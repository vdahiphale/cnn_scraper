I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Right now, the US is working to identify who carried out a drone attack on a small us outpost in Jordan near the border with Syria and Iraq that killed three US troops and injured more than 30 others. US officials say the drone landed near the living quarters at the base. The attack marks the first time US troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the war erupted in Gaza. It also marks a significant escalation of an already precarious situation in the region. President Biden reacting to the attack vowing the US will hold those responsible accountable. We've got full coverage of this developing story. Natasha Bertrand is in Washington, Kevin Liptak is at the White House and Ben Wedeman in Beirut, Lebanon. Natasha, you first. What are we learning about the attack?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, we're told that three US Army soldiers were killed in this drone attack targeting this military base, this very small outpost in northeast Jordan, right on the border with Syria. And it happened early this morning, local time there.And we're also told that as many as 30 US servicemembers who were also at that base were injured in this attack. And that number is expected to rise as more service members seek treatment for symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury. But three of those servicemembers were so critically injured that they actually had to be medically evacuated out of the country. And so the Secretary of Defense just issued a statement about this, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and he promised that the US is going to respond at a time and place of our choosing. He said that Iran backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on US forces, and he said, \"The President and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces and we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests.\" Now, just to put this into context, the US and coalition forces have been attacked dozens and dozens of times over the last several months in Iraq and Syria by these Iran-backed groups, but never before have these attacks resulted in the actual deaths of US servicemembers. They have resulted in some injuries, mostly light injuries, the most severe of which have been traumatic brain injury. So this is a really serious escalation at an already very precarious and tense moment in the region. And of course, now all eyes are on the Biden administration to see how they are going to respond to it.",

It says the drone was launched from the outskirts of the Al-Murassant Base in the west of Ar-Rutbah district, so that's sort of near the Syrian border in Iraq.

But this time around, he faces an uphill battle amid waning enthusiasm among Black voters and dipping poll numbers among this key constituency.And so his message across multiple stops, including at the church behind me this morning is that he needs this state and this diverse electorate for him to clinch another win in November. And to do that, he drew connections in a speech last night about what his administration has done for the communities of color, be it investing in HBCUs, driving down insulin costs, as well as student loan debt relief, and how that has improved and benefited the lives of Black voters. But notably, Fred, he also mentioned an issue that up until this point on the trail had not come up, and that's border security.

But he also, Fred, was interrupted by Palestinian protesters who were calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and that was just another reality for the president as he hits the trail and there are divisions in his coalition about support for Israel, but at the end of the day, the resounding message here in South Carolina was that the president needs this state.

It is terrible, meaning the quality of the audio, and that's why you're not hearing the president, but when and if we're able to kind of clean up that signal or be able to understand what the president is saying, of course, we'll bring it to our audiences.Meantime, Natasha Bertrand, what are the considerations that the US is entertaining on how it responds. The president said they want to respond responsibly. Now, a group has claimed responsibility, what are the options?",

      "sentences": "Well, the administration is walking a very, very fine line here between, of course needing to respond and avoiding and all-out war with Iran and perhaps another major regional power, something that they did not want to see happen when of course, they sent troops over to the region in response to the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th, but that many US officials believe could be inevitable, given the number of strikes and attacks that we've seen from these Iran-backed militias on US and coalition bases over the last several months, over 150 of them just since October.And so the question now is, is the US going to go after this very specific militant group that appears to have claimed responsibility for this attack? If the reports are accurate, that this group Kata'ib Hezbollah has, in fact, claimed responsibility, then that would put them back into the crosshairs of the United States, which just last week, struck this group and their militants in Iraq because of previous rocket and drone attacks that they had carried out against US bases in the region. And so the question is, are they only going to go after the Iran- backed proxy groups, or are they going to attack on Iran itself as many Republican lawmakers have begun calling for? That is the really tough question they'll have to answer -- Fred.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Hi, Fredricka. The Lions and 49ers represent this clash of football and culture. It's like Ford F-150 versus a Tesla, old school mash mouth football against flashy new school scheme, an old industry and economy versus modernity and new money.In the 50s, Detroit Motor City was one of America's richest cities with GM, Ford, Chrysler popping out cars like a PEZ dispenser. The football team dominated, too, winning three NFL championships in '52, '53, and 1957. And then it was crickets. The city's industries, economy, and football team marinated in mediocrity for decades, but before this season, Fredricka, the Lions only won one playoff game since the 50s in 1992, and as you mentioned, became the first team in the NFL to go winless in a season back in 2008. They are one of just four teams to have never reached a Super Bowl, but now, they are rolling, just one win away, led by former Lions player, tough as nails coach, Dan Campbell, who vowed his team will kick you in the teeth, bite your kneecaps, until they find a way to get up just like the city did. The team representing Motor City is full throttle. Here's one of their stars, David Montgomery on Motor City magic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They play within in the birthplace of Apple, Google, Facebook, steeped in innovation, money, and success on the field.They played in seven Super Bowls, Fredricka, won five. One more, they'll tie the record. So yes, this is, one team is pretty, one is gritty. But it's about to get ugly. The winner will be headed into the Super Bowl.",
