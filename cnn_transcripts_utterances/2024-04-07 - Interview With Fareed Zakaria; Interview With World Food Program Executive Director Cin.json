I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, D.C., where the state of our union is, frankly, heartsick.News this morning out of Israel, as the region marked six months since those brutal Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7 against Israel, killing 1,200 and taking more than 250 people hostages. The Israeli military now says it has withdrawn forces from the Southern Gaza Strip, though -- quote -- \"Significant force remains in other areas of Gaza,\" that as an Israeli official told CNN this morning, that an Israeli delegation is expected to join hostage release and cease-fire negotiations in Cairo, Egypt. All of that as Israelis' anger over the roughly 100 hostages still in captivity spilled onto the streets of Israel last night, demonstrators demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the war and his failure, in their view, to sufficiently focus on bringing those hostages home. Meanwhile, in Gaza, the brutal toll continues in the Israel Defense Forces' war against Hamas, which embeds within the populace. Israeli attacks have resulted in the deaths and injuries of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians. And aid organizations say all 2.2 million people in Gaza do not have enough to eat, with half the population on the brink of starvation. Here in the United States, the desperate conditions in Gaza and President Biden's support for Israel in the wake of the Hamas attacks have damaged his standing with his progressive coalition. And, this week, President Biden raised the pressure on the Israeli government to allow more aid to enter Gaza. Joining us now is the chairman of the House Committee on Intelligence, Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio. Congressman, thanks for joining us. Mr. Chairman, I want to start on the news this morning.

REP. MICHAEL TURNER (R-OH):  Well, I think you're certainly seeing some efforts to respond to the White House's vocal criticism of the operations of Israel in Gaza. As you indicated, Jake, this is the sixth-month demarcation of the horrific attack that occurred October 7 and then the subsequent declaration by Israel that they would enter Gaza for the purposes of eliminating Hamas. Today, the Palestinians in Gaza remain hostages to Hamas, and Hamas has not been eliminated. We have seen, I think, an overconfidence of Israel both -- on its intelligence, both when it failed to see October 7 and when it went into Gaza to eliminate Hamas. That has been, I think, part of the outcome that we have seen of the both haphazardous and dangerous military operations that resulted in unacceptable civilian deaths and certainly the food crisis that you described.",

And Hezbollah continues to be a threat to Israel in Lebanon. But I think what we're seeing here is, certainly, the consulate in Syria was a legitimate target from -- for Israel because Iran certainly is the source of which all this is coming. At the same time, it still is very unwise. As we were trying to put pressure on Iran to keep them out of this conflict, both with U.S. presence and with our response to the attacks on our own troops, this certainly does escalate the issue throughout the entire region.",

It should be a world top priority. Everyone looking for de-escalation in the region should be opening the sentence saying, release the hostages. You know, any sentence of any demand of cease-fire without release of hostages is a death sentence to them. As far as what's going on in Israel there's broad range.

They're still waiting for the economy to improve and hoping that that will lift Biden, as it has traditionally. But the problem is, we're in a revolutionary period. It's a break from history.

And the reason, as I try to show in the book, is that what you have had over the last 30 or 40 years is a decline in the core importance of economics, partly maybe because we have become a kind of mass middle-class society, and the rise of all these what social scientists call postmaterialistic issues.
