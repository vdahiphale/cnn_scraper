      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, families of Israeli hostages urged the International Criminal Court to take action against Hamas. This is world leaders and humanitarian organizations plead with Israel not to invade Rafah. Then the Ukrainian military says it sank a Russian warship in the Black Sea. What we know about the state of Russia's naval fleet. Plus, a mega election day in Indonesia, where officials are counting more than 200 million votes. We begin with news then coming into CNN. The Israeli Air Force has begun an extensive wave of attacks in Lebanon, the IGF said in a statement. Lebanese media report air raids on several towns in the southern part of the country. The new developments come as the Palestinian Authority president calls on Hamas to quickly cement a deal for the release of hostages in Gaza and for a pause in fighting. Mahmoud Abbas says this would protect Palestinians and avoid another catastrophe. U.S., Qatari, Egyptian and Israeli officials have been working on a deal. A U.S. official says negotiations will continue. This is a growing chorus of world leaders and aid organizations warned against any Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, where more than a 1 million Palestinians are seeking shelter in dire conditions. CNN's Nada Bashir tracking developments in Cairo for us. What are you hearing from Gaza today, Nada?",

Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the First Lady were greeted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. Mr. Erdogan will be discussing the situation in Gaza and other regional issues with the Egyptian president. Now, Ukraine says it sank a large Russian warship off the coast of occupied Crimea. Footage provided by Ukraine appears to show a drone as it approaches the ship, followed by an explosion. CNN can't confirm Ukraine's claims. Kyiv says it's now disabled a third of Russia's Black Sea fleets. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us live from Paris. So Russia haven't denied it either. Have they, Melissa?",

      "sentences": "They haven't denied it. They won't comment, the Kremlin says, because this is part of the special military operation as they call the war in Ukraine. And it will be for the Russia's Defense Ministry to comment. So far, no comment from there either.I think what's significant, Max, about that piece of news that we've had this morning, the sinking of this landing ship now marking, according to Ukrainian side, the disabling of more than 30 percent of Russia's Black Sea fleet. It's significant because you're talking about a part of the world where Ukrainian forces, Ukrainian Navy hasn't been able to function since 2014, largely. And where the Ukrainian military have been targeting a lot of their resources and efforts simply because the static land front lines have been so difficult to shift, first of all, but also because this, they believe, is an important strategic shift that may allow them to cut off Russia's ability to continue fueling its war effort through men equipment that comes through the Crimean Peninsula. So, there has been a shift of Ukraine's attention to the Black Sea. What's interesting as well about this successful mission to sink another of Russia's ships is what they use, which are Ukrainian-made drones, these Magura drones. That's important because we know that Ukraine had been trying to ramp up its own production ability in terms of the weaponry, the equipment that it uses because of the difficulties, it says, it's been having in getting enough of the Western supplies that it needs. These are long range drones that allow them -- that they have a range of some 800 kilometers. They're highly maneuverable and very difficult for Russia to detect and prevent in terms of the attacks. And so this successful one, another important win for Ukraine at a time, Max, when frankly, they haven't had terribly much to celebrate, not only in the fact that they've been able to use their own drones as effectively, but of course, overall, in their claim that it is now a third of Russia's fleet that's been destroyed. It's an important psychological win, if nothing else, and shows that they are able to make a dent at least in the Black Sea, while elsewhere, their effort, of course, continues. But has proven so difficult to shift in their favor on those landlines all the way up to the north of Ukraine, its border with Russia. So a significant development this morning, and again, an important win for Ukraine at a difficult time, Max.",

The Pentagon says Austin has resumed his full duties and will work from home as he recovers. The Defense Secretary is expected to host a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense contact group which is this morning. The U.S. Navy is making a very visible show of force in the Red Sea. They are protecting international shipping from missiles and drones launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Just two days ago, the Houthis fired two missiles at a Greek-owned commercial vessel that was carrying corn to Iran. Our Natasha Bertrand boarded a U.S. warship on the front lines of the fight and saw how quickly the crew has to act to intercept these incoming missiles.

      "sentences": "Yes, that was one of the feelings when South Africa brought the case against Israel at the ICJ, International Court of Justice. And why? Because that's where you go to arbitrate and substantiate allegations that are made by one state about another state. But Hamas is not a state and that was a criticism.You heard from a lot of Israeli officials here is why isn't Hamas being questioned? So by going to the ICC, International Criminal Court, which is where you take cases against individuals, the families and the victims of October 7th attacks can hope that the prosecution will listen to their testimonies and use that in their investigations against individuals within Hamas. And Karim Khan, the prosecutor at the ICC has said that he does have jurisdiction over the October 7th attacks. So this is what the families are trying to do. They clearly want to get a level of justice for the crimes that were perpetrated against them and against their family members. And I think they also want it noted more globally where there's a sense in Israel that the world has just moved on from the October 7th attacks that were brutal. They were horrendous. They were on a scale that is Israelis were just utterly shocked by and still are traumatized by. The sense here is that the world has moved on and looks only at what's happening in Gaza and it's forgetting October 7th. So very much this is to bring about criminal cases against these Hamas individuals, but it's also to put it front and center in the world's consciousness as well, Max.",

There, of course, is a sense that Rafah is the way the IDF terms at the last refuge of Hamas and the place that many of the hostages might be, the two hostages who were freed at the beginning of the week were it being held in Rafah.So I think the perspective here is that's the last place where Hamas is. And, you know, when you hear criticism from the Irish Taoiseach, the Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, saying that this could lead to massacre if there's military operations, if the IDF goes in with ground troops inside of Rafah. And we're hearing similar concerns expressed by the U.N. Secretary General, by the leaders of other U.N. bodies, that there is this huge concern. You know, the Israeli, rather the German and the Italian foreign ministers yesterday added their concerns. The Spanish Prime Minister has added his concerns to the Irish Prime Minister. So there is this growing welter of international opinion, not least President Biden saying you have to have a plan for the civilians if the IDF goes into Rafah. But at the moment here, that doesn't seem to be a big part of the discourse. It's really the IDF waiting for the politicians, Netanyahu, to say, go and do it. And that's I think whether conversation here is inside of Israel, Max.",
