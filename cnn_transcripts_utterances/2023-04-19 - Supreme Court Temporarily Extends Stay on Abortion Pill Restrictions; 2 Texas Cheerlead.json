The U.S. Supreme Court kicking the can down the road for now, pausing restrictions until Friday on access to the abortion pill, restrictions put in place by a Texas judge. But what might happen after this two day stay? And for the third time in a week, young people shot after making innocent mistakes. This time two cheerleaders after one of them mistook someone else's car for hers. I'm going to speak with her cheer programs owner. Plus, one day after one of the biggest media defamation settlements in the history of the universe, the CEO of Dominion will be here and we'll talk about whether his company took that historic $787.5 million check from Fox at the expense of truth and democracy. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start with breaking news in our health lead. This afternoon, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in the blockbuster medication abortion case, temporarily extending access to the drug mifepristone until Friday night. Justice Samuel Alito has set the new deadline, essentially buying the full court another two days to decide the future of the widely used abortion drugs. Mifepristone is the first in a two-pill regimen used to terminate pregnancies in medication abortions in the first 8 to 10 weeks or so. It has been approved by the FDA for more than two decades. Mifepristone also frequently prescribed after miscarriages and for women experiencing menopause. But earlier this month, a Texas judge in Amarillo sided with anti abortion activists and issued a sweeping ruling which in part would -- which in part would impose strict new restrictions on how mifepristone is prescribed and who can prescribe it, and where patients can get it, and at what point in their pregnancy, women and girls are allowed to take the pill. Let's get straight to CNN's Jessica Schneider. And, Jessica, this deadline has been moved to Friday. The justices are still considering the very same questions in this case. What options does the court have here?",

      "sentences": "You know, Jake, this really just gives the Supreme Court more time for a definitive decision, something that they've sort of been delaying over the past few days. At the same time, though, this really adds to the uncertainty that we've been hearing about, women, doctors and even the drugmakers here.So, in part, the Supreme Court didn't give the Justice Department a little bit of what they were asking for here. In filings last night, the solicitor general basically said, look, if you can't come up with a definitive decision, at least extend this stay for a few more days, and that is what Justice Alito did just minutes ago. And what this does is this gives the Supreme Court more time to decide whether to extend that pause on the lower court's ruling more definitively for weeks or potentially months, or to let those restrictions go into effect. So sometime before midnight Friday into Saturday, the world will potentially know whether or not those restrictions will be in effect. If they do go into effect, if the Supreme Court doesn't extend the hold, it will be quite a change for the way that this abortion pill is administered. It would require that women at seven weeks pregnant are allowed to take the draw the drug, but no longer than that. It would also require that they see doctors in person and get the pill in person as opposed to what exists now, with the telehealth visits and getting the drug in the mail. So, Jake, once again, the Supreme Court. Sort of making everyone stay on their toes as we wait for that Friday night deadline that was supposed to be today. So we'll see what the Supreme Court does, including whether they write on their eventual decision here -- Jake.",

Senator, what's your reaction to this temporary extension by the court? And how concerned are you that ultimately this court is going to allow this limited ban on access to mifepristone? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  Well, I really appreciate Joan's analysis right there, Jake, because in truth, we haven't learned anything new today about what they're going to do. They could be debating language and in order, it could be about a dissent. But one thing that hasn't changed, Jake, is that two judges on the Fifth Circuit and another in Amarillo, Texas, three Trump appointed judges, have basically threatened the availability of a safe drug, according to the American Medical Association that is used in half the abortion in this country and that's safe in 60 countries, and they basically have said this the last two judges. Hey guess what we know better than the FDA. It's going to -- you can maybe use it in seven weeks, but not 10 weeks. You can't get in the mail now and hey, you're not going to be able to get it in pharmacies. That hasn't happened yet because it stayed, but that's what they said. And as Joan has pointed out, this is an incredible step for the Supreme Court, and there's a lot of ways for them to get out of this with standing and other things to say. A judge can make this decision. What about if this Amarillo judge doesn't like birth control? What if the next thing is Lipitor? That's why you have seen the pharmaceutical companies the American medical association so strong here. And so we go on to fight another day until Friday at midnight, but make no mistake, our Republican colleagues, for the most part, have been silent on this and we are standing up the Democratic Party, President Biden, for women's rights to say women have a right to make their own healthcare decisions and not politicians. And we don't want Ted Cruz in the waiting room. TAPPER:  So that's a -- that's an image. So, if the court ultimately allows this judge's restrictions to take effect and we're not there yet, it might not happen. But if the court ultimately does do that, and I can easily see four justices who would probably vote that way, and maybe five. You're in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Can Congress do anything?",

He talked about you can't bring a case like this only if there is a chance of a plaintiff being harmed. He said that's not enough. You either have to show your harmed or there's a real chance you're harmed.The people that brought this case are saying oh, hey, there could be stress involved for us because we don't agree with this drug. How about the women of this country? They're going to have to, what, get on a bus in Texas and go to Minnesota or go to Illinois? You talk about stress. You talk about real harm. That's what the justices are grappling with right now, whether it is simply a language in the order, or how long to stay at last or what it is. This is an enormous issue for the precedent of the court, really for the trust that people have in the court and for the women of America who have got to be able to get up in the morning and believe that they've got the same rights and not less rights than their moms or their grandma's good or people that haven't 60 other countries have.",

She's a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University. She's also an attorney. So, Professor, it does look as though it is possible that the court might ultimately allow these intense restrictions to be imposed and it would make it very difficult and complicated for girls and women to have access to mifepristone.

We can't forget that the case out of Washington said the FDA had to preserve access in the 17 states that were plaintiffs in that litigation.So the Supreme Court has to resolve this conflict, the impact even if they say the Washington order can stand and the Texas order can stand, is that the federal drug -- the FDA cannot regulate federally, that we would have a patchwork system, saying that mifepristone is safe in some states, but not in another. Or they could uphold the Texas preliminary injunction and say mifepristone can't be used. The impact is enormous. I have approximately a half million women and girls used this drug every year in recent years. And they depend on it. The misoprostol only, the second drug regimen, does lead to more symptoms and side effects, takes longer and is a little bit less effective. So, if you're comparing risk profiles, that's why you want the two-drug gold standard. It's also the case that, according to the CDC, about 1,200 women in the United States a year die from underlying causes from pregnancy and childbirth. So if you're looking at a risk profile and expecting those people will continue those pregnancies, you have much more health damage. Essentially what this case is about is anti-abortion forces trying to control and it eliminates abortion nationwide, and that's the problem. It's thrown medicine into chaos. The other thing these pills do is allow people to avoid clinic visits by using telemedicine and then bail and so it increases access. The true risk of these pills that's being litigated is the risk of women's freedom to control their reproductive destiny.

We have a lot of employees that have experienced trauma and we have six more trials.

We've asked a lot of our election officials to testify, for no personal gain of their own, and frankly, they all said yes, everyone we had asked said yes.

I'm more concerned about the next instance on any channel. My hope is that media tells the truth. We have a very high standard for individuals to sue media companies for defamation. In my opinion, it's exactly the way it should be. It should be a hopes standard.
