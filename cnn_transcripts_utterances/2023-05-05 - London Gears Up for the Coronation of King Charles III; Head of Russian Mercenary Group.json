It has just gone 7 O'clock, and just meters away from where I am from where the king himself stepped out today to greet well-wishers a few hours ago. Have a look at this footage, we'll have much more, of course, on tomorrow's once in a generation event throughout this hour. Plus, the other headlines we are following for you, and that includes the head of the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, threatening to pull out of Bakhmut. Then, a stellar U.S. jobs report that makes the Federal Reserve's job even trickier when it comes to inflation. And then, a shocking spike in ocean temperatures even by climate crisis standards. Now, we'll have all those stories, of course, in just a moment. We'll begin here in London. In just a matter of hours, the world will witness something many people have never seen, in fact, in their lifetimes. And that is the crowning of a new British monarch, King Charles III. Final preparations are well underway ahead of Saturday's ceremony that will be taking place at Westminster Abbey. The king, along with the prince and princess of Wales, greeted people today on the Mall here in London, it is not very far from where I am. Earlier today, as you see there, thousands of people have been camping out along tomorrow's procession route, as security, including firearms officers and facial recognition technology is ramped up and rolled out. Salma Abdelaziz is on the Mall where many royal super fans have been gathering. And Salma, I think that, you know, that surprise, that visit by the king and the prince and princess of Wales, took many people by surprise.",

We'll have much more, of course, on this story ahead this hour, from the CEO of the Princess Trust Charity, to the composer whose music will be the soundtrack of tomorrow's big event. We have a host of unique perspectives on this historic event. For now, though, let me bring you up to date with the other headlines we have following this hour. Ukraine says it could be a turning point in the months-long battle for Bakhmut. A private Russian paramilitary group is vowing to withdraw from the frontlines within days, blaming Russia's military for a lack of ammunition, as well as support. Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin posted a grizzly video online, standing in front of rows of corpses that he said were his fighters killed in the eastern Ukrainian city. He unleashed a blistering personal tirade against Russia's military leaders, calling them fat cats who sit around in luxury offices while his men bleed to death in the field. Let's get more now from our Nic Robertson who joins me now from eastern Ukraine. And Nic, you and I have been talking about Bakhmut now for months. So how significant is this, and what does this mean for Bakhmut and for that counteroffensive?",

    {
      "timeStamp": "14:05:00",
      "speaker": "NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR",
      "sentences": "Well, even Ukrainian military officials say that Wagner under Yevgeny Prigozhin has made a hugedifference for the fight -- for the Russian fight for Bakhmut. He's sacrificed thousands upon thousands of lives, many of them of conscripts just out of jail, given weapons and put into the fight. But he has actually taken ground that the Russian military hasn't been able to take, and has crowed about this a lot. And he's used it to his advantage to try to score points off of his sort of military opposite numbers, if you will, at the Kremlin, the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, the defense chief of staff as well. But he's tried to sort of bake himself up, get one over on them. But it feels like it's getting -- these divisions are getting more vitriolic. And the threat to pull out his troops, potentially means that some of the gains that the Russians have made at huge cost, could be lost. As we know, Ukraine is poised for a counteroffensive. They will want to push wherever they can, all along the frontline. They'll have places where they'll hope to breakthrough and other places where they'll hope to take territory, and Bakhmut will very likely, as likely as anywhere else, be a place where they would hope to make gains. So, it would really work well for the Ukrainians if Prigozhin were to pull his troops out. But the analysis here is, quite simply, that Prigozhin really has no other choice, because if he keeps losing a 100 troops a day, which is what one military spokesman here said. If he loses a 100 troops a day, at the rate that he's been losing them in the past, and if he continues, he'll essentially break the back of Wagner, and that's destructive for him and he can't afford it. So, he'll have no option but to pull out of the fight. That also would be a victory for the Ukrainians as well, and perhaps, make it worthwhile that they absorb so many casualties in Bakhmut themselves, taking on it seems weakening Wagner. It depends a lot, I guess, on ultimately, how President Putin responds to all this, and a clue to that maybe, Sergei Shoigu, the Defense Minister visited Russia's southern command, not in Ukraine, but in Russia, and inspected what we're told were new military hardware. Obviously, it begs the question, why weren't the troops getting it sooner? Certainly, that would be a Prigozhin type of question. But you can see those divisions getting deeper, and it doesn't benefit Russia's fight.",

A few weeks ago when Sergei Shoigu was in the same position, he said some of the same things, oh, we need to look at the supply chains, oh, commander need to say when there are problems with the supply chains. But the problems with the supply chains go to the defense chief, so responsible for getting the raw materials into the armaments factories, stepping them up to three shifts a day, seven days a week, getting those armaments to the frontlines, including that whole process. It's breaking down. But I think that, you know, what Prigozhin is doing is, he's doing essentially Putin's bidding by giving Putin fall guys within the Kremlin. Sergei Shoigu, for example, the defense minister, is a fall guy if this war doesn't go well in Ukraine, or is Shoigu -- or is Prigozhin; that Wagner boss, trying to give himself an increased political position. So, one thing that he's done and he announced today, I think is significant in that, last week, the Kremlin fired one of the deputy defense ministers. Well, today --",

Our Scott McLean has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, this part of Serbia is breathing a huge sigh of relief after the suspect in this country's second mass shooting in just two days was arrested after a massive overnight manhunt that involved some 600 heavily-armed police officers. There was a huge police presence across a huge swath of this country. Checkpoints set up, we were actually searched, our vehicle was searched going into one of the villages were shots were actually fired.

Now, in response to Wednesday's deadly mass shooting inside of an elementary school in Belgrade, carried out by a 13-year-old boy, lawmakers propose legislation for a two-year moratorium on any new gun licenses after this latest mass shooting in rural Serbia, President Vucic says they're going to go even further, clamping down tougher on gun restrictions and a mandatory buyback scheme for those who can't meet the tougher new condition.

In 2020, the big shipping container ships, the ship lines around the world switched to fuel that puts less sulfur into the sky. That's good, of course, for our lungs, for surface pollution. But it turns out that that might have been an accidental sunscreen for decades, actually masking the amount of warming that's actually happening. And now that the skies are clear of that sulfur, we're feeling the warming effects. If it's a half a degree or a full degree, we really don't know. There's also volcanic activity, wildfire debris that puts material high into the stratosphere that could either be deflecting or accelerating the clouds depending on how close they are altitude-wise, or either helping warm or cool. It's a complex system. That's why there's no interesting culprit right now.
