I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Voting still under way in several key races as the balance of power -- reading through the votes is what is taking place still, as the balance in Congress hangs in the balance. Whew! All right, today, the fight for control of the U.S. Senate is down to just two important races. CNN now projects incumbent Democrat Senator Mark Kelly holding onto his seat in Arizona, beating Republican Blake Masters. Senator Kelly holding a victory speech earlier today in Phoenix. But his opponent, Republican Blake Masters, is still not conceding. With Kelly's win, Democrats and Republicans are now locked in a neck and necktie in the U.S. Senate, with only two races undecided. In Nevada, a race between Republican Adam Laxalt and Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto is still too early to call. More updates are expected as Clark County is due to hold a press conference this hour. And in Georgia, a runoff election between Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker still weeks away. CNN has teams on the ground in those key battleground states covering all the latest developments in these critical elections. Let's go first to CNN's Kyung Lah live in Phoenix. So Kyung, Senator Mark Kelly now claiming victory. What was his message to supporters?",

And he met with supporters earlier today, in just the last couple of hours, telling supporters that he appreciated their work, that this was a long-fought campaign, a very expensive campaign as well with the stakes very high, that being control of Congress. Arizona now remaining in the Democratic column. And here's a little bit of what he told his supporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): You are all the reason that we are successful.

If at the end Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I would congratulate him on a hard- fought victory.\"But I just want to bring you back inside the elections department for just one second. We are still going through the count here. I say \"we,\" but I am observing what these workers are doing. These are long hours that they are pulling, 14 to 18 hours to complete a diligent count. This is something that happens every single election. It takes days to get through all of them. So while we call races, they don't have anything to do with that. They simply do the count. And they do it very diligently and very carefully following state laws. I want to give you a live look at what's happening outside this building. There is a protest, what they are calling a vigil happening outside. And I'm not going to play what they are saying, but these are angry people who are shouting conspiratorial lies over bullhorns at the people who are doing this. so they are trying to continue the count, and outside there is not a huge crowd. Let's keep it in perspective. Not a very big crowd. But enough of a crowd that we really hope that the people who are doing the hard work of democracy are not hearing what is happening outside.

      "sentences": "You know, Fred, until a few hours ago, both campaigns were very optimistic about their chances here. Well, that changed a few hours ago. I can tell you that according to a Nevada political strategist telling my colleague Dan Merica, they say that the mood has changed inside the Adam Laxalt campaign, saying that the mood is, quote, \"awful,\" that they are, quote, \"shocked and depressed,\" and that various fractions of the Republican Party are now pointing their fingers, saying that their challenger, Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto, could actually take the lead.And if you read the latest tweet by Adam Laxalt, you can see traces of that as well. I want to read it to you, if we can pull it up. Adam Laxalt tweeted, quote, \"Here is where we are. We are up 862 votes. Multiple days in a row the mostly mail-in ballots counted continue to break in higher Dem margins than we calculated. This has narrowed our victory window. The race will come down to 20,000 to 30,000 election Clark drop-off ballots.\" To correct Mr. Laxalt there a little bit, according to Clark County officials, we don't know exactly how many drop-off ballots are included in those 20,000 to 30,000. Those also include mail-in ballots. Now to continue reading his tweet, quote, \"If they are GOP precincts or slightly Dem leaning, then we can still win. If they continue to trend heavy Dem, then she will overtake us. Thanks for all the prayers for millions of Nevadans and Americans who hope we can still take back the Senate and start taking our country back.\" Here is what we have monitored ever since Election Day. On Wednesday, the day after the election, Adam Laxalt was ahead of Catherine Cortez Masto by about 22,000 votes. We have since seen that advantage shrink from 22,000, to 15,000, to 8,900. Now, like he mentioned in his tweet, it's down to 862 votes. It is a 0.1 percent charge in. Right now there are outstanding, CNN estimates more than 50,000 ballots out there that have not been counted yet. The majority of those are right here in Clark County where I am. I want to give you a breakdown, because this will give you a sense. So there are about 23,000 mail-in ballots and also potentially drop-off Election Day ballots as well. Now, there's an additional 9,659 ballots that have to be cured. Those signatures might not match. The voter must do something to cure the ballot. And there's another 5,555 provisional ballots. Now, the deadline for those to be counted is until Wednesday. There's another 12,000 ballots out there in Washoe County. We are not expected to have an update on Washoe County today, so it's going to be interesting to see how those go. And Washoe County is a swing county. Then there's 1,000 more ballots in Douglas County. That's a Republican stronghold. And, again, Fred, the new information here that we're getting is that there's about 50,000 ballots out there. Today is deadline day for all of the mail-in ballots, all the mail-in ballots that were postmarked on Election Day have to arrive here to the building that you see behind me for them to be counted.

If you look at runoff elections, you will largely see them in formerly slave-owning states like Georgia. After the Civil War, the south lost, black men were able to vote. And so those former slave owners are now standing toe to toe with the people they used to own, the black men who they used to own. And their thought was, how can I limit their voting power?This is coming from the Georgia NAACP and from civil rights leaders who will tell you that this all comes from limiting the power of the black vote. That's why you have to have 50 percent plus one vote in order to win an election, a statewide election here in Georgia. It's also part of the reason why, if you look back at 2021, Raphael Warnock was the first black person to win his seat, to win a Senate seat in the state of Georgia despite the fact that there has been up to 40 percent black population into this state. People will point to the racism that has been built into the system, but it's the system that we have today. WHITFIELD: Nadia Romero, thanks so much for all that. Appreciate it.

That said, the countryside is almost entirely deserted. Very, very few vehicles on the road, and the roads badly damaged.So I think for this city to get the restoration of power, to get their Internet connection again, and everyone has been coming along here to use our Internet connection that we're talking to you on right now. To get these things established, there's clearly a lot of damage that has happened, and it's clear that it's going to take a long time. But this is just a moment of euphoria here, just a moment of celebration where people can come in the square and show their flags.

      "sentences": "Fredricka, I think when you take a step back and you look at President Biden's first two years in office, so much of what was done, whether it was on the domestic front or whether it was on the foreign policy front, was tied into the through line of trying to compete with China, trying to ramp up that competition at home with industrial policy, manufacturing policy, and abroad with how the U.S. has attempted through both economic and military means to meet China, which has been particularly muscular and confrontational to some degree when it comes to Taiwan over the course of that period of time.That moment now transitions into a very real test for the president on a face-to-face basis, that first bilateral sit-down between President Biden and Xi Jinping. Obviously the two have spoken several times by phone over the course of the last two years. When Biden was Vice President, the two spent a lot of time together personally. But I think there is a recognition when you talk to White House advisers about how critical this meeting is at this moment in time where there is a very real possibility that competition could tip into confrontation. It's something White House officials say they don't want, but they recognize as China continues to grow, as China continues to accelerate its development on both the economic and military fronts, has become a very real possibility. And at the center of this meeting when they reach Bali will be the idea of trying to understand the -- as White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan put it, sharpening the understanding of where each side stands. There are red lines, there are specific issues that they want dealt with, not because they think there's going to be resolution to any of those issues in this one bilateral meeting but because it could lay the groundwork for meetings to come between the two leaders, but also between their teams. That's really the central focus of this meeting, no clear end game here from this meeting. But the hope, when you talk to White House officials that the possibility of conflict recedes into just a very intense competition, Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, they are defining expectations down. That is understandable. I think the phrase that came out of the White House the other day was trying to establish a floor for U.S./China relations in this new, much more adversarial environment. So obviously they are not looking for any big deliverables in the way that you might have expected at this kind of a superpower meeting in the past to go.It's remarkable that this is the first face-to-face meeting they have had. Of course, that is a problem of the pandemic, and China's very extreme inward looking zero COVID policy. Xi Jinping has basically had almost no travel outside of China in the entire time that Biden has been president. So it's an extremely important meeting. But I think that the course of these two countries as being adversaries is already set. Xi in winning, securing a third term and essentially, potentially being China's leader for life, has made it very clear that reabsorbing Taiwan into mainland China is a key part of his goals for the his tenure. The question that many American analysts have had is really what is the timetable, how long to prepare? And recently, there have been very alarming comments, suggesting that the timetable may be much shorter than had been previously expected. So that's one thing I think that will be foremost for President Biden who, as you know, has repeatedly, four different times, suggested the U.S. would come to Taiwan's defense militarily. So there's going to be that overt question of how quickly could this come to active hostility. I think that's number one. Number two, Biden has had a very strong week. His hand is much better because of the elections here in the United States, and also because of events on the ground in Ukraine where his policy of support for Ukraine against Russia is looking very, very encouraging right now.",

And that is a flashpoint that is really hard to see any constructive way past for Xi and Biden.One question is whether Ukraine's strong resistance to the Russian invasion might make China think twice about the plans that it had or Xi's desire to reabsorb Taiwan. And I do think that this is where you see events influencing each other in the world. And I'm sure that that's one of the messages that President Biden will be carrying to Xi is, like, hey, look, this isn't working out so well for your buddy Vladimir Putin.
