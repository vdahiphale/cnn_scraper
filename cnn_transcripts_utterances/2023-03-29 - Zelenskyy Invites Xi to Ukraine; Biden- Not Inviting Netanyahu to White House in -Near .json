This hour we explore the crucial relationship between these two countries. First up, though Joe Biden is hosting a virtual summit for democracy today with 120 countries. Washington says it is an effort to bolster democracies around the world in the face of the growing influence of authoritarianism. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has extended a formal invitation to his Chinese counterpart to visit his war torn country. The gesture coming just a week after Xi Jinping visited Vladimir Putin and the Russian Capital. Saudi Arabia will join the Shanghai Cooperation Council as a dialogue partner; a move coming amid growing ties between the Kingdom and China. Well, King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla are in Germany for their first overseas trip as Monocracy. King hopes to renew and strengthen relations with his European neighbors after Britain's exit from the EU. Well, this is the second hour of \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome. Not in the near term that is what President Joe Biden said when asked if he would invite Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington. The U.S. President again expressing concern about Israel's judicial overhaul proposal saying he hoped the Prime Minister would act in a way that would bring about a genuine compromise. But that remains to be seen. So tonight we ask is Washington losing patience with Netanyahu. My next guest, Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel accuses Benjamin Netanyahu's government of reneging on written commitments that Israel has made to the U.S. by for example, allowing what he calls creeping annexation in the West Bank. Daniel Kurtzer says there's no excuse for anybody to break promises whether Israel or the United States. If there's a verbal commitment that's broken you say, well, that's not nice and you move on. It's quite different when commitments like this are criticized and memorialized in legislation. Well, Daniel Kurtzer joins me now via Skype from Washington. It is good to have you with us. I'll put our very question to you right out of the gate here, sir. Is Washington losing patience with Netanyahu? DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISREAL AND EGYPT: Well, I think the President made that clear yesterday with his statement that came after Prime Minister Netanyahu had announced a pause in the legislation on the judicial overhaul. It's quite serious between the two countries now, and I think it mostly has to do with a decline in trust. The President has signaled early on our concern about the inclusion in Netanyahu's cabinet of some very challenging personalities, felons' racists, misogynist, and so forth. Netanyahu had assured him that he Netanyahu could control the cabinet. But this judicial overhaul business has proved otherwise. So Netanyahu is going to have to do some work to build - rebuild trust with the President.",

Ben-Gvir said it seems to me that both President Biden and all the administration officials in the U.S. should understand that Israel is an independent country. It is not another star in the U.S. flag. We are a democratic regime. And I expect the U.S. President to understand this fact.

And at that time, Secretary Blinken came here, and the language that he was using then, when Secretary Blinken spoke about, you know, we have frank discussions between ourselves the language that Prime Minister Netanyahu was using back then sounds very similar to the language that he's using now. Trying to sort of brush off this clearly deteriorating relationship with Israel's biggest and most important ally, the one that guarantees its security in a region that can potentially be very hostile to Israel. And he was again back then saying, I have this long relationship with President Biden that has gone on for 40 years, our relationship and go up and down. But we are two very powerful democracies, and we're very strong together. That narrative I think is going to wear thin that pressure from the White House hasn't just started today. It's been going on a while. And it is that core issue, that there's some unpalatable characters for the United States, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet and that is as long as this cabinet exists that tension seems to be going on precisely as the Former Ambassador was saying, because Netanyahu is not despite him saying he's the driver, his hands on the steering wheel.

What do you make of that? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): No surprise, really. There's been intense speculation now for weeks. Now that the Russian offensive has petered out, that it's the turn of the Ukrainians and all indications on the ground, as well as from other statements from officials on the Ukrainian side is that indeed an offensive is coming. The timing is very unclear. Now at the moment, most of the fighting is focused around the town of a Bakhmut where for seven months the Russians have tried, but so far failed to take that city.

But you're doing it for national security reasons, because it's a vital, regional player, for example, this is always brought up in the case of Saudi Arabia. So, I take your point, and I think you're right, that getting all these leaders, even coming up with a list that could actually come to the United States who is democratic enough, is very difficult. Because when you decide that some countries are democratic enough, but then you reject other allies you need for things, you're causing all sorts of diplomatic problems for yourself. Having said that, I think that Joe Biden actually believes this he believes that democracy is under threat, that it's the greatest threat to the Western world. If you look at two of his central foreign policy priorities, the war in Ukraine and standing up to China, and, you know, allowing Taiwan the means to defend itself.

We must reduce emissions 43 percent by 2030\". And he goes on to say, \"We need to ensure that no one is left behind\". Last year developing economies received only 20 percent of clean tech investment. These are economies that represent 70 percent of the world's population. Well, the South Pacific island of Vanuatu has no intention of being left behind. It just got a big win at the U.N. where the General Assembly voted to adopt, a resolution led by the cyclone plagued Ireland. It asks the International Court of Justice to play a role in climate justice and clarify exactly what big polluters are responsible for. CNN's Anna Coren shows us why the stakes are so high for Vanuatu. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): High above the vast Pacific Ocean, Vanuatu's leader looks down on his fragile paradise. The nation is one of the most vulnerable on Earth its people at constant risk from cyclones, earthquakes and live volcanoes.",

But it's not the only global issue that clutches at this tiny nation. The people of these islands are getting wrapped up in the great power tussle between the U.S. and China. Both want greater influence across the blue Pacific continent. U.S. allies Australia and New Zealand have always viewed the Pacific as their neighborhood. So, when the Cyclones hit Vanuatu, they were first in to help. CAPT. JACE HUTCHISON, HMAS CANBERRA: Australia is a direct neighbor of Vanuatu in our region. And just like all the other neighboring Pacific family countries, we respond to natural disasters when our neighbors are in need. COREN (voice over): All know the value of winning hearts and minds in the Pacific. Beijing sent in cyclone aid too, but as China and the U.S. talk about new embassies, new military bases and new economic deals in the region.

After 30 years of deadlock, the result of last year's copwas finally getting rich nations to agree in principle to consider paying developing countries for loss and damage caused by global warming. This is only about infrastructure at this point. Already, we've got some big carbon emitters who are just not prepared to pony up or even really engage in the conversations about loss and damage. Do you believe there will ever be any accountability?",

We've set in motion changes that will continue regardless of if we stopped emitting right this minute, there will continue to be impacts around felt around the world for decades, at least to come. So, this is a long-term process. And it's been plagued by mistrust. And it's been plagued by parties not being on the same page in terms of even the basic facts of what's happening. And so I think a key part of what may come out of an ICJ opinion is a strong validation of the science and bringing countries together to have a framework and a common language from which to start moving towards climate justice.",
