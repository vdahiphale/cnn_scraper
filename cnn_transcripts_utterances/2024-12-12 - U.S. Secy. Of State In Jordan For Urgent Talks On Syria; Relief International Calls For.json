He -- Antony Blinken now on his way to Ankara. He talked there about pushing for an inclusive transition to a new government in Syria. That is the message from America's top diplomat today on what may be his final trip to the Middle East as Secretary of State. Antony Blinken making that stop in Jordan, as I say, before heading to Turkey. The State Department says that in talks with Jordan's king, Blinken also emphasized the importance of Syria's new leadership, respecting human rights and protecting civilians, including members of minority groups. And Blinken himself said that he is on the ground in the region working with partners around the region to build up and build out a unified approach for Syria. As the people of Syria, he said, transition away from a government for the first time in decades, not dominated by either the Assad dictatorship or any other single entity. Syria, he said, must not be a base for extremism going forward. More from Antony Blinken as he arrives in Ankara later. Well, inside Syria, the country's new leadership is going about the business of sweeping away the remnants of that Assad regime. Rebel leader Mohammed al-Jolani telling Reuters that he will dissolve Assad's security forces. He also said his team is working with international organizations to secure possible chemical weapons sites. Meanwhile, long lines forming at border crossings as Syrians stream back into the country after years in exile. Others are leaving the country, fearing instability and more conflict. And thousands are still displaced. Human Rights Watch is warning that displaced civilians in northeastern Syria are facing, quote, \"dire conditions\". Reception centers are overflowing and there is a critical need for food and shelter. Well, for more on the humanitarian situation in Syria, I want to bring in our next guest, Valeria Gholizadeh.

Some three million Syrians, as we understand it, displaced into Turkey, of course, and another million or so displaced into Jordan at this point. And Antony Blinken talking about the importance of a coordinated and unified approach from the international community to build up and build out support for Syrians. And there will be short, medium and long term approaches baked into this narrative, of course, for Syria. Your efforts are very much in the immediate term and then what happens longer term.

That's going to remain extremely essential. Protection services for women, children, vulnerable populations, but also food support. We know that, again, livelihoods and food production is still problematic inside Syria. And therefore, this type of assistance will be much needed. We are now also approaching the winter season with people who are displaced or living in situations that are not meeting minimal standards. And therefore, they will require blankets and other types of support, probably also a new type of shelters and living situation, especially if they're on the move. So all these types of basic services are still going to be needed for quite some time. And then the rest, let's say, of both the humanitarian work and development, will need to be defined. The situation definitely has changed. So we need to check again what are the needs on the ground, what the communities want to have implemented and what type of services they will need.

Now, I know that you're not a politician, but I'm going to put this to you because I think it is important. As the U.S. looks to increase its support and help coordinate efforts for Syria going forward, so there are appeals for the lifting of some of those sanctions to ensure that Syria can access the help that it needs.

We are in deep consultations with the Israeli government about where this goes from here, what that will look like in the days and weeks ahead. I'm going to leave it at that for now.

OWEN ALTERMAN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, I24NEWS: Hi, thank you so much. Owen Alterman from i24 News. Two questions that are related. First of all, we've seen reports in the last few days of American- backed Kurdish troops that have been shooting at and been shot by Turkish- backed troops in northeastern Syria. What are the red lines of Turkish involvement in that part of the country from the perspective of the administration? And the second question, there's concern in Israel that Turkish activity in Syria could ultimately, in the medium term even, be hostile to us and be hostile activities up to and including on our border.

All of those are possibilities, all of those are risks that President Biden has spoken to publicly, and that we are dealing with partners on privately, including dealing with the Turks, who do some -- have some measure of influence here, and where we have set out our views and expectations.

Those people deserve the basic sustenance of life. They deserve food, water, medicine, sanitation. And, by the way, that's not just an American position. That's a requirement under international humanitarian law. And it is also the position of this Israeli government, who is not standing up saying we should give no humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. They're saying something different. Now, we have viewed various critical points over the course of the past 15 months as moments where not enough was getting in to ensure that people had what they needed to survive, and we made no bones about pressing on that. Because we think at the end of the day, feeding starving children does not harm the security of the state of Israel, but it does vindicate our common shared values of humanity. And so, as I said in my remarks, the American commandment, the Jewish commandment that every innocent life has value, that is a present factor. And it's something we have to take seriously, even as we take seriously that Israel has every right, indeed a duty, to go after its enemies with everything it's got. You have done that, and we have backed you in going after your enemies, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran itself.
