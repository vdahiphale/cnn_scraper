But in Ukraine, the Russian invasion is still very real.(VIDEO PLAYING) Right now rescue teams are working tirelessly to find victims caught in a deadly missile strike in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. At least eight people were killed and dozens injured in the blast that hit a crowded downtown area. In his nightly address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the attack on civilians comes one year after a similar strike in Kremenchuk, which killed 22 people. Many are accusing Russia of deliberately targeting the city and Ukraine's president says they need to be held accountable.

He's praising security forces for preventing a civil war and promising to investigate the Wagner Group's financing.CNN's senior international correspondent Matthew Chance reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is Kremlin damage control in full swing, using the trappings of the Russian presidency to patch up Putin's battered image and to portray a deal, ending the armed Wagner rebellion here as a feat not of weakness, but of national unity. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): You have defended the constitutional order, the life, security and freedom of our citizens, saved our motherland from upheavals and actually stopped the civil war. CHANCE (voice-over): The Kremlin insists Putin's biggest challenge in 23 years of power is actually bringing Russia closer together. The problem is, that's not entirely true. Images of Russians cheering Wagner forces would have sent chills through the Kremlin. Not all Russians welcomed the mutiny, but few turned out to resist it either, despite what the Kremlin says. And what of the man who exposed this serious crack in Kremlin authority? Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, has now arrived in neighboring Belarus, according to its officials, after charges of insurrection against him and his fighters in Russia were dropped. It's possible Wagner fighters could now work alongside the Belarusian military, suggests Alexander Lukashenko, the country's leader, although he said no camps for them had yet been built. The Russian Defense Ministry says the mercenary group must first surrender its heavy weapons. The Kremlin, which now admits fully funding Wagner, says it will investigate how more than a billion dollars recently paid for salaries and bonuses was really spent. Back at the Kremlin, a minute's silence for the Russian pilots killed in Prigozhin's uprising. Putin may find it hard to forgive a man who shattered his image of control and who, he says, stabbed Russia in the back. Matthew Chance, CNN Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They return to their camps in Luhansk, according to Lukashenko, but we don't know how many of them will sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense.Prigozhin himself suggested that would be relatively few, and then how many will choose to go to Belarus and form some kind of new Wagner 2.0, perhaps.

But there are a series of issues with the Kremlin as well, which is essentially what to do with all of this machinery that Prigozhin has built, both the military machinery and the propaganda disinformation machinery that has been very, very useful to the Kremlin over the years and which they might not entirely want to lose access to.

That will likely be seen as a major help for the relations between Ukraine and Israel, which have often been tense ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, because Israel has always sort of tiptoed this diplomatic line between Ukraine and Russia. They've supported Ukraine in the U.N. They've sent humanitarian assistance. They've condemned the invasion. But they haven't gone so far as to sanction Russia or completely cut off Russia. They often cite security concerns because of Russia's presence in Syria on Israel's northern border.But the tensions between Ukraine and Israel have really ratcheted up in the past week or so. And that's because the Ukrainian Embassy here in Israel issued a blistering and lengthy statement about Israel and its stance in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying that in reality, and this is a quote from their statement, on the ground the so-called quote \"neutrality\" of the Israeli government is considered as a clear pro-Russian position. Now the embassy cited recent diplomatic negotiations between Israel and Russia about Russia's diplomatic presence here in Jerusalem, and they also cited an interview that Benjamin Netanyahu conducted with the \"Jerusalem Post\" in the last few weeks where he specifically talked about concerns that any weapons systems that Israel would give to Ukraine would be used against Israel because it could fall into Iranian hands and be used against us. Netanyahu asserted that such a scenario had actually happened. He said that Western anti-tank weapons were now found at Israel's borders. And when I spoke to the Ukrainian ambassador, he took particular issue with those statements, saying that he expects a full explanation from Israel about those statements. Now, as a result of that statement from the Ukrainian embassy, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the Ukrainian ambassador for a meeting but it's next week and I asked the ambassador about this he sort of chuckled and saying listen it's clear that they're not in any sort of hurry because they're having me come in next week and that he thinks by then that the tensions should calm down a little bit and he did say that a potential visit by Netanyahu to Kyiv will be a very good sign saying that there's always room for repairing the damages. Now the Prime Minister's office told me that no decision has been made on such a trip but Israeli media is also reporting that Israel's foreign minister has also said that there are early stages, discussions for such a trip. And what's interesting is what the Ukrainian ambassador told me. He said, you know, Netanyahu has been waiting for an invitation to the White House now for quite some time, and he believes that the fastest way to the White House is through Kyiv. Rosemary.",

But the threat is not over yet. The local meteorological department says 21 counties could see heavy rain and landslides today.In Egypt, at least five people have died, including a child and four others injured after a 14-story building collapsed in Alexandria on Monday. State media say prosecutors have issued an order to detain two people in connection with the deadly building collapse. There are dozens of old inhabited buildings in Alexandria at risk of collapse, state media says, quoting a lawmaker there. In Sudan, yet another ceasefire between the two warring sides seems to have been shattered. Activists and human rights groups reported truce violations Tuesday after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces announced a one-day unilateral ceasefire. A pro-democracy activist group says despite declaring the truce, the RSF fighters terrorized some local businesses, even beating staff and civilians. Another rights group reported renewed fighting in the state of southern Darfur. Well hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have been forced to flee their homes due to the violence. The U.N. refugee agency says that number is likely to surpass 1 million. The rainy season is making it harder for officials to reach refugees and move them away from the border into safer camps.

And also some of them were injured and needed immediate treatment. Also, as far as the psychological trauma is concerned, we are meeting children that are still separated from their families.

These are places where children can receive psychological support through recreational activities and other to just exteriorize the trauma they went through, but also it's a means for us to identify the separated and unaccompanied children.So far, we were able to identify a little less than 250 children that were either separated or unaccompanied. And for unaccompanied children in the most recent entry point for the refugees, which is a place of a town called Adre in Chad, we have put in place a space together with the support of the red, the Italian Red Cross, and accompanied children are located. And we are disseminating messages to the refugee community and to the parents that are looking after their lost children to come to this place and see if their children are not in this place. And so far we were able to reunite six children with their biological parents. And we are hoping that in the coming days we will be able to reunify or reunite more kids with their own families. So that's for the protection part. But of course these children are in need of more support in terms of health, in terms of fight against severe acute malnutrition, and in terms of access to safe drinking water, not only for the kids but also for the adults that have crossed the border.",
