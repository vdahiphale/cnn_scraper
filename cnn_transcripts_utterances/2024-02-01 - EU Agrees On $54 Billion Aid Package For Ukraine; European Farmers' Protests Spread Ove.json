Gridlock on the streets of Europe as farmers are protesting over regulations and rising costs. And an apology from the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He says he should have told President Biden about his cancer diagnosis. That   story and a great deal more as we continue. A very good evening to you. The European Union has agreed to send $54 billion in new aid to Ukraine. The leaders in the bloc overcame weeks of resistance from Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to get the deal done. Now, they're encouraging the United States to follow their example. The EU, President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, says America should now in her words, do its fair share.

Fred Pleitgen is with me in Kyiv. We have much to get to. Let's pass it down into its individual bit.

On the one hand, you have obviously the military operational level, and on the other hand, you have the political level where it's very important to as well in the military level, it's important because really every cent helps the Ukrainians right now. One of the main shortages that Ukrainians face, and I've seen this in various parts of the frontlines, especially in the east of the country is a shortage of 155 millimeter artillery ammunition. And you'll recall that it was the European Union that actually promised the Ukrainians last year, that they would provide them with 1 million artillery shells. I think the deadline for that was supposed to be March of this year, but they already say they're going to fall well, short of that, they're only going to be able to provide about half a million of those shells, which is a lot less than the Russians are currently manufacturing and the Russians are getting from the North Koreans as well. So, more artillery ammo is definitely something from that EU money that the Ukrainians will be looking forward to, and certainly something where it's not and certainly will make and can make a big difference on the battlefield. And then, of course, in the political sphere, this is extremely important for the European Union to show unity, but especially also for the Ukrainians because of the issues around U.S. military aid in U.S. Congress. Of course, that very much uncertain. So a big win today for the Ukrainians to show that, at least, that European bloc, the European Union is united behind helping Ukraine. Richard.",

And of course, there's oversight to as well.

However, as CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports, the government now says it can no longer afford the subsidy on fuel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Even before the sun comes up, people line up for hours in Havana to pump gas. The Cuban government owns every gas station on this island, and says it will raise prices at the pump more than an eye watering 500 percent. News of the massive hike triggered a run-on fuel, before the increase takes place, which is expected to further batter an already failing economy. You don't need to have three neurons. One is enough to know if this will be a disaster, he tells me. To fill up a car with 40 liters will cost 6,000 pesos. Most people don't earn that much in a month. For decades, Cuba received oil donations from political allies in Venezuela and Russia, which it then sold to its citizens at rock bottom prices. But as a communist run island weathers the worst economic crisis in decades, Cuban officials say subsidies on gas or a luxury the government can no longer afford. We are a country without fuel, he says, and we sell fuel at perhaps the cheapest prices in the region. Some of the cheapest in the world. But when we raise the price of fuel, it's going to increase the cost of some services and the price of things. Already as fuel supplies dwindle, people wait for hours to hitchhike. And more and more commuters return to riding bicycles. Others push to get onto the ever scarcer public transportation. Without a control inflation and the gas price hike, Cubans who only earned the equivalent of a few dollars a day may find themselves unable to afford a ride.",

A potentially precarious situation, says this man who resells fruit and vegetables from his small cart. Look how we are right now, he says. People are being impacted. If it increases one percent more, people will go crazy in the streets. Cuba's socialist government has long said it protects the most vulnerable here. But a stagnant, centralized economy, stalled reforms, and increased U.S. sanctions are forcing more and more into extreme poverty. The government has warned additional price hikes and cuts in services are in store. Many hope to be gone by the time that happens.
