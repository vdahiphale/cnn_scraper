And he does have an opportunity, the absence of President Xi from these talks. For President Biden, it is something of a missed opportunity.You will remember at last year's G20 in Bali, the two men sat for hours for a summit, no chance of that happening here. But White House officials do view this as an opening for President Biden to talk about the relative strength of the American economy compared to the Chinese economy. And he is coming armed with these proposals to increase development in the developing world through the World Bank. He is talking about infrastructure investments by the United States in the developing world in those countries. So, certainly, President Biden believes he has a good story to tell there. Of course, Ukraine is the other topic that will dominate these talks this weekend. President Biden has had quite a bit of success in rallying the West behind Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, but he hasn't been as convincing to some countries in the so-called global South. Countries like India, South Africa, Brazil, the work is underway now to develop some type of joint leader statement that would come out of this summit. Those talks, we're told, have been very difficult, so it does remain to be seen whether they will come to any agreement on joint language. Now, really, at the center of this week's G20 is the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and it is remarkable. You cannot go 10 feet in New Delhi this weekend without seeing a photo of him on posters, on billboards. President Biden's first order of business when he arrives here is sitting down for talks with him.

Officials say the city was struck Friday morning, leaving at least one person wounded. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force also says the Odessa region was targeted by a drone attack. Officials say air defenses managed to destroy most of them. Now, on the front lines, Ukraine says it continues to make incremental gains in its counteroffensive in the south. A local Ukrainian brigade posted this video on social media, saying it shows fighting for the village of Robotyne. It was recently captured by Ukraine. Now, Ukrainian military sources say their troops overran several Russian positions south of there. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heard horror stories about the abuse of Ukrainian civilians at the hands of Russian forces. He visited a town north of Kyiv on Thursday where survivors told him about their imprisonment while the area was occupied in the early days of the war. For more, Katie Polglase joins us from London.

A source familiar with the matter says Giuliani hopes a fundraiser at Trump's Bedminster Golf Club last night will help eat into that debt.We're told the $100,000 played event was expected to raise more than a million dollars. But Giuliani's son told a local radio show that won't be enough to cover his father's legal bills. The former mayor of New York City is facing several lawsuits, as well as criminal charges, stemming from his efforts to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Now, the current race for the White House isn't a normal election. One of the chief candidates faces criminal racketeering charges, accused of trying to overthrow democracy. His supporters, in his name, attack the U.S. Capitol, but backed by a devoted and sometimes militant following. Ex-President Donald Trump is still the Republican front runner. And the current president may be in trouble. New polling shows Democrat Joe Biden's approval rating dropping to 39 percent. His handling of the economy is a factor, and the 80-year-old's age remains a major concern. Now, it's worth mentioning, Trump is 77, but the polling gives him a very slight edge over Biden in next year's vote. In fact, nearly all top Republicans have a fighting chance on paper. Still, many have struggled with how to challenge Trump while embracing his platform. Here's Trump's former vice president and current rival speaking to CNN's Phil Mattingly.

So, he isn't as outspoken as he was. He's very much following the policy of, you know, remaining quiet, not speaking out politically. He's been attending to massive state. He did a state visit to Germany a few months ago, which went very well. He was praised particularly for speaking German very fluently.

He's in his seventies when he becomes king.So, I think people thought there would be a change in tone. So, I think in general, people are surprised. I would say he's taken the right approach.

Right now, players are only making about $17,000.Now, of course, this comes as a volatile time. The president of the Spanish Football Federation was suspended after kissing player Jenny Hermoso on the mouth at the World Cup, which her team won, and she filed an official complaint with prosecutors this week.
