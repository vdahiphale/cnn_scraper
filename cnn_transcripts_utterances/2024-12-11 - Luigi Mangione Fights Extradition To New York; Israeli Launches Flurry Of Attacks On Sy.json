And imagine, she says, there were women and children living in these homes. KARADSHEH (voice-over): So many men like her husband, Mazen (ph) detained and disappeared. Two years later, a released prisoner told her he saw him in jail. They beat him so much. His wounded leg was infected. He was in so much pain, she says. There was no medical care in prison and because of all he was going through, he lost his mind. [02:15:05] The prisoner last saw him taken away, crying and screaming hysterically. She went from one detention center to the next, searching for him, until they broke the news to her in the most cruel of ways. They handed her his belongings and told her to register his death. There are no words to describe how I was feeling when I left, she says. I was holding on to the hope he would be released and her family would be reunited. They didn't even give me his body. This is the last photo she has of Mazen and his youngest boy, Raif (ph) doesn't remember his dad. Noor (ph) was six and so attached to his father. Every day he would wait by the door for him to come back. When I would hear someone calling Baba, dad, it was torment for me, Umfira says. What did these children do to be deprived of their father? She has to be strong for her boys, she says. She is all they have. Her father also disappeared into the black holes of Assad's jails. Like her husband, their only crime, she says, was being from Diriyah. KARADSHEH (on camera): She says, I'm just one of thousands and thousands of stories and that's just in Diriyah. And just imagine how many more there are across Syria. KARADSHEH (voice-over): But the end of this dark chapter in their history, a new life in New Syria emerges from the rubble of their broken lives. Jomana Karadsheh, Diriyah, Syria. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Kremlin-controlled TV strategizes over what might come next with maps showing Russia's bases in Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off guard again. Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014, he says. I want to highlight one universal lesson for world powers, don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself, this is a verdict. For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's Air Force pounding rebel groups, its Navy firing cruise missiles at ISIS militants in eastern Syria. In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main air base near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project power throughout the Middle East.",

It is an extraordinary moment, not only for the history that is being made as the Israeli prime minister walked into this courthouse and then began testifying in his own defense, but also because of the moment at which it comes with Israel facing a multi-front war. That was part of the reason why the Israeli prime minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case, unsuccessfully though as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks.We expect that the prime minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy, accusations against the media, as he really tries to make his own case. But then, the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the prime minister has been facing for four years now. They are Case 1000, Case 2000 and Case 4,000, all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption that the Israeli prime minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage or in exchange for lavish gifts, some several hundred thousand dollars in champagne bottles, in jewelry and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now, the prime minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent and we have heard the prime minister already on the stand, making his case, defending himself against these allegations, insisting that he is innocent.
