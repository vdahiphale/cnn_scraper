I'm Christine Romans.There are signs of movement this morning in the negotiations to raise the debt ceiling. There are just six days to go until June 1st, the earliest estimated date the Treasury may not to be able to pay all the government's bills. Now, two sources tell CNN that White House and Republican negotiators are moving closer to a deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  We've been talking to the White House all day. We're going back and forth. And it's not easy. We want to make sure this is an agreement worthy of the American people and so, it takes a while to make it happen and we're working to make it happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Jasmine Wright is live for us this Friday morning in Washington.So, Jasmine, do we know what the outstanding issues are the Democrats and Republicans are still far apart on? It sounds like they are talking about a two-year deal here with spending caps and raising the debt ceiling for two years. Is that -- is that the parameter? JASMINE WRIGHT, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Yeah, Christine. I think those are kind of where negotiations are heading. But in terms of how far apart these two sides are, I think it depends on who you ask. But reality is, Friday morning, that there is no deal in principle yet. And it's unclear whether or not there will be one as lawmakers had to leave the city for the holiday weekend. There are a series of outstanding issues, some of the things that you kind of just pointed to, with both sides pretty far apart on some of the very major issues to kind of get a deal in place. Now, sources tell us that under a potential agreement, there are several things that are happening. First, debt ceiling would be raised for two years while also capping federal spending except for defense spending and veteran spending. That is kind of up to debate according to sources. Some tell us that the spending caps are still under discussion under this potential agreement. We talked about they would be in place for two years, as long as that debt ceiling is raised. Now, also nondefense discretionary spending levels would be cut to levels slightly below what they are right now. And it would be allowed to kind of raise 1 percent in the second year. Those are specific details, but they are important when we're talking about exactly what is happening in those rooms as they try to really negotiate a deal. Now, of course, both sides remain really far apart on a key issue that we've talked about these last few weeks, which is work requirements. Obviously, Republicans want stricter work requirements for folks who are on programs like SNAP and other programs really help people less fortunate, as well as Democrats want less work requirements in these type of areas. So that remains a very big issue. Now, people in these rooms continue to tell CNN that progress remains slow, that they are really trying to deeply work through all of these issues. But again, time is of the essence and it is not on their side, Christine. So, of course, yesterday we heard McCarthy not be able to promise that deal would be made by June 1st, that X date.",

And look across the nation's midsection, this is where we have the chance of severe weather. Let's break it down for you. If you are in New York, looking good. Down to Orlando, not bad. Washington, D.C., you will stay dry. A few showers and thunderstorms to end off the Memorial Day weekend from Dallas to Denver. The West Coast looking cool still from San Francisco to Los Angeles. And here is our severe weather threat for today near the border of Texas and New Mexico. But getting back to the rain threat across the Carolinas and into Virginia, look at how much rain from Charleston into Wilmington that will dampen your barbecue plans for the weekend, unfortunately.
