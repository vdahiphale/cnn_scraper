We'll get to him in just moments. But first, we want to talk about the breaking news at a New York border crossing. The FBI is investigating a vehicle explosion there. This is at the Rainbow Bridge U.S.-Canada border crossing. Let's get straight to CNN's Brynn Gingrass with the latest details. Brynn, bring us up to speed.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Boris. The FBI, the ATF, the JTTF, which is the Joint Terrorism Task Force, there's a number of federal authorities both on the U.S. side and also on the Canada side that is monitoring the situation, trying to figure out exactly at this point what happened. What we know is that there was a car crossing into the U.S. from Canada and what has been described as some authorities a crosh --  as a crash, sorry at that crossing there at the Rainbow Bridge.And then a subsequent somewhat explosion is what the FBI is describing. Now, whether or not this was sinister or not is not clear at this point. However, as you can imagine, at this point of entry, it's going to be an uptick in security across that area. So that is what we are seeing currently in response as this is still being investigated. We're hearing there is a system-wide security uptick at this point due to this explosion. That means there are going to be more security checks of cars in that area. Around the airports in that area and more security screenings of passengers who are coming in and out of this area. Now, of course, with the holiday, that was already sort of being an uptick, certainly as we've seen more travellers during this time. But this has sort of definitely raised it to another level. So, again, it's very unclear at this point what exactly happened at that crossing. We're still trying to get those answers as authorities are also on the ground there investigating. But, again, there is an uptick in security. And we also know from the JTTF that all points of entry into the state of New York are being closely monitored at this point. So still trying to get some answers, Boris. But that's the very latest that we're hearing on the ground there. SANCHEZ: Bryn, please stand by. I just want to let our viewers know these are live images of the scene that we are watching. It appears that law enforcement is there in large numbers diverting traffic away from the crossing area. I want to go to CNN's John Miller because, John, you have some new reporting. You've spoken to multiple law enforcement. You've spoken to multiple law enforcement sources. You have details about some of what unfolded. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, at that point, the car increases speed, and right after that, there's an explosion. And this is where --depending on which witnesses you're talking to or who viewed which videos, the story becomes divergent because what is not clear is did the car explode because of or upon some impact or did the car explode because there was something in the car that blew up and then caused the impact? And that's what they're trying to look at. They're trying to look at every angle of the video, talk to every witness, but also forensically identify, what's in that car.At the same time, they're dealing with a separate suspicious package that's been found at the scene, which they'll work their way through, which may or may not have anything to do with this. That's common in these situations. But really, the best piece of evidence, physical evidence that may contain those answers, is going to be that vehicle. And that means chemical tests. It means going through the wreckage. It means looking for signs of something that blew up to determine was that a spontaneous combustion upon impact fueled by the gas tank and fuel and other things, or was there an improvised explosive device? These are questions right now, not answers.",

I do want to note we've just gotten word that Canadian officials are going to be holding some kind of press briefing to provide us with potentially some of those answers to the questions that John brought up. I want to bring in former Boston Police Commissioner, Ed Davis, who joins us now. Thank you so much for joining us, Ed. I wanted to ask you something about what John brought up.The fact that this car was apparently selected for secondary screening, what is it that would prompt some official to see something in a car to say that that vehicle needs to be screened further? Because it sticks out to me that between getting from that first checkpoint to the second one, the car sped up and then there was an explosion. Could you tell us a little bit more about that and what you think is going on with that car?",

It's hard to say at this juncture, and John is correct in saying it's very early in the investigation, but all of the agents on the borders are trained in something called suspicious indicators. And so, anything that might have happened, either in the exchange with the driver of the vehicle or his passenger, or something that they saw inside the vehicle, that caused them concern.They do have explosive sniffing dogs there. Again, that's just speculation. But there are a multitude of things that could have happened that raise the suspicion of the Border Patrol agents. And that's exactly why they're there. They're doing their job. And if they started to expand their search and the 2 suspects knew that they were going to get caught, anything's possible.",

The white house is closely monitoring the incident at the Rainbow Bridge crossing, Niagara falls. They say that law enforcement is on the scene and investigating. So obviously President Biden is being brought up to speed with the latest on what is happening there.I want to go back to former commissioner Ed Davis because obviously, Ed, the specter of what's happening in the middle East has heightened the sense of potential danger for different points of entry into the United States and for different landmarks across the country as well as obviously the Thanksgiving holiday too. And with so many people traveling, it seems like soft targets are especially vulnerable with just the sheer number of people that are at airports in different locations. Talk to us about the complicated process when something like this happens of then buttoning down and protecting other areas that might be vulnerable.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a very good point for us. Just a little over two weeks ago, Christopher Ray, the FBI director warned of an increase in potential terrorist attacks. This is Thanksgiving. Uh, there's a lot going on in a hundred different places in New York, not the least of which is in New York city. It's the very epitome of a soft target. And the problem with the soft target is there's so many thousands of people that are coming to this event. You can't stop everybody and everything. And, this is exactly, I mean, whether or not this is terrorism, this is a timely reminder to everyone in security and policing that they need to stay on their game right now.I do want to bring in CNN's Wolf Blitzer, who is a live force in Tel Aviv reporting on what's been happening in the middle East. And obviously Wolf, uh, this to a degree, we don't know, exactly what, has unfolded here in the context of whether it's a terrorist attack or not, but this is something personal for you because you're from Buffalo. You're from this area. I'm wondering what's going through your mind as you're watching these images. It's so sad because those of us who grew up in Buffalo, obviously very, very close to Niagara Falls, one of the great tourist attractions in the country and this Rainbow Bridge, which I've gone over many, many times. Every time we had visitors coming to Buffalo, we would always go to Niagara Falls to show them Niagara falls. And we would always go to the Canadian side because the view from the Canadian side, you cross the Rainbow Bridge is really magnificent to see the falls from the Canadian side, as well as the U S side. But, a lot of people have always thought it's a better view from the Canadian side. That's why this rainbow bridge was always so popular. And, and it's just, it's sad to hear that an incident like this could take place at a place that I love having grown up there. My family grew up there and all of us, you know, would always be frequent visitors over at Niagara falls just to see something like this. [14:15:09] We don't know what it is. We don't know what caused this. I do know that whenever you went across any of the bridges from the United States into Canada, whether the Rainbow Bridge at Niagara Falls or the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, you would go through --  in the old days they would it would be very quick. They would say, where are you from? You see, I'm from Buffalo. Okay, go ahead. And then later they they wanted to see some passport passports once terrorism became an issue or whatever. But if there was a problem, they would always send you to a secondary location for further screening, whether paperwork or look at what you're bringing into Canada or bringing into the United States. So it just brings back a lot of memories. But it was never a big deal to go between the U.S. and Canada. This is very worrisome for those of us who grew up in that area and know it well.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, no question about that. I do want to point out for our viewers, as Wolf noted, the several border crossings in that area, all 4 land border crossings between the United States and Canada near Niagara Falls have been shut down as investigators work through the scene there. We also just got word from CNN's Paula Newton that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been briefed on the situation in Niagara Falls.Essentially, the prime minister's office saying that they are in contact with U.S. officials, and they are fully engaged offering necessary support. I do want to go back to CNN's John Miller for a moment because, John, as you were reporting, your sources have shared with you that there were 2 suspects in this car. It's unclear at this moment exactly what caused the explosion that we've been monitoring. But would we soon know whether that explosive, potential explosive material was detected on the scene? How long does it take to sort that out?",

      "sentences": "So, we're learning a little bit more. The initial report was that the car was past the first checkpoint and was referred to secondary. And Ed talked about, you know, there's indicators that get you referred to secondary. Now they have had time to review video from multiple angles. And it is beginning to tell a slightly different story, which is the car comes onto the bridge and accelerates to an extraordinarily high rate of speed. We're talking about, you know, the speed of a car that's possibly shy of 100 miles an hour. And it strikes the curb, a divider, and then literally goes airborne, flying through the air, smashes into, upon landing, the secondary inspection area.So, it wasn't really referred to secondary. After its initial collision and the car goes up into the air, it literally crashes into the secondary area and disintegrates upon impact. The engine is separated from the car. The car is in pieces and so on. So, this adds a layer of uncertainty to what we're talking about because it starts to drift away from the theory that the car contained an improvised explosive device. But it starts to move towards the theory that this was some kind of high-speed accident. But then we have to look at the word accident, which was what do we have here, do we have a car that was out of control, do we have a malfunction, do we have an accident, or do we have a ramming attack? So, it still leaves us with more questions than answers, but it gives us a better picture of what occurred in the seconds before that car landed and came apart in so many pieces at the secondary inspection area.",

That seems unlikely, but you have to rule out everything. The second is that it's serious enough to have both the Canadian equivalent of the Secretary of Homeland Security as well as the governor discuss it and head there. This is a major, you know, it's a major, you know, it's a major crossing. I mean, this thing does not close.It is fortified. It is, has multiple types of screening. You can't even get close to it without there beginning to be surveillance screening. And so, it would be a natural target. But and this is just where we need to be careful as reporters and analysts. People can assume that they know what the intent is, and I'm not going to assume that yet because I don't, we don't know. The fact that the Joint Terrorism Task Force has been deployed is absolutely accurate at this stage. The threat environment is, to quote FBI Director Wray, sort of is high. We know it because of international terrorism and what's going on in the Middle East and also how domestic terror groups have been activated or animated. (CROSSTALK)",
