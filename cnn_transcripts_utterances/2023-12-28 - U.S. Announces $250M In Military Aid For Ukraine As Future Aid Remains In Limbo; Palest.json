Either side is going to decide what they want to do going forward.If Ukraine does not get the support from NATO and the United States, I'm afraid they are in for another tough year. Russia can re-arm itself and can re-constitute its military machine. If the United States decides to send $60 billion an aid, as the Senate should pass, as well as $50 billion coming from the European Union, that sends a signal to Russia that the West is not going to allow it to take over. I think that is what's got to happen here early in the year. Ukraine has to get that level of support from the United States in order to show Russia that it will have the capability to go on the offense and change the game. Maybe perhaps, that brings pressure to the negotiation table. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: I know it's, Mike, really perplexing to the military community about why there is this kind of what would be unconventional Russian Republican opposition to finding Ukraine.

NATO was created to stop Russian aggression and advancement.Maybe not allowing Ukraine into NATO, I understand that. I recognize that putting them in right now draws the West into a large conflict in Europe. But providing the support that we could provide them, with the offensive weapons, more airplanes, more tanks, more overall long-range rocket fire systems that actually threaten Russia. Force Russia to do more mobilization because we don't see them on their side -- this hasn't affected their economy as well. Use the levers of soft American power. We haven't done that, as well we haven't got other countries mobilized here. Again, I don't get it. I think this is a literally no-brainer for the United States to continue support with what Ukraine is trying to do here to stop Russian aggression here and what is NATO's backyard.",

Flovent, over the last nine years, has gone up about 50 percent. The rate of inflation in that period of time has been about 23 percent. GSK did the math and realized that they might be liable for higher rebates than the price they actually charged for the drug. Which is why they've created this generic, which has never been sold and has no price history, and therefore, won't be potentially liable for the inflation rebates that Medicaid demands. So, this is basically just a cost decision. Flovent it's a 20-year-old drug, incredibly successful, very popular drug. There is no other reason to discontinue it other than this potential financial downfall for the manufacturer.",

Then talk to your insurance company about whether the new generic formulation of Flovent will be covered by your insurance. But get that it now, before you need to renew your medicine. If you get pushback from your pharmaceutical insurance benefit plan about whether they'll cover this drug, talk to your doctor or provider about alternatives. There are other inhaled corticosteroids that can be appropriate for you but not necessarily interchangeable. The time to discuss this with your physician is not when you are basically using the last of a severe drug. Do it now, sort it out now.
