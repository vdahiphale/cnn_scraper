      "sentences": "Kate, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has to accomplish what the administration has been trying to do for months, and that's get to the point where they can announce that there is a ceasefire and a deal that would bring home the remaining hostages. The problem is, that hasn't gotten any closer over the weekend with Israel's operation. Quite the opposite, in fact. It may have moved even farther away. And there was not yet a finish line in sight before this weekend.So, the challenge remains great here as Blinken is in Egypt and he'll come here. And it may even be more difficult with Israel's political fracturing now with Benny Gantz, as you point out, war time - war cabinet minister leaving the war cabinet. And that makes it even more difficult to try to get - get a deal in place here. Over the weekend, of course, on Saturday, Israel carried out a daylight raid into the heart of the Nuseirat refugee camp that rescued four hostages. There was great joy here at that news and the U.S. administration also welcoming the news of four hostages that were rescued from a very densely populated area. But that, of course, is the challenge in that operation. The Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza says 274 Palestinians were killed, hundreds more wounded. The IDF disputes that and says there were less than 100 casualties. CNN can't independently verify those numbers. But either way it makes it one of the deadliest days in Gaza in months. And that - those sorts of major incidents have brought negotiations to a standstill, or at least created a major roadblock for them. And that's what Blinken is stepping into here. Meanwhile, just moments ago, the mother of one of the hostages spoke out publicly saying how glad she wants to hold her son, Almong Meir, once again after this rescue, and calling on a hostage deal, but crucially remembering those moments that she had prayed for, for so long.

They'll talk about patterns of life. The kinds of things that occurred while they were under captivity for eight months. Imagine that. The fact that they were held by a family. The fact that they've probably had conversations with terrorists that might be something that they might consider important but boy when you give that kind of information to the special operators, they know exactly what to do with it, and it will help them put pieces of a puzzle together to potentially find other hostages as well.",

The Biden administration is close to finalizing a treaty with Saudi Arabia that would commit the U.S. to help defend the gulf nation as part of a long shot deal to encourage diplomatic ties between Riyadh and Israel, U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials said.Now, leave the Israel side out of this. What would it mean from a military perspective to strike this kind of defense treaty with Saudi Arabia?",

But it's also caused a lot of problems for the Saudi Arabian government to have westerners in the land of the holy mosque. But you can't leave Israel out of this. That's the sole purpose for this. They are - Mr. Blinken, Director Burns from the CIA, are all trying to get Saudi Arabia to contribute forces to the end state of Gaza. And it's something that Mr. Netanyahu does not address. He doesn't have a political end state to this war. He just has a military end state. And it's one of the reasons that Benny Gantz resigned yesterday because he didn't see the political outcome of all of this fighting. He knows that as a former soldiers, as a former chief of the Israeli Defense Forces. So, there has to be some type of organization that will go into Gaza and help secure it and provide security, not only from a military perspective, but even such things as police, and take away some of the power from Hamas that has been there close to 20 years since 2006 when the last election was held inside of Gaza and Hamas was voted it and refused to give elections after that. So, there has to be Middle Eastern countries helping in this. And I think that's all part of the deal- making with Saudi Arabia.",
