And tonight, we are now just three days away from the former president's surrender at the Fulton County jail after you realized he was criminally charged for allegedly trying to overturn Joe Biden's election victory in Georgia. Two sources telling CNN that Donald Trump plans to turn himself in and be processed this coming Thursday.Now, that date was set during negotiations today, apparently, with the D.A., Fani Willis, in her office over his consent bond and release conditions. We'll talk more about what that really means. The bottom line, he agreed to a $200,000 bond and a parade of his co-defendants also began reaching their own bond agreements. This case is now marking the very first time the release conditions for Trump have included, first of all, a cash bond and also a prohibition at the outset on intimidating co-defendants or witnesses and victims, including through social media. I want to bring in CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen. We are going to walk through what we've learned about this bond agreement. Norm, you and I are talking about this all the time in terms of what to expect. First of all, that big number, 200 grand, is that fair? Is that expected?",

Tell me what you think the people of Atlanta are thinking about in Fulton County as it relates to this case over the others? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Well, number one, I think the people of Atlanta in Fulton County want a safe procedure. They don't want violence. They don't want a January 6th coming to their city. They want to see the justice system play out in a way that's fair, fair to Donald Trump, fair to the 18 co- defendants, but that keeps everything in the courthouse. So, I think that people of Atlanta are a little bit nervous about, you know, are pro-Trump supporters going to show up? Is there potential for some drama around either when Trump and the other co-defendants start turning themselves in or indictments in other court hearings? But I think in the broader sense, what the people of Atlanta want is the same thing as what the people of America want, and that is accountability.

He has been charged down in Atlanta.So, if you are one of these people who has exposure in both, either as a subject or as a witness, you've got to make a calculation whether or not you're going to cooperate with the authorities, whether those are state authorities or federal authorities. Obviously, if you don't cooperate and Trump is elected, you could get a pardon for a federal crime, but you're not going to get that at a state level. So, it's going to be very interesting to see, particularly if we have dual, one federal, one state case moving together at once, where you have people who are in different roles, that's certainly going to be interesting. And again, the Norm's point, those are going to be the people at the higher level, the ones who are immediately in contact with Trump, the ones who can either make the case for Jack Smith or who can end up being charged alongside, next to Trump.",

So, I think that each person has a different defense.But -- I mean, there's another way th0at's interesting, which I don't think people have talked about. Donald Trump has a claim that he has an advice of counsel defense. I'm not saying it will prevail, but he has a good advice of counsel defense. And he can argue that, look, district attorney, you've taken away that defense because every one of the lawyers who gave me advice is a co-defendant.

First of all, I think some of them are going to likely flip. The prison system in Georgia is notorious for being a hellhole, and nobody wants to spend a day there. So, as I say, I think some of them will cooperate. Others may find legitimate reasons to sever. Some might go to federal court on removal. Some would stay in state court.

What are they for?And the other thing I'll be listening for is, are they interested, in fact, in being president of all of us in the United States or just those who agree with that? And you hear a lot from Republicans today pandering to others who are about, you know, turning on one another instead of to one another. And I think we need presidents and candidates for president who want to ask us and do ask us to turn to each other. That's why Joe Biden is a formidable candidate for reelection. He's shown that kind of leadership, that kind of executive, and frankly patriotic leadership.

And there is somebody who is a formidable opponent right now in one Donald Trump, at least according to the polling.And so, what is the best strategy for the candidates to even make a dent in that lead? Because so far, the strategy has been to be quiet. His name is almost Voldemort (ph) to many of these candidates. They do not want to even name him at this point or any point in time.

We want someone who is unifying, someone who is about a better future for all of us, the seen and the unseen, the left out and left back.

These lawsuits are against two entities that Michael Jackson was the sole shareholder, sole proprietor of, and one was the Michael or MJJ Ventures, and one was MJJ Productions.And what the court is allowing for these two cases, as you stated in your opening, both cases had been dismissed, the 2013 and 2014 cases, based on the statute of limitations, and now this new law that California has, which allows individuals to file a case for sexual abuse that otherwise might have been barred by the statute, so that's a huge victory for the plaintiffs in this case, then the court of appeals saying that the lower court got it wrong by determining that these corporations did not owe a duty of care to these individuals. Now, I think it's interesting to note, Laura, the appellate court says there is no comparable case law to cite. I think the decision about whether these corporations that are solely owned by Michael Jackson and the court goes on to talk about how he could have restrained himself, how he could have conducted himself in a different way so as not to cause the harm to these two men and boys at the time, I don't think this is a settled decision at all. You have two lower courts dismissing these cases. You have an appellate court saying, no, lower court, particularly on the merit of the liability of the corporations, you got it wrong sending it back to the lower court. So, whatever the outcome is, if this case does move forward to trial, we should expect to see continued appellate court litigation about this issue of the responsibility of these companies.",

And it's causing some people to look at this case perhaps with a new, fresh set of eyes.But you actually were in the court when one of the plaintiffs, Wade Robeson, testified. But he testified, remember, in defense of Michael Jackson, saying that he had not been a victim of molestation or anything inappropriate.

They both have stated under oath that Michael Jackson never molested them, never assaulted them. So, that is going to be, if these cases do move forward to trial, if there isn't settlement, that is going to be a big issue, I think, for a lot of jurors who are looking at this. You know, Michael Jackson is a beloved celebrity in his death. So, reconciling what we know about, the delayed response, how victims oftentimes suppress what has happened to them and then come forward later, juxtaposing that with these prior inconsistent statements, I don't think it's a slam dunk on either side.",

But it was pretty clear pretty quickly that things were different.Damar Hamlin, his heart stopped. If it wasn't for the quick thinking of the medical staff on hand, he would have died. In this situation, it was pretty clear as soon as the medical staff was attending to Bolden that things were different. You saw some of his legs moving a little bit. You saw that they were not moving at the same pace they had with Damar Hamlin because obviously the situation wasn't as serious. And the team did announce pretty soon after the game, as you noted, that he had feeling in all his extremities. He was really just kept in the hospital overnight for observation, reportedly diagnosed with a concussion, and allowed to fly back to Massachusetts with the team on Sunday morning. COATES: I mean, one of the differences is that the game was called off. Obviously, this is a preseason at this point. So, it's unlike the actual regular season games when there was a question of what to do now and how to operate in this instance. But noting on that concussion, I mean, there has been, I understand, an 18% increase in concussions in the NFL comparing the last two seasons, by the way.

One thing is the NFL, to its credit, has broadened the definition of what a concussion is to be in line with what medical experts suggest. So obviously, if you broaden that out, you're going to get more people diagnosed with it.However, what we are still waiting for is a little bit more safety equipment. We have seen the NFL investigate different style of helmets. We've also seen what's called a guardian cap. I call it a foam thingy. Some people like to call it an egg crate. Certain players have been wearing this during practice. And this is astonishing, Laura. In those situations, concussions have decreased 52%. Fifty-two percent. And we know the effect of concussions on these players later in life. That is significant if those could be cut in half. Now why don't we see this during a game? Well, you can take a look at what they look like. A lot of players don't want to change to something like that. It is hard to get them to play in what they're not used to. NFL can be slow to change as a league and they don't look great, and I think it doesn't really fit into the aesthetic of being this rough and ready league. So, it'll be interesting to see if the helmet technology can catch up enough to those guardian caps that people are okay just sticking with the helmets, or the NFL has said, not right now, but it's possible. If the helmet technology can't catch up, you might see those guardian caps in a game sometime soon.",
