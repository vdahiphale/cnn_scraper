Israel saying that its forces have raided Gaza over the past 24 news in a search for hostages.We're also seeing Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon. Also, large- scale strikes continuing in Gaza. Israeli tanks are on the move near the Gaza border. That is coming ahead of an expected ground incursion. The Israeli military has told more than a million people to leave northern Gaza. The U.N. says that's impossible, and the Red Cross warns it would be, in their words, \"catastrophic.\" I want to turn to CNN's Becky Anderson, who is joining us now from Jerusalem. So the IDF says the troops have carried out local raids in Gaza. What more do we know about that?",

It is an enormous buildup of ground troops and artillery on the ground around that border with Gaza.And now as we understand it, the IDF has conducted raids, in the plural, into Gaza Strip as they continue the air assault. It is interesting. I'm looking for the full IDF statement. We only just received this to CNN. First of all, they don't say when the raids were conducted. I think that's important. And we'll work more on our sources to get that. It says, and I quote here, \"IDF soldiers thwarted terror cells and infrastructure located in the area.\" And, Anderson, it says, \"Including a Hamas cell that fired antitank missiles towards Israeli territory.\" But it also says, \"This is all in an effort to eliminate the threat of terrorists and weapons in the area and locate hostages.\" So, we know what they're describing they did. We don't know whether they have or were able to locate the area or areas where these hostages are being held. But we do know -- of course, you and I have been discussing this for some days -- it is as many as 150 hostages being held there.",

In the videos, you can see the terror group and its affiliates training for a major attack at six open-air training camps in Gaza itself. In the investigation, CNN's Clarissa Ward looks at years of satellite images and social media videos, adding to the question, how did Israel and perhaps the U.S. intelligence miss this? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (SHOUTING) (GUNFIRE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Propaganda videos put out by Hamas reveal chilling details about the years of preparations that went into Saturday's bloody attacks right under Israel's nose.

      "sentences": "Analyzing metadata from the videos, a CNN investigation can reveal the presence of at least six training sites inside Gaza, one just 720 meters from the most heavily fortified and patrolled part of Israel's border.In that camp, Hamas recreated an Israeli compound, elements of the nearby border crossing, including an insignia of the area's battalion. The videos show they even practiced taking prisoners and zip-tying their hands at the camp. Satellite imagery indicates the camp was constructed within the last year and a half. At two other locations in the Southern part of Gaza, Hamas trained for their audacious paraglider assault, rehearsing takeoffs and landings. At all six sites, two years of satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows no indication of offensive Israeli military action. The imagery, instead, shows that in the last two years, some camps even expanded into surrounding farmland, and that there was activity in the last several months at the camps. The stunning revelations raise questions as to how Hamas was able to train so openly, so close to the border for so long. And why Israeli officials were unable to pick up on and prevent the October 7th attack. Clarissa Ward, CNN (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The question was, how many votes will he peel away from Jim Jordan? And if Jim Jordan still wins the Republican nomination, which is a simple majority threshold of the 221 members, but if he peels away enough support, what will happen then? And will Jim Jordan decide to step aside? Because Jordan has insisted that he must have 217 votes of the 221 Republican conference to go to the floor. If he does not have that today, this afternoon, will he step aside? And then what will happen then? Will there be another speaker candidate? All so many questions still, guys, after more than a week of this disarray, dysfunction and inability to do anything here in the House because of this leadership crisis on the Republican side.

It is that one of our political parties is just in gridlock, unable to work. And Donald Trump has been at the center of all of this. He supported Jim Jordan. And people are defying him. That may be one of the big takeaways 10 days after McCarthy was ousted. So many House Republicans are not following his lead. KEILAR: You bring up a good point.

That has not been the case so far. Steve Scalise, likely was that person if there was a unifying figure. There was no appetite for that. So how bad would it have to get? Talking to a couple of members this morning, they think it has to go several more days for there to be a true unifying government, for Democrats to have to get involved, and maybe some moderate Republican.

Adding that they're increasing the number of uniformed officers, in their words, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" I want to bring in CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. He's a former NYPD deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. So, John, where else are we seeing ramped up security? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: We're seeing it at major Jewish organizations, for instance, the Museum of Jewish Heritage. You're seeing it at major religious institutions, such as Temple Emanuel on 5th Avenue, an iconic location. But you're also seeing it, Anderson, in public schools in Brooklyn and Jewish and/or Arab neighborhoods, at mosques and predominantly Muslim neighborhoods. What New York is doing is trying to create a sense of visibility, a blanket of security at over 400 locations, so that people understand, yes, there is no credible specific threat. But they also understand that, in the threat stream on the Internet and in the airways, they're hearing concerns, and want that visibility out there to reassure people and also to ensure timely response.",
