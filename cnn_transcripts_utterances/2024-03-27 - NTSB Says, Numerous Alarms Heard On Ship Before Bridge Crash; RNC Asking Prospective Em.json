That's tonight on a special two-hour Laura Coates Live.Good evening, I'm Laura Coates in Washington, D.C. And tonight, a dramatic play by play of the Dali's final faded minutes, from the investigators examining just went wrong and what happened at that Key Bridge. The National Transportation Safety Board gave a second-by-second depiction, going through the initial alarms, the commands to steer away, the desperate radio call for help, the order to drop the anchor, the radio call that confirmed that the Dali had lost all power, all of this before hitting the bridge and causing the catastrophic collapse. And I really cannot even begin to imagine how frantic this crew must have been. Now, we have some insight into those terrifying moments inside the ship, the NTSB revealing they've got the data recorders, they got cargo manifest. And you will not believe what was on board that vessel, some 764 tons of hazardous material, corrosives, flammables, and some are breached on that ship. And there's some kind of apparent sheen on the water, which suggests that some of this hazardous material might now be in the port of Baltimore, a body of water with a current that leads to the ocean. You know, as much information as we're getting tonight, there is still so much we still do not know. It's the infancy of the investigation and we don't have any pictures from inside that engine room. We don't have any cameras. We don't have any CCTV. Also tonight, divers are uncovering an underwater grave, a red pickup truck with two victims who were trapped inside. And they are all saying site that sonar scans show the vehicles encased in the wreckage from the bridge. Did anyone else possibly survive? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you notice, there are a lot of parties to this investigation. You've had the secretary of transportation there, you've had Federal Highway there, you have other organizations. Sometimes in our ports, in which 25 percent of our economy is based, there's so many people in charge that, as they say, no one is in charge.And the accountability here, for me, runs to why -- this hasn't been our first bridge collapse. There were two during my tenure at the NTSB, in which we made recommendations that risk assessments be done. We know how large these ships are, how much the port traffic has changed because of just in time impact on our economy, and yet here we are with the same bridge that was built and very little change to it. So, in many ways, we have got to relook at port security because it's too disjointed and it needs to be addressed for the protection of the American society and the American people, because, at the end of the day, we're going to be the ones paying for the bridge to be replaced.",

I don t know that there's been a real risk assessment to look at. I think the chairman, Homendy, mentioned the number of bridges at risk and the numbers of ports that we have, the economic impact. This is an accident that needs to wake up America to the importance of addressing a system of accountability in terms of these operations in the ports. As you pointed out, and we saw in East Moriches incident, we've got a lot of hazardous materials being transported.

So, she was an election denying enabler. To me, that's a bridge too far. If you believe in something as fundamental as the peaceful transfer of power and that we believe in elections and the winner wins and the loser concedes and goes home, to hire somebody to talk about Trumpism and supposedly give an insight into that, but someone who actually was an enabler of Trump's effort to overturn the election, I can certainly understand why our colleagues at NBC found that unacceptable.
