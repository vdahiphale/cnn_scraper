      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. I'm Boris Sanchez coming live to you from Tampa Bay, Florida, where Hurricane Milton is set to make landfall not far from here in just a few hours. I'm joined by my colleague Brianna Keilar, who's live for us in the nation's capital.Hurricane Milton is an unprecedented storm. We saw this thing go from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just about a day. Right now, it stands at a Category 4, and it is promising 140-plus mile-an- hour winds for this region, as well as a deadly, deadly storm surge. I want to show you what has started to happen in Tampa Bay right now. The water has started to recede. These are easterly winds that is dragging water out. Typically, the water line is much closer to this spot right here, this seawall in front of me. This recession is something you typically see with storms. At some point, this will come flying back as a potential 15-foot storm surge in some parts. It's estimated to be somewhere between 8 to 12 feet here in Tampa Bay, and that is what has officials very, very concerned. This may be a Category 4 storm, a very powerful one, but the storm surge is a Category 5, and it is set to shatter records set by Hurricane Helene made only about two weeks ago. Some of the debris from Hurricane Helene is still out in this area. You see it here in this pier. A police officer came by earlier in the day and told our crews that this was damage from Hurricane Helene, and you see scenes just like this one all along Florida's Gulf Coast. This storm is extremely dangerous, not only because of the wind and the storm surge and the added foot of rainfall that's coming, but also because of tornadoes. We've seen several touchdowns throughout the region. This morning, one of them confirmed in Broward County. That is hundreds of miles from here. That is on the southeastern part of Florida. That is extremely concerning. There is something like 18 tornado warnings for counties across this region and it could be a devastating, devastating situation once this storm barrels through not just the western part of Florida but through central Florida and past the East Coast. It is expected to maintain hurricane-force winds throughout its path. I'm going to go live now to Elisa Raffa, who's in the CNN Weather Center for us tracking the storm. Elisa, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "We are still looking at a Category 4 hurricane. It's maintaining that intensity. It's got 130-mile-per-hour winds in the center. It's booking it north and east at 16 miles per hour, sitting 120 miles south and west of Tampa.The gusts coming into St. Petersburg right now are already up to 55 miles per hour. Winds are sustained at 37 miles per hour. Gusts are getting up to 50 miles per hour even in Naples. You could see all of the lightning as all of these outer bands work their way inland. We have also found a prolific amount of tornadoes. Tornadoes are common when a hurricane makes landfall. But we are really finding some intense tornado warnings in these outer bands that are coming through Alligator Alley, South Florida. All of these white boxes are signifying that it's not just a tornado warning. It's a tornado warning signifying considerable damage is possible because the tornado is so large and so impactful. A lot of these have some cells, discrete cells, that are really just dropping some of these twisters across the state. The tornado threat continues through 9 o'clock this evening for that watch as we get - continue to see the outer bands rolling with the heavy rain and drop the tornadoes. When it comes to the wind field of this, it won't impact the entire state because since yesterday, Milton's wind field has doubled. Yesterday, the wind field was a hundred miles wide. Today, 250 miles wide. That's why it's going to impact so many people. Look at the purple, 110 mph winds or greater from Tampa down to Fort Myers. Hurricane winds, though, stretch across the peninsula to the East Coast of Florida as well. And it will take with it all of the ocean storm surge that it's been churning over, over the last couple of days. That's why we're still concerned no matter what the category is, the storm surge will still be catastrophic. Nine to 13 feet of storm surge possible from Sarasota down towards Fort Myers, eight to 12 feet in Tampa Bay. These numbers will break what they saw with Helene just two weeks ago. Even some storm surge values up to 8 feet down towards Naples and Marco Island. And, of course, it comes with heavy rain. Could see rain totals up to a foot or more. Boris?",

So we had teams here at the county, at the municipality level. We even had neighbors pitching in with their pickup trucks, helping other neighbors out. Everyone was pitching in, it was a community-wide effort to try to do as much as we can because we all know with these strong winds, that debris can become dangerous and projectiles. So, you know, I feel that we did everything that we could with our, you know, limited resources. And we were also sharing resources with the northern part of the country, which was also impacted heavily from Helene. So it has definitely had impacts across the whole East Coast.",

MYERS BEACH, FL: Well, where we're located, we're a little bit higher up here in Fort Myers towards Colonial. We're at nine feet flood level. We're about 25 minutes away from Fort Myers Beach.

It's not just the foot of rainfall on top of a potential 15-foot storm surge, on top of 140-plus mile-an-hour winds. It's also the potential for tornadoes. There are something like a dozen tornado warnings spread out across the region where this storm is expected to hit.In fact, we just got footage of a tornado, a confirmed tornado, touching down in Fort Myers. I want to play that clip for you right now. And conditions here on the ground in Tampa Bay have gotten very, very intense and then they've slowed down. And literally, as I'm speaking, I'm starting to feel the wind pick up, but it's so fascinating how, just a few miles apart, you can sense an enormous difference in conditions and in what this massive hurricane is capable of. I want to go live to Isabel Rosales, who's in Tampa. And, Isabel, you had spoken to a guy who calls himself Lieutenant Dan, who's deciding to ride out the storm in arguably the worst place possible in a storm like this.

He's there at his sailboat right now, right over here, just taking cover. He's refusing to go to a shelter. This is strongly against the advice, you know, of police officers who have been here throughout the day pleading with him to please, you know, get out of here, go to a shelter. But he says, hey, I did it through Helene. I'm going to do it again. So that's where he's taking cover.And it's interesting just to see the dichotomy of how seriously people are taking the storm. You have people like that. You have people out here going on runs, even in weather like this, going out and taking pictures like you saw, Boris, right behind you. And then you have people on Davis Islands right here, a man-made island where TGH is who yesterday were taking this so seriously. They were boarding up their homes, packing up and evacuating. Good for them. That's the advice of what first responders have been saying. Now, it's a lot harder to move around here if people still want to get out of evacuation zone A and B, as it is under a mandatory evacuation. And that's because the bridges, Boris, have been shut down. The Sunshine Skyway, the Gandy, the Courtney Campbell, these bridges that connect Pinellas County, Manatee County and Hillsborough County, because it's so windy. We're getting these gusts of wind that are too dangerous to keep these bridges operational. And the same goes with first responders. Once you start getting into these wind speeds, these first responders are just not going to be able to come out and answer 911 calls. I heard that directly from Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister, who said, hey, I fear for the person who's decided not to evacuate. And they're going to be in that situation calling 911, and we can't get out to them. Boris.",

The water continues to stay out. Boris, you mentioned that you're a Florida native. I am, too. I don't know why people are here. We see the steady stream here in Cypress Point Park. We saw people earlier swimming in the water. I don't know why they're here when there is beer and not run home. The conditions here continue to get worse.

One of the things that has struck me about Hurricane Milton, aside from the way that it rapidly intensified in the Gulf, the threat that it poses from the perspective of storm surge, is the way that I've heard people discussing this storm and the sort of distrust about what this storm actually is, the threat that it poses, and how the federal government can help people respond. I was actually speaking to a couple of residents yesterday at a massive debris pile at a dump that a local municipality organized in the area of Pinellas County to help folks get rid of stuff that had broken down during Hurricane Helene, to help get rid of trash, effectively. And I spoke to an elderly woman who told me that she believed that this hurricane was geo-engineered. This is the kind of disinformation, dangerous disinformation, that's being put out there, even by elected officials, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene who earlier put out on social media that she believed that someone was controlling the weather. Not sure exactly what that means, but my colleague Dana Bash asked Vice President Kamala Harris, who was on CNN earlier today, about that kind of disinformation. Here's the Vice President's response.

And that's why I call it dangerous, and we all know it's dangerous, and the gamesmanship has to stop. At some point, the politics have to end, especially in a moment of crisis, and the crises that we've been seeing affect so many people. And they've - I've met people who have lost family members to Hurricane Helene. We know the desperation and the fear that the folks who are attempting to evacuate Florida are experiencing.

And certainly all good ideas are welcome. But right now, let's let FEMA, let's let the folks who are on the ground do the work they need to do right now in real time.That's about assisting with evacuations, getting correct information out, battling, sadly, the misinformation and putting in place the resources that can hopefully mitigate against the predictable damage.

Storm surge is one of the most fatal portions of the hazards and one of the greatest risks to life and safety.But as you mentioned, tornadoes can be a significant risk. We're going to see major river flooding from this storm, where areas that may not have flooded before are going to flood because of the extensive rainfall and the fact that the storm surge is going to come up and block those rivers from draining.
