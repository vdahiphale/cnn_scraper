It began with a traditional handshake between Republican Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Democratic Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota.The debate went on to be mostly civil, especially given the history of attacks in this campaign. Senator Vance and Governor Walz drew very sharp contrasts on policy while repeatedly shifting the focus to the candidates at the top of their tickets, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Take a listen to Walz and Vance as they save their sharpest lines for the presidential nominee of the other party on issue after issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: The fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear in the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris.",

So I just want to make clear that it's about a third Democrat, a third Republican, a third independent in our sample. Overall about five percentage points more Democratic than a poll of registered voters nationwide would be. So keep that in mind as we look at these results of debate watchers.First and foremost, who won the debate? It was basically an even split. 51 percent of debate watchers say Vance won, 49 percent say Walz won. What about expectations versus reality? So who did you think was going to win the debate? Before the debate, 45 percent said Vance would win, 54 percent said Walz. And you see it ended up 51 percent to 49 percent. So Vance bested expectations, Walz underperformed expectations of this group of debate watchers going into the debate. And I just want to show you how this scorecard stacks up to recent vice presidential debates. You see here it looks more in the realm of 2016 and 2012, this was not an outsized lopsided victory the way we saw in 2020 or 2008. Roughly even here in how the debate watchers in this poll saw this debate tonight, Anderson.",

I mean, it was amazing, the split- screen difference between a competent Vance and a totally in over his head Walz. The answer on why he lied about his trips to China and the Tiananmen Square thing was probably the worst VP debate meltdown since Stockdale in '92. You know, who am I and why am I here? It was two and a half minutes of absolute terrible. For Vance, night of redemption, all the political media has told us that Vance was a terrible pick and Walz was going to bring in all these voters, that charade is now over.

He wanted, you know, all of the sort of acid lines that he delivers on the road he didn't deliver. And he probably profited from that.You said, and I agree, if you were here earlier, I said if I were, if I were Walz, I would have delivered that line about Tiananmen Square, that answer in Chinese, and it would have been more understandable than the one he gave. But when you look at a dial group of this debate, the things that did the worst, Scott, were two things, his January 6th answer, worse than anybody, and his abortion and saying he never supported a national abortion ban, because people know that's not true.

Vance and Tim Walz. He said, \"EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT, BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR OWN VOTERS.\" Now the real point here, Anderson, is that not everybody knew that, because during the last debate, between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, he was asked repeatedly. He was pressed on the issue. Would you veto this ban if it came across your desk? And he refused to answer that. In fact, J.D. Vance had said in an interview that Donald Trump would veto a national abortion ban if he was re-elected, and when asked about that in the debate, he said he hadn't talked -- Trump said he hadn't talked to Vance about it. Not only that, he said I don't think he was speaking for me. Later, Vance said that he learned a lesson about speaking out ahead of Donald Trump. But this really comes at a time, again, when Donald Trump has tried to walk this fine line when it comes to abortion. He knows it's not a political winner. He doesn't want to engage on the topic. But he also wants to take full credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. One of the reasons, we suspected, told by some of Trump's closest allies, that he wouldn't fully embrace this idea of a veto was because he wanted to appeal to the right.

He cut the open enrollment period in half. He slashed funding for advertising and for people who help other Americans sign up. He ended a key set of subsidies for insurers. His administration refused to defend some critical provisions of the law in court, instead, arguing that they should, indeed, be invalidated. I could go on. So yes, Trump did keep operating the Obama exchanges. He didn't completely give up on it. But casting him as the savior of Obamacare, I think, Jake, is pretty dishonest.",

And in many ways, I mean, talking to many Republicans over the last several months, there are a lot of Republicans who make the case for Trump's candidacy way better than Trump himself does. Trump rarely executes these arguments in ways that are coherent. And Vance has been really the only person out there doing it for him. And tonight, he did it. Look, I think that they kind of both ended up net positive at the end of this.
