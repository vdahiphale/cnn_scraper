Could be as soon as today the twice-impeached, twice-arrested former president of the United States of America could be indicted for a third time, the federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results meeting right now right behind me right there. That is live pictures from outside the court in Washington, D.C. What is unclear at this moment is if they are voting on a potential indictment. Trump posted on his social media account yesterday that he expected to be indicted this week. CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz is outside the court watching every movement. Katelyn, if and when the indictment is handed up, how will we get word? How will that this has happened, since they are meeting in secret?",

And that investigation, as far as we know, is focused on what happened around Georgia. It is a Georgia investigation conducted by the Fulton County district attorney. And one of the things that has surfaced recently is that there was a subpoena that went out to a journalist from Atlanta who had gone into the state capitol in December of 2020 and stumbled upon the meeting of Trump electors as they were gathering to put forward electoral votes that were, in fact, illegitimate, that Donald Trump had not won the state of Georgia, but yet those electors had gathered, sent their elector votes into Congress. And so this journalist has been subpoenaed to testify to the grand jury in Georgia that is looking at the possible indictment there separately -- Sara.",

And to the point we were just making there, look, Donald Trump has received a target letter. Donald Trump's lawyers are saying they believe he will be indicted. They have met with prosecutors. We don't believe there are many or any more crucial witnesses to testify before that grand jury. At this point, what's the holdup, if there is one, for an indictment? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Well, I'm glad to be with both of you. I will tell you, I think he's probably just -- he being the special counsel, is just using the belt-and-suspenders method to make sure that he's got everything covered and that anything that he may not have anticipated, that somebody else has thought of, that he's covering that as well. I really think you're likely to see an indictment either today or maybe Thursday, as the grand jury that's been hearing this case meets. It's important that they consider, frankly, the evidence that has been presented. And that grand jury is either going to have to have a summary of some of that information, or they will have heard some of it originally. But all that matter, I'm sure, has been placed before them. And you will likely see that indictment come out without a great deal of fanfare until we get to the time of the initial appearance. So I wouldn't be surprised at all to see it this week.",

      "sentences": "So a grand jury needs to actually have evidence presented, but it can be presented to the body as a summary.So you may have had a witnesses testify in some depositions or some recorded interviews. And they don't have to sit there and listen to every bit of it. You can actually have a grand jury that hears a summary of the investigation of the steps that has been done. And that's why you can have multiple grand juries working at any given time. And summaries from one grand jury can be given to another grand jury. But in a case like this, my guess is that all the what I would call critical evidence or the vast majority of the information that was to be presented has been given to a grand jury. And that grand jury will then vote. So, the prosecutor comes in, they will have a chance to speak to the grand jury before those deliberations. Ultimately, the grand jury will make a decision and vote. And then that indictment goes through the usual process of being returned in court. I'm sure there have been discussions about, will the indictment be sealed, how do we deal with this if a true bill comes out, which, frankly, nobody should be surprised if there is an indictment. A good prosecutor can get an indictment in a case like this. And so the court process then will take place to make sure that Trump is aware of the charges or anybody else who's charged is told what the charges are against him. And you will see a lot of what we saw from the case in Florida. It will mimic essentially that. It'll just be in a different courthouse with a different judge and sort of different allegations.",

      "sentences": "So, from Jack Smith, I'm hoping that we see a detailed indictment. I really think this is probably the more serious of the allegations that Trump is facing. I think the country is aware of it.We watched it live as events were happening around January the 6th and certainly heard the press conferences and things that went on from Trump and the statements that were given about the election, so that the public knows that. [11:10:08] But I think, at the same time, the public is going to want a very detailed indictment. You can have an indictment that's technically very well-written and very accurate, but it doesn't have enough detail. I mean, think about you could have a poem that's a haiku, right? But you would like to have something that's a little longer in verse. So I'd like to see in this indictment really the special counsel spelling out what the involvement was, what the specific allegations was -- were, some particular instances of evidence that should be listed in the indictment. I'm less worried about identify particular witnesses, but I would be interested to see how they intend to prove the allegations they set forth. I think the -- and I just think that builds confidence, that builds public confidence in the actions of a prosecutor, as he or she plans to move forward with a case. So, that's, I think, what we will see. And I think it'll be a much more detailed document than the original indictment that we saw in the documents case in Florida.",

But there are still a number of issues that still need to be worked out. And chief among them is that the U.S. actually still needs to approve the training program that the Europeans come up with, because the F-16 is an American technology. The problem, though, is that, according to U.S. officials, the Europeans have still not actually submitted a final syllabus or training program for the U.S. to sign off on. So everything is kind of on hold right now until the Biden administration receives that training plan and then actually authorizes it. The training cannot begin until the U.S. signs off on the provision of things like simulators, flight simulators, as well as training manuals, because all of that, of course, has to do with sensitive U.S. technology with regard to the F-16, which is a U.S.-made plane. So, right now, really, the Biden administration is kind of in limbo waiting for the Europeans, who will be taking the lead on this training program, to provide that final syllabus. And there are still a number of other things that need to be worked out before, of course, this training can actually begin. The U.S., for its part, is still deciding whether or not it's going to even send American pilots over to Europe to train these Ukrainians on the F-16s. The Ukrainians themselves need to undergo English-language proficiency programs before they can start training, because these F- 16 planes, they are operated using English. And so all of these issues are kind of compounding at this moment. But we are told that any syllabus and any training program that the Ukrainians begin to undergo, whether it's this month, next month, it is going to be very similar to a hypothetical training course that the U.S. Air Force actually designed after assessing two Ukrainian pilots who came to the U.S. earlier this year to basically be assessed on their skills on an F-16. The U.S. Air Force devised this training program that would hypothetically be used for Ukrainian pilots in the future. And that determined that these pilots could feasibly be trained within four to five months, a much speedier timeline than it would normally take an American pilot to learn from scratch. And so the syllabus is likely going to look a lot like that. But, again, the U.S. actually needs to see that training program before it can sign off on anything. So, everything at the moment is on hold, Sara.",
