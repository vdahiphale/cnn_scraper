Napster came before iTunes.But you needed Napster and that very cutting edge copyright infringing format for iTunes to come in and create a scheme, where we could all pay 99 cents for a song. And now we have a bunch of other digital music platforms. Here, I think it's similar in the sense that, whatever it is that emerges, this litigation will probably set rules. And \"The New York Times\" has been to the U.S. Supreme Court before over copyright. So it's possible this goes all the way up and we get very clear rules on the interplay between generative AI and copyright.",

Thunder was another impressive win, 119-93, the only team to beat the Nuggets twice in Denver this season. The 76ers and Rockets come down to the wire. Tyrese Maxey defends. Pat Beverly gets it is Marcus Warren, who hits the three plus the foul. Houston just devastated. That play put the game away. Will the Celtics ever lose a home game this season? They were hosting the raptors. Jaylen Brown making the big play. Put the Celtics up 2 with 32 seconds. And Boston, playing out Jayson Tatum, holds on to win. Celtics 16-0 at home this season. Will the Raptors will be tired after that loss? The Pistons certainly hope so. They are trying to avoid the worst losing streak in NBA history. They have lost 28 in a row.
