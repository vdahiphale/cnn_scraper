We will see you in just a couple of moments.But good evening everyone, I'm Abby Phillip, and we begin with that major breaking news exclusive and what is likely a key piece of evidence in the federal case against Donald Trump. CNN has now obtained an audio recording of the former president, in which he is heard discussing classified documents in the presence of others and apparently holding and referencing a secret Pentagon document that obtains plans to attack Iran. It is the tape that could be at the center of Special Counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump for allegedly mishandling classified information. And the recording was made almost exactly two years ago in July 2021 during a meeting at Trump's golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was taking part in an interview for people who are working on that memoir, of his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Now, listen in to what he said exactly on that tape. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: These are bad sick people.",

Now, during this time period, the former president was in the habit of having his aides report any conversations that he had with journalists, any members of the media, even if they were friendly or people working on a book.So, this is a meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club in July, 2021, and he was speaking with some folks working on an autobiography for former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Now, two of his aides were recording this. It's our understanding the audio biographers will also recording this. So, he knew he was being taped. And one of the things that just really surprised me here is that he knows he is being taped and it's such a casual conversation. There is laughing, right, juxtaposed with what appears to be a discussion of some incredibly sensitive national security information. That's really what struck me is this isn't him being like, come here, I've got something to show you, on a secret recording. I mean, this is very conversational, very collegial.

This is not a defense that they are using in the courtroom for Todd Blanche. We will see, of course, have beside to handle that. But, politically, this is how the campaign is handling it. And they say, quote, the audiotape provides context proving once again that President Trump did nothing wrong at all. They say that he is speaking rhetorically and quite humorously when he references Anthony Weiner there. And they have criticized the DOJ, the Justice Department. And then they added, and this was texted, additional from Trump, meaning the former president himself, as we have been saying from the moment President Trump rolled and the golden escalator, the president did nothing wrong. And so they are saying, essentially, it proves the defense. But I think if you are looking at it from the legal perspective and what the defense attorneys here are going to have to argue when they are in court in Miami, it is going to make it difficult for them. And our sources have acknowledged privately that when they found out about this audiotape, which they didn't know about until March, whenever Margo Martin, an aide to Trump, went into the grand jury, that is when they found out about it.

I'm bringing in former Trump White House Lawyer Jim Schultz and former Federal Prosecutor and National Security Lawyer Paul Rosenzweig. Thank you so much, both of you, gentlemen for joining us.

I means, it bolsters the government's claim under the Espionage Act.It also bolsters her claim under the obstruction case. Because, you know, one of the things he has been saying all along is that he can just wave a magic wand and these documents are declassified. And in this instance, in his own words, he's saying it is not declassified. So that is very troubling for him, no doubt about it. And, you know, I think the only matter -- you know, the big question is going to be what comes in at trial under the Classified Information Procedures Act. Is this all going to be admissible?

And, two, it demonstrates that he knows that he is retaining it. It's not like it was accidentally kept in a box where she was unaware. It was on his desk as he was being interviewed by the people who were doing the Meadows autobiography.So, he's giving them essentially, you know, nine-tenths of the proof of his criminality on the Espionage Act.

We have talked about the challenges of bringing this case in court, where most of the charges had to be brought.

One of the things that we have been hearing from people supportive of Donald Trump is that the tape is not going to be as explosive as people thought after looking at the indictment, that the tape was not necessarily as bad as it seemed. Trump himself told Fox News that he was not really holding a document, he was not showing something. It certainly sounds like it on the tape that he is showing people in the room some kind of a document. You can hear papers rustling and you could argue that papers could be anything, but they all seem to be, just, again, based on the reaction, looking at something.And it is interesting what they chose to put in the indictment versus not, because from that full audio you can see that there are certain pieces that aren't. But he is clearly -- at least appears to be clearly pointing to some kind of material and he appears to be trying to pressure the people who are writing Mark Meadows' book and working on it to include some of this.

When I was -- he said when he was president, he could declassify, now he can't.So, I think they're trying to show that he had awareness that, A, he didn't have the powers that he once did despite having claimed that he had declassified everything and that would suggest that he knew this document was not declassified and I think that they are trying to show that he knew exactly what he was doing.

Four, is Yevgeny Prigozhin's life now in danger after attempting an insurrection? And five, where specifically are these key players?Take a look at the split screen today.

Both Putin and Prigozhin speaking out publicly today, breaking their silence after this weekend insurrection that challenged the Russian leader's grip on power. Putin briefly addressing the Russian people, angrily denouncing this challenge to his government. Without using Prigozhin's name specifically, though, he accused the organizers of the insurrection of being traitors, and then he claimed that they would never have succeeded at the end of the day. But for his part, Prigozhin released an audio message claiming -- and for his part, Yevgeny Prigozhin released an audio message claiming that the brief insurrection was protest against the Russian defense ministry's handling of the Ukraine invasion and its dealings with the Wagner group, and not attempt to overthrow Putin's government. Tonight -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP CHIEF (through translator): Two factors played into my decision to turn around. First factor, we wanted to avoid a Russian bloodshed. Second is, we marched in demonstration of a protest not to overturn the power in the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It would be, look, Russia is one of the most important countries in the world. It spans 10 time zones. It's five and a half thousand miles. It would take you eight or nine hours to fly from one end of Russia to the other. It has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. It has a seat in the Security Council. It borders all kinds of sensitive areas, from the Middle East to China to Europe, of course. So, it would be a huge deal. The price of oil would skyrocket. The price of every commodity would skyrocket. The price of food would skyrocket. But let's be clear, that is not what happened. As you put it, we got a brief, a glimpse of what could happen.

They could have destroyed him on the, you know, just using air power.But what he did was not just challenge but assault the rationale for the war. And it's clearly an unpopular war in the sense that 200,000 Russians are dead or wounded in this war. It does not seem to excite the kind of nationalist fervor that Putin was hoping for. And what Prigozhin is doing is almost giving a license for people to say, look, the whole thing was started on false pretext. I think that is a big deal.

They take you to a secure offsite location, and they spend about six hours telling you all the ways you're going to go to jail if you do certain things.

MCKINNONmonth of June, there were not fewer candidates in the Republican primary. There were more, five more people that got into the race as they see the mounting legal troubles for Trump. They're going to, most of them, with the exception of Christie and a couple of others, are just going to stand by and wait to see if the weight of the legal troubles ultimately break him. Now, he may not go to trial before the election, but I think what they will wait to see is whether or not there's just enough weight of those legal cases that what happens is that perception begins to come through in polling or otherwise that he's just going to lose, that he's going to lose to Joe Biden in a general election.
