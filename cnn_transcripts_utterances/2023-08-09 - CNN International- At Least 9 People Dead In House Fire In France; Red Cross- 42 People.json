I'm Bianca Nobilo in London.Developing right now, a tragic morning in eastern France as nine people have died after a fire engulfed a vacation home. The blaze broke out early Wednesday morning in a town near the German border. 17 people were evacuated from the cottage, which officials say was completely destroyed. Two people are still missing and presumed dead. The vacation home had been hosting people with disabilities and their companions for the summer. Jim Bittermann joins us now from Paris with more on this tragic event. Jim, to hear that the cottage is completely destroyed, obviously, this was a very severe event. Do we understand what led up to it or the cause of this fire?",

But this was even outside the town and basically it was a place where these handicapped people were going to be given a bit of a summer break for a few weeks.As you mentioned, 17 had already gotten out of the barn when it was engulfed in flames by the time the fire brigades arrived. And there were 11 other people that were unaccounted for for a while. Nine have now been accounted for. They are dead and the other two are presumed dead and somewhere in the ashes. So a really tragic fire. They've set up a crisis cell for welcoming the families and to comforting them with some psychological help. The Prime Minister is on her way over there and should be arriving any moment now, and the President sent his condolences. So a real tragedy for the country this morning, Bianca.",

And the prosecutor in that region has been motivated to go ahead and start an investigation into the exact cause of this fire. It's certainly something that will be investigated. These people were, in fact, lightly handicapped, mentally handicapped, and so it could be that they didn't have enough means to figure out exactly how to get out of the burning building. But it apparently went up very, very quickly, according to the witnesses that were on the scene. Bianca?",

So we don't know if perhaps others are still at sea, but certainly I think we can say with certainty that 41 people are probably missing, at least as a result of the incident. Now, these four survivors, we understand three men and a woman, actually were some of the few on board who had life jackets. They were able to survive at sea for -- it appears, at least, a day or two because they found a capsized boat and held onto that until that boat, another ship, came by and picked them up, handed them over to the Italian Red Cross, who took them to Lampedusa and handed them over to the Red Cross. But as you said, this is becoming such a common occurrence in the Mediterranean. And what we've seen is, according to the Italian authorities, and we're just talking about Italy here, almost 94,000 migrants and refugees have reached Italy this year as of today, compared to on this day. Last year, the number was half that, and in the year before, it was a third the number who have arrived in Italy. So the numbers are increasing, and they're coming from places like Sub-Saharan Africa, from the Middle East, places like Egypt, which until recently was not a source of migrants, and as far away as Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Ben Wedeman, thank you very much for joining us.Now to Russia, where we're getting dramatic new images of an explosion at an industrial plant northeast of Moscow. Russian state media reports at least 45 people were injured and two of them were hospitalized. Russian media saying that it appears the blast was not caused by drones, they say, but came from a Pyrotechnics warehouse at the site and was a result of a violation of technological processes. Ukraine's president says that he talks strategy and next steps in a meeting with Ukraine's top military commanders. It comes after he acknowledged in a video message Tuesday that the counter offensive has been difficult and is happening probably slower than some had hoped. Kyiv is still claiming what it calls partial success on the southern front line. Meanwhile, in Russia, Moscow's mayor says that two combat drones were shot down over the city's suburbs overnight. CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is here to discuss this. Nic, Moscow acknowledging that two combat drones were shot down overnight. Then there's this huge, unexplained explosion quite close to Moscow, but they say it wasn't drone related. Do we suspect that we're getting the full truth from the Russian authorities?",

I wish we had more time because, of course, as you were explaining to me the wider context of this too, is Ukraine trying to expose chinks in the armor of Moscow, that everything isn't in fact OK, that the war isn't going to plan, and to provide any distraction that will enable them to make progress on the front lines. Thank you.A controversial decision by Israel's far-right finance minister is coming under harsh criticism. Bezalel Smotrich is freezing about $53 million earmarked for Arab municipalities and educational programs in East Jerusalem. He said the money could end up in the hands of criminal organizations. Knesset members Mansour Abbas, the head of the United Arab List, slammed the decision, calling Smotrich a, quote, \"racist minister\". Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now from Jerusalem. Elliot, is there any evidence at all to support what the finance minister has alleged, that this money could end up in the hands of criminals and terrorists?",

      "sentences": "Bianca, I mean, I guess it's quite speculative as to where the precise endpoint of the funds were likely to go. What I can say, of course, is that there are two main things here that Smotrich is referring to. First of all, there is a five-year program that was designed to help residents of East Jerusalem.And as part of that five-year program, there was a program to help to boost the Hebrew of residents of East Jerusalem, to enable them to study at Hebrew University. So that part of a broader five-year plan which is worth hundreds of millions of shekels, that is one of the bits that Smotrich has frozen. The other part was, I suppose, best described as a kind of leveling up strategy that is quite well established in Israel in order to help poorer municipalities bring them up to closer to the level of income of wealthier ones. And after doing all the sums, they worked out that Arab municipalities still had a long way to go to close the gap. So more funds were assigned to them. Those funds are also being frozen. Those are worth, as you say, just over $50 million per year. And that is also what Smotrich says he has frozen. Now, it's not a done deal just yet. The government could still overturn this. It could be challenged in courts and the like. And as you say, Smotrich has outlined a number of reasons why these funds are being frozen. One is, he says it's not fair that poorer Arab municipalities are getting more money, and money isn't going to poorer Jewish ones. He's saying also that, for example, that the money could end up in the hands of criminals or terrorist organizations. And I suppose it's also to play to his base in a way. I mean, he's not saying that, but clearly that is one of the understandings that this will play well with his base. And, as you say, Mansour Abbas, the leader of the Islamist Ra'am Party, who was in the last government, has said that Smotrich is doing this because he is, quote, a racist minister. Bianca?",

The scouts were being evacuated from the campsite ahead of an approaching tropical storm. The jamboree had already faced criticism due to the poor organization and high levels of illness. Rain and wind from tropical storm Khanun has hit southern parts of Japan and South Korea. You can see the waves here crashing on Jeju Island in South Korea. Strong winds have already hit the island, causing flights leaving the island to be delayed, and it's expected to hit Seoul on Thursday evening.

This is still at the core of it, a battle for control between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, this powerful paramilitary group that grew out of the Janjaweed militia.And so this conflict has kind of fallen out of the world attention, with Niger taking a lot of that attention. But it's nowhere near complete. So far, more than 4.2 million people have been displaced from their homes. 70 percent of them are just in Khartoum alone. So that means that one in 10 people in Sudan have had to leave their homes. Nearly 1 million have crossed over into neighboring countries like Egypt and Chad and South Sudan trying to get away from this conflict. That is not going anywhere away anytime soon. There have been lots of mediation efforts. There were efforts by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to hold talks in Jeddah to try and bring these warring factions together. It had mixed results. They agreed on some ceasefires that didn't last long. There's another attempt on August 25. The African Union and IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority, have brought these parties to another round of talks in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.
