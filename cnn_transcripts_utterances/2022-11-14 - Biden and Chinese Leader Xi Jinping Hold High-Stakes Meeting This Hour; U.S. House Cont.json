      "sentences": "No, not likely. And American officials have been fairly frank that they don't see any, quote unquote, deliverables coming out of these talks. They don't expect a joint statement that you sometimes see that would list areas of cooperation. But they do see they are expecting to go in this meeting for these two leaders to sit down, look at each other in the face, sort of define the parameters of this relationship. Define some of the red lines they each have going forward. And of course, Taiwan is the overriding issue that has caused so much tensions over the last several months.Now these two leaders both decided they wanted to talk to each other face to face back in July. And it was only a month after that the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan that caused furor in Beijing. China cut off channels of communication with the United States. But officials were still able to talk to set up this meeting. And this morning American officials describe those conversations as serious, constructive, they occurred over the ensuing two months or so, even up until last night when officials were still going over the agenda, talking about what President Biden wanted to emphasize, wanted to de-emphasize. And so, that will be sort of the setting in which these two leaders talked. Now remember, President Biden has said four times that the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily if China were to make a move on it. That has obviously caused intense anger in Beijing. President Xi has responded with a metaphor. He likes to use this metaphor. Basically, if you play with fire, you will get burned. And so, when you look at that rhetoric heading into this meeting, it really does show you how far relations have fallen. And it is telling that this meeting is taking place here in Bali, here at a neutral site. It wasn't that long ago that it was fairly common for a American president to visit Beijing, for a Chinese president come to the White House. I covered several of those meetings. Now it's almost unthinkable that that would be something that would happen as this relationship sours. And so, what White House officials say they want to do is, quote unquote, build a floor for this relationship. Essentially, ensure that it doesn't fall any further. And that will be President Biden's objective when he sits down with Xi later today.",

But in this midterm, we saw the Democratic Party have a net gain of gubernatorial seats, not lose any Senate seats -- and may in fact gain one -- and a net loss it looks like right now of less than House seat. The last time that happened in a midterm election, 1934.So how did Democrats pull this off? Well, despite high inflation, the issue of abortion was also on the minds of voters. In fact, a look at our exit polls show that about as many voters said that abortion was important to their vote as inflation. And those abortion first voters, they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And, of course, Joe Biden's popularity had sunk considerably over the course of his presidency. And indeed, our exit polls showed only about 41 percent of voters had a favorable view of Joe Biden. But when you also ask them whether or not they had a favorable view of Donald Trump, Trump's favorable rating was right around the same level. Indeed, there was a solid portion, just a little less than 20 percent of the electorate, that did not have a favorable view of either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And those voters, who you might have expected to go overwhelmingly for the Republicans because Joe Biden is the president of the United States, in fact, basically split their tickets fairly equally. Only slightly going for Republican candidates. Of course, it's not just about Biden and Trump. It's also the fact that there were a lot of candidates running for the United States Senate who in the minds of the voters were extreme. Indeed, in pretty much all of the key battleground Senate races, more voters said the Republican candidate was too extreme than said that the Democratic candidate was too extreme. Lastly in the governor's races, there were a lot of Republicans running who denied that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, which of course he did. All of those candidates who are running in either swing states or in blue states currently with GOP governors are either trailing or lost. The only one currently trailing who CNN has not been able to project as a loser yet is Kari Lake in the state of Arizona who right now is trailing. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Election officials in Maricopa have pushed back strongly, saying if anything, they are moving at a faster rate than they have in other elections.

It's actually remarkable that the numbers are not higher.As of this point right now, six people have been killed more than 80 wounded. Of those six, we know there was a married couple. There was a mother out with her 15-year-old daughter. There was a 9-year-old boy who was out with a male relative as well. All of them killed. The vast majority of the more than 80 people who were hospitalized have been released. There are still five, though, in intensive care right now.",
