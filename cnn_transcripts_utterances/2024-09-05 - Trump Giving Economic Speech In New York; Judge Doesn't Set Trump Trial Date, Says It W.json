      "sentences": "Well, I think what he alluding to is the fact that, of course, the economy was adding jobs when Biden came into office in 2021 because the COVID crisis was beginning to fade and eventually the pandemic ended. And so as the economy reopened, of course, jobs were going to be rapidly increasing.But, again, you know, Trump's critics would argue that the economy wouldn't have lost as many jobs if the COVID crisis, the health crisis itself had been better managed in the first place. So I think that's an important context on trade. So we do expect Trump to reaffirm his plans to impose sweeping tariffs. He's called for 10 percent to 20 percent tariffs on all $3 trillion of U.S. imports, 60 percent tariffs on China. I've got to tell you, I've been talking to economists for years about policy ideas, and I'm not sure I've ever heard as much across the board concern about a policy idea as I've heard about the Trump tariffs. That's not to say that he isn't trying to address legitimate concerns, right? We hear from Republicans, we hear from Democrats, we hear from CEOs and others that China is not playing fair on trade and that something has to be done. But the question is whether or not this fix would actually do more harm than good because a lot of the mainstream economists I talk to, they warn that massive tariffs like this, they would kill jobs. It would actually make inflation worse. It could cause a global trade war. I talked to J.P. Morgan's David Kelly, and he told me that this is one of those magical economic proposals that can actually cause inflation and put you into a recession at the same time, right? So to be clear, you don't want either of those things to happen. And the fear is that both of them could happen. I talked to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former McCain and George H. W. Bush adviser, and he told me that this tariff plan is just terrible economic policy. And there's some research out there from the Peterson Institute that warns that everyday Americans are going to pay the price that the typical middle income would have to pay 2,600 more a year because of the Trump tariffs. And notably, Dana, this does not even factor in the almost definite retaliation we'd have as other countries respond to those Trump tariffs. So there's a lot to break down and to understand about what the real world implications are from some of these policy proposals.",

President Trump, the former president, candidate to be president again, is now talking about the plans for his economic policies if he were to win again. Let's listen in for a couple minutes.DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's massive. For the same service that you have right now, trillions of dollars is wasted and gone and nobody knows where it went. Further taming inflation and bringing prices way down. The fifth pillar of my plan is to make the Trump tax cuts permanent. They are massive tax cuts, biggest ever, permanent and to cut taxes even more. And we will have no tax on tips, something which they copied four weeks after I said it. She got up and said, no tax on tips. I said I just said that. She is actually copying a lot of my plan. In fact, we're going to send her a maggot (ph) sometime in the next week. We're having a special one day. (APPLAUSE)",

In fact, you will pay a very substantial tariff when a product comes in from another country, that's made in another country and comes in. There'll be a big tariff on that product because we want to make our goods in America, and most of them we can.My message is simple, make your product here in America. And only in America, we are not going to be taken advantage of anymore just as we made great inroads and progress four years ago. We made tremendous inroads on this subject. We're not going to watch our wealth and jobs get ripped away from us and sent to foreign countries, which is what's been happening for many, many decades with us. China was built on doing exactly what we're going to be doing and what I started doing four years ago. What we're putting forward is the most pro-American manufacturing and jobs policy in modern history for any country. This plan will bring jobs and growth into our country at levels never seen before. Every business on earth will flock to America from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and all over the world. By contrast, comrade Kamala Harris wants to sacrifice our wealth, kill the economy, and drive jobs overseas to punish businesses more. Businesses will leave. They'll leave America. They're international companies. They report to their shareholders. And they will leave America if her plan, even in a small form, comes to the fore. Her tax plan, which includes the promise to end the Trump tax cuts, which again, by itself, would be a massive tax increase, would increase taxes by over $5 trillion, a record many times over. It would result in the largest small business tax hike in history, massively raising taxes on 25 million small business people and raising small business tax rates to 43 percent and higher. In other words, 20 percent higher than communist China. Kamala is also vowing to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. We're bringing it down to 15 percent. But she really is looking to raise it to 40 percent, 45 percent, or even 50 percent. You know that. All you have to do is follow her past path. Radically raise the capital gains tax rate, which she wants to do, and they don't even want to give a number. And for the first time ever imposed a 25 percent tax on unrealized capital gains. So, if you happen to have a lot of wealth, but no cash, you're a lot of trouble. This will lead America into a 1929 depression. And it will be a depression and a territory that we have not seen for a long time. There's a gentleman that happens to believe that, Scott. These policies, especially the tax on unrealized capital gains would decimate the U.S. economy, companies, and innovation would flee from America to other countries. Venture capital markets would disappear, the stock market would be annihilated, and investors assess the tax liabilities of large --",
