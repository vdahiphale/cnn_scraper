      "sentences": "This morning as President-elect Trump condemns current immigration policies and vows to enact mass deportations as soon as he takes office a new report is showing the Biden administration actually deported the most immigrants in nearly a decade. Many of the more than 270,000 removals were of people who illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now with more details. What does this report mean, and what does it say to the incoming administration?",

      "sentences": "Well, one of the takeaways of this report that the incoming administration is likely going to lean on is that it mentions the in-country negotiations that the Biden administration was involved in to get some countries to accept more removal flights, which helped them bolster their deportation numbers.But it also serves as a reminder that there are limited resources and personnel at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, including, for example, around 6,000 immigration enforcement officers. Now, Sara, to sort of look through this number. You said the topline -- 271,484 removals -- the highest level since 2014. Now many of those were recent border crossers and that is a reflection of what the Biden administration has had to grapple with over recent years, which was multiple border surges and, as a result, multiple border crossings. Now these numbers also show that the administration prioritized national security and public safety threats not only in their removals but also in their arrests in the interior. Now this might sound familiar because we have heard multiple times from Trump aides that they too want to prioritize on those threats. And we see in these numbers that is what the Biden administration was doing over the last year. Then, too, there are where we were removing people to. Dozens of countries again reflecting record migration across the globe but also the top countries were Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. So certainly, all of this is going to be telling for the incoming administration because they do want to up the numbers even more, according to what they have said publicly. But they are going to need money. That is something that Tom Homan, the president-elect's border czar, said on CNN earlier this week. And in a statement the acting ICE director said this. He said that they are \"chronically underfunded.\" So that tells you almost everything you need to know about the coming weeks and months, which is that the incoming administration is going to have to find the money if they want to hit numbers higher than this 271,000 that was done under the Biden administration. I'll give you one more data point, Sara. Under the Trump administration the highest number of deportations in a year was just under this 271,000. So certainly they would still have much to do if they want to go higher than that in the years to come.",

Congressman, you have seen a few government shutdowns or the race to -- the race to in front of government shutdowns in your time in Congress. Where do things stand this morning? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY) (via Webex by Cisco):  I think that the Republicans have to get their back together. It seems as though the Republican members of the House have conceded their responsibilities to the co-presidents, Trump and Musk, and we don't have a separate legislative branch. There was an agreement that was made and that's what the American people wanted. They wanted Democrats and Republicans to sit down and work this thing out. We did just that. We hammered it out for a long period of time and came up to an agreement only to have at the last moment co-president Musk start tweeting, then followed thereafter the president-elect -- I guess he's following Musk now -- saying that kill the deal. And I would have thought that Speaker Johnson -- he had been down to Mar-a-Lago and a number of other places, and he had talked to Mr. Trump. And so therefore I would believe that he would have talked to him about the deal and Trump did not say anything about it negatively. But his co-president then came in after because he didn't like the deal and overruled Trump. And then Trump joined him so that they would now tell or dictate to the members of the House don't pass this bill.

In the state you can go from a first-degree, to a second- degree, to manslaughter. In the feds it's just murder or no murder.

And then a lot of that snowfall is moving towards the Ohio River Valley and eventually will reach the East Coast in a weakened state. But a very tricky forecast as well. So heads up. Check your flight before you head out today. Maybe you're getting an early start to the holiday week next week and getting out to the family or friends' house. And guess what? It's not only the airports that will be impacted but also the roadways with this clipper moving through. Look at how the snow is dropping the visibility in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In Fort Wayne, Indiana there have been some snowy road conditions, which you can see in Milwaukee right now because of this system that moved through. We have winter weather alerts that are in place across the Great Lakes. Nothing, so far, along the East Coast -- the major I-95 corridor. But we're going to keep a close eye on this because this type of a weather pattern and the energy associated with it could have some tricks up its sleeve. Let me explain. As this thing kind of evolves there's this narrow corridor of snow that could form right along the eastern periphery right here -- basically, the I-95 corridor, eastern Long Island into Cape Cod, Nantucket. Boston may or may not get a couple of inches of snow out of this. I don't want to sound nebulous. Like, we don't know exactly how it's going to un-shape -- or unfold. But this is something that's going to really require a lot of hyperlocal weather forecasts. So we're going to see that rain-snow line right there near Boston. And you can see the influence with the ocean waters. It could cause this to fall in the form of rain at first before transitioning to all cold. And some of the coldest air of the season will settle in behind this system. Today's daytime highs 36 for Chicago, and New York at 38. We cool off from there for the weekend.
