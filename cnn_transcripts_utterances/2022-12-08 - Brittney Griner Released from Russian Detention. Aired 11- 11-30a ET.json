Not included in the exchange, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. He remains left behind in Russia. CNN just spoke to him from behind bars and we'll bring that to you in moments. We'll also get a live interview with the White House about all of this at this hour. Now before that, let find out what led up to this big moment. Kylie Atwood is at State Department.

      "sentences": "Months in the marking. We reported over the summer that the Biden administration had put a deal on the table with Russia to try and get out both Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. That isn't the deal that came to fruition today. Of course, the WhiteHouse and Cherelle Griner, who is Brittney Griner's wife, welcoming the news that Brittney Griner is coming home after serving in Russian prison for about 10 months, with Cherelle saying their family is whole again today. But not all families are whole today because Paul Whelan, who has been detained in Russia for about four years now, was not part of this swap. And President Biden essentially said from the White House today that it wasn't a choice. This was the only deal that the United States could pull off. And we spoke with a senior administration official this afternoon and -- excuse me -- this morning and briefing reporters, who said this is the only deal that Russia was willing to make at this point. And it is clear that Russia is treating Paul Whelan, who is charged with espionage, which are charges that he vehemently denies, differently than Brittney Griner. And that is of major concern for Paul Whelan's family. Of course, they so graciously welcomed the fact that Brittney Griner was released today, saying that was the right move for the Biden administration but also raising questions as to how Paul Whelan is going to get home, because they don't know what the U.S. could put on the table that Russia actually wants right now. This prisoner swap included Viktor Bout, that convicted arms trafficker. And he's the person that Russia really wanted. There is reason to believe that the channel of communication between U.S. and Russia will remain open. But we'll have to wait and see how that turns out. Kate.",

And the Russians saying today they do not leave their citizens behind and we've been looking at Russian state TV over the past couple of hours. And you've had Viktor Bout's Russian lawyer calling this a miracle and his mother has been on Russian state TV, thanking Vladimir Putin and thanking Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, as well. So the Russians celebrating this as a win and talking about just how important Viktor Bout is to them. And it really was a protracted process that went on because it was a month ago -- months ago that the United States came out and said that they had put what they called substantial offer on the table for Brittney Griner. It was clear that that would be for Brittney Griner with Viktor Bout. And the Russians were irate about that. And said all of this needed to happen behind closed doors. And then just a couple of days ago they said there won't be any more negotiations until the end of the year. And now this deal has come through and the Russians certainly, from what we could see in Russian public, making a big deal out of this and celebrating it as a win for Vladimir Putin and for the Kremlin, Kate.",

I appreciate it.Joining me now from the White House is John Kirby, the spokesperson for the National Security Council. John, this is a very important day. And it is, as the president said, a day of mixed emotions for so many people. You heard Paul Whelan, speaking to my colleague, Jennifer Hansler, from the State Department, saying that he knows that his case has been considered a higher level or considered differently or separately than others like Brittney's. Biden spoke to this today, saying it's for totally illegitimate reasons. What are the reasons? ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET.), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Well, I don't want to get into too much detail here, with you, Kate. But it has to do with the nature of the sham charges against him, based on espionage. That is the hook that the Russians seem to have in him. And we're just not able to -- to deal with him the same way that we were able to deal with Mr. Reed or, in this case, Ms. Griner. But that doesn't mean we're going to stop trying. That interview that just aired, I think demonstrates what a remarkable individual Mr. Whelan is. The stoicism and the courage that he continues to display is not something lost on us here. And I can tell you, we worked very hard to get Mr. Whelan home. It was always the goal to get both of them home and we just couldn't make it work. This is the deal that we could get and now was the moment we could get it. And it was either get one American home or get none.

I can't emphasize how different that is from how these things are typically handled. Part of it is because Brittney Griner is a famous person. That is very true.
