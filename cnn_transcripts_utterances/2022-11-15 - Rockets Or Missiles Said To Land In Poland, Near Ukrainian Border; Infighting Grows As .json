      "sentences": "Well, Victor and Alisyn, just in the last hour or so, we've had confirmation from Polish authorities of a very, very dramatic and potentially inflammatory moment in history really, which is that two projectiles of some kind rockets, missiles, we don't know exactly what. We also critically don't know who fired them, but we do know that they landed in Polish territory, very close to the border with Ukraine in farmland hitting a grain store and reportedly killing two Polish citizens or residents. Now, this is a very dramatic potential escalation, obviously, because Poland is a NATO country.There were ongoing cruise missile attacks being carried out in the west of Ukraine close to Poland's border at the time that these projectiles landed on Polish territory. It is conceivable that they are Russian missiles. It's equally conceivable at this stage that they could be the spent rockets of anti-aircraft missiles fired by Ukrainians. So, that is somewhat less likely on a technical level. But this is all automatically effectively triggered a meeting of the equivalent of the National Security Council inside the Polish Government who are meeting now to decide how to react and what to say to this dramatic moment. There is the worst case scenario from many people's perspective, a chance that the Poles might be inclined to apply to NATO for all for one and one for all type support on a military level in this in terms of wanting to go for retaliation. I think that's extremely unlikely. But this is and will be seen as a very dramatic escalation, a spreading of the war outside of the borders of Russia and Ukraine, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: Sam, how long will it take for them to figure out where the missiles came from?",

We're not exactly sure what the detonations are, whether it's incoming or outgoing missiles, two missile -- two residential buildings were hit in Kyiv with at least two people killed there in Kharkiv. Very, very bad effects on the electrical supply system around the whole nation that according to the government, they're saying that 7 million Ukrainians are now without electricity as a result of this latest several series of salvos of cruise missiles, and quite probably the long range-drones supplied by Iran to Russia.Again, this is the second devastating attack on the critical national infrastructure, particularly in the electrical infrastructure of Ukraine since the beginning of October and indeed, this one, according to President Zelenskyy was on a scale that exceeded the last one back at the beginning of October.",

      "sentences": "Well, significant international implications, Alisyn and Victor. And of course, the big question right now is a question over Article Five, as Sam was just describing it as an all-for-one, one for all, of course, as you know well when NATO is attacked. The fundamental basis of the NATO charter is that when one nation in NATO is attacked that the others will come to its aid in a military conflict. So, the biggest question that is going to be tried to answer now is the question of intent.We do know, of course, that Russia was intending to strike Ukraine today in a very significant way, scores of missiles raining down all across Ukraine from the east coast -- from the eastern side of the country, where of course, so much of the fighting is happening all the way to Lviv in the West, which has been relatively quiet. Relatively, I should say, since the start of the conflict. There have been some attacks around Lviv, there have been strikes on military installations, there have been strikes on civilian and energy infrastructure but for the most part, the western side of Ukraine has been relatively spared in this conflict. So, the question now, did Russia go too far, and did they make a mistake? Did they overshoot what they intended to with those missiles landing in Poland, or did they actually intend to strike Poland? That is less likely and you would have to hope that in this moment that Russia is trying to make assurances to Poland and to the rest of NATO that that was not their intent. We do not know that for now. We are certainly making a lot of calls right now to our sources at the White House, at the Pentagon, in the intelligence community to try to figure out what that intent by Russia was. But President Joe Biden has made it clear and he has said repeatedly since the beginning of this war that the U.S. and the rest of the countries in NATO would come to the aid of NATO countries would -- if they were to be attacked. Take a listen to this from President Biden in just in September, just a couple of weeks ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, it is really a question of whether Article Five, is part of that conversation and whether the Russians are making any kind of assurances right now that this was indeed a mistake, Alisyn, and Victor.",

Again, I think that's what we heard. And if the control room can tell you exactly what he said, that'll be good. But it does seem to be an amount of confusion right now. And you can imagine why. This is, you know, a sort of a nightmare scenario because of all the red lines that NATO leaders, including the United States, clearly the president and NATO Secretary General and all the NATO countries surrounding there have made it very clear that if \"one square inch of a NATO country is attacked, then that will invoke Article Five, and that will invoke a response from all 30 NATO nations.\" That's what Article Five means. So, we really do have to wait and see exactly what it was.And I would assume that there's a lot of phone calling, there's a lot of hotlines that are being tapped right now. We know that there's a national security meeting called by the Poles themselves. They will be discussing. They are right, as we know, bang up against this war. They provide the conduit for NATO weapons and help to Ukraine and they're -- and they're right there. So, if Russia is busy sending salvos of dozens and dozens of missiles -- I mean, it did almost seem a matter of time where one of these would go either astray or in the waste -- worst case scenario would be deliberately targeted at a potential weapons transport hub in one of those countries. That is what Russia has threatened in the past. In fact, Sergey Lavrov himself threatened it not so long ago. Lavrov himself has been with President Biden and all the G20 leaders in Indonesia. I'm afraid I don't know that state of play right now, whether they're all there together. But presumably, he can give some answers if he's -- if he's still there. The other thing to note is that you know, internally inside Russia, there has been a lot of division between the Kremlin, between the military, between the bloggers, who have a huge impact, between people there who have said that Russia has not taken the war hard enough to Ukraine yet, and sort of goading Putin, goading the military into taking further stands. So, who does one call right now? Presumably, obviously, we know that the CIA director Bill Burns has recently been in touch and face to face meeting with his Russian counterpart in Turkey to talk precisely about this kind of escalation on wishing or otherwise on many fronts, we understand, according to reports over the weekend. So, he is the last one who we know has had this very close contact with a very important Russian official, maybe we'll get some answers from there. President Biden, as I said, has been in Indonesia in the same meetings as the Russian Foreign Minister. Maybe there are answers to be gotten there. But at the moment, it is -- it is something that we're waiting to see how we can confirm and what exactly was Russia's intent. It's being said that these -- it's being blamed on Russia. We'll wait to see exactly what transpires.",

In order to get -- become the Speaker of the House in January, he will need 218 votes to become speaker. 31 members at this conference voted instead for Andy Biggs. He's the conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus, someone who tried to challenge McCarthy knowing full well he did not have the votes to be nominated to become a speaker but wanted to demonstrate that McCarthy did not have the 218 votes here to try to force concessions, try to get -- for McCarthy as they try to negotiate as McCarthy tries to push ahead and lock down the votes he needs in January to become -- ultimately become Speaker of the House assuming Republicans regain control of the House.Now, it is not unusual for a speaker nominee to be under 218 votes. In fact, Nancy Pelosi in 2018 when she was nominated by Democrats to be the speaker, she got 203 votes in that race, Paul Ryan, the Republican in 2015 got 200 votes in his race, and in this race, Kevin McCarthy, 188. So, he still has work cut out for him ultimately to get the speaker's gavel. But at the moment, he got what he needed, which is half the Republican conference to get that nomination.
