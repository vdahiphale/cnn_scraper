And I hope that Biden's administration will do this now, not waiting for January. And I ask them to do this now, together with this permission. That can be really important. Also, we hear that maybe this permission will be only for Kursk region, where North Korean troops are now. I think it's not right, because it's again Ukraine inside some very strict red lines.

And we are using Western weaponry for almost three years already.So all these red lines are absolutely artificial. World War III is happening. The only one question is, will it be a full-scale World War like it was World War II? Or we can stop it in the beginning by stopping Russia in Ukraine. Because if Russia will be in any way successful in Ukraine, not just Russia, we should say no, Russia, Iran, North Korea at least, maybe China also, they will move forward.

Now also it's time for President Biden to put all the decisions on sanctions on the basis of another legislation in the United States, which will need the permission of Congress to backpedal it, if Donald Trump will decide this. But at least it will be also needed permission of Congress. And President Biden still has two months to do such steps. And I hope they will do this and many others. Speaking about Donald Trump and his coming and what is his plan. We don't know. We are ready to listen. We are eager to listen. No one in the world wants this war to end more than Ukrainians. Because every day we are dying. Every day we are suffering. So we want this war to end. And if Donald Trump will help us to do this in a fair way, we would be the happiest people in the world.

We heard from one analyst from a think tank who suggested this is a time for China to really show its commitment to peace and development. And we've already seen it. It was just last week that a massive port, a mega port, was unveiled in Peru. $1.3 billion of that was funded because of the Chinese government.
