As China sees it right now, this investigation is over and they're fine with an inconclusive result. But it's interesting, as you point out, the majority of the U.S. intel community still believes that this is likely a natural origin, jumping from animals to humans, and/or that there's just not enough evidence.But from the Chinese state media perspective, they're looking at this as the U.S. trying to gather as much as possible. They even link it to the surveillance balloon. They link it to the suggestion the China may be providing Russia arms when it comes to the invasion of Ukraine. And they're saying this is just the U.S. doing yet another thing to potentially smear China. And they've politicized the whole issue at this point.",

He's expected to address last year's operational activities and lay out his priorities for the coming year. Obviously, the west and European allies are going to be listening closely. All of this is coming amid Putin's effort to frame his war in Ukraine as some kind of defensive strategy. Obviously, it is not. He may also address his plans, though, for a spring offensive. Something that we've seen officials say they do expect to happen.All of this is coming as Putin and really the entire Russian government was not invited to this month's Munich Security Conference because his war was dominating discussions so they did not feel it was appropriate to invite them for obvious reasons. It remains to be seen whether or not the dialogue will Putin is going to be possible at next year's conference given he has signaled no end in sight to his war in Ukraine.",

The 44-year-old governor is inching toward a White House campaign and expanding his political coalition, meeting privately with donors and is starting a book tour in Florida today. He's got stops in Texas and California and beyond. He's got several stops in key presidential states. He's also using the levers of his office, signing a bill yesterday that gives him control of Walt Disney world's formerly self-governing district, effectively punishing the entertainment giant as they've been speaking out against his agenda.CNN's Jeff Zeleny has been covering all of this and joins us now. Jeff, we've heard Governor DeSantis talk about, you know, the Florida blueprint and this way to revive America. He's very clearly using this time and using his office now to pave the way for what his presidential run might look like.",

He's talking about people coming to Florida. So certainly this is only half of the story. And Republican primary voters will get the other chance to rebut this, of course.But, interestingly, he is set to announce, we're told, not until after the Florida legislative session in May or early June, but he does want to have an imprint on the race right now.

As you prepare your morning cup of coffee or tea, there is a serious new health concern about a popular 0-calorie sweetener. It's called Erythritol. According to a new study, it has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, even death. Doctors say it's an ingredient in some popular sweeteners and a range of foods, especially keto diet products. But it's hard to identify specific drinks or foods that contain. That's because, according to the study, there is no rule requiring the sweetener to be named on a product's label.Why as that? What's going on with this? Let's discuss now, physician and assistant professor of health policy at Weil Cornell Medical - Medicine, I should say. That's where I go to the doctor. Dr. Dhruv Khullar. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. He's also a contributor to \"The New Yorker.\" I appreciate you joining us. So, good morning. DR. DHRUV KHULLAR, PHYSICIAN AND ASST. PROF.

That's in part because it looks like sugar, it tastes like sugar, but it doesn't have any of the calories and it doesn't affect our blood glucose levels. And so a lot of people with medical conditions, like diabetes, tend to use it.But this new study shows that people with higher levels of Erythritol in their blood, they had much higher risk of stroke, heart attack and other cardiac problems. And so there's a real concern here. They think that the mechanism might be that it activates our platelets and so it kind of causes our blood to clot and that can cause all sorts of downstream problems.",

I mean these things can help us scale treatment. So before everyone needed a one-on-one therapist and this is a way that we can automate some of that.But these AI algorithms, they can also look through our medical records, they can look through our social media use, our sleep habits and put all of these things together and give us a real view of our own personal mental health.
