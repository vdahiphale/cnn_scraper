She's also not, like David Pecker is, a tabloid king, or like Keith Davidson, someone who's involved in what may or may not be extortion of celebrities as a career. So, the jurors are really listening to everything she has to say. And even though she doesn't recall some of the meetings that other people have testified to, like David Pecker testified, she was in and out of that critical 2015 meeting. She says she doesn't necessarily remember that. She certainly remembers that the impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape on the campaign. That's something she's talked a lot about, as we're inching closer and closer to Election Day. So this has been, I think, the most significant testimony so far.

It speaks to the enormous pressure on then-candidate Trump to suppress any other stories, particularly about illicit behavior towards women, which incentivizes them, right, to try to pay Stormy Daniels to go away, also incentivizes Stormy Daniels to push for money. But that's why the tape is so critical, because prosecutors are going to say, look at what the campaign was facing. Clearly, the money that was paid to Stormy Daniels, it wasn't just about his family, if it was about his family at all. This was to give him some glimmer of hope for taking the White House.",

And it was a very human moment when she got to the microphone and she said: \"I'm really nervous.\" I mean, imagine, you have this estranged former boss, someone you were very close to. She also hasn't looked at him, which I think it also speaks to just how difficult this is for her. But I think it's really -- it's very telling, right, of how difficult this is for most people to be involved in a case like this. Clearly, Keith Davidson made a career of it. So did David Pecker.

They were in damage control mode.They were terrified about what this would do to the campaign. And what this does is, it sets up prosecutors to argue, when the Stormy Daniels accusation surfaced right after that, the campaign, Donald Trump, had every reason to want to silence her because of the campaign. Hope Hicks, it strikes me as a very credible witness. She doesn't have a bias for or against Donald Trump. It seems like both sides see her as a truth-teller, but what both sides are going to try to do is pull out pieces of her testimony that are favorable. So, to me, a strong witness for the prosecution, but also not the whole ball game. There's much more to the crime that they're going to have to prove through other sources.

The actions I took in Congress were consistent with the actions of many of my colleagues and in the interest of the American people.\" Now, he goes on to say that he proactively sought advice from the House Ethics Committee here on Capitol Hill, as well as a national law firm.

The answer under the law is, it doesn't have to be 100 percent. Prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a substantial motivating factor was the campaign. And I think -- if I can editorialize or give a subjective view, I think prosecutors have made that part of the case almost beyond any question. How could the campaign in October of 2016 not have been a substantial factor in why they wanted to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?",

You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out. And they were trying to figure out how to deal with it. And then the notion that she's calling Michael Cohen, who earlier she said she wasn't sure what his role was and he didn't have any role in the campaign, he was a reflexive phone call, because she knew, if anyone knew about these things, it would be Michael Cohen.",
