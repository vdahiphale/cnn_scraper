I can tell you the top of that building was much taller on this right-hand side. We watched that burn down this morning. The gusts of wind are hurricane strength. It's really like, it's weird. It's like covering a hurricane, but instead of being caught in the rain, you're surrounded by sand, dust and fire, like it's just a bizarre combination of things. We watched that part burn down as the wind gusts brought up the flames really strongly, and now something is burning back between these two buildings. I've seen how law enforcement is now blocking off the road. We've seen firefighters rush up there as well to get up there. And it is getting more and more smoky out here. We've watched a building to the left. You can see just a tiny ember of it that's left. That was an entire building when we got here that is pretty much all burned down. And it's not just here. There's another fire that is burning, the Eaton fire, that is on the other side of Los Angeles. So, if you look and you think, I'm standing out here by the Pacific Ocean Los Angeles, up here in the foothills, there's another fire, the Eaton fire, that is up by Pasadena and Altadena. There are evacuations happening now because of these winds spreading fire. This is something that is unprecedented. This strength of wind combined with the fact that everything is so dry, this is the driest start to a wet season in LA County, on record. On record the fact that we're dealing with these massive blazes in January is just crazy. That's not something we do here, like you expect to have this maybe even going into December now. But this is just, this is just something we haven't dealt with. On top of it, the Pacific Palisades. It's a beautiful place to live. You have great views of the ocean. You've got the canyons, lots of nature, but you also have very small, tight, windy roads that make it very difficult for people to evacuate. So, people were running out of their cars yesterday. LA fire having to go in and bulldoze cars out of the way so that they could get in there. All of this now shutting down schools across the area, LA County Fire. You can see the wind in front of those lights. You see how quickly it's moving? How smoky it is? LA County Fire, asking people, their employees, if they are off, to come back into work early, because this is an all-hands-on deck type response that is needed. This is something we have not seen here, like this. And I have to tell you, Becky driving here, I've never had an experience like that, and I've covered a lot of wildfires, but this was one of the most treacherous drives that I had to make to get to where I am right now.",

For many, manyyears, Panamanians felt it was deeply unfair that, essentially, gunboat diplomacy over 100 years ago, had forced them to give up this strip that cut through right through the middle of their country, this important economic lifeline, which is the Panama Canal. And we should point out that many people think the Panama Canal, of course, was built 100 years ago to sort of this relic of the U.S. Monroe Doctrine, but the Panama Canal has been expanded just nine years ago to the which was done by Panama. So, it's not quite that simple that the Panama Canal was something the U.S. built and then gave back under pressure because it became such an eyesore and a proof of kind of this ugly American attitude around the region where the U.S. took what it wanted. Panama Canal is not run by China. That's just false. It is run by Panama, and has been run quite successfully by Panama over the years. There's much more traffic that goes through the Panama Canal, despite the challenges of global warming of droughts in recent years, the Panama Canal makes a lot of money for Panama, but also is very important about six -- 5 or 6 percent of all maritime traffic goes through the Panama Canal. So, you know, Donald Trump thinks that by threatening Panama, that somehow that is going to help the price of goods in the U.S. go down. He's quite mistaken. Will probably have the exact opposite effect. And Panamanians, who consider themselves allies of the U.S. stable democracy. Now, you know, ever since Manuel Noriega was forced from Panama, are really kind of confused by the saber rattling. They were just considered to be bluster or crazy talk, if we're not coming from the next president of United States.",

Whatis clear, though is that both the Biden Administration and the incoming Trump Administration are both clearly rowing in the same direction, pushing for a hostage and cease fire deal to be reached before Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. And that's why we saw today, Steve Witkoff, President-elect Trump's incoming Special Envoy for the Middle East is set to arrive in Doha, Qatar, to join the -- you know, the U.S. delegation that is already there, led by -- currently led by Brett McGurk, President Biden's top adviser on Middle East affairs. We've been told that Witkoff and any other incoming Trump Administration officials aren't directly participating in the negotiations in the room, but that they're there to kind of present a united front. And we know that Witkoff has been having meetings and conversations with some of the other mediators, the other countries involved in these negotiations. Witkoff said that he has seen some, quote, really great progress in recent weeks, giving him a sense of optimism that a deal can be reached before Trump comes into office. We have heard, you know, a little bit more caution from Israeli officials over here, where I am, and also from Biden Administration officials, who acknowledge that the conversations around reaching a cease fire still do indeed remain very difficult. And so, you know this is hard to tell whether or not a deal can actually be reached before. But you did hear in that clip, you played that warning from the president-elect that all hell will break out in the Middle East, that it will be especially bad for Hamas if a hostage deal is not reached before he comes into office.

Thebig question, of course, for Europeans, given their security architecture, will be Ukraine. There is some hint of hope, though, that things will not be as stark as they'd imagined when Donald Trump won the election with his pronouncements that everything could be resolved within 24 hours. And they we had that 47-minute meeting, Becky, at the time when Notre Dame was reopened, between Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, President Zelenskyy. And what we've heard from sources at the Elysee about that is that essentially, Emmanuel Macron tried to say to Don Trump, of course, we understand that you want peace in Ukraine. You want this war to be finished, but let's be strong about it. Let's be clever about it. And it's the explained the importance of keeping all one's cards close to one's chest and all one's cards in one hand, including the strength of NATO, even as one went into a negotiation in order not to look weak. Really trying to speak to Donald Trump in language that he might understand about the need to look strong, faced with Vladimir Putin as and when those negotiations begin. So already, European leaders really adopting a different strategy in their dealings with the incoming administration, with expectations that things will be different, but I think some hope that they will manage to work together on those key issues, Becky.",

It was suchchaos last time, as far as Europeans were concerned, in the first Trump Administration, that things perhaps could only get better. But obviously you could argue things could get worse. So, some cautious optimism. It seems at this point, good to have you as ever. Thank you. Well, more to come on the top story today, the very latest from the U.S. West Coast, as strong winds drive fierce fires across Southern California. More on that is after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN K. RICE, PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS: As a firefighter, you never feel hopeless. You might feel like you're really behind the eight ball. And if there's one thing that we need that we're never going to have, we need to be able to control the weather, and we can't. And right now, the firefighters on the line, these men and women, are going to put in 24, 36, 40, 48-hour shift. They're not going off the fire line anytime soon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
