And her final line to the jury is this very question you said, what will it take Donald Trump to stop doing this? She said he doesn't care about the truth. But he does care about money. So asking the jury to hit him where it hurts, which is his pocketbook.This of course, though, coming after an already adventurous morning, where Trump's team was late into the courtroom that had already irritated the judge. And then they were fighting before the jury entered about what evidence could be shown on a slide. And Carroll's lawyer saying that they wanted to use something that wasn't even in evidence. Now Trump's attorney then trying to re argue the point with the judge. He told Alina Habba, you are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup, now sit down. And that's when the closing arguments got underway. Trump in the courtroom sitting at the defense table while E. Jean Carroll's attorney began addressing the jury telling them that it has already been established that Trump has sexually assaulted Carroll, and that he defamed her. The job for them is to determine how much he should have to pay. And she started telling them, she said this trial is about whether the rules that apply to me and to you, apply to Donald Trump. And she said the case is about punishing Trump for what he's done and continues to do saying that he hasn't even respected the previous jury's verdict because within 24 hours, he was on CNN repeating at that town hall the same defamatory statements that the jury had just ordered him to pay $5 million for Carroll. At that point is when Donald Trump just stood up from the defense table, turned and walked out of the courtroom with his secret service detail following him. It was a surprising moment. And the judge even stopped interrupting Carroll's lawyer telling the court reporter who keeps a record of the whole case to note that Donald Trump just stood up and left the room. Carroll's attorney then continued on with her closing statement. Now telling the jury how much does this cost Carroll emotionally, losing her career saying it took her five years to build it. And Donald Trump shattered it just within 24 hours. Also saying that Donald Trump had some gall to say that Carroll even benefited becoming -- because she became more famous after she went public with her allegations that he raped her in the 90s in a New York department store. She said that he had gall to do that and asking the jury to award him a big -- to reward Carroll a large amount of money to compensate her for what he's done, and to try to make them stop repeating these statements.

It is mind boggling. It just doesn't happen. And of course, it just drips with contempt for the whole process, for the plaintiff, for the jury. It's almost calculated.

Well, we heard about the allegations earlier from UNRWA itself, which had said that it had been given evidence by the Israelis that several of its staffers had been involved in the October 7th massacre, of course, the deadliest day in Israeli history.The Commissioner General of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, he said he took immediate action after receiving what he called shocking allegations to immediately terminate the contract of these UNRWA staffers who are accused of participating in the October 7th attacks and not -- very quickly after Lazzarini made those statements, the State Department came out with its own statement saying that the U.S. will now hold what they're calling additional funding temporarily pausing additional funding for UNRWA as this is investigated. Kate to your point, it is hard to overstate the importance of the work that UNRWA does in Gaza. It is the main U.N. agency there during peacetimes. It provides critical levels of support in terms of schooling, all kinds of aid, medical clinics, et cetera. And now during this war, they have been the main U.N. body that has been coordinating the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip, both from the Rafah crossing in Egypt and the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel. So they provide a vital service. They have had strained relations with the Israelis. The Israeli government has repeatedly accused UNRWA of allowing Hamas militants to use their facilities, to hide weapons, to fire rockets from their facilities that Hamas militants have taken shelter inside their facilities. So it already was a strained relationship. Now we see UNRWA taking this immediate action. I also want to read part of the State Department's statement from Spokesman Matt Miller. He said that we welcomed the decision to conduct an investigation, and Secretary General Gutierrez has pledged to take decisive action to respond should the allegations prove accurate. We also welcome the U.N.'s announcement of a comprehensive and independent review of UNRWA. There must be complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks of October 7th. Kate, we have reached out to UNRWA ourselves as well as the Israeli government for more details on the allegations of these 12 staffers who the U.S. alleges may have participated in the October 7th attacks.

And as you say, Trump returned to the courtroom to sit there to listen to her, try to convince the jury that they shouldn't award E. Jean Carroll damages and that Donald Trump shouldn't have to pay. So Habba beginning her closing argument by saying that the plaintiff E. Jean Carroll is trying to pin Twitter troll comments on a former president of the United States without accepting any responsibility.They're trying to distance Trump from the onslaught of negative e- mails, tweets, harassing messages that E. Jean Carroll received after Donald Trump called her a liar when she accused him of raping her in the mid-1990s. And her opening statement has already drawn one rebuke from the judge. She was raising questions about who was paying the fees of the witness that she called, in this case, Carol Martin, a longtime friend of E. Jean Carroll. She asked Martin about that when she was on the stand. And Martin said she didn't know. So Habba mentions this in the closing statement. That got the judge irritated. He told her, if you violate my instruction, again, Ms. Habba, you may have consequences. Now earlier before the jury was even in the room. He said -- he told Habba who was challenging one of his rulings that he could throw her in lockup. So definitely the tension rising between the two of them today in this homestretch of this case. Now Habba has just begun her closings that followed Carroll's attorney who was giving her closing arguments for the -- for about an hour or so earlier today. And in her closings, she was making the case to the jury that Trump should have to pay. And the only way to stop Donald Trump from repeating the statements that a jury had already found to be defamatory was to make him pay a lot of money, millions of dollars in both compensatory and punitive damages. That's what they're asking the jury to do. And in the closing statements from Carroll's lawyers, they said that this trial is about whether rules apply to -- the rules that apply to us, apply to Donald Trump, and that this case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he's done and continues to do. And they say that he has not respected the prior jury's verdict because just 24 hours later, he was at a CNN town hall repeating the statements that that very jury had found to be defamatory. It was at that moment that Donald Trump have gotten up and left the courtroom. But now that we're back in the closing arguments that his lawyers are giving, he's in the courtroom listening to this and that's expected to go for probably another half hour or so, Sara.",
