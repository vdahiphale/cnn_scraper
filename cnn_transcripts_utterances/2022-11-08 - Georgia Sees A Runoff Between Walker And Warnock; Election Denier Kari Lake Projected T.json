The U.S. Senate race in Nevada between Senator Cortez Masco and Mr. Laxalt, Adam Laxalt. It is too early to call. We do not have any information for you there to project. In terms of Utah between incumbent Republican Senator Mike Lee and his challenger independent Evan McMullin, also too early to call. The balance of power in the U.S. Senate. As we've been telling you all night, this is key. There are 40 Democratic senators, 40 Republican senators, 20 seats outstanding. That is what we are going to be spending the rest of the night focusing on Republicans need to pick up one net seat in order to regain control of the U.S. Senate. But right now, it's tied 40-40.

All of them Republican incumbents hanging on, including in the state of South Dakota where Democrats have not elected a governor since the 1970s.There Kristi Noem earns another four years defeating Jamie Smith. She is someone that potentially has presidential, if not vice-presidential aspirations for 2024. An update now or projection from the state of Oklahoma. There Kevin Stitt getting a big boost from national Republicans late in the game. A big influx of cash there. He defeats Democratic challenger Joy Hofmeister to earn a return trip to the Governor's mansion in Oklahoma. An update now from the state of Vermont, in a state that Joe Biden won by a considerable margin, Republican Governor Phil Scott earns another four years. He is the only Republican holding onto statewide office in that state as he defeats progressive educator Brenda Siegel. A number of key race alerts to bring you now beginning in the state of Texas. Republican incumbent Greg Abbott building on his lead. He's now 368,000 votes ahead of Beto O'Rourke with 58 percent of the vote in, in the Lone Star state. Let's get a look at Michigan. Right now, Gretchen Whitmer roughly the same place, maybe a slimmer advantage than the last time we checked in on her contest with Tudor Dixon, 36,000 votes ahead for the Democratic incumbent with 16 percent of the vote in. An update now again, from Georgia, Brian Kemp there 247,000 votes ahead of Stacey Abrams. Notable in this rematch last time around, Kemp only won by about 50,000 votes. This is a much bigger lead, and as you just saw, he added another thousand votes to that advantage with 77 percent of the vote in in Georgia. We finish with Wisconsin the key race alert there, 85,000 votes separating these two candidates. Tony Evers the incumbent holding onto an advantage over election denier Tim Michaels, 35 percent of the vote in, in Wisconsin. And as we turn it over to Kasie Hunt, we have to point out there's also a big Senate race in Wisconsin as well.",

Of those 82, there are 51 competitive seats that we think are too early to call.Right now, in those 51 Democrats are leading in 39 of them. Republicans are leading in 12 of them. It's early. We do not know that this is going to be determinative, but this is certainly if you're a Democrat watching at home, better news than what a lot of Republicans were hoping for at this point in the night. Let's go over to the magic wall right now. John King, let's take a look. And if you don't mind my asking.

She is now pulled ahead, narrowly ahead, but 4,863 votes with 98 percent of the vote an estimated vote in. So still some counting to do. So, what happened here?

So, you, when you pull back out, again, Democrats are looking at these House races filling in, and what you do see is the Democrats are very competitive.Is it enough to keep a Republican majority? That's a much bigger question and we'll walk through the night because Republicans only need a net gain of five. But in terms of Democrats fighting, tough in the competitive districts. You see it right here, a lot of red here in the district as you look for Vega. But the people, the largest population center of the district is right here. And so, again, we have to finish the count here, but we're up to 98 percent.

Again, if you're Democrats and Republicans looking at Virginia saying, we're going to get at least two of those three, at the moment you're thinking, OK, maybe we can keep it to just one. This is a footnote I want to make because it's early. I don't want to draw any conclusions here, but you -- this district has gotten a lot of attention in recent days because Sean Maloney is not just a Democratic incumbent from New York. He's the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He's the head of the fundraising arm to help Democrats try to keep the majority. At the moment, he's losing in his district. I want to turn off the county line for a minute to just to show you the district here. You're in the Hudson Valley, little bit northwest of New York City, losing at the moment, but it's only 9 percent. So, this is one of those races. Republicans would love this. They consider this if they can get it a trophy because he's the campaign committee chairman. But it is very, very early. And again, in the other competitive districts in New York, early for them too. So that could change. But Democrats ahead, Democrats still holding both in New Hampshire. Democrats holding that seat in Rhode Island I talked about. We're not done yet, but they're leading Democrats. This is another one we haven't talked about all night long. Republicans were hoping to pick up. You talked about New England earlier, hoping to pick up a Democratic seat in Connecticut, only 10 percent of the vote, but the Democratic incumbent ahead at the moment.",

And I just want to check where we are in the vote count here in New Hampshire, because again, these were -- the Republicans really thought maybe if, especially with the governor, Chris Sununu, coasting to reelection that they could pick up at least one of these and Kuster holding on as we're up to 27 percent here. Chris Pappas leading more, much more narrowly. This is the more competitive district. This one here, you move up into the north country. This is more Republican territory, 24 percent. It's more competitive. So, we have a long way to go in counting that one. But you pull back out to the map. And, so North Carolina, we have some competitive seats here. The Democrats at the moment, I just want to check, leading here, 91 percent so that, you know, you're looking to hold and you come here.

This tells you, you know, this when they red -- when they redrew the district, they added this. So, it's just their interesting to watch, Jake, as we go through.

Abigail Spanberger is the winner in Virginia's seventh congressional district. She's a former CIA case officer. She's criticized her party for moving too far to the left.This was the seat that Republicans hoped to pick up. They failed to do so, CNN projects. Republican State Senator Jen Kiggans has however flipped the southern Virginia District. She defeated incumbent Congresswoman Elaine Luria, who serves on the January 6th committee. That is one of the Republican pickups. They were hoping for this evening. Republican and emergency room doctor Rich McCormick has CNN projects flipped the Georgia seat that was gerrymandered to become more Republican. He's a marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. In addition to New York, Republican, Nicole Malliotakis has been reelected in New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn. It was a rematch after a 2020 win over Democrat Max Rose. Let's look at the balance of power right now in the U.S. House of Representatives. Eighty-one 81 Democrats in the House, 145 Republicans, including five pickups. There are 209 seats remaining to be called. You need 218 to control the U.S. House of Representatives. The state of play right now when it comes to those competitive seats, we've been telling you at these 82 competitive House seats all night. Democrats, well, let's start with Republicans. Republicans need to win 23 of the outstanding competitive seats. Democrats need to win 51 of the outstanding competitive seats. Anderson Cooper, I'm going to go to you right now with your panel.

How much of this vote is pre-election vote? Right now, our estimate is 70 percent of it is pre-election. Which we know Democrats have been participating in the pre-election vote in more robust numbers than Republicans.At the end of the day, we think that's going to drop down to 61 percent, so right now there's more preelection vote in the Georgia vote as a share than we think there will be at the end of the day. Now I want to break down specific methods of -- method of voting and take a look at what's left uncounted here. So, in the mail vote where Raphael Warnock has a 36.9 percent lead. It's a big Warnock advantage category. There's still 26 percent of that mail vote uncounted. I'm going to add in early in person. Here Warnock has an eight and a half percentage point lead over Walker, and there's only 5 percent counted. Now these two buckets together, remember what I just said, make up what we think will be 61 percent of the overall electorate. The smaller piece is the election day vote. OK? Down here. Now that is a big Herschel Walker category. It -- he's winning it by 27.2 percent and there's still 42 percent of it uncounted. But remember, the top two categories, let me see if I can unhighlight, that is what we think is going to make up 61 percent of the vote and the election day vote, which again, 42 percent is uncounted. We think that's going to make up at the end of the day about 39, 40 percent of the vote in Georgia. This is why you're seeing such a close race right now.",

What about these governor's races as we get through all that, when we can do a closer analytical environment, look at the Ron DeSantis win in Florida.You know that Florida Republicans did much better in early voting this time than they did in 2020. The Kemp campaign says, I haven't looked at the data yet. The Kemp campaign says when you look there, they did better, even though Democrats are dominating the Georgia early voting, the Kemp camp again on the margins, the campaign. So, it's just a simple question, what Donald Trump's saying don't do it. Just ask yourself this. Would you like a month to turn out your vote or one day to turn out your vote?",

Greg Abbott, the incumbent Republican, winning a third term defeating former Congressman Beto O'Rourke.Meantime, in the state of Iowa, another incumbent Republican defeating the Democratic challenger Kim Reynolds, their winning reelection against small business owner Deirdre Dejear. We also have a projection to bring you from the state of Nebraska, Jim Pillen. A veterinarian who defeated a Donald Trump back candidate in the Republican primary. He becomes the next governor of Nebraska, defeating state legislator Carol Blood. And no surprises in the state of Wyoming. A state that Donald Trump carried with some 70 percentage points in 2020. Mark Gordon, the incumbent Republican there, defeats Theresa Livingston an air force veteran. Let's get you some key race alerts now and in four of these key races, the Democrat is leading an election denier. First in Michigan. Gretchen Whitmer, the incumbent Democrat, she builds on the lead that she had. When we last checked in on this race against Tudor Dixon now sitting 112,000 votes ahead with 30 percent of the vote in, in the state of Michigan. An update now, Jake, from your home state, Home Commonwealth, maybe Josh Shapiro, the attorney general there, 430,000 votes ahead of Doug Mastriano with 62 percent of the vote. In meantime, our first look at the Arizona governor's race with this key race alert. Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state that helped certify the 2020 election results in Arizona. She's leading former TV anchor turned unrepentant election denier, Kari Lake, 184,000 votes. Half of the vote in, in the state of Arizona. Then in New York, a race that nobody expected would be as close as it was in polling right at the very end, Kathy Hochul, the incumbent Democrat, 647,000 votes in front of Lee Zeldin who you may recall voted to object to certifying the election results in 2020 in the states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. Hochul holding onto a lead there. Let's get you a look at Georgia now. This race that we've been talking about all night. Incumbent Republican Brian Kemp nearly 300,000 votes ahead of Stacey Abrams in this rematch from 2018, 82 percent of the vote in Georgia. Let's turn it over to Kasie Hunt now. Kasie, you have an update for us on some Senate races?",

Herschel Walker sitting at 49.6. That is considerably behind, but he is ahead of Raphael Warnock, the Democrat, who holds 48.5 percent right now. Again, this is so close. Neither one has 50 percent. We arepotentially looking at a runoff, 83 percent of the vote in, in Georgia. So, let's check in on Wisconsin, which has been tightening over the past hour or so. Mandela Barnes, the Democrat. Look, you saw it tighten right there on your screen now at exactly 50 percent, just 4,000 votes ahead of the incumbent Republican Ron Johnson at 49.8 percent. Our friends at the magic wall are going to be able to give us a sense of what we -- how we may see this move in the next couple of hours with 50 percent of the vote in, in Wisconsin. Let's check in on Jake Tapper's Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, also mine. John Fetterman, 49.8 percent now below 50 percent, Mehmet Oz, 47.7 percent. This race really tightening up as we have been expecting all night. About 75,000 votes separate them right now. I think we can expect a really long time counting this race. Sixty-four percent of the vote in in Pennsylvania right now. And I do want to check in on Arizona because this has been a critical battleground as well. Mark Kelly, the incumbent Democrat sitting at 58.1 percent. So, he's got a comfortable early lead over Blake Masters, the Republican at 39.6 percent. I do want to point out Katie Hobbs is sitting at 57 percent in the governor's race. So, Kelly is slightly outperforming Hobbs potential to see a split on that race. There of course is only 50 percent of the vote in here, so we could see this tighten up throughout the night, Jake.",

Close aides, the campaign manager just leaving the stage, not saying a whole lot, just maintaining that they are feeling good. I did speak with a Democratic strategist working with the campaign and he says, look at, Dekalb County. Look at Fulton County. Look at the major areas around Atlanta. That is where they are tracking tonight.They are looking to see if the Biden voters from 2020 are going to stick with them. They're also feeling good about these split ticket voters because it is splitting in a way that seems to be good for Senator Warnock. And overall, they are confident in the strategy that they have employed here for the past several weeks by really characterizing Warnock, who is a reliable, a Democratic vote, but characterizing him as a moderate, as someone who can appeal to a wide swath of Georgians. All of that optimism though couched, with the fact that a lot of votes still need to be counted. Jake.",

Now that Republican incumbent Ron Johnson is up by 851 votes. We had a bit of a seesaw earlier in Georgia, and looks like we're going to have one as we go through the second half of the vote count, if you will, in Wisconsin.Sixty percent of the vote in, Ron Johnson now up to 1,422 vote lead. But you can, you don't need me to say a word, but 49.9, 49.9. So, it's 1,400 votes in an incredibly competitive state in recent years. So, we're going to watch this play out. We're at 60 percent, which means we're going to watch it and count for quite some time. Let's just take a look at what we got. Milwaukee is your largest vote pool. It's 16, 16 and a half percent of the state population. And Mandela Barnes getting 66 percent there to 33 percent. I just want to check in on the Governor's race and see how that's going right there. It's about the same. Tim Michaels a little bit below there. We'll see when you get to the final numbers. We come back to the Senate race. Fifty-seven percent. Again, this is the largest basket of votes in the state, we're only at 57 percent. Mandela Barnes, if he holds a margin like that, might not stay if this is all early vote. But if he holds a significant margin, just come back to the presidential race just to get a sense of it there. Joe Biden gets 69 percent of the vote here, so that gives you the target. Joe Biden wins the state by 22,000 votes, gets 69 percent here. So that tells you what you're going to look for as you come through. Not all races are exactly the same, but you want to stay -- (CROSSTALK)",

But if that holds up, that votes well for Senator Johnson in the sense that you have Milwaukee here.
