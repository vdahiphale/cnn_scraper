Also, as that mystery is growing in the skies, a part-time New Jersey resident says it's time to shoot them down. Is that even possible? And tonight, we're hearing from the Homeland Security Secretary, telling CNN, they don't know exactly what they are, but they're also not concerned. An alarm in the medical community, tonight, over revelations that RFK Jr.'s attorney has been petitioning to get a life-saving vaccine revoked. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the accused CEO killer may be getting ready, to head here to New York, perhaps sooner than some expected. As I have exclusive new reporting about who will be representing him when he gets here. Tonight, I can report that Luigi Mangione has retained a high-powered New York defense attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, to represent him, as he's facing a second degree murder charge, in the death of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. Viewers of THE SOURCE will be very familiar with Friedman Agnifilo, who was recently a CNN Legal Analyst. But she's also a veteran of the New York criminal justice system. She served as the Chief Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan D.A.'s office for seven years, before going into private practice. As one longtime New York prosecutor told me, tonight, she knows, quote, Every corridor, every judge, every clerk in the courthouse here. And she will be taking this case on, at a time when investigators have amassed new evidence, in recent days. With police telling CNN, this week, that the 3D-printed gun he had on him when he was arrested, matches the three shell casings that were found at the crime scene in Midtown Manhattan. His fingerprints also matched those that investigators found on items near the scene. This is all evidence that Friedman Agnifilo said before she was retained, I should note, could potentially be a problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, HIGH-POWERED NEW YORK ATTORNEY: It looks to me like this -- there might be a not guilty by reason of insanity defense that they're going to be thinking about, because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did.

That was to give our detectives a chance to get in the box with him and speak with him.

It's a shame that we missed that window. They must have tried for a few hours, because they didn't charge him and file accusatory instrument, which attaches to right to counsel until that evening. There's a lot we could have gotten. But now, for the New York case, like the science didn't catch this guy. We only had partial prints. We had ballistics that matched absolutely nothing, because the gun didn't exist. Police worked that photo of the person. That's how they caught this guy.

Oh, Jen needs this for her case? I can just lean over and hand it to her. The FBI has got to go three flights up, two hallways down, three flights down. They can't -- they have rules of engagement with each other. So, that information was properly sent from the FBI San Francisco office, to the FBI New York office, and it was being processed.

What would happen theoretically, if the FDA did revoke approval of the polio vaccine? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN, DEAN, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Theoretically speaking, if approval of the polio vaccine were revoked, it would mean that children being born would not be able to get the polio vaccine. And as the years passed, we would start seeing polio spread in the United States again. We would be in the same situation that Afghanistan and Pakistan are in, right now, where polio is spreading amongst the population. We'd be in the same situation that my parents were in, when they were little kids, where we'd have to worry, each summer, about the spread of polio at the beach, and where we'd see generations of children, and their friends, experiencing disability and death, thanks to this virus.",
