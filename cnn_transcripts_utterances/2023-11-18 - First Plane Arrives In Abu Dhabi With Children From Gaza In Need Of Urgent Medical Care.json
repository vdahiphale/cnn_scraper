These are letters in responses to correspondence that comes into the White House.To those deemed to be pro-Israel, the letter focuses on the pure evil of the October 7th attack, references the Holocaust. For those who are deemed to be pro-Palestinian, it focuses on protecting Gaza civilians, focuses on aid.

It requires a two-thirds majority for passage but having the weight of the House Ethics Committee and the weight of this damning report behind it is significant. And already, we have seen a number of Republicans, new Republicans, come out and say they will now support expulsion after previously voting against it. And meanwhile, the new Speaker, Mike Johnson, is essentially giving members a green light to vote their conscience. I want to read you part of the statement that came from his spokesman, Raj Shah. He said, \"The Speaker has reviewed the report and it's very troubling findings. As members from both parties, members of the Ethics Committee and Representative Santos return to Congress after the Thanksgiving break. Speaker Johnson encourages all involved to consider the best interests of the institution as this matter is addressed further.\" So, we'll see what Santos decides to do. At this moment he says he will not run for re-election in 2024. He is claiming that he will stick around and serve out his term as long as he is allowed, but some Republicans are at least hoping that he resigns before they have to expel him. Santos, for his part, has been defiant, says that he is innocent, deserves his day in court, and has also announced that he will hold a press conference on the Capitol steps on November 30th, but we'll see if that winds up being his last press conference here on Capitol Hill.

I mean, that's pretty good as it gets.That it has some problems Friday night with the practice. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz' car was damaged, when he hit a loose drainage cover on the track. So, they had to cancel the first practice. The second one was delayed for hours. The fans actually got kicked out of the stands because it got so late. Now, F1 didn't apologize, and they offered those fans actually just a voucher to buy merchandise. So, some of them are not very happy. But it actually was smooth sailing for qualifying which wrapped up just few hours ago, actually. The race is going to start tonight 10:00 p.m. local time in Vegas. Take advantage of all the cool lights there on the strip. It's the latest start time ever for an F1 race. Ferraris Charles Leclerc, claiming the pole, and he says he's excited to try to get his first one of the season in Vegas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
