His lawyers declaring it's impossible for the former president to post a nearly half billion dollar bond in the New York civil fraud case with a court deadline just days away.Also tonight, President Biden personally warns Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against an offensive in Rafah. The two leaders speaking on the phone for the first time in more than a month amid their deepening rift over the war in Gaza. And a new explosion of deadly violence in the capital of Haiti, where machete-wielding militias and gangs are battling for power. CNN is the first major news network on the scene since the uprising. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First tonight, why Donald Trump's lawyers say he can't make good on a $464 million bond order in the New York civil fraud ruling, and it's raising new questions about Trump's cash crunch from multiple legal cases and how it could impact his wealth. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is joining us now with the latest. Evan, what was the Trump team's explanation for why they can't come up with this money?",

And according to this filing that they've made in federal court -- sorry, in state court today, they said that they've been rejected by 30 different underwriters who said that they cannot satisfy that kind of bond.And so as a result of this, they're asking the court, they are asking the judge to give him more time, to extend the former president more time in order to come up with this kind of money. $464 million is what that overall judgment is. And it is going up every day as a result of interest, Wolf. The state attorney general, Letitia James, is asking the court to not give Trump any more time. They say they're ready, as you pointed out, Wolf, to start seizing some of his assets to satisfy that judgment. Now, according to the court filing today, these bond underwriters have said that they cannot write a bond for that size of money. And one of the -- an insurance underwriter who provided an affidavit for the Trump team in this court filing called this a practical impossibility. So, the cash crunch for the former president is absolutely coming to a head in the next week, Wolf.",

It's for the Democratic nomination like Trump did for their Republican nomination.And when you just look at the differences in how much cash they have on hand, I believe Biden and the Democrats have about $155 million on- hand. We have not gotten the latest totals from the Trump campaign but, certainly, they're nowhere near that because we know the Republican National Committee is struggling with its finances as well. And so I think that speaks to what you're seeing happening at Mar-a- Lago. It's basically billionaire week where the former president and his political team are welcoming in all of these wealthy donors, hoping that they will be prepared to cut checks to his campaign because they feel confident in the long run that are going to be able to have that money. They say they've been outraised before. But, overall, this big picture does speak to the fact that his campaigns is having trouble raising money, he's behind, President Biden and trying to catch up and also obviously on the legal front having a lot of issues there as well.",

If it is, it's because the companies that Trump has interacted with in an effort to secure the bond have quite rightly and conservatively said they're not willing to post that bond on his behalf in return for using properties as security. They want actual cash or stocks, things that can be liquidated easily to post that bond. And he doesn't have enough cash on hand or stocks, liquid assets on-hand, to get a bond of that size.And I don't think we can really question the logic of that. This is someone who is in this unenviable position because he's been found guilty of overinflating the values of his properties. So, it makes sense that insurance companies would not accept those properties and his valuation of them as security on a bond of this size. So, it may be impossible for him to obtain the bond, but it is not impossible to proceed forward according to the law in this case, as the laws allows the state attorney general to start pursuing the seizure of some of those properties to secure this judgment. So, a lot to be determined in the future here, but there is a path forward. It's just not the one that Trump wants.",

I mean, there are multiple avenues that he has, not just in the court system but in the business community to try to manage this.It's not a practical impossibility, per se. I mean, I know that's the language that's used in the brief. It's only a practical impossibility because he refuses to sell anything, right? That is the reason why he can't generate this cash, and it's stated explicitly in the brief. He says it would be a fire sale. He'd suffer irreparable harm. There's no legal reason I can discern from the brief why the court has to care about any of that. Now, the key thing here, though, that folks should remember is this all proceeds forward. It would not actually be in Letitia James' best interest to have to go through a very complicated, cumbersome enforcement process. So, this is one of those areas where actually the litigants who have been sort of at loggerheads for quite some time now may actually have it in their mutual interest to try to come up with some sort of arrangement so he can have his appeal, but the A.G.'s office can also have its certainty that they'll get paid out if that appeal is resolved in their favor at the end of the day.

The seizure of physical property brings with it an entire course of headaches that law enforcement really isn't inclined or in well-positioned to deal with. And nothing is more headache-ridden than real estate, because there's upkeep, there's maintenance, there's all kinds of costs that go along with maintaining that real estate until you can liquidate it.Trump has got numerous properties all over New York that would be subject to that sort of authority and it would essentially mean seizing those properties, maintaining them and putting them up to some sort of auction or sale for the public good. Not a process that happens quickly. It takes an enormous amount of money and time and effort by the law enforcement entities involved. It's probably not one that Letitia James -- it sounds great in a sound bite, but it's probably not one that she looks forward to actually going through. So, I think the kind of deal that Ankush mentioned is something they should be looking forward to.",

He was essentially appointed to that position and he was supposed to hand over power essentially to what would have been another elected leader in February of this year, February 7th in particular.

There were reports of Israeli airstrikes in the rubble. Women and children were also among the casualties.
