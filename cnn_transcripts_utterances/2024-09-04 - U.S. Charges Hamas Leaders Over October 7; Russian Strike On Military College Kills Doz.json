We will, of course, bring you more details on this very issue when they come into us.Meantime, Russia is continuing its relentless air assaults on Ukraine. In the past few hours, Moscow launched an attack on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Officials say three people were killed. One of the victims is a 14-year-old girl. 35 people were reported injured, including five children. On Tuesday evening, a Russian airstrike hit a university building in Sumy, that is a border area close to Russia's Kursk region where Ukrainian forces are making gains in their month-long incursion. And all of this follows one of Russia's single deadliest attacks in the duration of the war. More than 50 people were killed and hundreds wounded overnight Tuesday, when a Russian attack targeted a military education facility. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen brings us the details from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Parts of the military educational facility almost completely destroyed. Dozens killed here, the Ukrainians say when two Russian ballistic missiles struck, leaving those on the ground with no time to get to bomb shelters. More than 200 were also wounded and a nearby hospital damaged. Ukraine's President irate. VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): The Russian scum will undoubtedly be held accountable for this strike, and once again, we urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror. Air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine. Not in the warehouse somewhere. Long range strikes that can defend against Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. PLEITGEN (voiceover): Russia has been accelerating its aerial bombardment of Ukraine cities and infrastructure. A massive barrage aiming for the capital Kyiv early Monday, just as children were gearing up for the first day of school after summer break. One of the places damaged a management college. ANASTASIYA, STUDENT (through translator): I got up and it had already started to boom. We ran out into the yard near the dormitory. We heard something flying and something being shot down. PLEITGEN (voiceover): On Sunday, more than 40 people injured after Russian air strikes on the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Responders desperately trying to save the victims. There's an ambulance on the other side, the photographer says. We won't be able to carry him there, she answers. While Ukraine's air defenses often take down Russian missiles, the consequences can be devastating when they don't. The strikes on Poltava were one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of the war. We were on hand when a ballistic missile annihilated a funeral wake in eastern Ukraine in October of last year, killing 59 people. And 46 were killed in Dnipro in January 2023 when a heavy cruise missile blew a giant hole into an apartment block. PLEITGEN (on camera): The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage here is so extensive that this building was hit with a cruise missile called the Kh-22, that's designed to destroy aircraft carrier strike groups, and obviously, when it hit the building, it completely annihilated it, burying dozens of people underneath. PLEITGEN (voiceover): Now yet another mass casualty strike, leaving Ukraine's leadership angry and vowing revenge. Frederik Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I want to set one thing straight. I don't want anyone to think that Ukraine is asking for air defense systems while sitting itself with hands down. This is not the case. We are doing more than we can to use our mobile groups shooting, intercepting drones to efficiently use air defense systems available to us. So, we are doing our part of the homework. We are asking our partners to do their part of the homework, especially with regard to those systems which were promised but have not delivered yet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They include the late political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' current leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar and another Hamas leader, Khaled Mashal. The charges include terrorism, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals and use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death. And they follow a promise from U.S. President Joe Biden to hold Hamas accountable. However, the October 7th massacre is not the sole focus of the complaint, which actually covers several decades of alleged atrocities by Hamas. The charges were originally filed back in February, but kept under seal in case the Justice Department had an opportunity to arrest any of the defendants. But an official said that with three of the Hamas leaders charged now dead, it was no longer necessary to wait. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now this was a level of anger, level of frustration.
