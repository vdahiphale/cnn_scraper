Arizona, certainly one of them. We are now seeing lines of voters wrap around some buildings, so the turnout in Arizona here on Election Day, tons of lines that we are seeing there. We've got a team of reporters across the country, including in Arizona, and the other closely watched for Senate race in Pennsylvania. I want to start with Sara Sidner, because she's in Tempe at ASU.

Because people like to early vote in this state, no matter how you slice it, especially in this county, which is the most populous county in the state.

A little less than 4,000 came through in 2020 for the presidential cycle. It could be competitive with those numbers. They've got several hours to go and an official here told me that they expect their big push of voters to come after five o'clock Eastern time, a little over two hours from now.

Can Cheri Beasley surprise us in North Carolina? Can Tim Ryan surprise us in Ohio? Three Republican states: North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. Democrats have long shot upset plans. That would turn things on their head tonight if that could happen. But Wolf, just come right down here. Number one, you see the New Hampshire Senate race, the Pennsylvania Senate race, that North Carolina Senate race I talked about and then you talked about the House races and you come here that you look at where there are competitive seats, 82 competitive seats across the country but a lot of them right here in the east. So we won't know for days, maybe more, the final math could be run off in December in Georgia for that Senate seat. We won't know for days or weeks the final math in the House as well because it takes a long time to count. Out west, you have rank choice voting in Alaska, you have rank choice voting in Maine that takes time to count.

But it highlights a larger issue, which is driving a lot of people crazy, which is the way that Democrats tackle messaging on particular issues. Take crime, for example. You cannot tell New Yorkers or people in Arkansas or people in Georgia or Philadelphia, wherever it may be, that the statistics about crime are wrong, that what you're feeling is not accurate. Crime is an issue. It's a top issue. It's a top of mind issue and we know the crime rates in Arkansas, and Mississippi and Georgia, a Republican-led states are higher than the blue states. We know that. But that - those stats don't matter. What we have to do is come up with holistic solutions, early childhood education, after school programs, midnight basketball, giving kids something else to do, strengthening gun laws. We have to have these holistic conversations instead of saying, oh, what you feel as a voter just ain't right. I don't believe it. Here's a statistic.
