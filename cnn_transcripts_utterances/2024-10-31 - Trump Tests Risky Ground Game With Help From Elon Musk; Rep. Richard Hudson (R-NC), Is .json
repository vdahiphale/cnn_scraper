In Pennsylvania, though, good operation before Musk came in on the Republican side because of Dave McCormick's campaign, the Super PAC tied to it, other groups that have been in there for a while.

By the way, great to be with you. Thanks for having me. No, I'm very confident that Republicans will hold the House majority.
