Overnight a Russian rocket struck a children's school in a village in Zaporizhzhia, no injuries reported. And in Kryvyi Rih, an important city in the south, another power generating facility was hit causing serious destruction. The Ukrainian government is now imposing energy restrictions, rolling blackouts across the country, after repeated strikes on critical energy infrastructure.",

And so these are very tough laws that give the Russian military almost absolute power.On the ground, again, I'm not sure how much impact it is going to have because, as I say, not all the territories are under their control, and they are already warzones as well, but it definitely sends a very powerful message to Putin's critics not least at home who have been saying that Vladimir Putin is not doing enough, or rather the Russian military is not doing enough to win the conflicts in Ukraine. This is Vladimir Putin showing that he's not going to back down, in fact he is doubling down, and that's what I think the message is meant to be of this imposition of martial law in these areas of Ukraine.",

And we'll see how many people jump into the 2024 field when it kicks off. He seems to suggest in 21 days or 22 days after the midterms, he might make some sort of decision. When does Donald Trump decide to run? It sounds like it's a matter of if and not when. And all of the other folks, people like Ron DeSantis has become a real star in the Republican Party, can he take that to a bigger stage and actually challenge somebody like Donald Trump. You have Greg Abbott down in Texas who is a governor down there doing well and up for re- election obviously. So we'll see. But again I think the heart and soul is still with Donald Trump. If you ask Republicans, if you look at the polls, the majority of Republicans are still with Donald Trump. JENNINGS:  I've seen some polling lately in which Trump has about, you know, 47, 48, 49 if you do it like a primary ballot, and then everybody else. The structure is protective of anyone who can start the race with 40, 45 percent. So to your point, if all these people run, it is really a cocoon for Trump because it fragments the opposition and I think a lot of people will run, but how long are they stay in.

So you will hear a lot of frustration being vented the next couple weeks that's going to be cranked up as more and more polls come out showing the Republican momentum, folks saying, why did you give $5 million in that race, not this race? Why did you give $50 million in that race and not this race, because then we could have saved this majority. You're going to hear a lot of that.",
