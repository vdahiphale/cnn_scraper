That's a way of protect the integrity of a trial.But in this situation, it's an important moment because it's a restriction placed on Donald Trump and Donald Trump is clearly a person who's already charged with wanting to allegedly share documents that are protected on -- from the national security perspective. How he handles this and how he responds to this, if he can abide by it leading up to trial, that's a new world for him as a criminal defendant. There's a judge's order on this.",

But I think the ramifications of the vicious fighting that ensued is something that will perhaps persist in the days and weeks ahead because it's not uncommon for Israel to go into Jenin or other cities in the West Bank to arrest wanton militants. That's what it did yesterday, it arrested one member of Hamas, one member of Islamic jihad.But it - what it wasn't expecting in particular was this improvised explosive device that took out one of its vehicles and damaged a number of others. The ID have described this IED as pretty advanced. And then on top of that, after the Israeli soldiers, a number of whom had been wounded, were kind of bogged down in Jenin, they had to call for support from an Apache helicopter. And that's the first time that's happened in the West Bank in some two decades. And as you say, the result of all of that is that six Palestinians were killed, half of them have been claimed by the Jenin brigades militant group that's associated with Islamic jihad. The last of those six funerals took place earlier today in Jenin. There's been condemnation from the Egyptians, from the Jordanians. And, as you say, the U.S. State Department also calling for a de- escalation. We also saw Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visiting some of the injured soldiers on Monday afternoon, reiterating that Israel would continue to carry out these kinds of raids as and when it sees fit.

And just imagine, Victor, as you mentioned, there are 100 of those letters across the state of Kansas.And these are finite resources that the state and federal government has. As a matter of fact, Representative Blew says that some of the lawmakers were told to double bag those letters, leave them outside, because the recovery could take a while.

The White House officials are meeting about two to three times a week to discuss AI. President Biden himself has been extensively briefed on the issue. One official even telling me that he's experimented with programs like ChatGPT. Now, additionally, the White House chief of staff's office has also overseen this process to try to develop some decisive actions that they can try to roll out related to artificial intelligence in the coming weeks.
