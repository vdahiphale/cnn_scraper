But even as these meetings are set to kick off, Israel has decided to skip ceasefire talks in Cairo. An Israeli official tells CNN that Israel is not sending a delegation to Egypt after Hamas failed to respond to two key demands. And a Hamas source says that the group has its own sticking points. All of this seeming to dash hopes of any imminent deal. Still, the U.S. ramping up its push to address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tymofiy (ph) was four months old. Mark (ph) would have been three Sunday, today, had he lived to see that moment. And we're now hearing of a ten-year-old also killed during these attacks. Now, all of this, the backdrop to an urgent situation here on the Eastern front lines. We've been seeing ourselves, the intensity of the fighting around some of these frontline towns. Remember, this all started with a Ukrainian decision to pull out of Avdiivka two weekends ago. That said, it was planned, but it appears that their departure and the defensive lines were less well-planned from what we're hearing. Now, certainly that was evident in the three villages to the West of Avdiivka, which Ukraine initially said were never part of their defensive plan. They were given up quite fast.

There's been a lot of it in social media, too, that essentially, Ukraine didn't prepare for the possibility of having to fall back in the way that it should have.

He's now, since Thursday, berated his staff for essentially not being up to the job of commanding some of these forces in the Avdiivka area. He says even made some personnel replacements.

And so these villages, under increased pressure, are leaving many worried that we might be seeing Russia moving forward past Ukraine's expectations in what it could do to defend its territory. And then possibly a change in the dynamic on the battlefield. Too early to tell right now. But things are absolutely not what Ukraine hoped they would be on the battlefield. They're certainly not what they hoped there would be in terms of supply and assistance from the West. And it begins to feel -- WALSH (voice-over): -- as though Russia has the capacity to move forwards.

And one thing we noted was, in many cases, we did not see a lot of young coral colonies where these ancient coral colonies were.So the events that lead to their establishment could be rare. And so the likelihood of them being re-established and then taking the time to grow to serve the purpose that they serve in the grander scheme of things could take millennia to recover. And just seeing again, all these fish eggs settled on the corals, for example, if that's a fish species that is sufficiently mobile, it migrates. And maybe it's only around that sea mount (ph) at the time it's ready to lay its eggs. But if those corals aren't there, they wouldn't have had the opportunity to lay their eggs.",
