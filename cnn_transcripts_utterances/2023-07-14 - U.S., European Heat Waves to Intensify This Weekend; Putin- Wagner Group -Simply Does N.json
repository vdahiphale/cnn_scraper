Russian President Vladimir Putin says Wagner doesn't exist. The International Criminal Court opens a war crimes investigation into Sudan. And more than 100,000 actors go on strike today. Welcome to the show, and we are in the grips of the worst crisis we have ever seen. That's not a call to panic but to action, as the U.N. flashes a warning that climate change is in its words, out of control today, after the world saw its highest temperatures for three days running last week, around 100 million people under heat alerts across the United States. Now, the U.S. government's just releasing a report saying the earth saw its warmest June on record. And for the second month in a row as well- known Europe, Dante's Inferno has nothing on the dangerous heatwave gripping Italy. 15 Italian cities are under extreme heat risk alerts for this weekend. Look at that map. And a short time ago Greece had to shut the Acropolis in Athens for the day. Now, we're not talking about sweating through a handful of uncomfortable days. Because it's summer in the Mediterranean. This kind of heatwave is a health hazard. And climate scientists at the European Space Agency say it's only just begun. You've also got soaring temperatures, as well as hot wind sparking a raging wildfire in Croatia. Firefighters there are working flat out to contain the flames near a town on the Adriatic coast. Keep in mind, the U.N.'s last big study of climate change tells us we have to cut emissions by 43% soon to limit global heating. Here's what the head of COP28, the Climate Change Conference has to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SULTAN AHMED AL JABER, PRESIDENT-DESIGNATE, COP28: We truly don't need a report to tell us that our climate is already warming to unprecedented levels. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN Senior National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt joins us now live from Dnipro in Ukraine. Alex, look the questions about where Prigozhin is? What his fate might be?

And secondly, that Wagner as we've known it, here in Ukraine during this war no longer exists. It raises all kinds of questions about the future of Wagner and its leader of Yevgeny Prigozhin, what its operations may continue to look like in Africa and the Middle East, where it has been operating for years. And of course, what the fate is for its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which very much hangs in the balance. But Putin making clear here that at least under Russian law, mercenary groups are not allowed to operate. Here's a little bit more of what he told the Kommersant newspaper that I want to quote from. He says, \"We do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist. There is no such legal entity.\" He goes on to say, that it is not an easy question to answer. Of course, the full name of the Wagner group is the Wagner Private Military Company. Now, Putin also detailed an extraordinary meeting on June 29, that's just five days after the Wagner insurrection in which some 35 commanders from Wagner came to the Kremlin and met with Putin. And in Putin's own telling, he says he told them that they could continue to fight and they could continue to do so under their direct commander whose callsign is Sedoi, which means a gray hair. The men according to Putin nodded in agreement. But then Prigozhin himself piped up from the front row saying, no, the guys do not agree with this decision. So a split between the Russian President and the head of the Wagner company on full display. But what is apparent here is that the Russian President is trying to divide Prigozhin from his men while being able to maintain the option that the Wagner fighters who are considerable and very capable fighters may continue to fight for Russia.
