The mayor of Kharkiv in the east reports a series of explosions and to the south, the mayor of Mykolaiv says a two-story residential building was destroyed and one man killed after a night of shelling. And this comes one day after Russia launched a wave of deadly kamikaze drone strikes in Ukrainian cities far from the front lines, Ukraine says dozens of drones were shot down, but several hit the capital killing at least four people. The attacks appeared to be part of a wide result that took aim at critical infrastructure and civilian targets across the country. Ukraine's President says even though his forces are fighting back more, international help is needed.

They've clearly expanded to have much greater demands, political demands, even demands for change in regime. So, I think that, you know, and many people are calling it a revolution, but it's also being met with incredible violence. So, it -- it's difficult to speculate what will happen. But what has happened is significant because now we see protests across the country that have last. This is the last -- longest lasting continuous protests and people seem determined to continue expressing their frustration and their demand. And we're seeing things about this protest that are very different. First of all, we see women, women's demands still continue to be central to these protests, but women are participating in great -- in great numbers, and we also see a much younger generation of Iranians participating. This is unprecedented. These are children over the children of the revolution, and you know, they are demanding very peacefully. They're dissenting. They -- they're, they have peace -- peacefully dissenting and making demands for their own freedom. And they have a clearly a very different vision of their own future, what they want for the future. Then the Islamic Republic of Iran does.

Look, there is an impression in this country, Rosemary, that Liz Truss is a woman who is not in control of her own government, and yesterday didn't do a whole lot to dispel that notion. It was a bit of a bizarre scenario that played out.So first you had an urgent question coming from the opposition about the fiscal plans of the government. Liz Truss though wasn't there. She deputized the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, a former leadership rival who went on to assure the House that Truss was not hiding under a desk. Then somewhere during that line of questioning, Liz Truss herself, actually walked into the House of Commons, took a seat behind Penny Mordaunt but then didn't answer any questions herself. Then you have the new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, step up to the dispatch box, and essentially proceed to scrap nearly everything that was in Liz Truss's now infamous mini budget. That includes now the planned basic income tax cut, the plan cut to dividends tax, the planned income tax cut for the highest earners, the plan to cancel corporate tax hike, and a few other things. All told the government estimates that this will save about $36 million of money that it never actually had in the first place. The markets, they seem to like this. The Major U.K. stock index, the FTSE responded positively to this gaining some ground. The pound also gained some ground against the U.S. dollar as well. It is now almost back to the level that it was when Liz Truss first took office back in the beginning of September. But all of this now leaves Truss in a pretty awkward scenario considering that the primary ideas that she ran on in the leadership contest, which is lowering taxes, and really trying to fuel growth haven't exactly panned out as planned. So, she was asked about this yesterday by the BBC and she pointed to her plan to subsidize energy prices, but even that is only going to survive in its current form now until April. She then tried to explain that, look, fundamentally she still believes in low taxes, high growth, but that now is not exactly the time to do that, which awkwardly is precisely the point that her leadership rival Rishi Sunak was trying to make during that leadership contest. That look, he believes in lower taxes, but given all the debt that the government has ran up during the pandemic, given the war, given energy prices, now is not exactly the time. So, what happens now? Liz Truss's leadership has been described as rudderless as an empty vessel. Some backbench conservative M.P.s are already publicly calling for her to resign, and now her party has to decide whether or not with her polling really showing that she's very unpopular, whether or not they can stick with her till the next general election. Hope that she can right the ship over the next two years, or if they want to rip the Band-Aid off now and try to get a different leader in there, Rosemary.",
