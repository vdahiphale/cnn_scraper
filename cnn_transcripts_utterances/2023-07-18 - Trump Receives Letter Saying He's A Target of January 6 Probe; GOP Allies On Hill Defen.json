No comment when a CNN crew spotted him in D.C. today and asked about the target letter he sent to Donald Trump. CNN asking whether the special counsel's office is preparing to indict the former president over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election here in the United States. Several Congressional Republicans are vowing to support Trump despite his growing legal troubles. Here's Texas Congressman Troy Nehls. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): Donald Trump is the leader of our party. And Donald Trump is going to beat Joe Biden in 2024 for a second time. Why are they doing everything they can to prevent him from bein2024.the ballot in 2024? I'll tell you why. Because Donald Trump will win in 2024. And the left just think they're scared (BLEEP).

You've seen actions taken already in the other indictments, including going after the prosecutor in New York, over the first Trump indictment, and then trying to ask for his testimony. As well as seeking records from Jack Smith himself as part of the classified records probe. And now there is calls from some on the hard right to defund the special counsel's investigations all together. That includes coming from Congressman Matt Gaetz, who said that he plans to introduce a bill to go after the special counsel investigation. And I just caught up with Congressman Byron Donalds. Another one of Donald Trump's prominent allies on Capitol Hill. And he indicated that it may be time to go after the Justice Department's funding when it comes time to fund the government.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): This is outrageous and Jack Smith is out of control. What we are looking at while we're dealing with appropriations and some of the dollars that are going to be relevant agencies. Because the Department of Justice is going to have a two- tier system about how they choose to investigate and prosecute, then maybe they don't need that much money. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All we know is what Donald Trump said that he is the target of this investigation.But Wolf, even as his most prominent allies are rushing to his defense, many Republicans on Capitol Hill still staying silent, including the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who just moments ago would not answer questions about this as he walk onto the Senate floor. Also, the Speaker of the House, it's much different than the Speaker of the House, who came out and aggressively defended the former president in the immediate aftermath of this news.

The special counsel's letter targeting Donald Trump in the January 6 criminal probe is the latest in the long list of legal troubles for the former president. CNN's Elie Honig is with me now. Let's just take a look at kind of the big picture because it's easy to lose track of it all. Let's start with the Manhattan's DA's case. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYSTcases swirling around Donald Trump now. The one that is most concrete at this point is the Manhattan D.A.'s indictment. This is a state level indictment under New York state law. Donald Trump is charged with falsifying records relating to hush money payments that Donald Trump made to porn stars before the 2016 election. No, importantly, Anderson, that case has already been set for trial starting late March into April of 2024. Now trial dates can move, but if we're trying to figure out the calendar here, that's the one trial that as of this moment, has a date.",

We know that she's investigating Donald Trump for his effort to interfere with the election in Georgia. And that the key keys of evidence there -- this also may be part of Jack Smith's evidence -- is the infamous phone call that Donald Trump made to the Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger. Where Trump infamously asked Raffensperger to just find 11,780 votes.

      "sentences": "Well, in the last hour or so, Wolf, we've really gotten a sense of just how former President Trump's legal strategy of trying to delay any prosecution, any criminal prosecution until after the election just how that's going to play out down here in Florida. This is a significant hearing because this is the first time that special council prosecutors and defense attorneys were appearing before Trump appointed Judge Ailene Cannon. She is the judge who's going to oversee this case. And we're watching to see just how receptive she would be to Trump's efforts to try to delay this. And based on what we saw over the last 90 minutes, she's clearly very open to delaying this.One of the central tensions here has been the fact that special counsel Jack Smith wants a, quote, speedy trial. They suggested that they'd be ready to take this to trial in December. But today if the hearing the judge called that, quote, a compressed timeline. She said, look, cases like this take more time. And she really pushed back on the idea that this case is not what you would describe as a complex case. There's something that should take more time. Now defense attorneys were up and they called this, once again, unusual. They said it would only be fair to delay any prosecution until after the election. But the judge did insist on some sort of timeline. She said, all right, I know you're not ready to put a trial date on the calendar but could you at least tell me when you can finish going through all the evident, the discovery process. They said they might be able it finish that in November. And then they might be able to give her a time when they think they would be ready to go to trial. And Wolf, there's a lot of back and forth between prosecutors and defense attorneys about Trump's status as a candidate. The special counsel was clear. They said look, it doesn't matter if he's a former president. He is no longer the president. They said even if he's a candidate for the presidency once again, that he should be treated like any other busy American. Now Trump's attorneys really took issue with that. They insisted that he is not like any other American. This is unusual. They kept emphasizing that his likely opponents and administration is one prosecuting him. Obviously losing the nuance of a special counsel. But Wolf, the judge just wasn't interested in this argument. She said, look, let's focus on getting some sort of schedule down here. She is focused on the process and discovery and really the mechanics. At this point she does not appear too interested in the constitutional issues. But we left this hour -- over hour and a half long hearing without any kind of trial date or even an inclination of when she'll make a decision on what happens next.",

      "sentences": "Well it certainly wasn't an issue inside the court today. It seems like all of her questions were incredibly reasonable. She pushed back on both sides. Though it was clear she really wasn't on board with what she described as a compressed timeline being suggested by the special counsel. Now clearly, Wolf, it's unprecedented right to have a criminal prosecution of a former president in front of a judge that he has appointed. Up until now the special counsel has not made an issue of this.But there was no indication of any sort of political bias here in the courtroom. She asked questions, it seems very much based off the briefings. Based on what she already has in front of her. And I also want to note, while most of the focus was on former president Trump, he was not here today. Though his attorneys were. But his codefendant Walt Nauta was in the court with his lawyer. And his lawyer also got up and made arguments on behalf of him. He's not a candidate for the presidency. So a lot of the arguments that Trump's lawyers made don't apply to Walt Nauta, which is lawyer acknowledged. But his lawyer said, look, it's going to take us a while. They're still waiting for some of the evidence from prosecutors relating to Walt Nauta's phone. They said until we see all of this discovery, we really can't tell you when we will be ready for trial. But one really important thing that his lawyer, Walt Nauta's lawyer pointed out, and that is he said that the biggest decision that his client needs to make, is whether he wants to settle this. Whether he wants to plea. Whether that would involve cooperating against the former president or not is unclear. And his lawyer said he cannot make that decision until he has all of the discovery, all the evidence from prosecutors.",
