We can also project that President Biden will be the winner on the Democratic side. Neither outcome, obviously a surprise, but significant in terms of the delegate count.

He's going to get over 50 percent of the vote as the last man standing with no real opposition in this campaign.So add those 40 delegates to where he is and so this is where Donald Trump finds himself now. You noted one thousand two hundred and fifteen upper right hand corner there. He needs to secure the Republican nomination. He's now at one thousand 1,184 delegates. That puts him 31 delegates away from securing the Republican Party nomination. That will likely happen when Washington vote - when Washington State's votes come in later this evening in the eleven o'clock Eastern hour. Obviously, as you noted, Anderson, this is not a surprise and this is not the balloon drop moment that will happen in the convention in Milwaukee in the summer when the delegates make it official.

Why is that important? Well, this is the map. Last time he got 306 electoral votes.But Kaitlan, if you look at where David Chalian and our political team have looked at, where are we right now? Very early - emphasize very, very, very early, it's in March. We have so many questions we haven't answered about third party candidates. Trump's running mate. Will there be trials this year. There's so much more, both conventions. We have a long way to go. But right now, look where he's going, right? Battleground - we now call Pennsylvania a battleground state. We lean Michigan red for Trump. Wisconsin is a tossup. Georgia, we lean red for Trump, meaning there's public polling showing if the election were tomorrow, Trump would likely win. So we lean it that way. So the map is not as favorable right now to Joe Biden. In fact, our projection has Trump actually getting to 270. So if you're the President of the United States, what are you doing right now? Playing on your strengths. You've just clinched - you're the presumptive nominee and addressing your weaknesses by getting out into the battleground states, talking about the issues and to the people you need to talk to. Trump has to do the same thing. Even in the results in Georgia tonight, in some areas, Nikki Haley getting a high vote in the suburbs. So that's what you do.

But the other notable part of this as we're looking at this 2020 rematch coming in 2024, it was all about the margins and we see what a critical difference that makes.

He says, the Super PAC working with his campaign says they have enough signatures. No reason to doubt them. We just have to watch the states certify this. In Arizona, a battleground. Michigan, a battleground, Georgia, a battleground. So, again, if you have a Green Party candidate and Robert Kennedy Jr. on the ballot, just like you had Gary Johnson and Jill Stein in 2016. Another one more possibility we're keeping an eye on that's been less effective so far is Cornel West, who right now says he's on the ballot in South Carolina, Utah, Oregon and Alaska. But again, how many third party candidates, which states, right, how many ballots - how many states do they get ballot access and which states. If they are, your Michigan, your Wisconsin, your Pennsylvania, your Georgia, your Nevada, your Arizona, then they could make the difference.",

Committee Chairman Jim Jordan used his time, for example, to suggest the President was in it for the money. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Page 231. You said this: \"President Biden had strong motivations.\" That's a key word. We're getting the motive now. \"President Biden had strong motivations to ignore the proper procedures for safeguarding the classified information in his notebooks.\" Why did he have strong motivations? Because he's - next word - because he decided months before leaving office to write a book - to write a book. That was his motive. He knew the rules. He broke them because he was writing a book. And you further say, and he began meeting with the ghostwriter while he was still vice president. There's the motive. Mr. Hur, how much did President Biden get paid for his book?",

But I got to say that those words did not have the same kind of charge at all today in the wake of President Biden's triumphant State of the Union address, where he was on performance for several hours. He gave a brilliant speech. It was a political game changer. And then he engaged in a lot of amusing and effective repartee with all of the rhetorical ninja fighters and hecklers of the Freedom Caucus. And he showed exactly how with it he is.

It details, I think, in some ways, goes into too much detail things that are extraneous to what his actual finding was, but he did, I think, in a professional way and in a way that well represented the work that he tried to do and that his team tried to do, the fact that they conducted their investigation and there just was nothing to prosecute there.",

And coming out of the hearing, they clearly didn't get what they wanted out of Rob Hur. Republicans have made it clear that they're going to try to get that audio.

And that they possessed it knowingly, and they failed to return it. And that they did so willfully, which in this context means that they did so knowing that they were doing it contrary to law. And with respect to each element, there were problems as to the different tranches of documents that, Mr. Hur looked at.

Because when you really boil it down, Joe Biden, in a sense, got lucky here by all the focus on Robert Hur's assessment of Joe Biden's mental state, his age, really at bottom, it's what one person believes about Joe Biden.But what's been missed in all this, what Adam Schiff was not indignant about was that Joe Biden misled the American people. I mean, let's not lose the headline here. Joe Biden, some of those documents, he genuinely, there's no proof he knew he had, but he absolutely knew. He had at least some of those documents, the documents related to Afghanistan. He's on tape in 2017. He knew he had them. He did not turn them over. He disclosed at least their contents, if not the actual paper documents to his biographer, because he had a specific agenda. He wanted to be the hero in the historical retelling of the Afghanistan story and Obama to be the heel in that story and that has been missed because there's so much focus on the assessment of his memory and his age. That's really damaging. I agree with Jessica when it comes to whether this case should have been charged or not. I think it's important to understand when you're a prosecutor, there's some cases that have to be charged. I think Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago case had to be charged. Then there's some cases that you can't charge. There's a missing element. You just don't have the proof. But then there's a broad discretionary zone. And I think this one fell in that discretionary zone. And so did Robert Hur because he said, I do believe a reasonable juror could have convicted. That doesn't mean you have to charge, but it means he could have, and a different prosecutor could have come to a different result. So Biden got lucky in that sense here.",

Well, that's great for Biden politically, but if he's got photographic memory recall, it's bad for him legally because now you're going to get charged.

They don't think he's, you know, a bad guy that wants to expel, you know, Palestinians from this country or, you know, migrants. At the same time, the problem that Donald Trump has is that this is not the first -- this is not the only case. We're going to hear -- as we just heard last night, we learned new evidence about the way he treated, you know, documents.
