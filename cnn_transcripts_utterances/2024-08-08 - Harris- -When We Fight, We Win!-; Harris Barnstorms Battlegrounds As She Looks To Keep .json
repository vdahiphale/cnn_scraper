      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics. Kamala Harris is battleground blitz. She's heading to Arizona a day after holding rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan in front of two of the biggest crowds Democrats have seen in years. The Democratic energy is on her side. What about critical swing voters in these must win states?Plus, challenging his record. Republicans accused Tim Walz of lying about his military service, but we will bring you the facts on that. And look more broadly at how the Trump campaign is shifting its strategy to fight the new Democratic ticket. And Joe Biden says, he's worried about a peaceful transition of power if Trump loses. I'll ask Maryland Senate candidate and never Trump Republican, Larry Hogan, whether he shares that concern. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. In politics, momentum is everything. And right now, it seems to be on the Democratic side. Take a look at this brand-new poll. Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump by six points when you include third party candidates, and that is outside the margin of error. When you add that to other recent polls, the race is now tied according to a CNN average. Just a month ago, Trump led Joe Biden by five points. Now polls, of course, are just a snapshot in time. And Harris will need more than a tie to win 270 electoral votes. But Democrats say they are feeling an energy they haven't experienced since 2016 or even 2008. Here is Harris and her new running mate, Tim Walz, arriving in Detroit last night. At their second big battle ground state rally of the day, the crowds at both were enormous. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michigan, I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we ready to fight for it? And when we fight, we win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I was struck just a couple weeks ago, early on in her candidacy, when she met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and she was flanked by the American flag. She delivered public remarks after that meeting in a more fulsome way than President Biden even had. So, it's clear that on both the official side and the campaign side, they are having her look the part, to show the American people that not only can she do this job, but in essence that she's already doing it. It's interesting. You mentioned the enthusiasm harkening back to the Hillary days.I was texting with a Democratic operative who was at one of the launch rallies in Milwaukee early on, and they said at the time, this feels Hillary-esque or Obama-esque, and the enthusiasm has only ballooned since then. Some of the polling data now shows her closing that gap, but it is clear that she is not completely overtaking the oxygen and --",

But let's talk about that polling first. Marquette Law School, this poll that we were talking about just her favorability, which matters. In May, 35 percent, now 47 percent. So, that's a pretty big jump. Unfavorable has gone down.And then there's also another really interesting number here. If you look at the enthusiasm across the board among Democrats, independents and Republicans to vote. Everybody has gone up, but the independents, in particular, who were men before are less men now. And that's an official political term. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yeah. I mean, I think it harkens back to Obama, even more so than Hillary. If you remember, with Hillary, there was, quite frankly, some of the same concerns that we heard about Biden. Of course, Biden being an incumbent. But there was this heir apparent that voters weren't necessarily enthusiastic, but just felt like it was this person's turn, or this is just how things were supposed to go, same as Biden, you know, naturally running for a second term, but not necessarily having the enthusiasm of a lot of rank-and-file voters. And that's why, quite frankly, there was some talk about drafting Biden back in 2016, even though that didn't go anywhere. But I do think now when you -- when you see the crowds, and you see how people are talking, not just about Kamala Harris, not just about Governor Walz, but those who are very enthusiastic about making sure Donald Trump has not returned to the White House. And that's something that I think -- it's both. And the energy and the emotion around -- in opposition to Trump is just as palpable as the energy and enthusiasm for Harris and Walz.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J. D. VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him. He said, we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandon your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A National Guard spokesman says, Walz deployed to Italy in 2003 where he was part of a security mission in support of the Afghanistan war, but he never served in Afghanistan.In a statement, the campaign said, quote, in his 24 years of service, the governor carried fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any Americans service to this country. In fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way. Now we also heard Vance accuse Walz of ducking service to Iraq when he left the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. Here's what we know about that. Now, Walz was already running for Congress when his unit received notice, they could deploy to Iraq within two years. He actually retired two months before his unit received official alert orders for deployment. However, it is not clear when Walz actually filed his retirement paperwork, which often happens months ahead of the actual date. He said in 2009, he left the guard to focus on his run for Congress. And so far, no answer from the campaign on that particular issue. CNN's Brianna Keilar is now with us at the table. Bri, you have some new reporting about this.",

And he's a really interesting person to talk to about this, because he does not see eye to eye with Walz on politics at all.In fact, I want to read something from him. He said, from what I know of the situation, they're lying. He says, speaking of those who have come out against Walz from their former battalion, he says, he, Walz was a good soldier, as good of a soldier as you'll find. I'm not trying to defend him. I hope people don't think that. What I'm trying to do is defend someone who served his country. I'm not voting for him. I'll campaign against him. But I don't think it's fair to characterize his service the way they have. Specifically, it's that point that is being made or he says they say that he retired, so he didn't have to go to Iraq. And he says that they are lying about that. That is Joe Eustice's words there. He says, in fact, that Walz was thinking about retiring long before that, because he was thinking about running for office. And he says that in a conversation, Joe used to says, he pointed out to Walz well. Other people have been in Congress or been in office and they've been in the National Guard. But he said that Walz said something to the effect of, yeah, but they get let out of, you know, deployments or assignments, and that looks bad. And Walz didn't want to have that appearance. It's really interesting. He also does the -- on that issue, the weapons of war comment. Eustice says, you know, Walz should answer for that. He should give an explanation as to why he said that.",

They're wondering why so much attention on Tim Walz right now, perhaps is just the first week. But the John Kerry thing, the Swift Boat thing, as it happened, it caught Democrats off guard. There's no doubt about it. And it became a weeks' long campaign. If this becomes a weeks' long campaign, many Republicans think that should be against Vice President Harris on things like immigration and inflation. So, is this kind of a deflection? So, we will see, but this is not one issue. Even though Senator Vance injected this into the bloodstream in one press conference in Michigan, as Brianna pointed out. These are two very different things about when he decided to retire and if he used weapons of war.

And they've seized on those comments too to say, you sat in your house and you're, you know, in your place of safety, in your ivory tower, and just smelled what was going on, on the streets instead of actually getting involved.
