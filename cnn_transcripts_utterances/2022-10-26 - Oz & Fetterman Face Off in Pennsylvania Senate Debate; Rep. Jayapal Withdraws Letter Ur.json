I'm Christine Romans.We begin with the high stakes debate between the two men vying for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat. The first and only face-off between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz quickly spiraled into a series of biting personal attacks. Much of the attention leading up to the debate was focused on Fetterman's stroke in May and how it might affect his performance. Safe to say it did. At times he struggled for words or lost his train of thought. Oz did not draw attention to Fetterman's trouble. Instead he focused on painting Fetterman as, quote, extreme using that word over and over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEHMET OZ (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  John Fetterman takes everything to an extreme and those extreme positions hurt us all. JOHN FETTERMAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  Let's also talk about the elephant in the room. I had a stroke. He's never let me forget that. And I might miss some words during this debate. Mush two words together but it knocked me down, I'm going to keep coming back up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was hard, I believe, for him to make points that he wanted to. It took some time.

As chair of the caucus, I accept responsibility for this. Christine, it's interesting. You said that Democrats were upset thatshe issued this letter to President Joe Biden. Some of the Democrats that were upset with her signed the letter. There were 30 names on this letter when it was sent to President Joe Biden on Monday. Some of them said that if they had known this letter was going to be sent this week, they would have removed their name from this. Because this was written in July, that's what sources told me, and it was never sent. There was a miscommunication in Jayapal's office where aides including Jayapal sent this letter to President Biden without notifying the signers. Many, many of these lawmakers saying, quote, the timing was terrible. It was sent as this war with Ukraine and Russia amped up. Very different circumstances than it was when they wrote the letter in July and it's been edited. Another thing, Christine, this is two weeks from the midterms. There are a lot of moderate Democrats fighting for their seats and now discussion -- while it's been in the Republican Party about whether to continue funding u drain, that discussion is spilling over who have had to qualify their stances about supporting Ukraine. So, this debate has not been including in the Democrats, some that these Democrats, as they fight for control of the House, didn't want the discussion to be this two weeks from the midterms.",

She made an impassioned plea to the judge to reduce her sentence. And she did that for apologizing by what she had done. She admitted her guilt but said it was so hard for her, essentially to paraphrase her, to be away from her family and the other people who had committed much more serious crimes had received much, much less of a prison sentence, much reduced sentences.But none of that emotional plea seems to have had any impact on the Russian judge. The judge upheld the conviction, guilty verdict for Brittney Griner for smuggling drugs, essentially, into the country. Remember she was caught with a tiny, less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage when she came into Russia back in February. And he also basically upheld the sentence as well, that we did reduce it a little bit, by a couple of months. Now she will serve 8 1/2 months. So, there isn't much consolation there. The lawyers on behalf of Brittney Griner said they are surprised and devastate that had this has happened. They were expecting a much bigger reduction of the sentence. I spoke to them last week actually in Moscow and that's what they told me. They're now unfortunately kind of at the end of the road legally. It's not clear whether they'll be able to appeal again to a Russian court and so now what happens is that Brittney Griner will be taken away from her pretrial detention center outside of Moscow where she is now and moved to a more permanent location, a penal colony outside of Moscow. It could be further away. And, of course, the conditions in those Russian penal colonies leaves much to be desired to say the least. The worst sort of moments for Brittney Griner are still potentially ahead of us. Not a good day at all in terms of news for that American basketball star. Matthew Chance, CNN, London.
