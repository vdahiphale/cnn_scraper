      "sentences": "Well, Boris in some ways they have already begun. Over the last five days, Israel has been implementing what it has termed an evacuation corridor, to allow for Palestinian civilians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip to flee south as the humanitarian situation has deteriorated and as the fighting has, of course grown more intense on the ground with Israeli forces pushing deeper into Gaza City.But today the White House's National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby, effectively saying that Israel has agreed to humanitarian pauses in areas of the Northern Gaza Strip. And what he is saying is that these pauses will allow for more humanitarian aid to make it into the northern part of the Gaza Strip and also for civilians to be able to flee south. So this appears to be formalizing what Israel has already begun to implement over the last several days, whether or not this is a widening of what we have seen over the last several days, I think still remains to be seen. What we do know is that tens of thousands of civilians have already made use of these corridors in order to flee south over the last several days. Just yesterday, 50,000 civilians have fled South according to both the IDF as well as U.N. monitors. And so regardless of the language here that's being used by the White House or by the Israelis, it seems clear that at least this will provide some kind of respite for those Palestinian civilians who have been suffering even greater in the last several days and weeks, as we have watched hospitals in Northern Gaza run out of medical supplies, we have seen electricity run out as fuel has become scarce in those hospitals. And this could also, of course, we know allow for some additional mediation on the hostage front as well.",

And there have been about 40 such attacks by these Iran-backed groups against U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria since October 17th.And this was a way for the U.S. to retaliate against those attacks, as well as to try to degrade that Iranian infrastructure that they say is allowing these groups to continue carrying out these attacks. Now, according to Austin, in his statement last night, he emphasized that this was a limited self-defense strike, and that he does not want to see and the U.S. writ large does not want to see this conflict escalate any further. He urged against any further escalation by these groups. And defense officials revealed last night that they have actually been in touch with Iran directly to communicate to them that they expect Iran to stay out of this conflict and to rein in those proxy groups. And so this was a limited according to the Pentagon, self-defense act. And they, you know, were questioned very repeatedly by the Pentagon press corps, about how sustainable this is because the Iran-backed groups, they have continued launching these attacks in recent weeks, even after the U.S. has launched these airstrikes on these ammunition and weapons depots. And so it remains to be seen whether this really has any deterrent effect. Boris?",

And the U.S. is investigating, CENTCOM is investigating the incident.But this comes just a few weeks after a U.S. Navy warship intercepted several missiles and drones by the same Houthi-backed forces that were launched. And according to the Pentagon, they were headed towards Israel. And the U.S., as you can see, is taking a kind of a more active effort here to try to intercept all of these attacks by these Iran-backed groups in the region towards Israel and towards U.S. forces. And that is contributing to the major concern here that this conflict could escalate and spiral out of control, something that the U.S. is communicating to the Iranians as well as other people in the region that they do not want to see. And that is, of course, why they have placed all of that military hardware in the region, including those carrier strike groups, Boris.",

And although I'm glad we responded with the attacks on weapons facilities, I think we may have to consider reacting a lot more quickly when these attacks occur, in order to make clear that we're not going to tolerate those kinds of attacks, and be able to defend our forces.

Except, once again, he wasn't there.The former president and current GOP front runner made his case at a rally nearby. In a few minutes, it's President Biden's turn. He is again hoping to persuade Americans that his economic policies are working, a message that has yet to resonate, according to polls. He'll deliver the message to a crowd of auto workers in Illinois and with some wind in his sails after Democrats notched major wins across the country on Tuesday.

So the challenge for the President in his campaign is to shore up support and make points to know that the economy is moving in the right direction.And here in Illinois, Brianna, he is speaking to a friendly crowd and that is union workers. This is a bloc that buoyed his bid in 2020, and one that he will be leaning on going into 2024. And notably, he's going to meet with UAW President Shawn Fain. Now remember, during the UAW strike, there was back and forth between the White House and the union. And the two of them will be meeting at a plant. And while the -- Fain and -- has not yet endorsed a candidate for 2024, sources I have talked to say that there are positive moves here. The President is moving in the right direction to get that endorsement by visiting the picket line in September, but also by standing with him today. And when asked about this earlier, the President said quote, they're going to be fine, that in response to a question about UAW endorsement, and when that may come. But taking this big picture, Brianna, Illinois overwhelmingly voted for Biden, in 2024. But it is also a state where there are multiple political headwinds that are converging, be it the economy, or also border security. This is a state where Texas Governor Greg Abbott has sent migrants and that has caused strain in Chicago and some sparks tensions between allies of the President like Illinois Governor Pritzker and the Chicago Mayor, with the White House.
