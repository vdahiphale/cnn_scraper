I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi.In the last 30 minutes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has convened his war cabinet as tensions with Iran ratchet up. All eyes are on this story and we will get you the very latest. First up, all the headlines this hour. And U.S. consumer sentiment index for April has just been released. The survey will be watched keenly by markets as inflation proves stubborn there. We'll be breaking that down for you. The U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris visits the key battleground state of Arizona today. Abortion rights loom large as an issue for voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. And Ukrainian officials are becoming increasingly alarmed at not just the number of missile fired by Russia, but by their accuracy. That after a larger scale Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid. Well, we begin with an alarming new threat of military escalation right here in the Middle East. I of course am broadcasting to you from our Middle East programming hub here in the UAE. All eyes are on Iran whose leaders have vowed to take revenge on Israel after a deadly attack on its embassy compound in Syria last week. The strike in Damascus killed Iranian military commanders, and despite the best efforts of diplomats, tensions in this region are hurtling towards breaking point. In the past hour the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his war cabinet saying it is preparing for all scenarios. Let's bring in Nic Robertson from Jerusalem. Just how much of a threat are we looking at here, Nic? Is it clear?",

The expectations at themoment that abound in the region are that Iran will respond to Israel's strike on their consulate in Damascus on the 1st of April where one of their very senior IRGC commander and several other lower-level commanders and other operatives were killed. Iran has said it will. The expectation is they will. The question in the region at the moment is how, through proxy, direct on Israel, not direct on Israel, Israel's interests in the region. And the general sense at the moment is this is potentially imminent. Of course, it creates jitters among the Israeli public, and the very fact that there are various analysis of how this could go down, how an Iran response could go down, how they would do it, and where they would do it. The fact that there's a sense of it could be soon-ish, that can also be something that Iran feeds out through channels to create the jitters. It doesn't even have to be real to be felt, but to that point, you have the head of U.S. Central Command, Germany Erik Kurilla, today at the Hatzor Airbase in the south of Israel, meeting with the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. That was earlier on today. And this is very symbolic of Israel wanting to posture and show, and the United States posture and show, that they stand strong together. This ironclad guarantee of support that President Biden has been talking about for Israel in the face of Iran's threat. And we heard from the IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, just last night telling the Israeli people that Israel is prepared for a possible attack.",

Major General Tamir Hayman is an adviser to the Israeli defense minister. He's the current head of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. And this is a man who's been in the room when key decisions are made in Israeli intelligence and national security. I had a wide-ranging conversation with him about Israel's strategic direction and Tehran's possible response to Israel's attack on its consulate in Damascus. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. (RES.) TAMIR HAYMAN, ADVISER TO THE ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: What we could expect is some form of retaliation by Iran through UAVs, rockets, maybe missiles. But the Iranians does not want to escalate it to a full-scale war. They want to retaliate in order to retrieve back their honor. But they do not want to get the United States involved of the response to their retaliation. So they need to balance that above the level of friction, above the level of retaliate, and below the threshold of a full-scale attack on Iran by United States combined with Israel.

Those strategic messaging signals to Iran to be careful when you try -- when you retaliate from your Iran soil to Israel. It will end up of retaliation against in the first time directly from Israel to Iran and that can escalate. So it's all a matter of risk calculation that the supreme leader in Iran must take.

We cannot afford to end this massive situation that we are facing without the retrieving of maximum hostages back to our home. It's a moral duty. And we can grab the potential strategic connections in turning the Middle East new architecture by normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. And in order to create that kind of a chain of events, you must start somewhere. And we suggest start with the hostage deal. After the hostage deal, you get a ceasefire. Exploit the ceasefire to reimpose the reformed Palestinian Authority as a replacement of Hamas. Instead of chaos, instead of no man's land, instead of rivalries of warlords that will create unstable situation, and that will achieve two goals of the war. The returning back of the hostages and the relieving and the replacement of Hamas as the ruling entity and replacing it with a more moderate, the relatively moderate ruling address, that is the Palestinian Authority. So you have already some sort of a coalition with UAE and Saudi, and the level above it is the United States.

And in 1995, millions tuned in is football legend O.J. Simpson was tried for the killing of his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ron Goldman. Simpson's death this week has revived memories of the case. The trial of the century united America, while exposing its divisions. Simpson was acquitted, but later found liable in a wrongful death civil lawsuit and ordered to pay millions in damages. Well, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin covered the trial and has written a book about it. And he joins us now. Jeffrey, you were in the courtroom covering trials. Just walk us through the significance of that moment and how it shaped the modern media. JEFFREY TOOBIN, AUTHOR, \"THE RUN OF HIS LIFE: THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON\": Well, you have to remember how different the news media was in the mid- 1990s. Cable news existed, but there were many fewer stations. There was CNN, which broadcasts the trial gavel to gavel. There was something called Court TV, which sadly doesn't exist in that form anymore. But there was no FOX News. There was no MSNBC. And there was no internet. There was no social media. So the fact that the existing media focused so intently on the O.J. case meant that there was essentially nowhere else to go but follow O.J. and the fact is the case was incredibly interesting, so people weren't interested in going elsewhere. And so this incredible concentration of attention on the case gave it an importance that I don't think any single news story could even achieve today because the news media is now so much spread out.",

Prosecutors believe that Rocha provided some of this information to the Cuban government as early as 1981, though it is important to note that he was never charged with espionage.
