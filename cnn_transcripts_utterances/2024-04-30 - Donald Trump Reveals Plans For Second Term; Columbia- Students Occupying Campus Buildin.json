In just a moment the editor behind the interviewer joins The Lead.So what is Trump saying he will do? Well, a lot. On immigration, Trump says plans are on to use the military to carry out a mass deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. He's indicating he's willing to sidestep a law that prohibits using American troops against civilians. He says, quote, \"Well, these aren't civilians. These are people that aren't legally in our country. This is an invasion of our country,\" unquote. Asked about the possibility of political violence if he were to lose the election to Joe Biden as he did in 2020, Mr. Trump said he was going to win, and then quote, \"And if we don't win, you know, it depends. It always depends on the fairness of an election,\" unquote. Asked if he would fire a U.S. attorney who refuses to follow his orders to prosecute someone he wants to prosecute. He said, quote, \"It depends on the situation honestly.\" Asked if he would consider pardoning every single one of the nearly 800 rioters convicted of attacking the Capitol on January 6, Trump said, \"I would consider that yes. Yes, absolutely.\" Joining me now to discuss more is Massimo Calabresi, the Washington bureau chief for TIME magazine. Massimo, thanks so much for joining us. So the title the cover story is \"How Far Trump Would Go.\" And your reporter presses Trump in a wide ranging -- range of issues. He opens with this sense, Donald Trump thinks he's identified a crucial mistake of his first term. He was too nice. What does that signify to you?",

I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did the last time I don't think they'll be able to get away with it.\"First of all, fact check, nobody got away with anything last time. Donald Trump lost, fair and square and January 6 was a horrible moment in our nation's history.

In fact, there's not much discussion about winning concrete legislation that they plan to move ahead with. Instead, it was more about a number of congressional committees looking into federal funding, for instance, going to a number of universities as well as sending out letters and trying to get information about somehow the universities are peeking some action here, as well as hearings that we expect with university leaders, for instance, in the House Education and Workforce Committee, we expect Yale, Michigan and UCLA leaders to appear before that committees have been invited to appear by the end of May. So this is more of an oversight effort, Jake. The question is, how far do they take it?If they have to go after the federal funds to some of these universities, do they try to tie it, for instance, to government funding legislation to keep the government open in the fall? They could set up a showdown potentially with Democrats. We'll see if they decide to go that route. The speaker did not move ahead on that aspect of it.

So far, Columbia has not made any official request for NYPD assistance. New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he's going to meet with the leaders of your university determine next steps. What's your message to him and into the administration of Columbia, what should they do about the students in that academic building right now? PLATEKThis is now impeding on every single student's experiences at the greatest degree. Rather, I think going forward, especially into the next year, Columbia must pursue communication and dialogue, as well as help build communication that engrosses multiple perspectives and its academic departments, which up until this point has been unfortunately shown to the greatest degree, with anti-communication becoming the standardized form across student groups and our leaders and our faculty. Columbia started communication too late, which is unfortunately escalated the situation to this degree. And I think it must do whatever it can to de-escalate tensions on campus. Moreover, I do want to emphasize the Columbia does have a responsibility to ensure the safety of its students on campus. So it must do whatever it sees in line with its protocol and its rules to ensure that every student is not at risk of being verbally or physically harassed, which we have unfortunately seen in a lot of incidents over the last few weeks.",

Since then DOJ has been preparing a draft rule on this. And I'm told by a source familiar with the matter has submitted that to the Office of Management and Budget today to begin a regulatory review process. So yes, this is a major move and it will bring major shifts to how the drug is classified how these criminal offenses are treated, which President Biden has twice now been pardoning these simple offenses, but it is still going to take months for it to take effect, Jake?",

But it is widely popular, the legalization of marijuana, 70 percent support it, 79 percent within that age bracket, and it should be noted that President Biden campaigned on this and 2020.

I was really scared that they're going to rape me there, and that they're going to drag me through Gaza streets and parade my body around. I fear that more than been killed. I was chained for three weeks in Gaza. I was kept in a really dark room without being able to move. His name was Mohammed (ph). He untied me. I knew that he is up to something.

And I think the world has not yet fully come to terms with the systematic sexual violence of Hamas by Hamas on October 7th, because I think if they had there would be outrage. And right now there's a little bit of outrage but a lot of ignoring and even worse, some denial. And in this documentary, anyone can hear firsthand from released hostages, you were someone assaulted herself, sexually assaulted herself, but also first responders who saw with their own eyes, absolutely horrific violence. I think we can't deny what happened. We can't ignore what happened. And this gives people a chance to hear it for themselves.",

There were naked women tied to these trees, bloodied, leg spread, crying that he didn't get there early enough to save them.

I think college campuses should be a place where anyone can express, you know, a view and have an honest and civil and peaceful conversation. I believe in peaceful protest. Our country was founded on it. But when you have people screaming at other students who are Jewish, go back to Poland, when you have people screaming, October 7th is going to happen to you over and over again. That is where this movement is turning violent, someone was hurt, people are being hurt on college campuses. There have been threats, 600 bomb threats are more against synagogues, and community centers since October 7th. This is not peaceful protest. And this is not OK.
