Take a listen to what he said.

We have a speaker, he was voted in, and it was a complicated process, and I think it's not an easy situation for any speaker. I think he's doing a very good job.

The judge said he would ask all the jurors when they come in and assemble right off the bat if anyone thought that they couldn't be fair or impartial or for any other reasons, such as travel or religious commitments, be unable to serve on the jury. Anyone who puts their hands up, the judge said he would excuse, saying that polling people individually is time-consuming and doesn't generally yield any different outcome.Trump's lawyers are asking the Judge to separate those questions. They want to know who says that they can't be fair and impartial, distinct from those who say they cannot serve because of some other commitment. This is all because they're trying to build some data as far as their appeal goes. As you know, earlier this week, they asked a judge, an appellate judge to stop the trial. That was denied. One of the reasons is they have been arguing that Trump can't get a fair trial in New York, in Manhattan, where this jury pool will be pulled from, because Manhattanites have tended to vote at Democratic. They wanting to build some data now for that appeal by trying to understand how much -- how many people in the jury poll say that they would be biased against Trump, and they want to separate that from people who just otherwise couldn't serve. You know, the district attorney's office will have a chance to weigh in on this, though it is just a few days away from jury selection and will be up to the judge to decide on Monday morning how he's going to handle that.

And it wouldn't even surprise me if the D.A. agrees.So, here's what the Judge said he's going to do. He said he is going start jury selection by saying, is there anyone here who cannot serve, either because of hardship, meaning you have a job that prevents you, or some other impediment, or because you have such strong bias you can't set on this case. And all that Trump has said he wants the judge to do is separate those into two different questions so that if and when he needs to appeal, he'll be able to say, look how many people we lost out of our jury pool because of bias. That will take essentially zero extra time. It actually will make for a clearer record here, and I think it makes sense for the judge to it.

This is going to be what kicks off this entire process, Wolf, starting on Monday, and it has been an intense point of focus from Trump's legal team for the last several days.Even as they've been trying to delay this trial time and time again, 12 efforts in total, none of them which worked, I should note, in the last several weeks, this is going to be going forward, and they have been hyper-focused on what this jury is going to look like. Because as Elie has noted, you know, it's not necessarily about what the actual arguments are going to be, what it is going to look like, it's what the jurors decide that means. I mean, we've seen just the emphasis of that in last, several days. And it also shows Trump is basically, reluctantly accepted that this going to starting on Monday, despite all those efforts by them to delay it. And they know what influence this has on the jury. The question I have is how it changes Trump's behavior inside the courtroom, because we've seen where he's been in the courtroom and there has been a jury in there, whether it was deciding how much E. Jean Carroll was going to be awarded in her defamation damages, where Trump will speak loudly when he talks to his attorneys, or he'll have those moments where he makes clear that he is displeased with what's actually taking place inside of the courtroom. Does he do that once this jury has been impaneled in this case is going be a big question. He often thinks that can sway people. When he says, Wolf, that he's going to testify, I mean, you got to remember that with a lot of doubt because he said that before. I remember during the Robert Mueller investigation, he claimed he was willing to justify. He never once went and sat down and did an interview with him against the advice of his attorneys. They said he shouldn't. And so we'll see if he actually ends up getting on the stand in this case.",

And as Trump is saying, it may be one of the most important factors going into this.And so I think it's just to prepare to expect the unexpected. I mean, there won't be cameras inside the courtroom, but our reporters will be in there. We'll obviously be covering the key moments of this and what it looks like and what means. I think another thing for the Trump team that they are watching closely, and that it is not clear until it actually happens, what it's going to look like, is how he responds when all of these people from his past get up there on the witness stand in front of him. And it not just the Michael Cohens and the Stormy Daniels and maybe the Karen McDougals, it's also people, Wolf, who used to work closely with him, people like Hope Hicks, who certainly could be called to the stand.

And Vice President Harris was exactly right. When this is back in the hands of people in the states and they're looking at the decision of more bans, more suffering and less freedoms, every time this issue has come up at the state level, it has gone to the pro-abortion crowd, and it's a very energizing message. So, I think it's important for Trump and Republicans up and down the ticket to make sure that we understand that you can be pro-life, you can be anti-abortion, but you also understand the political reality and make sure we communicate. Look, we must have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.

And President Biden moved decisively six months ago by deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups, of thousands of Marines and other forces to the region and issuing clear and direct pushback to Iran at the time. And when militias attacked a number of American bases and facilities and personnel in the region, President Biden took action and we haven't had any more attacks on Americans in last several months.This is a real risk. Iran is a real threat to stability, security, and peace in the region. And the United States and our other regional allies, obviously, principally Israel, need to stand firm. One of the reasons that Hamas carried out this horrific attack back on October 7th, six months ago, was to stop the recognition by Saudi Arabia of Israel and the potential reconciliation of Israeli with much of Arab world. That's long been Iran's goal, is to keep Israel isolated. It's important to remember that Iran has gone to great lengths to train, arm, and equip a whole series of proxies throughout the region that have continually contributed to chaos and destabilization.",

It's set to begin on Monday.Brian Todd has a closer look now at how this historic case all came together. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  It wasn't until almost 12 years after the affair allegedly occurred that the world first learned of the allegations of hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in the weeks before the 2016 election, Donald Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to the adult film star to keep her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 encounter. Later, former Trump Attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, quote, for the principal purpose of influencing the election and that Trump later reimbursed him. Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments and gave jarring testimony to Congress. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY:  I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.",
