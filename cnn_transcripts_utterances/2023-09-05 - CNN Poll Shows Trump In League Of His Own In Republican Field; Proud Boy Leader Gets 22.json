Donald Trump's path to the Republican nomination is not only getting more dominant, it's becoming more bulletproof. And as the indictments against him grow, so does his stranglehold on the field. And new CNN numbers show one of the reasons why, voters just aren't worried. A majority of Republican voters and conservative-leaning Independents say that they aren't concerned that the charges against him will hinder his ability to win the general election, nor would the case hurt his ability to serve for another full term. Now, at least one of his rivals, Nikki Haley, suggests not putting too much stock into what these polls say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in that hypothetical general election matchup that she mentioned with President Biden, a Biden win is hardly a given. The two are neck and neck, at least at this very moment in time. And joining me now is former Republican Congressman in South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford. Governor Sanford, thank you very much for joining us. So, as you look at these numbers, do you see it the way it seems to be, which is that Trump's support is pretty locked in right now in the Republican Party? FMR. GOV. MARK SANFORD (R-SC): I think the operative thing that you just said was right now. And it is so early in the process. I mean, I've been through my share of elections over the years. And, you know, at this point, I'll just give you one quick antidote that I think tells the whole story. I went to the debate there in Milwaukee. And the next morning, I got in the cab and I asked the cab driver, and he told me, you know, who do you think won the debate? And he sort of paused and he says, you know, I think it was that Indian guy. I kind of liked him. But, you know, I also kind of liked a couple of women. But I liked that woman that was wearing the white dress best. Of course, there was only one woman. It was Nikki Haley. And I did like that black guy. That was about as detailed as he could get. And so at this point in the campaign, what we're really measuring is sort of name I.D., wherein Biden and Trump will stand way out front. But we've got a long way to go. And I think it's telling the caucus process in Iowa and how that can upset the apple cart and the degree to which, you know, Governor Christie -- excuse me, Governor Sununu, has said I'm going to make it my job to make sure Trump doesn't get elected. So, I think we've got some potholes in the road to this being a coronation. PHILLIP: Perhaps. But I mean, those two fellow South Carolinians that you mentioned that that man described in that way, Tim Scott and Nikki Haley. I mean, they're in single-digit support in our latest poll. No other Republican is even close to Trump. And that includes Ron DeSantis. At this point, what do you think that they should do to make defeating Trump a possibility? Is there anything that you can see them doing that would actually change this dynamic in the race?",

He apologized to the judge saying in part, quote, my candidate lost. I felt like something was personally stolen from me. Every media channel that I turned to told me I was justified.

Now they've been rebuked again, but they insist that they are appealing to the Supreme Court.

The pre-clearance provision would have required Alabama to have its maps cleared by a federal authority before they tried to put them into place.It was designed to avoid this kind of recalcitrance at the expense of this litigation. Who pays for this litigation? Is it the K.I.V., the governor? Is it the secretary of state? Is it the attorney general?

I hope the courts will stand strong and compel Alabama to comply, but they are playing politics with the right of black voters to be full and first-class citizens and to participate equally in the political process, and it is no joke.",
