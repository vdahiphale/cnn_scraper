Also, over the next two hours, a region on the precipice of war. Iran vowing retaliation against Israel after the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. After weeks of protests, Bangladesh's Prime Minister resigns, ushering in an interim government there, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling an emergency meeting after anti-immigrant riots and a weekend of unrest. Right. Now the red that we are seeing in U.S. futures today follows a historically bad day on the NIKKEI. Japanese stocks suffering their biggest one day drop ever with fears of a U.S. economic slowdown sending shockwaves through global markets now all this of course, following last Friday's weaker than expected U.S. Jobs Report. Let's get you into CNN's Marc Stewart joining us now from Beijing to take us through what we have seen on those Asian markets. Why Marc, did the NIKKEI plunge and take the other Asian benchmarks with it? MARC STEWART, Right, Becky, as you know from having covered business yourself, traders like to buy when they have reason to celebrate, and they'd like to sell when they have concern. And right now, there is just a lot of concern not only here in Asia, but around the world. And to understand the Asia story, we really need to look back to Friday and the United States when that lackluster Jobs Report came out. Not the best, not the worst, but it did not bode too well among traders in Wall Street. So, we saw a sell off. Well, let's fast forward to Monday morning here in Asia, when traders woke up, they were faced with this ongoing news that high interest rates would be a part of life in Japan. The Bank of Japan recently made some announcements to say interest rates are going to remain high for a while. Well, that means the cost of borrowing is more, the cost of doing business is going to cost more and so we saw a sell off today. Now what happens on one continent often transpires and moves to the next. So, so far today, we have seen low weak numbers in Europe. And now as you mentioned, a very weak trade. I mean, almost -- I mean, a very big sell off already in the works on Wall Street. Because if we look ahead to what the U.S. is facing some of the biggest companies in the world, American companies, brands that we know are going to start to report their earnings. And the concern isn't how they did last quarter, but about the future as so many companies and so many CEOs -- you know whisper about this idea of a recession. It was just last week we heard Amazon executives expressed concern that in the months ahead, yes, they would see growth, but it wouldn't be as fast as it was in the past. Intel announced layoffs. So, for all of these reasons, combined, markets as we follow the sun seem to be selling off and I think Wall Street is certainly bracing for a very difficult day ahead.",

Meantime, you have said for sometime that you see the probability of a recession to be 35 percent. I've seen various numbers doing the rounds. And today we see numbers being adjusted, does your view remain the same at this point? El-ERIAN: So, my view remains the same 35 percent with the balance of risk to the upside, meaning that if 35 percent turns out to be wrong, it's more likely to be higher than lower. But what has happened to consensus is amazing. I was pretty lonely at 35 percent, people tended to have much, much lower number. And now we're seeing consensus shift. Not only are some analysts urging the Fed to cut back by a half a percentage point when it meets in September which will to be unusual to start the cutting cycle with half a percent. You have some asking for an emergency cut. So, consensus has moved viciously from one side to another. And that's again, people being caught off sides.",

And you and I, by the way, have been speaking, I think -- you know since sort of the early 90s. And we all remember the strength of the Yen back in the day. And we are seeing a significant uptick in the Yen at present, which of course, you know, has a significant impact on Japanese stocks. You know, what -- what's your sense of what we're seeing on those currency markets and the impact, broader impacts at this point? EL-ERIAN: So, Becky absolutely right. The stronger Yen is adding to all the headwinds that Japanese equities are facing. And that is why the Japanese market has sold off so violently. Now, why is the Yen strength? Well, one factor, as you know, that plays into currency values is the different levels of interest rates. So as the markets have forced down dramatically, U.S. yields, suddenly Japanese yields, would have been lower don't look so out of whack. So, the interest rate differential has moved in favor of the Yen. And that has strengthened the Yen, which in turn has weakened the currency. So, we are seeing the spill overs and spill backs that are happening when markets are surprised by certain development. And in this case, it is the notion that the U.S. economy is much weaker than people anticipated.",

Stay with CNN to see that opening bell. But let's get you to the Middle East and to growing fears of Iranian retaliation against Israel. International diplomacy is in full gear, including a rare visit to Tehran by Jordan's Foreign Minister making the case for de-escalation as concerns over a wider regional war grow. Jomana Karadsheh is here with me. And I think we have to be very clear here and underscore the importance of the vision that we have just seen.

The Jordanians have been very concerned since October about the situation in the region about the widening of the conflict in Gaza. You've heard the warnings from King Abdullah from senior officials. And now clearly, they see how serious and dangerous this moment is that you had Ayman Safadi, the Foreign Minister traveling himself to Tehran, saying that he was willing -- he was invited by the Iranians to be there, and that he was not there to deliver any messages to the Israelis. But that doesn't mean that he's not there to carry messages to the U.S. As we know, we've heard Becky tonight at about 11:00 a.m. Eastern President Biden is going to be speaking with King Abdullah of Jordan, and we would expect that he's probably carrying a message.

What I'm trying to think about five days ago now, six days ago? The response has been, we will retaliate, you will suffer Israel. Now, of course, Israel has never accepted responsibility for that assassination. But the Iranians clearly believe it was Israel. And we, of course, have been here before, to a certain extent back in April. We saw what we could describe as a tit for tat although the react -- retaliation from Tehran in response to Israel, bombing an Iranian asset in Syria was huge. But well flagged, well telegraphed to the region and to the U.S., and therefore the impact less than it might have been.

They have been humiliated with an assassination that took place on their soil. They're going to have to respond. They're going to have to set deterrence again, for the Israelis.

The military in Bangladesh says itwill form an interim government hours after the Prime Minister resigned.

And we're also hearing from the army chief who held a press conference earlier today that Bangladesh will be consulting with the president of the country to decide who and what timing, they will be running the country. Now the army chief declined to answer any questions about when or if there would be holding elections about the timing of that, because he said it was too soon. But what he did say was that he wants these protesters to maintain peace, to stop protesting and to stop going out on the streets and calling for these demonstrations, and instead cooperate with the army. He's also promised that the police would stop using any violence, which is a very significant message because as we know, Becky, these protests have turned quite violent in these past few weeks. Police have used tear gas against demonstrators. They've opened fire on these protesters, sometimes - - you know near them, sometimes directly at them, according to one of our fixers on the ground there. And demonstrators have retaliated by setting fire to buildings to homes, and even killing protesters and police in recent days. So again, you know, these protests have been very violent, very disruptive to the entire country. But now we can assume that a new political structure will take place. And one thing I also want to note is that there's certainly a sense of jubilation and celebration in Bangladesh at the moment, because they were successfully able to oust their political leader. The student protesters desperately wanted to see her being held accountable for what they say was a gross mis-judgment and just simply a gross way of handling the country and these demonstrations. They felt that she needed to hold accountability and responsibility for these deaths and many, many injuries.",

Rioters broke intohotels, housing asylum seekers and tried to set fire to them. And the Refugee Council has condemned the attacks as you would expect. The riots began after three young girls were killed in Northwest England. This was exacerbated by the far right spreading disinformation including claims the attacker was an immigrant.

Today he'salso spoken after chairing this COBRA meeting after what just one month in office. And what he said following this meeting was that he had ministers had agreed upon setting up a what he described as a standing army of specialist officers to tackle violent protests to ensure that officers can get to where they need to get to more efficiently. Also, to ramp up the criminal justice, the identifying, the arresting, the processing of these people who were involved in his violent disorder. And we've already heard from judges saying that potentially the courts could run 24 hours a day in order to process this number of people and also talking about how the law applies online as much as it does offline. Because of course, the spark for these protests last week in the wake of that horrific killing of those three small girls, the injuring of eight others, and two adults also still in hospital as well spread online, particularly X. And I have to say it's not really been helped by the owner of X and the most followed person Elon Musk with almost 200 million followers, posting amplifying comments, for example, from Tommy Robinson, the far-right activist who has also been very much involved in commenting, and perhaps inflaming tensions here. And -- you know responding to that and also talking about -- you know the potential for civil war in the U.K. and how if there's no integration, then -- you know violence is inevitable.

They can't -- inflation don't forget, 18 months of high inflation has taken more money out of people's pockets. So, although prices aren't going up as fast, they are still high. People can't afford what they used to be able to buy. And this is going to play out and what you're seeing, you know, I hate to age you any more than I hate to age myself, Becky. But this is classic, there is -- you know part of me wants to scream, stop panicking everybody. This is what was meant to happen. The danger here is in markets that move faster than before in meme stock trading and peeping in consumer trading. This can become a self-fulfilling prophecy much faster. And that's why I think you're right, to point out that the Fed could act before its next meeting in September. I don't think it will. I think if the Fed were to act, at least at the moment, it may maybe if we have many days of this sort of selling, it could step in because it will be accused of propping up the market, which is exactly the accusation that was levelled at the Bernanke Fed, the Greenspan Fed to some extent Yellen had the same criticism. So, Powell doesn't want to be seen as doing Wall Street's bidding when it knows Main Street is hurting.

It is a brutal start to the newtrading day in New York and on Wall Street. Those markets actually not as bad as they were on the open. But still, it's a massive story, isn't it. And it's not only U.S. stocks indices around the world have been tumbling, as fears of a U.S. economic slowdown send shockwaves through the global markets. And that was prompted by Friday's disappointing U.S. Jobs Report. Plus, Warren Buffett, the famed investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway sold -- has says that Berkshire has sold off half of its Apple stock. That is a very specific story. But there's a wider story out there as well there today. CNN's Clare Duffy joins us live from New York. All things to tech stocks at CNN. I don't know where you want to start. I tell you what, let's have a look at the NASDAQ. It's just shy of 5 percent lower the S&amp;P off nearly 4 percent.

That stock is the world's biggest company by rev -- oh sorry by metrics on the stock market. A 10 percent sell off is something like a, what, $350 billion sell off today.

At the same time when fewer people are buying EVs. We're starting to see a sort of slowdown in people's interest in this market as far as consumers go. At the same time, I think Tesla struggles because it has to deal with its CEO, Elon Musk, who turns a lot of consumers off. In recent weeks, he has endorsed Former President Donald Trump which I think potentially alienates some of the more liberal, you can imagine California consumers of this company might be turned off by the CEO who is so sort of loud on social media about some of his more extreme views. And so, I think there's a few different things going on there. But at the core, I think Tesla is really struggling with the competition and having to cut its own prices, because it's dealing with that competition.",

We're starting to see the wage growth gap continue to increase. So, in essence, the wages are staying flat, while costs are starting to increase where it comes from -- you know foods to rent. And so, people start to kind of panic where that U.S. debt for the average consumer also is at an all- time high. So, when you add all those things together at a micro level, it starts to add on a macro level when people don't want to spend money as much where people are starting to kind of pull back. And then it kind of hurts businesses where businesses are trying to not put investments into their business and their companies, which then less profit, and then goes into the revenue as well. And so all of this is starting to spark a little bit together with these variables that we're seeing that the market starts to be more fearful.

They wanted to do in December. But what does 25 basis points really mean at this point, as of today in a panic market, not very much just signaling that you're going to make more cuts. So, I think, as of today, if we see more data like this, Becky, they're going to have to do more than 25 basis points this year. They're going to have to be more aggressive. And yet still, we won't still feel it until next year, but there have to be a little more aggressive. So, if the Fed didn't want to be aggressive, they should have made a cut last time, which in June or in an aspect and now September comes, I think it'll be depending what's going to happen over the next couple of weeks to see how hard that they will make a cut. Should they still want to hold that plan?",
