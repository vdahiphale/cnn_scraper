As Hope Hicks once -- one of his closest confidant and most trusted aides is now on the stand. Talking about how Trump ran his business and his 2016 presidential campaign.This is CNN special live coverage. I'm Kaitlan Collins here in New York. Hope Hicks just acknowledged that she didn't know the tabloid king David Pecker, the first witness that we heard from in this trial. She said that he and the former president she would describe as quote, friends. She also testified that she was present at times for Trump's phone calls with David Pecker. And at one point said that they were incredibly close, and Trump praised reporting that came out in the National Enquirer. CNN's Laura Coates and Paula Reid are back here with me. And Paula, I think one thing that's really notable about this line of testimony that we've gotten from Hope Hicks, where she's been praising Donald Trump saying, what a good communicator he is with the media. Talking about how bare bones the 2016 campaign was. But essentially saying Donald Trump was an incredibly hands on manager, whether it was his business or his campaign. And that every time she issued a statement on the campaign's behalf, she checked with him first.",

He knew this was happening. And then he was aware, the documents were falsified when Michael Cohen was reimbursed.So, this seeming, you know, like throwaway comments by a lot of people about how involved he was in his day-to-day business, either the Trump organization or the Trump campaign will be significant for the prosecutors.",

Laura, the day that they found out that Stormy Daniels wanted more money in exchange for her story as that campaign was getting in its final days. And she was describing the campaign travel in the fall of 2016, saying they were together almost every single day. And in most days, they would return to Trump Tower at the end of the day.Why are they getting into, you know, the routine of what it was like in those final weeks of the campaign? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, they want to establish again. This is the timing of it that it was for the purpose of the campaign that they falsified business records. Hope Hicks is not having additional follow. There's actually an update that she says that she became aware of the Access Hollywood tape on October 7 after receiving an email from Washington Post reporter, so you can comment on it. And so, she also was in the office on the 14th floor of Trump Tower at that time. And so, they're trying to establish that all this was done not for the purpose of trying to protect one's personal life, but for the purpose of knowing that it was going to impact the campaign in some way. Her being in these rooms during the conversation because Hope Hicks got the motivation. What were they actually saying about it? Was it literally a conversation when you said, I've heard about this. What about Melania? And that's it. Or was it -- what about the campaign? You remember, David Pecker testified. He thought that it was about the campaign that he never mentioned Melania Trump. Did he ever mention anything about his personal life. She can sort of thread that needle for us.",

I mean, it was a remarkable -- maybe an 18-wheeler is a better description, because it was a remarkable moment in the campaign where they were sent into real panic mode about what it meant for them.",

Michael Cohen was testifying, or they were hearing about his testimony yesterday through Ken Davidson about the idea that he was angry. He wasn't going to go to the White House with him.And I remember, thinking the time leading up December. If the defense wants to portray Michael Cohen as a sycophant who will do anything, for example, David Fahrenthold also writing to Hicks on October 7. I have extremely urgent requests for you today. We're waiting to see what that request would have been. But suffice to say, it likely is after the entirety of -- we know this is the actual reporter on Washington Post. And what she would be able to do for him was to get some sort of a comment. And she forwarded, of course, to the rest of the campaign. But the timing is so crucial. If you're the defense, you want to show that Michael Cohen had some other motivation for making sure this was not going to get into the world. He wanted to benefit somehow from Trump being in office, and he wanted to get an attaboy and a pat on the back. If she can connect the dots to the prosecution and suggest, this was a terrifying moment of the fog of Access Hollywood. And to have one more claim, be like that straw on the camel's back. That would have been problematic. And again, that's what you have (inaudible) coming in, saying, I've got this. I need to get paid for it. So, this is all going to be part of their master plan of summing it all up and the timing of. But you're so right, Paula. We are almost what 11 days in, and the jury is probably finally now going OK, somebody who's right in the circle, who knows him really well, who's been in every room where it happened.

I suspect the jury likes her. I suspect the jury is riveted. And she will be an extraordinarily effective witness for the people. And it will be very interesting to see how the defense handles her on cross examination. I mean, a woman who walks into a courtroom and says, I'm really nervous to be here.

But I think the defense -- and look these are experienced defense lawyers. They know this probably better than I do.

They were in the middle of debate prep because Donald Trump was 48 hours away from being face-to-face with Hillary Clinton. What about -- what Hope Hicks had to say that every time she put out a statement for the campaign, she checked with Donald Trump first and got his permission.

Thank you so much. And we're hearing now from the courtroom. Hicks says she shared the content, quote, verbally with Trump. Saying, she has a vague recollection of starting to read the transcript and Trump finish reading it himself. OK. That must have been a bit awkward. As we continue to get updates from this really dramatic set of questions and answers. Hope Hicks, quote, he said, that didn't sound like something he would say.

      "sentences": "So, a very interesting witness to call. Listen, I've actually been skeptical that Hope Hicks makes a lot of sense for the prosecution. And I say this because of this. Yes, Hope is a consummate insider. She was very close to Donald Trump, especially in this -- this juncture of the first campaign.But this is a woman who I -- she's not partisan. She's not ideological, but she is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump. Even after January 6, she never publicly broke with him though we now know they haven't communicated in some time. And I think that what you can expect and what we've kind of seen so far is she's very direct and calculated and how she's answering questions.",

And I'm going to have to do this a few times because I want you and our viewers to see what's happening because she is on the stand as we speak. She was asked about the media coverage and media coverage, of course about the Access Hollywood tape. Hicks bites her lip quote, it was intense.And then Hicks says, it knocked news out -- excuse me, knocked news of a category 4 hurricane out of the news cycle. It was all Trump all the time for the next 36 hours. She recalled. Go ahead, Alyssa.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. No, I'm sorry. I just want to -- I want to ask you a follow-up to that question before I do. An update from inside the courtroom. Trump is leaning back now with his eyes closed and now Hicks as to released statements criticize -- criticizing Donald Trump raises Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. Trump bobbed his head when she said their names. That is -- maybe the least surprising thing that's happened so far in this courtroom today.But Alyssa, on the whole question of his involvement. Yes, it is. I don't think anybody would disagree with you that given her long relationship, despite the fact that they had a semi falling out after January 6, that she's not going to throw him under the bus intentionally. But if the prosecutions intent is to establish Donald Trump as somebody who was very involved, as you just said, in order to make that connection between what Trump did with Michael Cohen, to try to make their case that he broke the law with regard to his records. Could she be helpful unintentionally on that?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think that the biggest value she can add for the prosecution is explaining what she had. And I think we'll hear more of it of how hands-on he was with anything, any statement that went out about him, anything that was publicly stated, especially in response to a scandal. I mean, an analogy I can give of my time with him. During the George Floyd protests, he put out this infamous and horrific statement when the looting starts the shooting starts.And I spent hours trying to get him to allow me to personally walk that back, or to do it in his own words, and he's somebody who is so direct. He's so hands-on. He will not let something go out under his name without hands-on approach. So, I think she could offer us some insight on that with regard to this specific scandal.",

      "sentences": "Oh. That's really interesting. We're waiting for another update from inside there. But just talk more broadly about Hope Hicks. And I mentioned -- I mean, you now famously quit the White House after some -- a little bit of time after the election in 2020. And you never looked back. She is somebody who has been pretty loyal. The only thing that has upset Donald Trump were some text messages, which she thought were private.Alyssa, Hicks is looking at prosecutor Colangelo, and the jury while answering questions. She does not appear to have looked at Trump so far during her testimony. So, bounce off of that if you will, Alyssa. And also talk about their relationship and where she is right now. Forgive me. Before you do that, prosecutors put Mitch McConnell's statement after the Access Hollywood tape on the screen for Hicks and the lawyers. Trump leans in to look at the statement briefly.

      "sentences": "Listen, this is going to be hard for Hope. Hope was always somebody -- she's very shrewd. She's thoughtful. She's calculated and how she operates. But she deliberately always wanted to be behind the scenes. She's not somebody who wanted to be in front of a camera. She's not somebody who, you know, as I said, publicly broke with Trump and she's led a largely private life since leaving the administration. And she was fiercely loyal to him.Her career, she did not come up in politics. She came up a PR in New York, working with Ivanka Trump, and then was brought on to the campaign. And in many ways, she was seen as like an extension of the Trump family. She was close with the kids. She was deeply close to Donald Trump for his entire term in office. And she's one -- she and I are one of a handful of staffers who did multiple stints in the Trump White House. She was first his comms director. Left for a job at Fox and then came back as counselor in this very senior sort of advising role. And Hope was someone that in the West Wing, if you needed to get through to Trump and you were struggling to, you would go to -- because she did. She knew him. He trusted her. I think this is uncomfortable for both of them. He really -- Hope is one of the few people he holds an incredibly high esteem. And I think to see her, you know, on the stand in front of him is probably very challenging and hard for him to see. And this reminder because he wanted her to come back and she basically had to convince her to come back to the White House that she's no longer, you know, with him publicly.",

And as we speak, attorneys have approached the judge's bench after an objection. So, they're sort of haggling over what can and cannot be admitted into -- into evidence there. And as part of the questioning, of course, of Hope Hicks.Thank you so much, Alyssa, for coming on and giving us that's really valuable insight into this relationship and into the broader inner workings of Trump world.
