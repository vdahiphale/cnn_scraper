I think it's anybody's guess what this company looks like in a week, let alone a year from now, ElonMusk has made some really big promises about what he wants Twitter to look like, growing revenue, growing its users massively relying more on subscription revenue, and even some more out there suggestions, like having users pay for each tweet with Dogecoin. So you know, I think it's, it's up to him now to make good on some of those promises and we will see what happens. You know, I think by the same token, he has started to realize, too, that at least for now, he is going to rely on advertising. He has previously said that he hates advertising. It is clear he wants to move the platform away from advertising. But for now, advertising makes up 89 percent of the company's revenue, and you see him yesterday posting a letter to advertisers saying, you know, we don't want Twitter to become a free for all hellscape where people can say anything that they want without consequences. So I think, he is trying to walk a line for you know, for right now, and we'll see what happens.",

Almost every initiative that somebody tries to do to make the world better, is undercut by some minority shouting down those people who are trying to accomplish something for the benefit of the world.

What January 6 represented was not the peak and then a decline, but rather a peak and a maintaining of a summit, really a plateau at a summit level of these heightened threats. So, here's what we know about this case, which is just the latest example of all of this. We know that this happened at 2:30 this morning. Sources tell CNN that this assailant broke into the back of the home and attacked Paul Pelosi. When San Francisco Police arrived around 2:30, San Francisco Police say that they witnessed both Paul Pelosi and the suspect holding onto a hammer and apparently it was in that moment that the suspect was able to wrench the hammer away from Paul Pelosi and attack him. The San Francisco Police immediately tackling that suspect taking him into custody. He is now, Richard, facing a list of charges that includes attempted murder, burglary, elder abuse among a list of other felonies. More to learn on him. What we have so far after digging through his social media posts, as well as speaking with acquaintances is that he grew up in Canada. He moved to California about 20 years ago and his social media shows posts that include multiple conspiracy theories about COVID vaccines, as well as perpetuating these lies that the 2020 election was stolen. Certainly many more details to figure out, but right now that man is in custody, so no longer a threat to anybody else in the public. The big questions now are what Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies are going to do to protect these lawmakers? Our understanding is that the US Capitol Police, the chief agency responsible for protecting lawmakers is assessing the security options at this point and assessing the resources -- Richard.",

And when you consider just how massive the physical space that they cover is, the Capitol and the Capitol complex here in Washington, as well as the hundreds of lawmakers and then exponentially growing by the number of their family members, it is a difficult job that they alone cannot take on and that is why their relationship with local agencies on the ground is so critical. So we're digging into what those relationships had been, in what ways they may in the future be leaning on their local partners to pick up the slack here, Richard, because you raise a good point, you've got to have a body out there to deter a potential attack. Certainly that was the case when someone tried to attack Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house. There were US Marshals on the ground and the alleged assailant walked away.",

And we can talk about what we're actually starting to see this week. Amazon, in its most recent quarter posted, Richard, $127 billion of sales. Apple, 90 billion. I mean, these are the type of sales that most companies would kill for. And they've benefited from not just that high growth, but also stocks that for about 10 years went one direction, practically up. And also tech trends because of the COVID lock downs. And now this week, we started to hear a different tune from a lot of the tech players. For example, some of the ad players like alphabet and Meta, certainly, in the case of Meta reporting slowing advertising spend as other companies start to feel a bit more cautious about the outlook, right? You think about some of the cloud computing names, as you pointed out, AWS, but also Microsoft saying that they're seeing softer revenue, as again, companies start to feel a bit more cautious about the outlook. So the headline or the conclusion rather, Richard, is that at a time when it felt like these growth companies, these tech companies were immune from perhaps a slowdown, it's looking like after this week, there's really not a lot of places to hide, they too, are vulnerable.",

Amazon, although it is starting to see some slowdown in its cloud business, it still has its retail business although it is warning of a slowdown. It has its cloud business, it has its retail business, so it has a better boat so does -- moat rather, so to speak. Amazon or Apple rather also has a pretty significant vote because it has subscription services, right? It also gets quite a bit of revenue from. So I think the question in this type of environment is who was better shielded from the economic headwinds? Who has a better moat? Who has more diversification?

I just don't want my kids to go hungry, she says. She fears they may if President Jair Bolsonaro is reelected even though he raised welfare payments ahead of the election. In the view she says Bolsonaro didn't fulfill his promises and is only given us the subsidy to see if he can get more votes. People here know better than to expect too much from either candidate. But from former President Lula de Silva, they expect something. I intend to vote for Lula she tells us because Bolsonaro has been there for four years and in four years, he's not been able to do much. NEWTON (on camera): From Brazil's impoverished suburbs to the streets of its commercial capital inflation is biting here. Access to food as become a central election issue and a convenient campaign promise these tens of millions continue to live in poverty. NEWTON (voice over): A Bolsonaro rally supporters ridicule Lula. Calling him a thief who belongs in jail, hardly a savior of the poor. Even Hilda sees Lula's past corruption scandals differently. Every single one that is in there steal something, she says. Even just a little. They are talking about Lula and saying he sold maybe he did. But at least he takes care of us, takes care of the poor. Bolsonaro has spent billions on welfare subsidies in the lead up to the selection, trying to prove he can save Brazilians from hunger. Robson Mendonsa (ph) has been feeding the hungry for decades. He says hundreds more have been lining up at his soup kitchen in recent months. And he's troubled that the desperate plight of so many is being exploited for votes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Bolsonaro was even capable of lying on national radio saying there is no hunger in Brazil. They don't see anyone asking for bread at the bakery. He doesn't know reality. There are millions asking for a plate of food because they can't feed themselves. To win, both presidential candidates need to count on votes from those who can't count on their next meal. A stark snapshot of what's at stake for Brazil's hunger.
