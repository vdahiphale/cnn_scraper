Tomorrow, we're going to see Trump exercise or see whether he still has the grip he says he has -- he probably does -- on the Republican Party in the most remarkable way. And why remarkable? Because at one point, it may have seemed completely impossible.But tomorrow, Trump is going to huddle with House and Senate Republicans just a few feet from the Capitol, that same Capitol that his supporters stormed on January 6th. This kind of blew my mind to think about. This will be his first public visit to the Hill since that day, nearly three and a half years ago. Isn't that surprising to think about? It has been the first time publicly? Now his critics are calling it a return to the scene of the crime. But his supporters, well, they're all ears. And some of the lawmakers that he will speak to tomorrow had at one point suggested that they were completely done with him after January 6th, and that includes, by the way, the then-majority leader, Mitch McConnell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.

And, of course, Senator McConnell and others said, we're team players, the voters said he's our choice. And so, they're signing up for it. And that's where I have the analogy of a shotgun wedding.

We're seeing this drama play out both in the United States and, as you said, around the world, in Europe as well.We've been doing this since the 1790s. We've been trying to figure out in each given era how forward leaning we should be and to what extent should we try to stay more on our side of the ocean. What history has taught us again and again and again is that isolationism does not in the end work because we are inevitably drawn into conflicts that are about perhaps our values, perhaps our trade, perhaps both. And I think what President Biden is doing is acting in the role of a fairly traditional role. And in an argument that really since 19 -- certainly since 1945, the idea that we would have an Atlantic alliance against an expansionist authoritarian force based in Russia or the Soviet Union wasn't really up for debate.

I'm sure there's something we don't see. But by and large, most of us are icebergs and most of us is hidden. He is sort of the opposite.And when he quotes Macron saying in that early meeting when President Biden said America is back, and the French president says, but for how long, totally rational question for Europe to ask. Remember, the former president, the Republican nominee, rose in many ways to the republican nomination in 2016 not only on immigration, but on a kind of, if you will, seemingly elective attack on NATO. One of those things that was sort of NATO was not maybe for you, was not a, you know, big subject in the minds of a lot of folks, but President Trump in that era was insistent on countries paying their fair share. It was sort of an interesting kind of isolationist argument. So, what I think you see with President Biden, who's returning to Europe, is a man who grew up in and has governed for a long time in a world of alliances, an Atlantic world that, by and large, has kept the peace after the greatest cataclysm in the history of warfare in the 1940s that began with an expansionist European force taking countries that did not belong to them.

You had Robert E. Lee and Turner Ashby, all men who helped to lead the pro-slavery states in the Civil War. But just last month, the school board, they reversed this decision, and in another five to one vote, ordered the names to be restored.

So that's part of our claims.We're also bringing claims under the First Amendment because here in America, of course, we have the right to disagree with the government and the right not to be forced to carry the government's message.
