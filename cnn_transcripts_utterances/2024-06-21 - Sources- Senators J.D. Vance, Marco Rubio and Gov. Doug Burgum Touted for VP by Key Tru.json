You have an increasing number of people jockeying to be in Trump's ears, pushing their preferred candidate and really we're seeing this from every corner of Donald Trump's orbit, from his family to conservative media to his former advisors, all of them pitching different people to Donald Trump.And so as you said, I've really been told from my conversations with Trump's campaign that the list has narrowed to three people, Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance and Doug Burgum and also that Donald Trump has actually taken on a much more serious and earnest approach to looking at this process, which is a departure from the past several months. But each of these men have different people pushing them. So I'm going to break it down for you. J.D. Vance. Don Jr., Donald Trump's son, has long been a close friend of J.D. Vance's. He's been very actively lobbying his father for him to be the running mate. He also has the support of Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, so a lot of the far-right. Doug Burgum has been getting the support of Fox News Corp mandate - or excuse me, magnate, Rupert Murdoch. He's been pushing him to different conservative high profile allies, but also we've really seen him get showered with some of, you know, favorable coverage from Fox News Corp, like the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and then Burgum - or excuse me, Rubio has actually been a favorite of the donor class. At a dinner last month, immediately after Donald Trump's guilty verdict in his Manhattan trial, Donald Trump was sitting with a group of a dozen or so Wall Street figures and took a informal straw poll asking everyone who do you like, who do you like, and the majority of people said Marco Rubio. Now, Rubio also has the support, I'm told, of Kellyanne Conway as well as Sean Hannity, so breaking there a little bit with Rupert Murdoch. But it's interesting to really see all of these different people really having drastic differences and who they think should be the right person.",

And that's why, actually, many of Donald Trump's closest advisors and the people actually working on his campaign, people like Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, his campaign managers, they're very wary of weighing in. They are trying to let him make the decision. And here's a quote, I just found this to kind of sum it up perfectly from someone close to Trump. They said, quote, \"Susie has lasted this long because she provides information that will be helpful and then lets Trump make the decision.\" So the only other person I'm waiting to hear from who I actually think could sway him is Melania Trump, the first lady, but words out on that for now.",

There's very little evidence in history that people are voting for VP.Is this perhaps the exception to the rule, because we have two older candidates for president and we know the Trump campaign is going to make a big issue of Vice President Harris, saying a vote for Biden is a vote for Harris.

We saw him in the - we pick a president particularly not just for the economy or where they stand on choice or one of these things, although people care a lot about those things. But we pick them particularly in moments of crisis. And what will the president do when there's a moment of crisis that we all have to just turn to him and say - or her - and say, lead us. Tell us what to do.And when Donald Trump had that field test, he failed it miserably during COVID. So we don't really need to know any more about Donald Trump's judgment.

In May, Donald Trump's team brought in $141 million. That's compared to the $85 million that Biden's campaign brought in. Eighty-five million is not a small number, but compared to $141 million, definitely lagging behind. And tens of millions of dollars of that $141 million number was raised in the aftermath of his guilty verdict. And so, it has been a huge boost and boon for Donald Trump's campaign.And really, I mean, we've also seen Donald Trump go to many of these fundraisers with wealthy donors, really focus on aggressively trying to catch up to Biden's war chest and it seems that it's paying off.",

Is it possible she's just different? SHIRA SCHEINDLIN, FORMER U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE: I don't think she's in the tank for Trump. I think that's pretty extreme, and there's no reason to think that. However, I have said before that she has - does not have as much experience as many judges do. She was an assistant U.S. attorney. She mostly did appeals, I understand. She was not much of a trial lawyer and she hasn't had many criminal trials yet as a judge.

You think she's wasting time? Is that the right way to put it? JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. MIDDLE DISTRICT COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA: I think she is, John, and I would never have had an argument day for this. There was no testimony taken. It was really an opportunity for the lawyers to come in, and there were some strange things about this that you don't typically see in the judging business. Notable was that she allowed friends of the court to come in and argue. You can let them in. You can let them intervene and then just take their briefs, let them file their briefs and decide the case on the briefs. I have no idea why she spent three hours listening to the same reconstituted arguments that apparently that were made in other cases involving the Special Counsel. I just wouldn't do that. And it just looks like a time sink that was absolutely unnecessary. And that seems to be a hallmark of the way that she's doing business in this case. She's judging defensively, John, where I think she's afraid to make a mistake. And when you judge that way, you overcomplicate things. As my former judge colleague knows, the job of the judge in a complicated case like this is to unravel it, set a trial date, and restore some order to it. And she's done anything but that.",

It does involve the former president and a presidential candidate and she had lots of questions. She was well-prepared today. She had lots of questions for both sides. And there's a slight difference in this case, which is that this special prosecutor, Jack Smith, has never been confirmed by Congress. He is not a U.S. attorney as the previous special counsel in the Hunter Biden case was. So they've got a slight factual difference and they've got a slight hook to argue this is different. So the real argument here is being the - what kind of officer, are you the primary officer or are you the inferior officer. And if you're an inferior officer, which they're arguing, then you're supervised and you don't need to be confirmed by Congress. So is this - is Jack Smith supervised or not.

One reason, they say, dozens of threats against District Attorney Alvin Bragg, his family, and his staff during the hush money trial, and since the former president's conviction on those 34 felony counts.And this is only part, we've seen this throughout the years, of a larger threat picture, which includes the former president and his supporters attacking the criminal justice system, attacking the courts, attacking individuals, and promising sometimes a campaign of revenge, retribution against Trump opponents. Last night, Anderson right here talked about the danger it poses with someone who has sadly been on the receiving end.

There is no doubt about that.But to -- but honestly, the DA is in a tough spot here. Because even though what he's asking for is reasonable, it is actually limited. There is a limited time horizon. There's a limited amount of restrictions on speech that you can impose upon people, particularly when the original reason for doing so was to protect the criminal justice process, right? To protect the witnesses and the jurors who are involved in this trial and then more broadly the people in the prosecutor's office and of course their families who are caught up in it by virtue of the jobs that they do. That process is coming to an end. It's essentially over for Judge Merchan, when the sentencing takes place. So the DAs kind of footing to make these arguments is shrinking by the day.

The timing of that expression of support is really interesting, given that it comes on the heels of Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel creating some controversy by saying in a video that the U.S. was withholding support from Israel, prompting a lot of back and forth between Israeli and U.S. officials, and adding to the tension that had already been growing between the two countries.

They want de-escalation.They don't want another front to open up in what has already been such a volatile situation. But at this moment, I do think the administration is at least bracing for the very real possibility of this scenario, full-blown out war between Israel and Hezbollah.
