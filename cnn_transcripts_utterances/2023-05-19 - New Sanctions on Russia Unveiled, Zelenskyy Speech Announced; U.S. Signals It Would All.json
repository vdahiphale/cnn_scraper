Certainly, he will be making the requests that he has been making for the last 14 months which is for more advanced weapons, more sanctions on Russia and certainly the hope among the leaders here is that in that counter offensive that is coming up that Ukraine will be able to regain some of the territories that it has lost, provide Zelenskyy leverage at an eventual negotiating table with Russia. The leaders did convene a special session on Ukraine today. They emerged from them and announcing these tough new sanctions, the United States sanctioning 300 additional individuals entities, really trying to close them with the loopholes in the sanction regime, trying to prevent Russians from evading the sanctions that are in place. Something interesting you saw from the United Kingdom today as well, placing a restriction on imports of Russian diamonds. That had been one of the last Russian industries that hadn't been touched by sanctions. So, really trying to choke off the Kremlin war machine. But there was a potent moment earlier today as the summit kicked off, the leaders all laying wreaths at the Hiroshima peace memorial. This, of course, is a city that was obliterated by an atomic bomb in 1945, the leaders really seeing up close what that meant to the city, what it meant to the world, and providing a backdrop for these diplomatic talks, really laying down the stakes of diplomacy and showing to them what happens if diplomacy can fail. And so, leaders, they are on their way now to an island nearby. They will participate in a leader's dinner. But, certainly, these talks really taking on new drama with that news that Zelenskyy will be coming here. That will be really kind of the high point of this summit on Sunday when he meets with them face to face here in Japan, Christine.",

Those are already on the front lines. And time and time again, that's why you see President Zelenskyy show up, will look his partners in the eye, shake hands, he knows that being in person at the G7, that matters. Think about the red lines from the HIMARS to the Patriot air defense systems, to those battle tanks, all of those now are in use in the conflict. So, by being there in person, in Japan, on Sunday, President Zelenskyy is going to hope that he can push for more from his allies. And it's not just that. Of course, President Zelenskyy is also going to want to see the noose around Russia tightened. He wants to see the sanctions increase. The U.K. has already announced sanctions just today against more than 80 entities and companies in Russia. But President Zelenskyy is going to want to see more of that. Remember, Japan, the host nation, other countries, continue to receive imports from Moscow. He's going to want to make sure that his allies don't have any fatigue set in especially ahead of this counteroffensive.",

This was not an easy decision to make but I believe that it was the right one.This memo does not mention Governor Ron DeSantis. This does refer to the Lake Nona campus that was supposed to be the site of this office complex, east of Walt Disney World. Now, 2,000 people were supposed to move there, but now, they are going to stay in southern California. Some people had already moved to Florida, and the chairman in that memo said that they would work on an individual, case by case basis on their options, including the possibility of returning to Burbank here in the Los Angeles area. Governor Ron DeSantis office spokesperson gave a statement to our colleague, Steve Contorno, that read: Disney announced the possibility of the Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago. Nothing ever came of the project, in the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition. Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures. Now, on the same day, Disney did announce that they are shutting down the Star Wars galactic cruiser at the Walt Disney World resort. That is a premium experience where families paid thousands of dollars for a two- night voyage through the galaxy. That has only been open for a year. Despite that announcement, D'Amaro, in his memo did say that they are still going to invest $17 billion dollars and add 13,000 jobs to that Florida resort in the next ten years. The Orange County mayor said that these 2,000 jobs not moving to Florida was a result of not having an inclusive and collaborative work environment. The Florida Democratic chair said that this loss happened because of DeSantis's unhinged personal vendetta against Disney. Natasha Chen, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Essentially, what the argument is, is we look at the Deutsche Bank they settled because he has the essence of the suit was that you are an enabler, you are an enabler to Jeffrey Epstein with respect to his sex trafficking. You cannot just take on a client and because that client is financially wealthy and is bringing you other individuals to decide to side with profit and ignore suspicious activity which if you could have and should have and would have reported could have made a difference with respect to Epstein's criminal enterprise. [05:20:09] So the essence of that again as we get Epstein who committed suicide as we know in 2019, they were saying that because the bank was asleep at the switch and other knew or should've known of his activities and did nothing about it he was allowed to engage in all of these activity, criminal activity in which he was engaging human trafficking and abusing underage girls. And so, the essence of it is that, and so the bank initially saying we have nothing to do with this, we have no obligation or duty to know what Jeffrey Epstein is doing and we couldn't have known what he did do but at the end of the day, Deutsche Bank said, we will agreed to settle and resolve this case for $75 million but there has been no admission of liability and now of course we know Deutsche Bank took on Jeffrey Epstein after Chase got rid of him after a 15-year relationship.",

Now with resolving this for $75 million and ensuring that many of his victims receive compensation, they also -- his victims, Jeffrey Epstein's victims that is, receive compensation from the estate Deutsche Bank will otherwise resolve this and move stage left.That then brings in and makes the centerpiece now, JPMorgan Chase, which is now the subject of a lawsuit itself by the Virgin Islands and by the victims here, saying that you too had an obligation, you already raised it, if in 2008, Jeffrey Epstein in Florida was convicted of the sex crime, you then Chase Bank would know even though you cut off ties with him in 2013, you had this 15-year relationship and you didn't do enough. So, as you noted, Mr. Dimon, the chief executive, will sit next week for a deposition and have to answer with respect to what he knew and what he knew if anything and, of course, Chase is saying we didn't know anything about this, and if we're liable, then one of the executives who used to work with us, it's not us it's him and so chase is trying to say that we didn't know, he concealed that is our executive information.",
