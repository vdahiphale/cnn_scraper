      "sentences": "Hello. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, a CNN exclusive from Ukraine's embattled army chief. He says his forces have to adapt to less military aid from key allies like America, as his own future is uncertain. The death toll may rise after a large gas explosion in Kenya's capital. Hundreds have been injured. We live in Nairobi for the latest. And taking the stand, the mother of a U.S. school shooter is being cross-examined about ignoring her son's state of mind prior to the attack.The embattled leader of Ukraine's army has laid out his strategy for defeating Russia and the challenges holding his country back. However, someone else may be putting those plans into action. As we reported yesterday, sources say Ukraine's President has already fired Valerii Zaluzhnyi, with an official announcement expected by the end of the week, as he prepares for his likely exit. Zaluzhnyi has written an OpEd for cnn.com, outlining how he sees the way forward. He writes that Ukraine must be less dependent on foreign aid and focus on a new military technology process. He adds, the challenge is to create a completely new state system of technological rearmament. He says such a system could be done in five months. Fred Pleitgen joins us from Kyiv with a closer look at the situation, and an extraordinary -- I mean, someone suggested it's a manifesto, I've got it written down here, and he says it can be achieved in five months.",

      "sentences": "You know what? I think -- you're absolutely right. It is definitely extraordinary and it is certainly something that I think is very well worth reading. I would urge everybody to go to our website and our app and to actually read this, because Valerii Zaluzhnyi, of course, right now is the top general here in Ukraine, even though as you've noted, he is very much embattled, and of course, he has been fighting this war, the biggest war, if you will, of our time against an overwhelming enemy for the past almost two years. And he obviously has some lessons learned from that, some of which he has been using in -- or he has been outlining in this OpEd that he wrote.And I think there is two things that they're predicated on, two things that are sinking in for the Ukrainians, and that that they are outgunned and they are out manned. And the fact that they are outgunned is something that he believes will continue. One of the things that he pointed out, Max, is he said, look, there might be waning military supplies coming from Ukraine's allies because of the political situations that they themselves face at home. Of course, the U.S. right now where the aid to Ukraine is very much in the balance. And essentially what Valerii Zaluzhnyi is saying is he said the only way that the Ukrainians can mitigate those disadvantages is to rely on modern technology on unmanned systems on land, at sea, and in the air. I want to read you one quote of what he said, because he also said some of these operations that we've recently been seeing from the Ukrainians where they've been hitting targets inside Russia or Russian warship just the other day that that is something that will continue. He says quote -- or he writes, \"Attack operations can have psychological objectives. And here, technology boasts an undoubted superiority over tradition. The remote control of these assets mean fewer soldiers in harm's way, thus reducing the level of human losses.\" Of course, Max, the other thing that the Ukrainians have been dealing with is a distinct lack of soldiers on the front lines. They do say that they need to rotate through, but they're having trouble mobilizing enough people. I want to read you another quote from Valerii Zaluzhnyi. He says, \"In 2024, we must focus our main efforts in three areas, introducing a new philosophy of training and warfare which takes account of restrictions in assets, how they can be deployed, and mastering new combat capabilities as soon as possible.\" And otherwise -- in other words, developing new technologies, bringing them to the battlefield as fast as possible. And I think one of the key things that we've found that I've drawn from reading Valerii Zaluzhnyi's essay is he needs those new technologies to be integrated into that traditional form of warfare, because on the other hand, of course, what we have here on the Russian side but also on the Ukrainian side is still the use of massive firepower in the form of artillery. He thinks that that can be all the more effective if it's coupled with modern technology, Max.",

This was liquefied petroleum gas filling plant and station. The regulator (ph) in Kenya says they applied for licenses three times and they were denied, in March, in June, and in July, but they still went ahead filling cooking gas here, which is used by a lot of people to cook in Kenya. And so, there is already a blame game about how this was allowed to happen. But, he said the impact here -- this is in the immediate vicinity. But, we've been walking around here, and the impact of the fire and the flames were seen last night spread for several hundred meters in every direction here.There is a building over on the other side of that street. This is almost maybe 300, 400 yards across. And there is the body of a car that was lifted all the way up there. That is just how serious the impact of the flames and this gas explosion was here. The reason why they were denied so many times is because this is a residential place. There are so many people that live so close to here. It's a densely populated area. And that's why the government is saying they shouldn't have been allowed to happen in the first place. I want you to listen to this one individual who survived the flames from last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDWIN MACHIO, NAIROBI EXPLOSION SURVIVOR (through translator): The fire caught up with me from almost one kilometer away as I was escaping. The flames from the explosion knocked me down, burnt me on my neck and back, as you can see. I decided to use my own means and take myself to the hospital at Mama Lucy where I got first aid. They injected me to prevent tetanus and alleviate the pain. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is 271 who are in hospital, who are being treated at various hospitals in the city. But, think about the fact that a car that was in this location was flying almost 300, 500 yards away to the sixth floor rooftop. So, anybody within the vicinity of this area was in the line of danger. And yet, so many people survived, this people who have 60 percent burns, but many of them might make it the final count of the impact, and especially the casualties will take a few days to really come to terms with. But, Max, having been here and seen just how many people live around here, it's truly extraordinary that more people did not die from here.",

Larry Madowo, thank you for bringing us that from the scene.Now, after weeks of pressuring Israel to scale back its military tactics in Gaza, the U.S. is now turning its attention to the West Bank. The Biden administration has issued sanctions against four Israeli men, it says, who carried out violent attacks in the West Bank. The move is aimed at stopping growing settler violence against Palestinians. The State Department says one of the men that was named initiated a riot with cars and buildings set on fire, resulting in the death of a Palestinian civilian. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disputed the need for sanctions, saying \"Israel acts against all lawbreakers everywhere, so there is no room for exceptional measures in this regard.\" He went on to say, the absolute majority of the settlers are law-abiding citizens. Let's get more citizens from CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. It is an exceptional move, isn't it, by the U.S. Probably won't have a huge amount of effect, presumably though, unless these people travel a lot.",

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will also be there. It's the first time he'll be seen with the President since his hospitalization. On Thursday, Secretary Austin said the U.S. is preparing a multi-tiered response to the Jordan attack. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now live from Abu Dhabi.

      "sentences": "Well, Max, what we also heard from the Secretary of Defense is that he wanted to make sure that these militia had less capability than they had before. He acknowledged the fact that U.S. military has already struck back against some of these pro-Iran, Iran-funded and trained groups in Iraq and Syria before. But, they haven't done enough. So, this coupled with the fact he is talking about a multi-tiered response would lead you to believe that this could well be a number of targets that they're looking at, at this point, potentially over multiple days rather than the individual targets they've been carrying out before.Now, it is interesting, because we've -- CNN has spoken to a number of individuals who have access to certain U.S. intelligence, which shows that they believe that Iran's leadership was actually taken by surprise by this attack last weekend, and the fact that they are concerned, according to this intelligence, that some of these proxy groups that Iran funds are doing what they want to do at this point. And there is potential concern that there is less control over these proxy groups than might have previously been thought. Now, it's interesting to point out that these multiple people speaking to CNN also point out they don't think that Iran will change their calculus or their strategy in any way because of these concerns. But, certainly, what we're looking at and what we have been seeing since October is more than 160 attacks by these militia against U.S. and coalition troops in Iraq and in Syria, missile, drone, rocket attacks, there have been injuries. But, of course, the attack last weekend was the first time that we saw a loss of life on the U.S. military side. So, we have been expecting for some days now that there would be some kind of retaliation, some kind of response by the United States. It has been telegraphed. It has been flagged by the military and by the Biden administration. In fact, it's led at least one of these militia to highlight the fact that they are now pulling back. Kata'ib Hezbollah, which is part of the umbrella group Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which the U.S. blames for this deadly drone attack, they have said that they will be pulling back from attacks on the United States at this point. So, potentially pointing to the fact that even threatening this retaliation does have some kind of deterrence power. Max.",
