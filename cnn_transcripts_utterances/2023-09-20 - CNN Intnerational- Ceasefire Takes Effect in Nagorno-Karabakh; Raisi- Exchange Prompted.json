They've been sitting on their hands and not doing what they were supposed to do in terms of their peacekeeping arrangement. And the Armenians themselves have taken steps recently that might indeed have upset President Putin. They've trained with U.S. troops just last week they sent aid to Ukraine for the first time. And they've also decided to accept the Rome statutes which would enforce the ICC call for President Putin to stand trial for war crimes in Ukraine.

There are many drones in this area, but is suspected to be a sea drone that hit the boat and exploded in the ship engine area and putting this into context of President Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian President in the United States this week, it's worth pointing out that he mentioned attacks in the Black Sea. He mentioned specifically of course, he targeted Russia said Russia was behind them and said that this was part of weaponizing food security globally.

In fact, it took a while for us to even get confirmation on the day and the time and the location for this meeting. And it's a bit unusual it's been nine months now, since Benjamin Netanyahu took power once again in Israel, and never in recent memory. The last time it took this long for an Israeli Prime Minister and a U.S. President to meet face to face was back in the 1960s.And that gives you a sense of sort of where this relationship stands right now between Israel and the United States. And notably, is that the meeting will be happening on the fringes of the U.N. General Assembly in New York at the hotel and not in the White House at the Oval Office. And keep in mind that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who's also at the U.N. also there. He is going right back down to D.C. to have that proper meeting with President Biden in the White House. And that is a very, very clear message from the White House to the Israelis, about how they see the relationship right now. And most of this is over this new right wing government not really new anymore, but this right wing government, their conduct, their actions, but especially over the judicial reform. But in addition to the judicial overhaul where I'm sure President Biden will bringing up once again, his distaste for how it's been handled. And his encouragement to try to have these really government reach a broad consensus on this. We'll be hearing about Saudi Arabia normalization, we'll be hearing about the Palestinians in the West Bank, and Iran. And I expect the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will use many of the same words we heard him use with Elon Musk. Earlier this week where he'll say, yes, I want to reach a consensus on judicial reform, I want to reach a moderate position.

But there is a big question, because whatever Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister may want to do. You have to keep in mind is who is sitting around him in his cabinet. And these are extremists. These are right wingers. These are people who have made very, very, sometimes disturbing comments about the Palestinians, some of them have been very clear. They don't believe a Palestinian state should exist. Some of them have even said the Palestinian Authority shouldn't exist. So there is a bit of disconnect here. How could Benjamin Netanyahu get through these sorts of big changes potential concessions to the Palestinians for this normalization agreement, while he has these people sitting in government beside him?

An exclusive CNN investigation has uncovered compelling evidence that Ukrainian forces have struck Wagner-backed fighters inside Sudan. It comes as Russia tries to expand its influence in Africa following the death of the Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. CNN's Nima Elbagir reports from neighboring Chad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nightfall in a war torn neighborhood in the Sudanese City of Omdurman. You are watching a thermal imaging video depicting military forces equipped in high tech gear, far more sophisticated than the Sudanese have demonstrated to date. And here, a series of high precision daytime strikes raining down from the sky in and around the same city hitting targets backed by Russia's Wagner Mercenary Group in Sudan, a Ukrainian military source told CNN this is the work of a foreign military. Pressed on whether they would say unequivocally that Kyiv was behind the attacks. The source would only say that Ukrainian special services were likely responsible, which would constitute a dramatic expansion and Kyiv's theater of war against Moscow. Previous CNN investigations exposed that the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, has been heavily backed by Wagner as they fight the Sudanese army in a war for dominance. CNN obtained a series of videos of the operation showing 14 different strikes on RSF weapons and equipment believed to be provided by Wagner. We pinpointed seven different locations of the drone strikes in Omdurman and RSF stronghold that has become a focal point of the conflict. And we geo located footage of the night raid to the same city by identifying the building seen here. The drone video obtained by CNN had already been edited, but clues remain as to the identity of those behind the attacks. Text on the monitor of the drone control, as seen here is in Ukrainian.",

CNN shared the videos with a high level source in Sudan's army for comment, who said they had no knowledge of a Ukrainian operation in Sudan and did not believe it was true. Sudan became embroiled in Russia's war against Ukraine last year, despite being thousands of miles from the front line. When as we reported Wagner exploited Sudan's gold resources to help finance Moscow's Ukraine war effort, circumventing U.S. sanctions on Russia. After a plane carrying Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin plummeted to the ground late last month, many believed that Wagner's influence would recede. But just the opposite has happened. Military whistle- blowers in a number of African countries have told CNN that the Kremlin is consolidating its power over Wagner networks in the Central African Republic, in Sudan, in Libya and in Mali.

If you look closely, you can see over a hundred vehicles including scores of trucks at the base, proof the supplies provided by Russia, Wagner continue. A strike on Wagner-backed forces in Sudan would constitute a blow to Moscow. If it is Ukraine, they will have raised the stakes for those willing to accept Wagner's backing in the future.

This is about celebrating the long term ties between the two countries. It's not meant to be all about politics. But certainly a previous visit by Rishi Sunak was seen as very successful as well. And diplomats are telling me U.K. diplomats, this is all about building on that very successful meeting between the Prime Minister and President earlier in the year, the King and the President are going to go inside, they're going to have a conversation. We've been told a bit about that. We're told it's going to be about environment that won't surprise you, Richard. But we also heard from the -- side a source they're telling us that the King always likes to hear what the President's views are about international affairs. And we've seen, haven't we how he's got a bit more involved, not necessarily in politics, but a bit more forthright on his views about international affairs, the King than his mother. So that's an interesting slight change. I think we're seeing here.",

PIERRE PASLIER, CO-FOUNDER AND CO-CEO, NOTPLA: Pierre Paslier and I'm the Co-Founder and CO-CEO of Notpla. So our mission is to make packaging disappear. We started with this belief that nature has solved all these problems. And if we can use the natural materials found in the environment, we're never going to create a long lasting problem. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Since 2019, Notpla has produced a range of packaging made from biodegradable seaweed. It can replace single use plastic for all kinds of users from thirsty marathon runners who can hydrate without using plastic bottles.
