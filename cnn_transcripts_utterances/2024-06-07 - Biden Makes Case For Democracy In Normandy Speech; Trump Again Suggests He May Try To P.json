I know where that kind of political positioning is, on her is, new judge. It's always look complicated coming into a big position. Are there political issues here? And bias issues here?

JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER JUDGE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT: The problem that I have is and all the things that were -- that Jessica just said may be true, but they those problems were solvable a long time ago. Yes, she is in Fort Pierce. Yes, she is isolated because she's the only judge in that courthouse and I've been a judge, the only one in the courthouse. But there are telephones. There are abilities to talk to the other members of the Southern District of Florida, many of whom have extensive experience in this type of case, and national security cases. She has not availed herself of those opportunities. She has not spoken to anybody, at least as far as I know, and I've heard. The basic thought process when a judge says she's smart, she's personable, she's doing the best she can. That type of thing, that's a way of saying, I don't want to criticize that, judge, because I'm one of them. So I think that I know about her confirmation hearings. In truth, the information that came out at them is that it amazed me that Democrats voted yes on her in any way. She did not have the experience or the knowledge to be able to do the kind of job to be a federal district judge.

SWARTZ: I don't think it's the financial reforms because I think the ethical reforms would solve that problem. If you notice that some of the other justices who have been there for a long time know what they can and cannot do, and they don't do it. The problem is that Justice Thomas doesn't care what he should or should not do. The fact that he would for all intents and purposes, falsify his financial disclosures in the past and now have to try to make up for them with the things that he claims. He has. I guess from the report that I saw received as much as somewhere between two-and-a- half to $4 million worth of gifts from people who may or may not have business before the court. Justice Alito has taken some of those gifts. Justice Scalia took a lot of trips, but he declared them, most of them at least as he should have. So it's a problem that needs to be resolved one by an ethical code that Congress and that is the Senate and the House have to impose upon the court and disclosures that are punishable to the extent that they become a high crime or misdemeanor, they could get them impeached.

To anyone who's been through that experience knows how difficult it is and then have to go inside a federal courtroom and testify about that, such a difficult thing to do.So she was there to testify about two instances where she met up with her father in 2018. The first was in late summer 2018. He'd been in rehab and he reached out to her to arrange a meeting. She said she went with her then boyfriend, now husband, and she said at that time her how her father was as clean and as clear as she had seen him since the death of his brother, her uncle, Beau Biden. She said she was really proud of him. She also testified that she saw him again in October, on October 19th. That's key because that is during the time when he owned the gun at the center of this case, should at that time, he was again, as clean as she had seen him in California, which had gone out to visit him in rehab and said she was really quite hopeful. But both Naomi and defense attorneys appear to be a little caught off guard when prosecutors on cross-examination presented her with text messages showing exchanges she had with her dad during that New York trip where he would be a little hard to communicate with. It was hard to meet up with him. He was texting her at 2:00 in the morning to try to get back a car that she had borrowed. Now about that car, she also testified when she borrowed it, she saw no drug residue, no drug paraphernalia, and that he certainly didn't do any drugs or put any in their prosecutors, on cross-examination, use that testimony to insinuate that the drugs that were then found, drug paraphernalia on the 23rd of October must have been put there in the intervening days. So it's unclear exactly what the jury made of this, but I'll tell you, they were very attentive. I was in the courtroom, very attentive throughout her testimony. She clearly had a lot of family support. As soon as she and her husband walked in, the first lady motioned to her husband to come sit right next to her in the front row where you had about two dozen friends and family.",

When he filled up the form, he wasn't currently using drugs.What do all of those things mean? They mean you're looking into Hunter Biden's head. You're looking at his intent when he was viewing this form. You're looking at keeping the only person who can attest that during that time frame, he was not using drugs. So certainly there's value there, but the risk is what can come in on cross-examination when a defendant testifies, you open up that door. We know there's so many text messages. There's the infamous laptop. There's other passages of his memoir that did not make it into the courtroom. All of that could be fair game.

This was when I relapsed. So there's certainly value, but to your point, they have to assess whether or not that risk is simply too high. And the other path, because the jury can't hold it against him if he doesn't testify. They just say the prosecutors failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and here's why.

The reason instead of backing Congressman Jamaal Bowman, Jones is throwing his support behind Bowman's Democratic opponent.Now, do you remember former representative is looking to get back into Congress. He ran for a different district then his last attempt following a shakeup of the map. So what's behind the beef with his former colleague? Well, let's going to ask him. Mondaire Jones joins me now. Appreciate your time. This is a fascinating dynamic because I think that -- I wanted to quote Cori Bush, a member of the Squad, said you're squad adjacent when you came into Congress. MONDAIRE JONES (D), NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Not only was I never squad adjacent, I was always a pragmatist and an independent voice for my values. And in this latest example, this thing that has outraged some members of the Squad, and I guess some members of the progressive caucus writ large is standing on my values. So, specifically, I endorsed Westchester County Executive George Latimer in the primary against Representative Jamaal Bowman in the 16th congressional district.

He dismissed it as propaganda. Recently, he doubled down on that extremism when he accepted the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose New York City chapter amplified a pro- Hamas rally the day after the worst assault on Jews since the Holocaust.

And I want to warn you, some of these images are very disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Awaiting burial, the victims of another costly day in Sudan's year-long civil war. At least 150 people were killed by rebel forces in the village of Wad Al-Noora on Wednesday, local officials and eyewitnesses say. Though CNN cannot independently confirm these claims, these images which our teams have geo-located was shared on social media by an activist group. Most of those killed here by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces were civilians, locals told us, including women and children. An RSF spokesperson said Thursday it had targeted army bases in the area, though locals disputed this claim. The U.N.'s top official in Sudan has called for a thorough investigation, but that may take time to heed. Wad Al-Noora is in Sudan's central Aljazeera state, where RSF fighters are attempting to gain ground. They already controlled much of the country's capital Khartoum, seized after RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo fell out with army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in April last year, unleashing violence across the country. MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: Two men basically decided did that they were going to resolve their differences through fighting, that they were going to take the country down, and this was an avoidable conflict.",
