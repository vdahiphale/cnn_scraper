And I understand the court has already ruled on that. I understand that. The tendency, though, after hearing the narrative that has been made public has been to make Jennifer Crumbley sound like a monster, to vilify her, to make her sound like a horrible mother and evil person. And the truth is, it's an effort to put her in a categorical other to say this is not something that could happen to any of us and it is. It is something that could happen to any of us. And people fail to realize what the sentencing memo shows the court through numerous others' support that Mrs. Crumbley does have a kind heart. She does have compassion. She has spent night after night crying, not for only herself and her son, but also for the victims and for what her son did and what she will live with, knowing he did, and what she missed, all the years forward. At the end of the day, we ask the court to look at Mrs. Crumbley's role in the offenses. We ask the court to consider that while she did not oppose having a gun in the home, she was not the person who was responsible for storing the gun and believed it was being stored properly and that it was locked. Mrs. Crumbley obviously testified, and all of the evidence at trial showed that she believed there was a string lock, a cable lock, placed on the gun, on the weapon.",

She didn't like it. She wasn't responsible for it. But at one time, she was texting her husband to see whether or not he got the gun and how much it was. She posted pictures of it as her son's Christmas present. She shot the gun, and I don't know if you're aware of this. I don't know if either side was aware of this, but the first jury determined that there was a claim that the gun was the responsibility solely of Defendant James Crumbley. And Mrs. Crumbly testified that when she returned from the range of the shooter on November 27th, it was the Defendant James Crumbley who was responsible for the six-hour retreat from the car, and was supposed to keep it safe. The first jury recognized that the GPS embedded in the case shows that even prior to the Defendant James Crumbley returning to the house, the shooter was videotaping the unlocked six-hour in the kitchen of the home. So, that's not true. That's not true. She also testified that a key to the cable lock was kept in the rear side of the kitchen, but it's clear that the cable lock was clearly never opened.",

Because if Mrs. Crumbley had been presented any of those five things, things would be different, and we would probably not be here today. I am asking this court, I know the court of public opinion is running high right now, emotions are running very high. There are many, many complicated issues with this case. It is a dynamic and different case than most cases. Mrs. Crumbley does have a good heart. This is a woman who had no felony history. She was a working mom who was very busy, did have a hobby. And I'm just saying, largely the evidence at trial were some of those things. And Mrs. Crumbley did have an enormous amount of love for her son, and what she has been painted out to be in the media and throughout this case, and even throughout the victim impact statements today, is just not congruent with the people who know Mrs. Crumbley and know her heart. It's also not congruent with the text messages she sent right after the shooting about how she wished she would have died instead of one of the kids.",

Your honor, in some of the same calls that the prosecution has tried to use and has quoted in their own sentencing memorandum and attached as exhibits to their memorandum, as I noted in my sentencing memorandum, your honor, James also said in those very same calls that he wished that he had known what his son was capable of. That if he had known, if he had been made aware of these things, if he had known that his son had obtained access to a firearm, that maybe he could have saved the poor children's lives, that maybe he could have saved a lot more than that. Your honor, there has never been a time that James Crumbley has not acknowledged what happened in this case. He has felt horrific grief for not only the families, but for the people who have been affected. He's grieved for himself, for his own child. And while that may not be something that is a popular statement to make, he's grieved for the child that he believed he had. Not the child who pled guilty, but the child that he believed he had on the morning of November 30th when he dropped his son off at school. James could not have predicted what his son was going to do that day. He couldn't have predicted because he didn't know that it was going to happen. As James said, your honor, you sat through the trial, judge. You heard the evidence that was presented. You also know that there was no indication given in the evidence presented that James had knowledge of what his son was planning, that James didn't know that his son had been accessing that firearm unsupervised or that he had access to the firearm unsupervised. Judge, you heard that that firearm was stored legally at the laws at the time, in November of 2021, that there may be differing opinions on whether or not that firearm was stored responsibly, your honor.

They were so gut-wrenching.There was not a dry eye for anybody that was watching that, not just those in the courtroom. But turning to the defense, we heard the arguments that the defense attorneys were raising. And from a defense perspective, those are the arguments that need to be raised. Recklessness standard, that while there are four victims, there was only one act. Ethan was tried as an adult. You know, he was sentenced as an adult. So, that means that he had an intervening act. And they're also talking about the particular harshness of the sentences they've served so far, 23 hours a day, solitary, and they've served two and a half years. So, taking all of that, those are the legal arguments. Now, we're putting the two individuals who are defendants in this case, giving them the opportunity to speak. And so what they were doing, they were hitting on those legal points but coming directly from them. And you nailed it. The main issue here is that aspect of remorse. That is something that the judge is absolutely going to be looking for. Remember the pillars of our criminal justice system. Deterrence, rehabilitation, and punishment.

Both of these parents had separate trials, as you said. James did not testify in his trial. And we'll recall that when Jennifer did, she was quite defiant, saying she wouldn't have done anything differently, that they were a normal family, that he was a normal son, and sort of deflecting the blame really to her son and the school for negligence. A bit different in her defense that we heard from Jennifer today. And as you said, from James, more remorse, saying that they didn't know of certain things at the time and that they would have acted differently, and showing more remorse for the parents in saying they can't imagine the pain that these victims' parents have endured.

He named that he would put in place Supreme Court justices that would be hostile to abortion access. And he, in fact, did appoint three justices who voted against Roe v. Wade, all of those nominees voting to overturn. And once the decision came down to overturn Roe v. Wade, he celebrated that. He's repeatedly taken credit for that.

And she went on to say that parents are not expected to be perfect. They're not expected to be psychics. This is not about parenting. But then she went on to say it's about negligence, that opportunity knocked and knocked at the door, she said, and no one answered. And so, there you hear it.

And she listed the fact that there were certain things that actually weighed on her decision, including the fact that James Crumbley threatened the prosecutor, he characterized himself as a martyr, and also Jennifer Crumbley did say, and actually Misty Morris was saying that that statement would come back to haunt her, but she did say previously that there was nothing that she would have done differently. And the judge said, listen, I know that those statements may have been mischaracterized, but the fact is you did say that, right? You did say that. I want to bring in trial attorney and legal analyst Misty Marris to join us back again. So, Misty, you and I were speaking a few hours ago about what we anticipated to be the sentence here. Ten to 15 years, just walk us through whether that is significantly higher than what you were anticipating and why you think the judge leaned towards the maximum here.",

And the judge also referencing her very rather flippant comments when they were brought into the school for a 12-minute meeting about the concerns over Ethan and his well-being and behavior. And she finished up by asking, are we done yet? Misty, as you know, every judge, when they're issuing their decision, especially one as high-profile as this one, and we know that an appeal is in the works as it is, has to make sure that their decision, every I is dotted, every T is crossed, and to try to make the decision as appeal-proof as possible. From everything that you heard this judge touched upon, not being swayed by the public opinion or how these people were portrayed, do you think that she did enough?",

She wants to make sure that she'sjustifying, especially going over what would be the sentencing guidelines, and something that she did when these arguments first began. Remember, before we heard the victim impact statements, we heard arguments from the prosecutors and the defense attorneys about the pre-sentence memos. And what the judge did very carefully in response to some of the arguments raised by the defense, she negated those. She said, look, there's case law that goes against that. They talk about an offense variable. That puts a calculation of certain years and points relating to what is appropriate in Michigan under those state guidelines.  So, I do think that she really did what she needed to do to put this in a situation where the ultimate, the sentence, is going to be justified from her perspective. Now, again, think about it. It's 10 to 15 years. That means that they will have the opportunity for parole in 10. So, it's not as far off from that seven-year maximum under the state guidelines at the end of the day. So, I do think that she did her best to make this bulletproof on appeal.",
