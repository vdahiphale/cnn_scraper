A short time ago, Israeli military officials said that they have uncovered concrete evidence of a Hamas terror presence, a headquarters inside this hospital compound.You can see this aerial view of the compound. It's not just one building. It's several buildings. Doctors, patients, staff inside the various buildings, also several areas where civilians, maybe thousands of civilians are sheltering. Now, Israeli forces say, again, concrete evidence of a terror presence. They have not released what that evidence is at this point. The IDF says that its tanks are not on the hospital grounds itself, but they released this video, you can see of tanks and its forces going right up to the edge of the compound and operating very close to it. Obviously, troops have now moved inside. Hospital staff says that Israeli troops have entered and have begun interrogating or questioning some people inside. Now, remember, and this is very important, the Geneva Conventions protect hospitals. They are entitled to protection, but they may not, under any circumstances, be used for non-medical purposes. What does that include? That includes sheltering able-bodied combatants, also to store munitions or as a shield for military action. And, again, Israel moments ago said they've uncovered concrete evidence of a Hamas terror presence inside that hospital compound. We are waiting to see what evidence that is. In the meantime, let's go to CNN's Ed Lavandera who is in Tel Aviv with the very latest. Ed?",

They are described as a very cynical operation by Hamas to operate this way. And, clearly, the world and those who have been very critical, especially in the operations here around the Al-Shifa hospital, Jordan, for example, said it was appalled by the actions that the Israeli military was engaging in the areas around that hospital.

The troops are now in, Israeli troops are now in Gaza's largest hospital and hospital complex, saying Hamas has been using it as a command center, which Hamas is still denying. The IDF is now saying it has some concrete evidence of that. But today, the specifics were a bit fuzzy when one of the members of the Israeli military spoke with our morning show, CNN This Morning.

So, are you a little bit concerned about the differing stories that are coming out? Obviously, they're in the middle of an operation, which gets very complicated, but do you have any concerns about the different stories that you're hearing from the IDF? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Well, first of all, U.S. intelligence has also confirmed that they believe that there is a Hamas infrastructure below that hospital. So, it's not just the Israelis. With that said, look, I'm deeply worried about civilians that are in the hospital that Hamas wouldn't let leave and, obviously, I'm worried about these unborn babies needing the medical tools, incubators, things that they need. I know the Israeli government is trying to send those things and try to get them out of that hospital. But we've got to stop listening to Hamas.

There wouldn't be all of this focus on the hospital if they didn't have evidence that they're being looking for, if they didn't have access to tunnels, if they didn't have the technology to see below. They are there for a reason. That's why there is a continued focus on the hospital.This idea that Israel is just picking on a hospital trying to hurt people is the Hamas propaganda that they want. Hamas could have let those people leave weeks ago, right? They could have let them leave, but they held them at gunpoint. Because what Hamas wants is Hamas wants to use the Palestinians, the innocent Palestinians, as propaganda. They want them to die and then they want to put those images all over television. Israel doesn't need to just protect Israel from Hamas. Israel needs to protect the innocent Palestinians from Hamas, right?

Are they in the tunnels? Are they not in the tunnels? Are they spread out? Are they alive? Are they okay? And this uncertainty that exists and how Hamas is using it for propaganda, by killing a hostage or sending videos of a hostage or misinformation, I mean, they are torturing these families. And these are -- the overwhelming majority of these are not soldiers. These are innocent civilians. Some of them are kids. One of them was a pregnant woman. One of them was a Holocaust survivor. I mean, they took people that were just indiscriminately. They took peace advocates. They took people who were fighting for rights of Palestinians. They didn't care if you were a Jew, they took you.

I'm not saying the chairman did anything wrong, maybe he did, maybe he didn't, perhaps, if, innuendos. And that's what the chairman has been doing every night on Fox News. And so I just wanted to point out to the American people the hypocrisy. Obviously, the chairman clearly needs a mental health day, so I hope he gets that. But, yes, how he reacted, in my opinion, has shown the chaos that Republicans have been in for the last ten months. I mean, they removed one of their speakers, they can't pass bills, they can't keep the government open without Democrats, they can't fix the debt ceiling without the Democrats, they can't pass any aid to Ukraine or Israel without the Democrats. And so you are seeing this just pent-up frustration on the Republican side. And so, look, I think, as far as I'm concerned, I'll work across the aisle, I'll work with my Republican colleagues wherever I can for the betterment of the American people, but at the same time, I'm going to call them out when they're misleading the American people and manipulating the information for political gains because of Donald Trump has given them instructions that they want to try to hurt Joe Biden for electoral purposes.",
