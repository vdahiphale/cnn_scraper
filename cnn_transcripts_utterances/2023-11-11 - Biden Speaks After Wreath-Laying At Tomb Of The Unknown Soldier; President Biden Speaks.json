He also had been touting achievements that he had made legislatively or policy wise in this category, of course, over the course of this week. So, Arlette, just give it to me. What policies has he been working on here and your reaction to what we just heard? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, President Biden stood there at Arlington National Cemetery, a site that he described as a sanctuary of sacrifice, trying to honor those veterans who have served this country. The president said that he was there to honor the generations of Americans who stood on the front lines of freedom. He talks about how there is this battle between darkness and light that -- and that generation after generation, American troops and veterans have showed up to fight that battle against darkness. The president, of course, also talked about this in very personal term, saying that it is not just an honor to be there as president, but also a privilege -- a privilege as the father of the son of a veteran, referencing the -- his late son, Beau Biden, who had served in the Delaware Army National Guard in Iraq in the past. The president said that his son would often talk about the duty that he felt to the country. And that is a similar duty that millions of veterans also feel at this time. Now, this comes on Veterans Day, but the president's administration just yesterday had rolled out a series of steps, series of actions that they are trying to take to help veterans. That includes trying to make some health care and nursing home services free of cost for World War II veterans. They're also making establishing these programs to help protect veterans and their families from fraud and scams. And then there is also the speeding up of eligibility for those veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits. That piece of legislation, the PACT Act is really one of the marquee pieces of legislation the president has gotten across the finish line when it pertains to issues of veterans. That's also a personal issue for the president as his own son had been exposed to toxic burn pits as he served in Iraq. But President Biden today taking a moment to honor and celebrate those veterans who have given their time, their service, also the families who have supported them all in defense of this country, and that idea of democracy.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [12:22:52] JIMENEZ: Now, for the critical situation unfolding in Gaza, Israeli troops are now in an intense ongoing fight against Hamas near one of Gaza's major medical centers. Now, medics at the Al-Shifa Hospital say the complex has been hit by artillery fire. The IDF hasn't yet addressed those reports, but has denied the claim by one official of the Hamas controlled health ministry in Gaza that al-Shifa Hospital is under complete siege with staff and patients unable to leave. The Red Cross says that Gaza has healthcare system has passed the point of no return. Meanwhile, Israel Defense Forces say they have now captured 11 Hamas military posts as the fighting across Gaza intensifies. Today, thousands of Gazans fled south as the IDF open another seven- hour evacuation window, marking the fourth straight day of evacuation corridors opening in northern Gaza. With the world watching, the humanitarian crisis unfold, today, leaders from Arab and Islamic nations have been meeting in Saudi Arabia, reiterating calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. We're also seeing major protests around the globe, including a large pro-Palestinian demonstration today in London. Police there say they had to arrest more than 80 counter protesters for what they call a breach of the peace. So, we have a team of reporters covering all of these developments.

And today, the Israelis did conduct a drone strike on a truck about 25 miles north of the border, which represents the deepest penetration by Israeli drones since the war in 2006. The Hezbollah leader said that, for instance, to for -- Hezbollah is using for the first-time attack drones going into Israel. And he also noted that Hezbollah is using Iranian designed Burkan missiles, those are short range ballistic missiles which have a 500 kilogram or more than half a ton explosive payload. In fact, we saw a video of that particular striker using that missile, and it was very big.

But there's experience of precedent for doing this. ISIS once occupied major urban areas to include Mosul in northern Iraq. And they were successfully eliminated as a terrorist threat and the territory was regained to civilian and popular control.I think it can be done. I think it is not going to be easy.

I don't think we've accommodated the population. And so as a result, there's no way for them to leave Gaza, for those that are not directly affiliated with Hamas. And so innocent civilians can't leave the area, and in large measure, I think that's because the United States has not worked with regional partners to accommodate the population, even on a temporary basis, which I think is all that would be required, and probably all that would be tolerated.And so as a result of that, I think the situation becomes even more complex.

And we thought we could apply the same principle.So we brought him here. And then within 24 hours of him arriving, his heart stopped. And we were doing chest compressions on him. And it was very clear that although he needed a transplant, he just didn't have time. So the thing that made logical sense to us was to do the source control, and take out the lungs that were making him that sick. So we came up with this strategy to rid out the blood as it's pumped from his heart, by creating some artificial channels, and just to keep him alive. But one of the things that we realized, as we took out the lungs was, how do you support the heart, if we get into the ICU with a little turn, if you set up, it would just cause the heart to just fall in one place. And that would be the end of everything. So we are thinking about how to stabilize that. And the thing that immediately, you know, kind of caught our attention most, to use the biggest implants we have, because the chest cavities are pretty big. So we use those big implants. And in fact, the double B's are the biggest we had. So we just use those to temporarily stabilize his heart while we took him to the ICU and kept him alive for a few days, waited for his body to clear the infection and then did the transplant.",

And one of the common causes of that death is what this young, you know, individual went through, which is, you know, the virus destroyed the lungs, but then they get the second wave of infections from really nasty infections acquired in the hospital in the ICU settings, and they're not able to make it to the transplant or the transplant is necessary.So in him because he was otherwise quite healthy, we felt like potentially, we could use a creative, innovative strategy to get him to the transplant while removing the source of his infection and giving time for his body to clear rest of the infection. See, because double lung transplant is a very complex procedure, and the body has to be able to withstand that.

So to be able to take those lungs out safely without spilling the infection in the bloodstream, gave us some novel insights into how to perform these operations.That in fact resulted in us being able to do transplant and carefully selected patients who had stage-four lung cancer limited to the lungs. In fact, we did that a couple of years ago. And in that we were able to successfully take both the lungs out and temporarily support the patients.
