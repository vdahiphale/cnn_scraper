We'll take you inside what is shaping up to be the most dramatic Veep stakes ceremony ever.And the major news out of the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin withdrawing a controversial plea deal for three alleged 9-11 terrorists. The abrupt reversal tonight on \"Laura Codes Live.\" All right, so Kamala Harris is about to have one of the most interesting weekends in political history. And, by the way, a long line of interesting weekends in political history recently. Hear me out on this. She became the official Democratic nominee for president today, as you know. You know the DNC convention is two weeks away. But she's got to pick her running mate, and she's got to do it pretty quickly. I mean, as in, like, this weekend. It is arguably the most important decision any candidate, let alone she, can make, and has to make, and soon. And no one really wants to rush it, right? I mean, you think about Trump taking, what, 20 months to actually announce who his running mate would be? But, hey, it's the year 2024, and nothing is normal. So instead of taking weeks to think about that decision, Harris instead has to go and do it the equivalent of a kind of political speed dating, doesn't she, to find the perfect match. Now, we're hearing from sources that she has six face-to-face interviews that she has got to get done between now and the big unveiling on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Now, you've got the party's rising star, the battleground governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, the swing state astronaut, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, the Midwest-Minnesota-Neistat (ph) Governor Tim Walz, and her one-time political ex-rival-turned-Biden cabinet member, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Now, the Democratic governor of a deep state, he's also a red state, he's also there, Kentucky's Andy Beshear, who seems to really want it. And then you've got the billionaire, Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois. Now, look, no one knows who'll get the kind of political rose, but her choice will be critical. So what are you going to look for? Well, there is the electoral map to consider, of course. Maybe a swing state governor can help her win one of those swing states. There's also the vibe. She has to be able to trust that person and feel they can be her partner in all of this and could one day, possibly, as the line of succession is there, could serve as president. And of course, the first rule of picking a vice presidential nominee, do no harm -- J.D. Vance. Now, the buzz around Josh Shapiro, it's unavoidable. And it's why the press today was really trying to get anything out of him. I mean, anything out of him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All three of them have been sort of out there auditioning for it and all doing very well.I think Governor Walz has come out of nowhere because he's so well in articulating the Democratic message in a way that everybody can respond to. People in northern Minnesota who are pretty conservative are responding just as well as the people in Minneapolis who are pretty liberal. So I think he's coming out of nowhere to sort of be maybe the front of the pack. But she's going to get the bump from that. She's going to get a bump from the convention.

When you put her in front of, you know, an entire gaggle of reporters, that in some ways can be more of a risk than they want.You know, another test for her is if she goes on foreign trips. You know, we know previously that there have been moments where, you know, she may have made a mistake and they're trying to minimize that. And I think she's done quite well. Her campaign has told me that her speech in Georgia on Tuesday was one of the best speeches she's given that they've seen in her political career. And that's the type of momentum that they want to keep next week, the week after that, the Democratic Convention.

But today, something happened that could provide some unsteady grounds in the months to come. After weeks of hearing the Biden administration speak about the strength of the economy, a crack emerged in the form of the July jobs report. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3 percent.My panel is back with me now on this point. First of all, Jami (ph), look at this. I mean, there is this wave of excitement. The Kamala momentum, people are calling it. You've got $300-plus million that's been fundraised. But the Bidenomics issue has not gone away and voters having a disconnect between how he wants them to feel and how they do feel about it. What does the Harris campaign have to do to course- correct that?",

This was one bad month in a series of, like, 11 great months that shocked even most economists. So she has to run on that. But she has to give a vision for what the next four years of her administration will look like, and you're seeing it.Look, she's the first candidate who's talked about, like, rent prices, something that affects millions of people around the country. And she's talking about how she's actually going to lower prices for everyday Americans, what she's going to do on prescription drugs, stuff like that. And you'll contrast that with Donald Trump's policies, which seem to be just another round of massive tax cuts for very rich people that does little to help anybody else, on top of the massive tax cuts that he passed in 2017 that only ballooned the deficit. So I think she's going to have to lay out her vision and separate a little bit from Joe Biden. But it'll be a contrast of what the Trump years versus what the Biden-Harris years looked like.",

And if people understood for two minutes what the dynamics of this was, it never should have got out of hand in this regard. And I feel so sorry for this young woman who has been subjected to these attacks when all it boiled down to was that the woman that she competed against realized after getting hit she couldn't compete. And rather than accept that gracefully as a competitor, she chose to weaponize this further by crying and by saying it was unjust. There was nothing unjust about it. I mean, to be frank, you just got your butt beat and that's the end of what happened. And seeing how all this ugliness and hatred and bigotry ballooned as a result, I think there's a lot of people that really need to take a hard look at themselves about what is it that would drive so many people to denigrate and try to destroy this woman.

We saw this with Serena Williams throughout her career, because she's strong, she's powerful. Unlike other tennis players that she played against or were part of her era, she had one of the most powerful serves, if not the most, that you had seen in tennis.And constantly she had to face caricatures and stereotypes that she was a man. So these are very specific attacks that are often directed at women of color, especially Black women. And then beyond all that, I heard a whole lot of people who were ready to be loud and wrong about this, chime in, using women against other women, saying, we need to protect our daughters. We need to protect women's sports. Meanwhile, the Dutch, they have a volleyball player who was a convicted rapist, convicted of raping a 12-year-old who was playing at the Olympics. I didn't see any of those same people with those protect our daughters, protect women and girls in sports. And often when it comes to issues of equity, when we're talking about financial investment, when we're talking about giving female athletes and women's sports appropriate media coverage, where's that protect women's sports crowd then? Where's Donald Trump's tweets about protecting women and protecting women's sports when we're talking about how women are under-invested in when it comes to sports? The things that are damaging women's sports and are damaging participation are lack of investment, lack of resources, and lack of media coverage. Those are the things that hurt women's sports.
