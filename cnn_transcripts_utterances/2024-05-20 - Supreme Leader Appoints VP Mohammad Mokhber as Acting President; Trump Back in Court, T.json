Leaders of the Israeli government and of Hamas now face potential arrest warrants from the world's top criminal court and questions hanging over the future of Iran's government after the sudden deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi, and the Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash. It is 2 pm here in London it is 3 pm at The Hague, where we begin this hour's special coverage. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor has told CNN in an exclusive interview that he is seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He is accusing three Hamas leaders including Yahya Sinwar of extermination, taking hostages and of sexual violence among other serious charges. He is also accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of extermination, starvation and deliberately attacking civilians in Gaza. Here is part of the interview Christiane Amanpour conducted earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, there are international rules of the road, even when it comes to war. And it's the United States above all, Israel's biggest ally, the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, which has constantly been saying since the beginning since October 7th, to take care of the civilians.

Now, keep in mind, this helicopter, I've seen reports, it's a U.S. made Bell Helicopter that Iran purchased back in 1979. And given that Iran has been under U.S. inspired international sanctions, for decades, some are attributing the crash to the fact that the helicopter was not as well maintained as it could, but it's obviously early days, it was only in the early hours of this morning that the helicopter was actually found the remains that is. And so we'll just have to see what they come up with in terms of the actual cause for the crash. As far as the functioning of the government going ahead well, we've heard from Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, that the government continues to function and I don't think anybody actually expected it not to given the fact that since the 1970 -- 79, Islamic revolution, despite external and internal pressures. This is a very solid regime, which as Christiane did mention has been suffering from falling credibility in recent years, but it still functions. Now we understand that Muhammad Mokhber (ph), who is one of 12, vice presidents in the Iranian system, the most senior of them, is now an interim president. And there's going to be a 50 day period mandated by the Iranian constitution, during which he will be consulting with the speaker of parliament, and the head of the judiciary to prepare the grounds for a new election for a new president, a president who will serve a full four year term. However any Iranian who a Shia Iranian can qualify to run for president but the Council of Guardians which is made up of six senior clerics will actually hand pick who they believe is eligible to run for president. So after 50 days, we will have an election for the president in Iran. At this point, nobody has put their name forward, obviously. So we'll yet again, just have to wait and see Becky.",

We have him on record, basically making fun of unnamed Western countries with 40 percent turnout, as evidence of people not really caring about the political process in those countries.

What are we hearing from inside Iran right now? Because there will be others who will say there is no love lost on the news of the death of the president? NEGAR MORTAZAVI, IRANIAN-AMERICAN JOURNALIST AND POLITICAL ANALYST: That's absolutely correct, Becky. I would call it a very polarized sort of society atmosphere. He wasn't a very popular president. He actually came out of an election, a presidential election with the least voter turnout and a very active boycott movement by a big portion of the Iranian population -- our society who did not participate in a previous presidential election. And before that, when he ran against Hassan Rouhani in a presidential election, he actually lost a big margin. So I would say as the voter turnout, and also the actual number of votes -- Raisi was not a popular president. Of course, he did have supporters. He did have people who voted for him and we are going to see sort of both images of Iranians who are mourning for him and also Iranians who are to the other extreme in essence of celebrating actually his death.

Those are not decisions only made by the President, certainly not by President who, as I said on popular not considered very strong only in the office for three years. And it comes down again, from the top person, the supreme leader, I don't see a major shift in the direction of the country's policies, but this is going to create disruption, maybe even chaos in the domestic politics, especially because their own constitution requires an election within 50 days.

Donald Trump's hush money trial is back underway. The credibility of Trump's Former Lawyer and Fixer Michael Cohen is once again on the line. As Cohen returns to the witness stand for cross examination and he is back on the stand, based on our latest updates here. Cohen has already faced six hours of grilling by Trump's defense attorneys over two days last week. Now earlier, the judge said he expects closing arguments in this case, its begin next Tuesday, based on the court schedule and a holiday schedule here in the U.S. The biggest question before then, though, is whether the former president will testify in his own defense? We will see. Joining us now to discuss the latest with the trial is former state and federal prosecutor David Weinstein, really appreciate you being here. And as everybody can see, on the left side of your screen, you are seeing the actual real time updates we're getting from inside court. So David, one of the big moments last week when Michael Cohen appeared to contradict himself, over an account of a call he'd previously said was to talk about the hush money payment, but based on texts that were produced that appeared the call, at least to begin with was about something else entirely. Is that -- what do you see, credibility wise? Is that recoverable for the prosecution?",

And so it certainly is a point for the defense because Cohen's recollection isn't necessarily what he claims it to be.

It was simply about protecting his family, that remains to be seen or they going to call a witness who's going to bolster that part of their argument? Or do they think they've made enough headway through Cohen, to show that, that's not what the intent was, and that takes it from being this felony for which they want the conviction to a misdemeanor at best?

And they're also outraged at the fact that the ICC is doing this at the same time as they are seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders. A lot of outrage about the kind of moral equivalency that Israeli officials say that suggests. We've heard from the Israeli Foreign Minister, Israel Katz saying, for example, quote, the scandalous decision of the Prosecutor General of the Criminal Court in The Hague is an unrestrained frontal attack on the victims of October 7 and our 128 hostages in Gaza. Notably these charges that would be sought if he's -- arrest warrants are approved by the panel of judges that the ICC would charge Netanyahu and Gallant not only with crimes against humanity, but war crimes also stemming from what the ICC views as the forced starvation of the Palestinian people using starvation as a weapon of war, something that Prosecutor Khan had actually warned against for months as there appear to be limitations on humanitarian aid entering Gaza. There are also charges of course for Hamas' top three leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh. Hamas is also responding to those charges, which include crimes against humanity and war crimes, extermination of people among the list of charges the taking of hostages, and rape and sexual assault. The Hamas in a statement says a quote, strongly condemns the attempts of the ICC Prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against the number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis. So Hamas, they're also taking issue with the fact that these -- the seeking of these warrants is happening for both Hamas as well as for Israel. Now, in terms of the practical implications of this, no one really expects the leaders of Hamas or the leaders of Israel to actually be arrested and tried, certainly not anytime soon. 124 member states are party to the Rome Statute that set up the International Criminal Court, Israel is not party to it, nor is the United States. However, as we've seen with Vladimir Putin, who was charged last year by the ICC, this could potentially limit Netanyahu and Gallant's travel to certain European countries, for example, that are party to this statue.",

Jeremy, thank you. Well, it is a busy. We'll have news here turning to London where the High Court has granted WikiLeaks Founder, Julian Assange a lifeline to avoid extradition to the United States. Celebrations took place outside that court where justice is ruled that U.S. is assurance it's over Assange's right to use freedom of speech as a defense in a trial when not sufficient, and he will be allowed a full appeal hearing in London at a later date. But Assange faces life in prison on espionage charges for posting classified documents on WikiLeaks in 2010 and in 2011. Joining me now is CNN's Clare Sebastian. Clare, just walk us through what happens now with today's ruling.",

Spiegel 17 pages -- SEBASTIAN (voice-over): As the world watched for WikiLeaks, his next move in November 2010, Sweden opened an investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Assange and issued an international arrest warrant for his extradition. Assange denied the allegations claiming it was retribution for his political work and orchestrated to pave the way for his extradition to the U.S. He turned himself into London police and was later released on strict bail conditions. Then, in an unexpected twist, he entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 and was granted political asylum, the start of a seven year diplomatic route.",

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): WikiLeaks published hacked emails from DNC staffers and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign. Over time his relationship with his host soured. Ecuador revoked his asylum in 2019 and London police arrested him on an extradition warrant from the U.S. Justice Department to face a conspiracy charge. 17 new counts under the Espionage Act followed. Assange was sentenced to prison for violating his 2010 bail conditions and spent five years fighting extradition to the U.S. mostly isolated at Belmarsh high security prison. Two years ago, he married his lawyer and mother of his two children, Stella Morris inside jail. If extradited and convicted in the U.S., Assange could face up to 175 years in prison. (END VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (on camera): Well, Becky, of course, that is not happening imminently. As I said, we don't know when the appeal will be there hasn't been a date set. But suddenly there is another option that is raising hopes. Yeah, there were a lot of flags outside the court today that said, let him go Joe, a reference to comments by President Biden of the U.S. Just a few weeks ago, that he was considering a request from Australia to drop the case entirely. I spoke to the Editor in Chief of WikiLeaks. He said that they are really piling on the pressure on the U.S. to do that. Now they don't want to wait for another long drawn out legal process. So really the hopes of being pinned on that international pressure as well as this renewed hope for success in the British court system.",
