Lawyers for Hunter Biden once again seeking a new trial following his conviction on federal gun charges. The move comes a week after a previous motion was withdrawn by Hunter's defense team without explanation. An Arizona election worker arrested for allegedly stealing a security fob and keys from the Maricopa County Election Center. The fobs are used with special secure tablets during the election. All of them must now be reprogrammed at the cost of $19,000. Two American astronauts scrapping plans for a spacewalk outside the International Space Station. NASA calling it off after a water leak in a - in the cooling unit of one of the space suits was detected. Julian Assange is a free man this morning. The WikiLeaks founder accepting a plea deal related to his role in one of the largest leaks of classified material in American history. Under the deal, Assange will plead guilty but avoid any time in a U.S. prison. All right, once again it's primary day with closely watched races in New York and Colorado that will decide the political future of two high profile House incumbents. In New York, the Democratic congressman, Jamaal Bowman, is up against establishment candidate George Latimer in a $20 million effort by pro-Israel groups to oust him over his criticism of the war in Gaza. In Colorado, Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert faces her first test since switching districts and after getting thrown out of a theater last fall for vaping and, shall we say, lewd behavior. Both Bowman and Boebert hoping to keep the incumbent hot streak going. So far, just one sitting House lawmaker has lost their primary this cycle. The panel is back. Guys, this - this primary in New York, very closely watched. And I want to play a little bit of what we have been hearing from Jamaal Bowman. He was at, you know, a rally with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez over the weekend. She came in for him. Let's just give a - give a little taste of - because, I mean, we've got to bleep the language. It gives you a feel for how this race is playing out right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Jamaal Bowman dared to speak up for Palestinians. AIPAC doesn't give a damn about us. AIPAC doesn't give a damn about the Bronx. REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY): So, we going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to let the guns out. We're going to show them who the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) we are. AIPAC is scared to death. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Massapequa, which is like the -- where Hillary Clinton used to live, and might still live, or Chappaqua, it's - yes, Chappaqua, it - they don't care about this stuff.

And Bowman - and when you talk to people about it, this is about Israel for sure and the comments that he's made, but it's also about people feeling like Bowman has been too caught up in some of the larger ideological squad issues. You remember that incident where he pulled the fire alarm and there's a lot of criticism about that.So, he has created a weakness for himself over years that then groups like AIPAC, but not just AIPAC, have been capitalizing on. I think most people go into tonight expecting that he - it's Latimer's race to lose. We'll see. New York primaries can be a little bit weird.
