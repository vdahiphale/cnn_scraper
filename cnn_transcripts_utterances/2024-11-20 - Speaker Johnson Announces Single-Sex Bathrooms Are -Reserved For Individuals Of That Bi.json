      "sentences": "We heard Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton -- I know you're tracking this. He said, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\"And he was talking about Democrats sort of struggling with this issue in a way that speaks to maybe the middle of the electorate in this last election. You had Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi saying, \"I don't want to discriminate against anybody, but I don't think biological boys should be playing in girls' sports. You know, what do you say to them and to Democrats as they are navigating this issue? LAVERNE COX, ACTRESS &amp; TRANSGENDER RIGHTS ADVOCATE: I would say that sports -- that sports, as the trojan horse, is a really great way to reduce trans people to testosterone levels, to our bodies, which is a way to dehumanize us. The sports -- sports question was brilliant -- a brilliant strategy for Republicans who are not interested in the liberty and the way to fear monger and among trans people. There are less than 100 trans athletes in the K through 12 system in this country. Many of the states, who have passed sports bans, 26 states, half the country now has those sports bans. Many of these trans athletes in that where there was only one trans athlete in that state. And so, again, what I would say to these people that less than 1 percent of the population that trans people are, and they spent $215 million scapegoating us to win an election. This is about divide and conquer. This is about a lot of things. it's about a lot of things. it's about a Republican party who doesn't have an economic message that resonates with working-class people and a Democratic party that also doesn't have a message that would resonate with working-class people. And that, and two parties that have both been captured by corporations. And so what the Republicans have done is they have no problem just telling complete lies, recycling those lies in their media ecosystem, setting the agenda, setting the terms of every debate. And then Democrats responding to the terms of that debate on really -- it's the second, we're the second. I've heard -- I've had so many people say gender affirming care for young people is up for debate, trans people in sports is up for debate. My identity is not up for debate. The second we can see that we can debate health care for young people, we have conceded to bigoted, dehumanizing terms that anti-trans people have set forth. I am not interested in, like, having a debate about my identity. I'm interested in access, equal access law and my liberty. And I also I just want to remind trans people, this is not the first time that our identities have been criminalized ,LGBTQ-Plus people, this is not the first time our identities have been criminalized in this country. We -- some of us survived the times before that. It was just 20 years ago, 2003, Lawrence v. Texas, where being gay was, you know federally legal in this country. So we haven't actually had right overtly for very long. So we have to figure out ways to survive. There have been underground railroads of resources and community aid and mutual aid. Now we -- it's -- it's coming. I believe they're going to do everything they say in probably 2025. How do we survive? Be there for each other. We have to do it in connection in community, take care of our mental health first and foremost. And we have a right to be here. I love my country. I might have to leave it if I'm criminalized. But my -- I've lived the American dream. And everyone should have the right to do that. Everyone. And I insist that trans people do everything that we can to survive this and to live our dreams even as they dehumanize, stigmatize and criminalize our existence.",

Because when you have anti-personnel mines, they are different in characteristics from an anti-tank mine here.And what's key here is this little fact right here, 160 countries have -- have banned or signed a treaty that bans the use of these mines. Now these particular mines, the ones that the U.S. is shipping to Ukraine, are actually battery powered and they, in essence, have a time delay associated with them. They are only active for a certain period that can be set. It can be set for a couple of weeks, or it can be set for just four hours. So that's kind of the difference when it comes -- when it comes to that. But that's all part of a big -- a big aid package that the U.S. is shipping to Ukraine.",
