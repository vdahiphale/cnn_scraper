I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, we begin this hour with the new developments in the high- stakes talks to avoid a looming debt crisis. Just a short time ago, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy agreed to meet tomorrow for another round of negotiations on raising the debt limit, and staff level talks between the two sides will resume in the next few hours. The two men agreeing to a one-on-one meeting after what McCarthy called a productive phone call today with the president as he flew home from the G7. And before departing, Biden painted a grim picture of the talks telling reporters that he cannot guarantee the US will not default in 11 days when the US government runs out of money and is unable to pay its bills. We have team coverage of all of these new developments. Phil Mattingly is in Japan at the G7 Summit, but let's begin with Melanie Zanona in Washington, DC. Melanie, Kevin McCarthy just spoke about the call with the president calling it productive. Help us understand where things stand. Is he optimistic?",

So after a weekend of rejected offers and stalled talks, the negotiators were really looking for a much needed reset, and they may have gotten it in that phone call today between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden.It was a cordial conversation, we're told. They talked about the debt ceiling, they talked a little bit about Biden's trip, but perhaps most importantly, is that they agreed to meet one-on-one tomorrow while staff will resume negotiations later tonight. Here is a little bit more about what McCarthy said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I believe it was a productive phone call. And so at the end of the phone call, what we agreed to do is we're going to have Congressmen Garret Graves and Patrick McHenry get back together with -- he is going to ask his team get back together, so we can walk them through literally what we've been talking about. I think some of the challenges here, they might not completely understand how we're coming about this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So the good news is that they have a mechanism to continue talking, but the bad news is they are still very far apart. And specifically, I'm told one of the biggest sticking points is spending levels. Republicans want to impose spending caps at fiscal 2022 levels on future spending, but they don't want to touch Defense spending. So that would mean significant cuts on the domestic side of things.And then the White House is insisting on sticking to current levels, which they argue over 10 years when you account for inflation would be a spending cut, and that is how scorekeepers look at it. But this is billions of dollars of apart -- a billion dollars apart is what we're talking about, like tens of billions, potentially a hundred billion dollars, so you can see how big the gap is and how much they need to narrow it and that doesn't even get into the fact that there are a number of other sticking points that need to be resolved, whether it's tougher work requirements. That's something Republicans are pushing for; tax revenue, something Biden recently said should be on the table. And of course, time is not on their side. McCarthy was hoping to have a deal, at least in principle by either today or tomorrow. He said he needed it in order to be able to move it through the House in time to avoid that June 1st default, so there is a lot of work to do, and just not a lot of time to get it done -- Fred.",

Does the government for example, have the ability to prioritize, okay, maybe we'll pay Social Security recipients, but we won't pay the military, for example. Or most likely, the thing that they would prioritize would be payments to bondholders, because that would be that -- and defaulting on our payments to bondholders, so people who own Treasuries, people we owe money to, that would be catastrophic, and it could lead to cascading effects throughout other kinds of financial markets.

I mean, it is understandable to get caught up in the kind of the drama and the details of the negotiation itself, but taking even half a step back and realizing how extraordinary what we're watching is, you know, Republicans and Democrats alike in Congress did not try to leverage the debt ceiling for policy concessions under Donald Trump.The only times we have really seen this happen is a Republican majority trying to demand policy concessions they would not get otherwise by threatening default, they could throw the US and even the world economy into recession. I think this kind of posturing doesn't tell us whether we are going to get there, but one thing that I think is clear and that the President and Phil was alluding to, as well earlier, especially with Donald Trump out there now kind of openly campaigning for default, I think because he sees that as something that would just obviously destabilize the economy and hurt Joe Biden. That suggests with Trump out there openly campaigning for default that any eventual deal is going to need Democratic votes to pass. There are going to be Republicans who are not going to vote, even if they can get a deal for the final agreement and that means they need Democrats and that means that if Kevin McCarthy actually does want to prevent default that he does need to find a final point for this, that a reasonable number of Democrats in Congress will sign on to because he is not going to pass it solely with Republican votes.",

I think we haven't been in this territory before, so we don't know the full range of the consequences, but we know some likely consequences if there is a default, and particularly a default, where it looks like we have like permanently repudiated some of our debts, not that it's a few hours, but a deal is imminent, you would see, for example, interest rates rise, you would see all sorts of other financial assets throughout the world that are benchmarked against US Treasuries, also be viewed as more risky and potentially see the cost of those rise.You would see the collateral that backs a lot of other transactions suddenly become worth much less. You would probably see a lot of trades have to close out, what people in finance call margin calls, because suddenly that collateral is worth a lot less. And the result of all of these kinds of consequences is that financial markets could seize up. You could see lots of layoffs, you could see lots of companies have to pull back. And yes, there would be devastating economic consequences from those kinds of effects, not just in the United States, but potentially globally. Again, this is all untested. We don't know the extent of these problems, but we do know that Treasuries, US debt is essentially the underpinning of the entire global financial system. So if the safety of that asset is called into question, all of the other dominoes fall, we don't know where they fall, but they will fall.",

      "sentences": "Well, the scenario that is closest to this, Fred was actually the one in 2011, when John Boehner and the new Republican majority in the House after the Tea Party election of 2010, tried to leverage the debt ceiling into concessions from President Obama. Obama did in fact, engage in months of negotiation with them, many of which in the beginning were led by Joe Biden.And in the end, the whole thing fell apart, and on the literal final weekend, Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell cobbled together an agreement that allowed the debt ceiling to rise and created a process called sequestration, which included basically mandated cuts in both Defense and non-Defense spending. The lesson Biden took from that was not to negotiate around the debt ceiling, and he can make a claim that there is a fig leaf between this parallel negotiation on the budget and the debt ceiling. But ultimately, he has been backed into that same corner. If anything, the situation today is more difficult. The Republican majority is smaller. It is further to the right. McCarthy is weaker than Boehner and the broad negotiation that included taxes and Defense spending and domestic spending that existed in 2011 now really is reduced to domestic spending, and even on domestic spending, by exempting Social Security and Medicare, Republicans are trying to protect older America, which is predominantly White and focusing on the discretionary programs that invest in the youth population, which is now majority non-White. So there are all sorts of generational partisan racial implications in the budget plans that are coming out and it is not clear to me exactly how this -- if, in fact, this plane lands safely before we hit the deadline.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the short answer is that in Ukraine, it is a contested city. The Wagner mercenary group does claim to have captured the urban area. The government says you haven't captured it all, that it has a foothold there. President Zelenskyy made that point as did his senior commander on the ground actually on a visit to that foothold.But more importantly, the Ukrainian forces are flanking Bakhmut to the north and the south, and arguably could be in a position if they continue to advance to actually encircle Wagner troops in that city. Now the city itself has been reduced to rubble. There are no forces there that are friendly to Ukraine. And indeed, there are practically speaking no civilians there either. So effectively, it's become a free fire zone for Ukrainian forces to rain artillery down on the mercenary organization, which might explain why Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group has said he wants to withdraw his forces from the town by Thursday and see them replaced by Russian regulars. I think that's extremely unlikely, and if it were to try to be attempted, will provide Ukraine with a golden opportunity for a localized counterattack. And of course, the background of this is all to do with the ongoing anticipation of an offensive being launched in the summer by Ukraine to recapture land taken by Russia during its illegal invasion more than a year ago now. And with the boost to morale, at the very least from the agreement laid out at the G7 by President Biden to allow Ukraine to get to the position to both train and then ultimately be given or buy somehow, F- 16 aircraft and fourth generation fighter bombers, which they've been calling out for, for many, many months.",

He is looking for the burden to be shared not just by the city of New York, but also the surrounding suburbs around the city asking for municipalities to step up and help with what he says is a humanitarian crisis. Listen to what the mayor had to say this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: We received over 70,000 migrant asylum seekers in our city; 42,000 are still in our care.

That is because we were expecting next month a preliminary hearing. So that is when, Fred, a judge ultimately decides if a case goes to trial. The defense has the opportunity to challenge the prosecution's evidence, poke holes in it and attempt to throw these charges out. But instead, prosecutors called a grand jury to step in. And last week that grand jury said these charges should stand and this should go to trial. So now, that defense strategy is out the window and the case moves forward. So tomorrow, we are watching to see how and if Bryan Kohberger pleads to four counts of murder, one count of burglary and we're looking for a time line of some sort. Will we see a trial date set or most likely, we're going to have a status update, at least put on the calendar. But then looking a little farther ahead, what if any new information will we learn? There is a strict gag order in this case, meaning that lawyers for the victims, their families, prosecutors and defense attorneys cannot say anything publicly aside from statements in court documents. And Fredricka, we still don't know what prosecutors think is a motive here, or any potential connections between the suspect and the victims. Information six months later has been very, very limited. And finally, what we are watching to see, will the state seek the death penalty after Kohberger enters a plea? Within 60 days, Idaho prosecutors need to file written notice if they are going to seek capital punishment. So a lot to watch and it all really begins tomorrow -- Fred.",

He had to make it without real certainty that the target was there, that it was going to go well. It was very fraught, and he understood that if it didn't go well, that his presidency could be lost.But that's why you're in that job, and what distinguishes great presidents from other presidents or presidents who are willing to make those decisions when they think it's in the best interest of the country, but yes, look, we are increasingly in -- we are in increasing polarized times. After the 2012 election, the Republican Party did an autopsy of the election that they lost and the conclusion of that autopsy was, we need to moderate. We need to broaden our horizons, and then Donald Trump came along, and he had a completely different theory of politics and that really exacerbated the polarity that we see today. And that, frankly, we have to find a way out of, it is not healthy for the country. But you know, it's a much different time than when Barack Obama was elected in 2008 and there was a sense that maybe we could come together as a national community, and we did over some issues, but the politics have been really intense. The resistance has been really intense to that kind of unifying politics, and we need to get back to that.",
