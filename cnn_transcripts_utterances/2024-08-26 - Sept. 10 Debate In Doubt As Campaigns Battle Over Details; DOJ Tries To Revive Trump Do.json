So, it's a really risky mission. But all these astronauts say, they've been training for two years. They think they're ready. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, ANDERSON COOPER 360: Yes. Amazing.

The scheduled clash could be on the brink of collapse tonight. Jack Smith versus judge Aileen Cannon, the Special Counsel's major move, tonight, against the Trump appointee, who threw out the classified documents case. What they're staring down tonight, at Mar- a-Lago. I'll speak to Trump's former attorney. And it's never been done before. Four private citizens, getting ready to blast off into space, a history-making mission, this week, while two NASA astronauts stuck in space. Can you imagine? They're learning they won't hitch a ride home, until next year. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, more drama over the upcoming debate. Donald Trump, and his Democratic opponent for president, are going back and forth tonight, over muting or unmuting microphones, when the other candidate is speaking, at the debate scheduled, just 15 days from now. Except this time, instead of the muted mics that President Biden demanded, back in June, the Harris campaign wants mics on, at all times. Perhaps it has something to do with bad memories, of the night Trump was kept muzzled, while President Biden imploded into his microphone. Well, the Harris campaign says Trump should quote, stop hiding behind the mute button, so the Vice President can deal with his quote, lies and interruptions in real-time. The Trump campaign says muted mics were the rules that they agreed to. Perhaps it has something to do with former President's allies trying to keep their candidate on message. We'll ask for the candidate himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They also want to change the rules. You know, the deal was we keep the same rules. Now, all of a sudden, they want to make a change in the rules because she can't answer questions.",

Romney campaign veteran, Kevin Madden. And Washington correspondent, for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Tia Mitchell. All right. Let's just take a step back and note where we are, in this -- in this campaign season, right? I mean, this is a pivotal stretch, we're entering. In just a couple of weeks from now, mail-in ballots will be sent out in the crucial swing state of North Carolina. We're heading into the fall sprint.

He was muted.And at the end of the day, that was a terrible night for Joe Biden. But I think the Harris campaign thinks that it was made worse, by the muted mic. And so, they don't want to repeat that, and give Trump an edge by allowing him to be silenced, so that we don't hear everything he says during that hour, or 90 minutes.

It underscores what voters already feel about him, that he's thin-skinned, that he's petty, that it's all about himself, and that he then starts insulting Kamala Harris, which is exactly what he did in the clip that you showed. Every time he insults the Vice President, he loses votes. He loses votes from key coalitions of voters, young people, women, women of color. And so, I think that this is something that the Harris campaign is doing very strategically. But I also think that they're asking for the mics to be unmuted, is also very strategic. It's not just they thought that that worked in Trump's favor. It's that they see that perhaps if ABC does the same thing, that CNN, which is where the moderators aren't going to be seen, or aren't going to be tasked with fact-checking, right? Because it would be daunting, given Donald Trump lies every time he opens his mouth. Kamala Harris can do it. And if you have a muted mic, it is a lot more difficult to do that. This way, she has control, not just over what she says. But if he starts spewing lies, which we know he will, she can jump in and say, Hang on, that's not true. Here are the facts, right?

I'm one of the few people that has no social life, so I read it. And when you look at it, it actually, it's a very interesting argument. It's very nuanced. But it comes down to this idea that the appointments clause of the Constitution, which governs the idea of how Senate, the Senate, has to be involved in some of the appointments within the Executive branch, that that kind of trumps all other statutes. And what we have with Jack Smith's brief, signed off on by nine different prosecutors, and probably the entire Appellate Division looked over it with a fine tooth comb. What they're relying on is U.S. v. Nixon from 1974 to say, Hey, there's a Supreme Court case that says it's OK for the attorney general to appoint an independent counsel, or they're saying Special Counsel. The problem is just that. The case involved independent counsel, which is a different bird, a different animal. So, what we're looking at is essentially an argument by the defense that this is a legislative oversight. If they wanted to give permission, to the attorney general, to appoint a special counsel, all they had to do is have a statute. And so, that's the difference between the 1970s and now. You don't have a statute that governs special counsel. I think it's a novel argument. It was actually former Attorney General Ed Meese that raised it, in an amicus brief, and it's finally getting some traction. And I don't think it's a laugher.

And all of them bring different philosophies and different kind of attitudes to a case. So, you're going to get three judges, that morning, basically, or soon before the argument, that are going to have the first whack at it. If you lose, you might ask for what's called an en banc, ask the entire Circuit, to rule on the same issue. And I have to think, for something this momentous, this important to the case, and to history, that we're going right back up to good old SCOTUS, that the Supreme Court is going to get a petition, at least, and they'll probably hear this case eventually.

I mean, I don't know that this is a laughable position. But I don't think at the end of the day that Team Trump is going to win on appeal here. There's just too much -- there's too much in what Jack Smith is saying, about the historical record here, about the statutory record, and about the Supreme Court's unanimous opinion in U.S. v. Nixon. And I mean, Jim can say it's a difference between an independent counsel and a special counsel. But when you look at those actual positions, and the differences between them? There's really nothing there. So, I think the unanimous Supreme Court finding that Congress did vest in the attorney general, the right to appoint a special counsel, in that case, the Watergate Special Prosecutor, I think that's going to carry the day. BROWN: It's interesting, because if you read through the Jack Smith filing, he also points out that the Trump team's argument, or Judge Aileen Cannon, for that matter, how it would -- it would raise questions about the hundreds of other appointments within the federal government, not -- right? Not just in this case, but in other departments as well the Executive branch, including the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Labor. And so, would also raise the question how that would apply, right, to vacancies, right, for an acting U.S. Attorney, how their argument would apply to something like that? What do you think?",

But it gets a lot of play, in the higher courts, because they're thinking about how expansive is this ruling, if we do this, how impactful is this going to be? And the notion that inferior officers cannot be appointed to do things that are even semi-independent, across the federal government, would be a disaster. As you said, in all of these departments, you have inferior officers, who are appointed, pursuant to these statutes without having to be affirmed by -- confirmed by the Senate. And so, it's not just a Special Counsel, Jack Smith, problem. It's not just a DOJ problem. If the Eleventh Circuit, and ultimately the Supreme Court, does what Trump wants them to do, it's an entire Executive branch problem.

A billionaire, and three other private citizens, are attempting to travel further into space than any astronaut, since the Apollo missions, to reach the highest orbit around Earth ever, and also become the first civilians to take a high-risk spacewalk. My source, tonight, is one of the few humans, who have been to space. Former NASA astronaut, Dr. Mae Jemison, who was the first Black woman in space. Honored to have you on tonight.

What's really exciting about what's happening with the Polaris mission, is the amount of information that's being taken, some updates in the EVA or Extravehicular Activity, or spacewalk suits. So, those are things that are incredibly interesting. And some of the things that are happening, when you talk about risk, are the fact that they're going through the, you know, one of this very high orbit, going through the Van Allen belt, and the radiation that they may receive, and really, really trying to understand how is that mitigated. There were a number of things that I understand had to be done to the vehicle itself, to sort of harden it to the radiation. They're doing a spacewalk. It's going to use the same sort of means that happened in Gemini, where they're going to stay, have an umbilical and get all their life support system through that. So, it's a different kind of spacesuit than you see with the spacewalks that with the -- on Space Station, where you carry your own life support with you. So, there are a lot of different avenues that are happening. So the risk is, hopefully, not to the crew, right? But perhaps to the amount of science that can be done.
