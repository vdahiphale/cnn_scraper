But that's not stopping Biden supporters from organizing a write-in campaign to ensure the president scores a symbolic victory over some of his intra party challengers.Let's discuss with a key official that's leading that Biden write-in campaign, New Hampshire House Democratic leader Matt Wilhelm joins us now. Matt, thank you so much for being with us. I first want to get your reaction to reports that CNN came across that fake robocalls imitating President Joe Biden are going out in New Hampshire trying to discourage voters from casting ballots tomorrow. We have a clip of one. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm wondering what do you know about these calls and are you concerned they could affect turnout?MATT WILHELM, (D) NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE HOUSE: Well, we've heard about these calls late last night. Word was getting around that these calls were coming into cell phones. You know, it's a deep fake disinformation campaign, it's really an appalling attempt to suppress votes and damage our democracy. And you know, probably a preview of what's in store for 2024. You know, I trust that law enforcement is going to take this seriously. I know the Attorney General here in New Hampshire and the feds are also being notified, but it's really a cynical attempt at voter suppression. I know it's going to backfire when voters respond by showing up to the polls in even greater numbers than expected tomorrow. SANCHEZ: So, let's talk about the why. Tomorrow's primary for Democrats is purely symbolic in that no matter who wins no delegates are going to be awarded. So why are you promoting this write-in campaign for President Biden?",

You know from volunteerism, to philanthropy, to campaigns and elections, you know no election is symbolic, especially when our democracy is quite literally on the line.Joe Biden is the only person to defeat Donald Trump. He did it in 2020. He's going to do it again this year. You know, his name may not be on the ballot due to this intra-party squabble. And I'm certainly disappointed that the DNC has put us in this situation. But you know, I have an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old and you know I'm not going to tell them that this election or any election is symbolic. It doesn't really matter. You know, it's something that we need to participate in. It is a rich tradition here in the state. You know if we didn't show up to the polls tomorrow that would be giving in to cynicism. So, you know, tomorrow we're going to write in the president and make sure that this critical campaign here in 2024 is off to a really strong start with a win in your first in the nation presidential primary. Right, Matt, you mentioned the -- I think you called it an awkward position that the DNC has put New Hampshire voters in. I want to ask you about a remark from someone you campaigned with earlier today saying that it was a mistake. Senator Maggie Hassan described it as a terrible mistake to exclude President Biden from the ballot. Do you agree with her?",

You know, senator Hassan, you know, knows what it takes to win here. She's done it time and time again. First as state senator than as governor and now as U.S. senator. And you know a swing state like ours, it is a top target of, you know, both the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the Democratic Governors Association in 2024 and this Grassroots Biden writing campaign it is totally separate from the DNC.And so, we are really just educating our neighbors about the importance of kicking off the president's campaign with a win here tomorrow and making sure that the president is reelected in 2024.",

President Biden will hold what is being described as very frank discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the formation of an independent Palestinian state. It's a proposal that Netanyahu is flatly rejecting time and again.Today, the EU's top diplomat called Netanyahu's stance unacceptable as Israel faces mounting pressure internationally to embrace a two-state solution. In the meantime, top White House advisor Brett McGurk is visiting Egypt and Qatar this week hoping to strike a deal to free more than 100 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. Here with us now we have CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. He's also the White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" And David, the Biden administration really seems to think or at least try to be communicating or, I don't know, trying to create that Netanyahu may be open to a two-state solution. You have heard some verbal gymnastics in your time when it comes to diplomacy. And that is a backwards somersault followed by a front handspring. So, translate what is going on here.",

He's been consistent on this issue for a long, long time.He has been opposed to a two-state solution. He has been opposed to a Palestinian state. At some moments he's suppressed those words so that he could get through a meeting with -- you may recall this came up often with President Obama, but not just with President Obama. But now after the October 7th attacks, he's being very clear. He's saying if there is a separate Palestinian state, it will be used as a base to attack Israel again. President Biden has also been clear. He's been clear that even before October 7th, there was no way they were going to get a recognition of Israel by Saudi Arabia. Sort of the next step in a peace accords with the Arab states unless there was an agreement to a two-state solution. So, they're stuck while Netanyahu is there.",

And the further embarrassment that the Israeli Defense Force was so slow in responding.And, you know, the key to Netanyahu's political message over the past number of years has been that he's the one who has kept Israelis safe. There seems to be a widespread view in Israel that when the war is over and there is a chance for an election or a change of government, he's out. But we also have an increasing sense that war isn't ending anytime soon if you define the war's goal as eliminating Hamas.
