We know late last year he was subpoenaed for documents related to payments that he received around the time that he was filing legal challenges on behalf of former President Trump trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election.And that subpoena came when it was still a Justice Department investigation. Before special counsel Jack Smith was appointed. Once Smith was appointed, Giuliani doesn't hear anything for over six months. And there were questions being raised about whether that meant that he was possibly a target and not just a potential witness in this investigation. So the fact that he has now sat down with prosecutors, talked to them, presumably answered questions, that is notable. Now we just got a statement from his spokesman Ted Goodman who said, quote, the appearance was entirely voluntary and conducted in a professional manner. From all of our reporting on this side of the special counsel probe, you know, looking at efforts to overturn the 2020 election, we always knew that this was going to have a longer timeline than the Mar-a-Lago documents probe. Because look, there are more people, right, with potential criminal exposure, more potential crimes. It's just a broader, more diverse array of potential criminal activity. But it does appear that over the past few weeks we have seen a flurry of witnesses going before the grand jury. We've seen other activity that suggests strongly that the special counsel could be nearing a charging decision. So far, he has not brought any charges related to January 6 but appears that could be coming. But it is completely unclear if Rudy Giuliani or former President Trump or anyone at all will definitely be charged. We're definitely seeing an uptick in activity. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is something that Kuleba also warned about. And they can do that without Wagner. So this was another adding to the very bleak list now of mass casualty events for civilians in Ukraine. Nine people now killed including a 17-year-old girl, two twin 14-year-old sisters in the restaurant. Kramatorsk is in the Ukrainian held part of Donetsk. It's only about an hour's drive from Bakhmut. So it is an important area where you find a lot of military, a lot of journalists. And a lot of them did frequent this pizza restaurant. So we don't know if that was the specific target or not.

But while this case was ongoing, the partisan balance of the North Carolina Supreme Court changed, and they ruled in late April that state courts have no role to play when it comes to policing election maps.
