This here is only a few yards away from a kindergarten. However, others are used to directly target critical infrastructure. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  More than 50 missiles fired just on Thursday, and while many of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, some were not brought down, adding to the daily toll of destruction.

And his lawyers, as a part of a lawsuit against the NFL over alleged racial discrimination and hiring practice -- well, those lawyers -- they criticized Wilks getting passed up for the Panthers job, saying, \"We are shocked and disturbed that after the incredible job Coach Wilks did as the interim coach, including bringing the team back into playoff contention and garnering the support of the players and fans, that he was passed over for the head coach position by [owner] David Tepper. There is a legitimate race problem in the NFL, and we can assure you that we will have more to say in the coming days.\" Now, the Panthers hired former Colts head coach Frank Reich yesterday. He spent five seasons with the Colts but was fired this season after a rough start. Reich actually played for the Panthers in their inaugural 1995 season, throwing the team's first-ever touchdown pass. All right, the Houston Astros, meanwhile, have hired Dana Brown as their next general manager. Brown spent the last four seasons as vice president of scouting for the Atlanta Braves. And with the promotion, the 55-year-old becomes the only Black general manager in Major League Baseball. All right, in the NFL, it's championship weekend in the AFC.
