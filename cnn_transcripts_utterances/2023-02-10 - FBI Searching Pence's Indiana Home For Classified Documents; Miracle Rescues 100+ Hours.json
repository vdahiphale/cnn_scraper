      "sentences": "Hi, there. I'm Victor Blackwell. Welcome to CNN Newsroom.The Department of Justice wants to know what former Vice President Mike Pence knows and potentially what he has. Right now, FBI agents are searching his home in Indiana. Remember back in January, a Pence attorney discovered about a dozen classified documents at the former VP's home. And just yesterday, the special counsel subpoenaed Pence. Jack Smith's office wants to hand -- him to hand over documents and testify under oath about interactions he had with Trump leading up to the 2020 election, and the attack on the Capitol. CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez joins us now. Evan, let's start with what you know about this search at Pence's home.",

This is something that the Justice Department, and that the FBI, and the Pence team had been working on for several -- for a couple of weeks, at least. And today is finally the day.You see there, the pictures of the state police blocking off the driveway, and they're doing a search there trying to find -- trying to see whether there were any more classified documents. For the Pence team, they want to try to get this over with. They are hoping that at the end of this, after this search, that there are no more documents found. We, by the way, also expect that there's going to be another search of his office, a think tank office that he has here in Washington, right across the street from the FBI building in downtown Washington. And if at the end of this, there are no more documents found, they hope that the FBI can wrap up this investigation without launching a full-blown investigation, without going to a special counsel. That's something that they're hoping to avoid because as you know, Victor, the former vice president has some political aspirations. He wants to go to Iowa. He wants to start at least beginning the conversation about a possible presidential run.",

But the vice president is -- the former vice president is an important witness in everything that happened in the lead up to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, everything from his meetings in December of 2020, where he laid out and talk to Trump about Trump's plans to challenge the elections, as well as some important meetings -- key meetings in a January of 2021, where they talked about this plan of theirs to try to have Pence put aside the election results and to try to impede essentially the transfer of power. Those are things that are at the center of this investigation.And we know, Victor, that there have been negotiations back and forth between the Pence legal team and the Justice Department as to how to do this. A key part of this is the fact that Mike Pence published a book in November where he talked a lot about these things. So, now obviously the Justice Department wants him to talk about this and possibly more, Victor.",

You need some kernel of evidence, some reason to believe there might eventually be proof of a crime. And you need what we call extraordinary circumstances which would be a conflict of interest.If there's no evidence that Pence had any classified documents other than the ones he turned over, if he's not a declared candidate for office, I don't see either of those things.

They're going to say, he's already talked about this publicly, Your Honor. And therefore, he's given up the right to keep it secret. Even if what he said was only sort of partial, even if he doesn't tell the entire conversation, that can be construed as a waiver. So, if you're Mike Pence, once you've come out and started discussing these things publicly, then there's an argument that you've given it away.Now, Donald Trump may have an actual interesting counterargument of he doesn't control the privilege, that's my privilege, I'm the former president, so maybe he did whatever he did, but that shouldn't be held against me. So, that'll be an interesting and really sort of unprecedented issue for the courts.",

But it did catch my attention that the former national security adviser had been subpoenaed in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation.I mean, I suppose prosecutors want to know, what do you know about these actual documents? What do you know about how they got to Mar-a- Lago? Was this run past you? Did you approve of this? And I think his answers could be really interesting there, whether he did or didn't know about it, whether he blessed it, whether he believes there's a security risk posed by these documents being at Mar-a-Lago.
