That's a cruise missile normally designed to destroy aircraft carriers with a warhead of more than 2000 pounds. BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR; And Ukraine's president vows those responsible for the deadly shelling of a residential building into Dnipro will pay for their crimes. What caused the accident which killed all passengers in the Yeti Airlines crash. Authorities have just received the black box. More on that is coming up. And as China prepares for its biggest holiday of the year, COVID cases jump into the tens of thousands. We've got a live report from Hong Kong for you this hour. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD coming to you from Abu Dhabi in the UAE. Hopes are fading fast to find any survivors in the rubble of a demolished apartment building in Dnipro. The death toll from a missile strike there now up to 40 including several children. Almost that many remain missing. Ukraine saying a Russian cruise missile destroyed the building countering a claim by the Kremlin today that it was hit by Ukrainian missiles used in counter attacks. Ukraine's president framing the strike is yet another act of Russian terror. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): I want to say to all those in Russia, and from Russia, who even now could not utter a few words of condemnation of this terror. Although they see and comprehend everything perfectly. Your cowardly silence, your attempt to wait out what is happening will only end with the fact that one day, the same terrorists will come for you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think for the civilians, that obviously is extremely difficult, because so manycivilians are affected, so many civilians are getting hurt or getting killed in so many areas and in so many different ways in Ukraine. You have, of course, all the areas around the front line, we've been speaking so much over the past couple of days, the past couple of weeks, about the fighting that's going on in the eastern part of Ukraine with the people having to flee there, people being killed there. But then also, in big cities, like the one that I am in right now in the Dnipro. People who were just in their apartments, people who were just going about their daily lives, all of a sudden ripped out of their lives, and many of them losing their lives because of a massive rocket strike hitting their building. Earlier today we were at the funeral memorial service for a 15-year-old girl here in the center of Dnipro who was inside this house, inside this building. And there were dozens of people, classmates, relatives who turned up there, obviously, many of them grieving, many of them also angry at the Russians as well. We saw that one woman in our report right now who said that she cursed the Russians. And it's interesting, because earlier, I was speaking with the mayor of the Dnipro. And he was telling me that actually, before this major war started, there was a lot of sympathy towards Russia here, especially in this part of Ukraine, especially in Dnipro area. Obviously now, that is no longer the case. And any sympathies that may have been there get destroyed by events like the one that we saw here. There is a lot of anger here on the ground on the part of the people and a lot of spare and a lot of grief. But at the same time, the people who do say that they remain strong, that they will remain strong and certainly are not going to back down in the face of what they see as terror against the civilian population, even as the Russians continued to claim that they were not behind the missile strike that happened here, Becky.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice over): A video on social media appears to show the passenger plane banking suddenly moments before the crash in western Nepal. On Sunday morning, a Yeti Airlines operated flight embarked on a roughly 30-minute flight from the capital of Kathmandu to Pokhara, the country's second most populous city. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We heard a loud thunderous crash and reached our terrace to see what had happened. We saw a lot of smoke and realized it was an airline crash, and we rushed to the site.",

So, that could answer the questions not only the investigators have, but also the family members. Like you said we've been lining up outside the hospitals waiting to receive the body of their loved ones. As far as the latest from the crash site is concerned, today was day two of search operations. It's ended with just one body in addition to the 68 that were recovered on Sunday being retrieved from the gorge. Cranes we use, Becky, to pull these bodies out from the gorge. We do know that all these bodies, a post mortem will be conducted on them after which they will be handed over to family members. There were 15 foreign nationals on board this inflated flight. We're being told that the bodies will be airlifted to a hospital in Kathmandu where the post mortems will be conducted, after which they will be handed over to family members. But only 38 bodies have been identified as we speak. So, there are a lot more bodies that need to be identified at this point.

And while that was part of it, and it's not necessarily even about Benjamin Netanyahu himself, it was about what these protesters see, as the core of Israeli democracy. A lot of these protesters say they're very proud of Israel's democracy, Israel's system, its Supreme Court. And they see these possible changes as really threatening the core of what Israeli democracy is about now. Well, a lot of these protesters talk about Benjamin Netanyahu, there is a movement that was against Benjamin Netanyahu, especially when he was prime minister, as his corruption trial has started. It really was about these proposed reforms to the judicial system that brought these people out. Now, this wasn't necessarily the biggest protest in Israeli history, but it was very large, at least 80,000 people came out. And I have to know, it was pouring rain while we were out there, and just absolute people were drenched. And yet, people stayed. And at one point, you just really couldn't move through the streets around the central score. So, it is notable, just the numbers that came out, especially considering the weather. But the big question now, Becky, is will this last? Will this momentum last? Because that's really essentially what they have as their option here. They don't have a majority in the Parliament. There's no written constitution. And so, it's really all comes down to this sort of public outcry and this public pressure, and will that -- whether that will actually move anything and will convince this government to either bring back or tone down some of these changes.

Akbari was accused with working as a spy for MI6 and reportedly provided information about dozens of Iranian figures, including the country's chief nuclear scientists Mohsen Fakhrizadeh who was assassinated in 2020, Iran says.

The first is at a former office here in D.C. We know 10 documents were found there. And they included top secret information. Now they also uncovered documents at his Wilmington residence. And that's where these new five pages that were revealed on Saturday, that's where those come in. Originally, they said that of those documents, there was one that was found in an adjacent room, that was a single page. Well, it turns out it was actually six pages and comprises multiple documents. Again, roughly 20 documents in total. And the big question now is OK, well, is this it? Could there be more classified documents? And we can say definitively, we don't know, because we do know from our reporting that not every possible location has been searched. The Biden team decided to look specifically at places where documents were shipped during the 2017 transition. But there are other locations as well. And what it'll be interesting to see is if they continue to search and who does it. Will the Biden lawyers do it or will it be passed off to the special counsel and the FBI? And another big question is, will they tell us if they find any more classified documents because while the White House did get out in front of this new disclosure, they didn't allow it to leak out through the media.
