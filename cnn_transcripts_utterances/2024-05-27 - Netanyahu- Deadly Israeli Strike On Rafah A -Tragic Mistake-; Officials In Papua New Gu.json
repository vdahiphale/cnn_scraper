      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu says the strike on a Rafah displacement camp was a quote, \"tragic mistake\", it killed at least 45 people. In a moment, I'll speak to U.N. in Rafah about the situation on the ground there. Then officials in Papua New Guinea now fear at least 2,000 people been buried in a massive landslide. We'll have more on the search as well as rescue efforts there. Plus, Ukraine reels from a deadly Russian attack in Kharkiv, which killed at least 18 people. We'll have that and much more just ahead. But first this evening, just days after the U.N.'s top court ordered Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah. A devastating strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians is triggering outrage right around the world, as well as new demands for accountability. Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 45 people were killed, many of them women and children. The attacks sparked a fire that swept through tents housing families, burning some people alive. Survivors tell CNN they spent the night pulling out charred bodies using flashlights to recover some remains. The Israeli military says it targeted a quote, \"Hamas compound with precision weaponry, precise Intelligence, an area of surveillance, killing two senior Hamas officials.\" Yet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also now acknowledging what he calls a tragic mistake. He says, Israel will conduct an internal investigation. Let's get more on this from our Jeremy Diamond who joins us this hour in Jerusalem. Jeremy, this is -- this attack on Rafah as we were saying, zoned for displaced women and children is absolutely devastating and terrifying. The video is just too graphic. Just tell us what you are learning.",

It is however, the first time that we have seen the Israeli military come out very swiftly and pledged to investigate the incident, with even the Israeli Prime Minister weighing in, calling this a tragic accident. That doesn't of course, diminish the horror of what has happened here as we see the images of women and children among the dead and the injured from this horrific strike overnight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MAYHEM) DIAMOND (voice-over): Their blood-cuddling screams tell the story of the unfolding horror, more than words ever could. But it is only as bodies are pulled out of the inferno that the scale of this attack becomes clear. At least, 45 people were killed after an Israeli airstrike targeted this camp for displaced Palestinians in western Rafah, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Plastic tarps engulfed in flames, sheet metal walls crushed by the blast. A block of make-shift shelters flattened in an instance. The Israeli military says the strike killed two senior Hamas militants who commanded Hamas' West Bank operations, Yasin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. In a rare move, the Israeli military's top lawyer launching an investigation into the strike, saying civilian casualties had not been expected. It was assessed that there would be no expected harm to uninvolved civilians. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.",

The Israeli military within 24 hours vowing to conduct an investigation, and I think all of this points not necessarily just to the uniqueness of this strike, although that is what the Israeli government will argue. They will argue that this was a mistake and an accident here. But I think it points more so to the chorus of international condemnation, Israel's increasing isolation on the world stage, and also keep in mind, the pressure from the United States in particular, as President Biden earlier this month warns that Israel would be crossing a red line if it carried out an all-out offensive in Rafah, that could lead to enormous civilian casualties. You know, I think it's a fair question to ask whether or not this strike, whether or not Israeli actions recently in Rafah do indeed cross that line, which the president has said would result in him withholding additional U.S. weapons from the Israeli --",

So, Ukraine really feeling intense pressure all along its frontlines slow and persistent. But ultimately, it seems slowly-changing the course of this war in Russia's favor.",

It is so swampy, especially even in Houston, that your body can't really evaporate its sweat to cool you off. And all you can do is get someplace cool, get in the shade or drink something cool. And all the numbers that you see on any weather map across the globe, those temperatures are always in the shade. Not in the sunshine. They're in a little white box with louvers and the air blows through it and it doesn't feel as hot. But Brownsville is going to feel like 111, 45 Celsius there. Yes, it will cool down a little bit. Dallas, you do have a cold front headed to you without thunderstorms, but it will cool you and dry you out a little bit. But all across the, what we call the deep south part of the United States, that's where the heat index and also that heat, humidity and sunshine will really cause problems today. A little bit farther to the north on up toward the big cities. We call this the I-95 corridor. Big cities, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, D.C., Baltimore, those are the cities that are under the gun for severe weather today. Not yet. There's a watch out and there are a few thunderstorms out there. But later on today, these storms will get stronger. Also, across parts of Georgia, the southern state there, down across parts of the southeast and part of the United States. So, yes, we have watches out, which means that some of these storms could contain some hail, likely as big as a nickel to me. Some spots, especially down to the west. This is the area that you're going to see the most severe weather today. Down to the south. Yes, just some thunder and lightning. But here's the problem, Isa. We have millions, and I mean probably tens of millions of people, outside today on holiday that will be out there hoping to have a very nice time in a picnic. But with power outages and the significant lightning threat today, you really need to have a place to go, even if it's your car. Keep something close at hand in case a thunderstorm rolls by you, because that is certainly a possibility. Just over the past three days, there have been 58 tornado reports across the United States, 737 reports of wind in excess that could cause damage.
