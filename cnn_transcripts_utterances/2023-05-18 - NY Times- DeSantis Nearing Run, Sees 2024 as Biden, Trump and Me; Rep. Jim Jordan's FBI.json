It comes on a day the company he has targeted, Disney decided to hit him with a billion-dollar blow. We'll have more on what Disney just announced shortly. But on DeSantis' run, sources are telling CNN he will be filing the paperwork next week. He had a call late today with donors and supporters and \"New York Times\" reporter listened in. Now I'm going to read your quote from that \"New York Times\" story which begins with something Ron DeSantis said on the call: \"You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing.\" Mr. DeSantis told donors on the call organized by this super PAC supporting him, Never Back Down. \"Biden, Trump and me, and I think of those three, wo have a chance to get elected president, Biden and me.\" Now according to \"The Times,\" he went on to say that he is basing that on swing state data, which he describes is not great for the former president, \"and probably insurmountable because people aren't going to change their view of him.\" Which is interesting because it would be hard to describe Ron DeSantis's recent moves is courting those same swing state voters. Instead, he appears to be trying to outflank the former president on the right, certainly on the issue of abortion, criticizing the former president for not saying during last week's CNN townhall whether he'd support Florida's restrictive new abortion law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): I signed the bill. I was proud to do it. He won't answer whether he would sign it or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And according to \"The New York Times,\" the average salary for those employees, each employee was going to be about $120,000.00. So the company today said we are no longer doing that. They cited changing business conditions, but of course, Anderson, the backdrop to all of this is Governor DeSantis tightening oversight of Disney's theme park and the surrounding area. This is after Disney issued that statement really slamming a signature piece of legislation that the governor had been touting, and Disney has accused DeSantis of being anti-business and Disney is now, they say, rethinking this whole plan of theirs to actually invest, Anderson another $17 billion in the state of Florida possibly bringing as many as 13,000 jobs.

The jobs environment was good, the economy was good. It is a good tax environment. He's kind of countering the best things about him by taking on the second biggest employer in the state.

But first, you have to win a primary, then you have to win a general, and I have said this to DeSantis' team, I've said it many times, he is making the circle of potential voters smaller and smaller by going as far into the culture wars, as he has. The biggest voting bloc in 2024 is going to be Gen Z voters, followed by millennials. We are the generation of marriage equality, even Republicans, 67 percent of Republicans don't support the attacks on the transgender community, yet he is making that such a big part of his political identity. If you're going to win swing voters that went away from Donald Trump in 2020, if you want to get them back into the fold to Independents and to moderates, he's got to start moderating and I just don't know that he has that in his wheelhouse. I would say real quick, this is a man who -- he doesn't sit down with mainstream media.

So the issue we had with the witnesses that they brought forward today is that Jim Jordan and his other -- and members of his party, particularly on that committee would like us to believe that these individuals are whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are individuals who will be protected by the government because they are disclosing allegations of misconduct. The individuals that we saw today have not alleged any misconduct by the FBI. What they have alleged is that the FBI asks them to do their job, and did not believe the January 6th was a regular day. The FBI believed that January 6 contained domestic terrorists and made these individuals act as federal law enforcement officers to go after and to investigate those individuals and that is exactly what they did not want to do. Friend did not want to be involved in the arrest of an individual who they've known has been armed. We saw pictures of him in January 6th with assault weapons, canisters of teargas, wearing protective masks himself. Other individuals as you heard from the reporter were downloading and disseminating to other FBI agents, information that they knew were fallacious and not true. I was told by the supervisor not to do it and continue to do it, and the third person recorded his supervisor when that is against the law for him to do that and downloaded information and put it out there into the public.
