We're tracking the SpaceX test flight, as well as Musk's growing influence over Trump and his incoming administration.Also breaking, new information that someone gained unauthorized access to confidential files, including a deposition with a woman who says she had sex with Matt Gaetz when she was 17 years old. This as demands to see the House Ethics Committee report on Gaetz are intensifying amid growing concerns about his prospects of becoming the U.S. attorney general. Plus, Ukraine fires U.S.-made longer range missiles into Russia for the first time after getting the green light from President Biden, Vladimir Putin responding by lowering the threshold for his use of nuclear weapons, sending a rather provocative message to the west. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news on the SpaceX test flight with splashdown of the rocket expected at any moment. CNN Contributor Kristin Fisher is following the mission for us and CNN's Kristen Holmes is tracking the politics of it all with President-elect Trump joining Elon Musk at the launch site. I want to I bring in Kristin Fisher. She's here with me in The Situation Room. So, Kristin, what happens next?",

And what's so remarkable about this, two things, every other Starship launch that we've seen and Starship reentry has been at night time. So, for the first time, we're getting to see this at daytime.But what really stands out, Wolf, is this is the first time that we are ever able to watch a spacecraft reenter the Earth's atmosphere and return to Earth all live in high quality video. And that's thanks to Starlink terminals that are mounted on Starship. So, really, a tour de force by SpaceX showing what they're capable of here, first with the Starship launch, and now with Starlink providing us these awesome live images, Wolf.",

This is really useful for when you're carrying, you know, people, but also sensitive and expensive payloads. You want to know what exactly this spacecraft is capable of, how sharp, how steep of a rate of return can it make and still survive.So, throughout this SpaceX webcast, they've been saying, look, be warned, this is an old generation Starship. The heat shield tiles that are on it, that you can see on the -- actually they're on the belly, the underside of that ship, it's an old generation model, not the best stuff. They're going to try to put this Starship, see if they can actually get it to the point of breaking up and burning up, so that they can take that data and say, this is how far we can push it for future test flights.",

You know, we haven't been able to see this before or get this kind of footage because, as I said, the previous test flights have been done at nighttime. But this is exactly -- this is better than what SpaceX had hoped for with Starship on the sense that they didn't think that they would be able to get it this far to the splashdown. They thought it would burn up on reentry because they were pushing it this far.Another big success of this mission was the fact that they were able to light one of Starship's engines in the vacuum of space. But, of course, Wolf, without a doubt, there was a disappointment at the beginning here. You know, yes, the booster was able to get Starship into space, but it was not able to be caught. There was something wrong that kept it from being caught by those giant chopsticks. And, of course, with the President-elect Trump there, a little bit of a disappointment for Elon Musk and SpaceX. But, overall, this is going to be viewed as a big success and a step forward for the Starship program.",

What do you make of that decision? KEITH COWING, EDITOR, NASAWATCH.COM: Well, this is all designed such that it's like being at an airport where the plane pulls in, people get off, people get on and you leave, and the guy standing there going like this. Well, something in the whole process said, no, you're not going to land at the pad, but you're going to land out in the water. And the whole idea is they want to get these rockets back, land them on the pad, put something on it, launch it, get it back, and so forth.

They've created this evidence that sources tell us the House Ethics Committee has used in its probe.We've been told that the Ethics Committee has really looked at this lawsuit as a road map in terms of who to talk to and what kind of evidence they can gather. And we have learned that some of the records in this case, they are confidential, including that deposition with a 17-year-old girl that is under seal. It's only available to the lawyers involved in the case and his confidential records. They are stored in a secure online document sharing system. And we've learned that lawyers in the case were notified by another lawyer yesterday that that secure online system was accessed by an unknown third party who had access to that sensitive material that, again, we believe is similar to what could be in the House Ethics report. Now, we asked at least one of the lawyers if they notified authorities about this third party breach, but we haven't gotten a comment.

He doubles down and he tries to get things -- ram things through. Look, I remember when Kimba Wood and Zoe Baird, attorney general appointees of Bill Clinton, had to withdraw because of issues with a nanny. I remember when Neera Tanden, who was an appointee of Joe Biden's, had to withdraw because she had written some pithy, controversial tweets. These are a whole bunch of different standards, or lack thereof when it comes to Donald Trump appointees, right? It's not just Gaetz. It's Gaetz. It's Hegseth. It's RFK. It's Tulsi Gabbard.

I think the resistance to Gaetz goes into people who would say they strongly support Donald Trump but have serious concerns about this.So, we'll see if he sticks with it. You know, there's still a lot of time between now and the next Congress convening. And at some point, you know, when you're the president and you've got a nominee for anything, you have to ask yourself, do I want to suffer a defeat, most people don't get defeated, they just withdraw from the process. It is obvious that all this information that's coming out about Gaetz, whether the House Ethics Committee acts to release their report or not, is going to find its way into the hands of the Senate. They're going to -- I think I saw John Cornyn say tonight, that they can just re-interview all the same witnesses that interviewed with the Ethics Committee.

Normally, the person who takes this job really, really loves spreadsheets, and it's true. Dr. Oz is a T.V. person, but he's also a very celebrated and very decorated surgeon. And so I think he obviously has an interest in public service. That's why he ran for the Senate in the first place. The fact that he wants to do this, I think, is a good thing, because we do need to attract people into government who have a sincere interest in public service.
