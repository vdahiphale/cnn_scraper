The number of Democratic lawmakers calling for President Biden to step away from his campaign is growing yet again.Tonight, while President Biden was campaigning in Pennsylvania, House Democratic leadership held a meeting to discuss Joe Biden's future as a candidate. Now, this meeting was with ranking members. We have new details breaking this hour on who was on the call, who is now calling for President Biden to step aside. I want to go straight to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez live right outside the White House. And Priscilla, we are both talking to our Democratic sources on the Hill, and we're hearing that there are more members calling for Biden to step aside. And notably, some of them are ranking members.

      "sentences": "Yeah, let me put it to you quite simply, Pamela. One of the sources that I spoke to said there were more people on this phone call explicitly saying that President Joe Biden should step aside as the candidate than those who spoke in favor of him staying. That really captures where the Democratic Party is at right now. And it goes to show that those nerves that have been racked over thelast week since that CNN presidential debate have not yet been calmed. All of this as President Biden hits the campaign trail. In fact, just moments before we started learning about the details of this phone call, President Biden said a resounding yes when asked by the press if the Democratic Party is standing behind him. But this phone call tells us that may not entirely be the case. Now, to give you a little bit of background as to what exactly this was, this was a call that was hosted by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to give an opportunity for the ranking members to express their grievances, take the temperature of where they were at before everybody returns back to Congress this week. And over the course of that call is where some of these explicit statements were made about whether the president should remain as the Democratic candidate this year. Now, some of the names that have come up are reporting, for example, as opposed to President Biden being the nominee or, for example, Representatives Adam Smith, Jim Hines, Susan Wild. We're also told Democratic Representatives Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott spoke in support of Biden. So you can see that there were fractures over the course of this call. But one senior Democratic aide telling our colleague, Jeff Zeleny, that it was, quote, \"pretty brutal.\" Now, there haven't been any decisions yet as to whether there will be a letter or a meeting with the president about this matter. But what it does tell us is that some of the leaders that are within the House of Representatives are very much questioning whether President Biden is a risk worth taking going into November, whether he should be the candidate. And in calls that I have had, one of the questions that comes up is, shouldn't this be resolved before August? They don't want to be in a position where August comes around, President Biden becomes the nominee, and then they don't have a choice going into November. So clearly, despite the president going to Wisconsin, despite his ABC interview, and despite him hitting battleground Pennsylvania today, everyone still has a lot of questions as to whether the president should remain as the Democratic candidate. And on that front, we're also learning that over the course of this call, there was support for the Vice President Kamala Harris to be the candidate if we get to that point.",

Of course, this was a call that was scheduled to do exactly that versus showing exactly where he is at. Now, the president did speak with him last week, along with other party leaders. So we don't quite know where he and others stand. But I do think it is notable that while these grievances are being aired, he is not reassuring them, as far as we're told, that the president is going to remain the nominee.A lot of that has really been on the president to say himself. And the campaign in the interim, even including today, is signaling more campaign travel. So they are certainly not giving any indications of the president stepping down. Instead, they, for example, announced today that the president is going to Las Vegas later this month to also talk to two conferences targeting black and Latino voters. Then on Friday, he's going to go to Michigan, that's his fourth battleground state since the debate. So what we have is two storylines playing out at the same time. Democrats who are telling their leadership, we don't know if this is a safe bet to make, and House leadership, in the meantime, just taking those concerns in, while the president and his campaign are signaling, we're in this to win it, and we are going to keep hitting the campaign trail to show you the president is the best candidate. And amid all of this, Pamela, I think we should also note the NATO summit is happening here this week in Washington. And so not only is the president wrestling with his own party over his candidacy, but he's also going to be talking to foreign leaders. And whether or not concerns come up there is another question entirely. Up until this point, the president has used his foreign policy chops as one of the main reasons that he should be taking a second term. And so there are a lot of events that are still going to unfold this week from all different corners that I think are going to be quite critical in the trajectory of the race.",

He said the only person who could do it was, you know, the Lord Almighty. Now, we all know, Pam, that in politics, everyone says they're not going to do a thing that they don't want to do until they have to do it, right? And they say until the bitter end that they're not going to.

We've seen him obviously do this ABC News interview. It lasted 22 minutes. He still has not done some sort of big press conference.You would think that one of the first things you might do after that sort of disastrous debate is put him in front of the reporters and say, listen, you know, that was a bad night, but look what he can do. He can stand in front of the White House Press Corps and take any and all of their questions at any time. We heard our own White House correspondent MJ Lee asking the press secretary, why aren't -- we've got a briefing room ready to go here? Why aren't you bringing him out and having him talk to us? We have not seen them do this. And actually, President Biden has done the fewest press conferences in the last seven presidents, according to the data when you look at it. And now this was happening even before the debate. But this is only being amplified by keeping the press at an arm's length away. I've been speaking to White House reporters now since that debate. There is a huge frustration from them. You know, they're getting battered down by people saying, why are you reporting so much? You're over reporting on Biden's age. You're over reporting this. Look at what the other guy is doing. Look at President Trump. Well, they're saying, well, the White House is keeping him at an arm's length. Put him in front of us. Let him answer the questions. We are going to see him later this week at the NATO summit answering the press's questions. There's a huge frustration in the White House and the National Press Corps.",

      "sentences": "So I think we have to look at the timeline here. After the debate, that was one of the immediate asks by allies, whether the president needed to get out there more and have unscripted and candid moments on the campaign trail. I've gone to a lot of these rallies, and oftentimes the president is working off of a teleprompter. So his allies were essentially saying, we want to see you have those unscripted moments with people so that they can see what one called the old President Joe Biden. I think Senator Chris Murphy said that.And so now we're at a point, it's been over a week, and he hit the trail going to Wisconsin again on Friday and going to Pennsylvania today. And we started to see some of that. I think it was quite notable as I was watching him go through all of these stops, he was trying to kind of go off the cuff a little bit more in the way that he talked at these campaign events. And in fact, in one campaign event earlier today in Pennsylvania, one of the supporters said, quote, \"we want to see the Dark Brandon come back.\" That's according -- that's that meme that she was referencing. He said, quote, \"Dark Brandon is coming back.\" So you can get a sense there that they are taking in this advice and trying to put him out in those moments to have those candid moments. Notably too, the July campaign memo that they released that included his, quote, \"aggressive travel schedule for the rest of the month,\" also made mention of off the cuff moments, which was like we hear you to allies. But again, we're more than a week out. We're going into the second week since that debate, and we're still hearing a lot of concerns from Democrats. So I think it's perhaps too early to say among voters whether this makes a difference. As we have talked about multiple times, voters are not often watching every campaign stop that he makes. They were watching the debate. And so whether it really quells concerns, I think, is still remains an open question. And whether this shift in strategy that we saw play out over the last three days can be maintained. But as at this point, they're clearly trying. I think it's whether or not it makes a difference.",

What I hear the most is that the mandate among her staff is to stay the course and to sort of dispel any replacement theories. And what she has said on the trail when she says that she stands behind the president and to defend his and defending his record and not just his debate performance is reflective of where she is.But I also think it's significant that on July 4th, the president was joined by the Vice President on the balcony to observe the fireworks. And they embraced and they held hands up in the air. And that is something that we have not seen since the president took office. He's always joined by his family, but he hasn't been joined by the vice president and the second gentleman who are often partaking in other July 4th engagements. So it was clearly them trying to show a unified front. And that is what I hear from sources, is that she is standing behind the president. But I will also note that since January, when the president -- when the vice president, I should say, really hit the campaign trail, she took -- she did that Reproductive Freedoms Tour and then has since done more on economic opportunity, among other issues. That was when the Vice President that her allies knew the best really came through. The prosecutor, as they say, where she was forceful on the campaign trail and more people got to know her. Whereas over the last three years, it was -- what we often heard is where's the vice president and what is she doing? So over the last several months, she certainly has been on the trail a lot multiple times a week, and it has allowed perhaps a reintroduction to voters. But that was all for the Biden-Harris ticket. It wasn't because she herself was trying to replace the president. And what we have heard from sources, what I have heard is that she is still very much unified with him.",

And yet, Pam, what we saw in the first round of voting was the far- right National Front -- National Rally, I'm sorry, come first, the left-wing alliance second, and Emmanuel Macron's centrist, a distant third. What we've seen over the course of the last week and this extraordinary result that they're celebrating behind me here tonight is essentially strategic voting on the part of those who support the left and those who support Macron's centrists in order to defeat the party. Still, I think it's important to note, as did the National Rally tonight at what should have been its celebration party turned into something much more somber, but they still noted, Jordan Bardella, the president of the party who had hoped to become prime minister, still noted that this election, Pam, marked their biggest electoral success so far.

But there are many buts in this hypothesis, because that project would break the left bloc that just won today, and leaving La France Insoumise, that's the controversial party of Jean-Luc Melenchon on the side. There are other problems, too, that the left parties might ask, for example, Emmanuel Macron, in order to form that rainbow coalition, to abandon two of his key reforms, which is the pension reform and also the law on immigration.

I certainly lean conservative on it. But there's language in here that says, you know, liberal states have become sanctuaries for abortion tourism. That is how this document is written. And so when you think about policy meetings in the Trump administration, should that happen again? Should he come back to office? I want people to view the type of language that's going to be said in these meetings, because to me, tourism doesn't enter my mind when I think about women who are having trouble giving childbirth, who are actually leaving states right now to be able to access health care.
