There was a lot of reading into congressional intent, right? What did Congress mean when 1512(c)(2), which you just talked about, was passed after Enron?I'm curious if they have that, just as the kids said, the same energy with immunity, right? We left the monarchy. And when our country was established, it was so that we could hold everyone accountable, a nation of laws of everyone. So, will they consider our nation's founding, what we were escaping when we formed our country, when holding the opinion on Monday? And if they do that, then you have to have some type of liability for presidents when they commit crimes. And so, I'll be curious to see if they look at the historical context that they did with congressional intent here today, but I'm not that hopeful to be completely candid.",
