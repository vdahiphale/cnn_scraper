The next big contest is exactly one month from today in South Carolina. And Haley is going to be there tonight for a rally.But some of her home state's most prominent Republicans are backing the former president, including Tim Scott, the senator who owes his job to Haley. Remember, she appointed him to the Senate. Also, this hour, we're going to hear some reaction from President Biden. He's expected to play up the contrast with Trump when he addresses the United Auto Workers union, clearly eying an election rematch. In fact, his campaign is now banking on it, selling these new T-shirts that read -- quote -- \"Together, we will defeat Trump again.\" Let's get the latest now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny, whose live for us in New Hampshire. Jeff, what does the path look like at this point for Nikki Haley?",

      "sentences": "Boris, it's a narrow path and a precarious one, but it is on her home turf. So Nikki Haley is back in South Carolina, not to lick her wounds, butto fight on to that primary, which is one month from today. If we say a day is a lifetime in politics, think how long a month will be if there's an epic fight between her and former President Donald Trump. But we are told that she is speaking to her supporters, longtime allies, friends and donors. And, as of now, she is staying in this race. She's scheduled to have a rally tonight in North Charleston. She's put out a campaign schedule for the next several days. She's on the air with the television ads in South Carolina. All signs point to the fact that she is going to continue, allowing other Republican voters to have their say in this primary. Of course, that's usually how it goes. Usually, people who have lost a couple states do not telegraph that they're getting out. They reassess their decision as it becomes clear. But she has many reasons to stay in this race, largely because she improved her performance here in New Hampshire. Yes, the electorate is much different here in New Hampshire. Many more independents voted. But, certainly, Republicans voted as well to give a voice to a Trump alternative. The question, of course, is in her home state of South Carolina, which has changed dramatically since she became -- since she was governor there, it's much more Trumpy, quite frankly. Do they want her candidacy continue? She will find that out as she campaigns there beginning tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, I think he made that very clear in his speech last night.If you look back to Iowa when he won by that 30-point, historic margin, he talked about unifying the party, unifying the country. There was absolutely none of that in the speech last night. It was all about Nikki Haley. He criticized her on every level, including what she was wearing. We're told by sources that he was annoyed, he was angry that she decided to stay in the race, and he didn't like the tone of the speech that he gave -- she gave, at one point actually calling her an impostor. And you mentioned that endorsement from South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. There was also an awkward moment during the speech where Trump essentially brought up that Tim Scott should have liked Nikki Haley or should have endorsed Nikki Haley and said, \"You must really hate her for endorsing me.\" And Scott walked up to the mic and said, \"No, I just love you.\" I mean, anyone who follows Tim Scott in his political career knows that's not his brand of politics, so putting him on the spot there. But that really is part of their effort in South Carolina. We have seen what they are doing, their strategy there, and it's essentially to embarrass her in her home state. As Jeff said, the electorate has changed there. It is more pro-Trump. Or at least that's what his advisers believe. So they're touting around all of these endorsements from South Carolina officials that have endorsed Donald Trump saying, look, this state, her home state, they actually support us over Nikki Haley.",

We have seen people who, like Ron DeSantis, were attacked viciously by the former president still come out and back him.But Susan Collins of Maine, the senator, says that she's not likely to endorse Donald Trump, no, at any point in the future. And, actually, she added that she was happy Nikki Haley was staying in the race, saying that: \"I think that, the more people see of her, the\" -- \"see of her\" -- excuse me -- that she -- \"the more that\" -- sorry -- there's a whole long thing in the middle here, since it appears to be the only alternative to Donald Trump right now -- \"the more impressed those people will be.\" It's not that surprising. Yes, she is a Republican Senator, but she also voted to impeach him in January of 2021 over the January 6 insurrection, not a big fan there, but it is interesting, given what we are seeing on Capitol Hill, which is a closing of ranks, a circling of the wagon as Donald Trump inches towards the nomination.",

S.E., of course, New Hampshire was tailor-made for the type of voter that Nikki Haley was courting here. So if she can't beat Trump or at least get darned close to doing that, what makes her campaign think that she can really give him a run for his money here? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think every opportunity she has to pierce that inevitability is good for her and leads to some momentum. And you have to look at the people who are saying this primary is over, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, are saying that because it benefits Donald Trump and Joe Biden, right? Joe Biden wants it to be over because he wants to face Trump. Nikki -- Nikki Haley would be a much tougher opponent for Joe Biden. And Trump wants the coronation. So I think we need to be careful with our framing here and remember that 49 percent of people in Iowa chose someone other than Trump; 40 percent-plus of people in New Hampshire chose someone other than Trump. This party is not coalesced around him. It is divided. There's no real other way to see it. Now, the map gets tougher for Nikki Haley. She knows that, but she's going to fight, because 40 percent is not an insignificant number. And I think her performance and her going out on the trail and doing media is giving permission for other independents, moderates and maybe even Republicans to say, yes, I would like someone else. And guess what? Someone else is running.",

They are desperate to have a choice between Donald Trump, the crazy, the chaos, the criminality, and somebody who would bring a little bit more of a presidential temperament, but perhaps are more conservative.Nikki Haley was their person, but I think they have also come to realize, to their chagrin, that, right now, the Republican Party is not built for somebody like Nikki Haley, is not built for somebody who's moderate. That's what Donald Trump is counting on. That is what he is focusing on. That is why he is going full force, full MAGA. The speech that he gave last night in New Hampshire was horrific, but that tells you just how -- not only what kind of candidate he will be in the general election, but what kind of president if, God forbid -- and hopefully the voters will forbid as well -- he gets into the Oval Office again.",

I mean, those were other Republicans voting for someone else. So I don't think he's in a very safe and strong position going into an election against Joe Biden. Joe Biden knows that. And that's why I think he really wants Trump on the top of the ticket. But I think Maria just made a really, really good point about Nikki wanting to be the last man standing in case, right? And I actually asked the campaign this yesterday or the day before, like, is it part of the strategy to just be the last one around in case Trump goes to prison? They didn't really want to answer that question directly. So I have no response to report there. But I think that is tacitly part of this, too, because anything, literally anything, could happen between now and Super Tuesday, now and the conventions.

Now the Ukrainians also say that a prisoner exchange was indeed supposed to happen today, but that the Russians did not inform them whether or not they were going to take these prisoners to that area by plane. I want to read you some -- a statement from the Ukrainian general staff, what they said. They said: \"The armed forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery means and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat,\" them obviously meaning the missile threat from Russia, \"including on the Belgorod-Kharkiv direction.\" So the Ukrainians are saying that any cargo planes carrying missiles could be targeted.

They certainly are quite difficult. They usually or often happen in northern regions of Ukraine on the border there with Russia. It's unclear whether or not in this case this exchange would have gone very smoothly. The Ukrainians, however, do acknowledge that an exchange was supposed to take place, that this exchange was supposed to take place today, and that it was called off last-minute. So, whether or not that means that there were really prisoners of war on board this plane really unclear, but, certainly, prisoner exchanges are something that we have seen.
