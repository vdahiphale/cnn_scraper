Will Haley really stay in the race for the South Carolina primary, which is still a month away? Also, have Haley's attacks against Trump been effective? In recent days, we've seen her escalate her rhetoric, even questioning Trump's mental fitness. She told CNN she sees Trump and Biden as, quote, \"equally bad options.\" Now in the final hours before the primary, Trump has been racking up endorsements from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Both the House and Senate GOP campaign chairs have called for the party to unite behind Trump And last night we saw Trump bring his former opponents on stage in the ultimate show of force.

That's affecting a lot of cities across the country. And also, they're not really too happy about some of the social issues that are coming from the Democrat Party. And so you have a voting bloc with minority voters, Spanish speaking voters that are actually quite socially conservative. And so now they're butting with almost an identity crisis, in that they've maybe voted Democrat for a while. But now with the illegal migrant crisis that happening and a few other social factors, it's making them start to look at some other candidates to be considered. We're in a tough economic environment. I think we know that the economy was better over the four years with Trump. And so now voters are really kind of starting to ask, am I going to cross over and make a different decision this time? And that particularly has shown among minority communities.",

About 20 hostages were said to the held in the tunnels in the area.It's the biggest single Israeli loss during combat since the war began. And a warning: these next images are graphic. Palestinians say Israel is targeting and battering hospital sites in these same areas. Nearly all of Gaza's population faces a humanitarian crisis, as the death toll reported by the Hamas-controlled Health Authority passed 25,000. At the same time, in a CNN exclusive, Israel's spy chief is proposing that senior Hamas leaders leave Gaza in return for a two-month-long pause in fighting as part of a broader ceasefire and hostage negotiation deal. That comes from two officials familiar with the talks who spoke to CNN's Alex Marquardt, who joins us now, live from Washington, D.C. Let's start with this proposal. It was stunning on its face when I read your reporting. What would it entail?",

And essentially, if it were to happen, it would be incredible to think that this would be Hamas's top leaders in Gaza, the orchestraters of the deadliest day in Israeli history, leaving Gaza, essentially being allowed to walk away.Now, the way that Israel sees this is that, if they were to leave Gaza, it would weaken Hamas in Gaza. And essentially, it would draw these leaders of Hamas out of the tunnels, allowing Israel to then target them elsewhere. And we do know that Israel plans to mount a global operation against Hamas leaders around the world. But, Phil, I think what this proposal really highlights is that, after four months of war, Israel has failed to capture or kill any of the most senior leaders of Hamas in Gaza, among them Yahya Sinwar, who is the top Hamas official in Gaza; Mohammed Deif, who is the leader of the military arm. We also know by Israel's own estimates that some 70 percent of Hamas's fighting force remains on the battlefield. Now Phil, I was told that this was raised, this proposal was raised by the head of Israeli intelligence, David Barnea, last month in a meeting in Warsaw with the CIA director, Bill Burns, and the Qatari prime minister. And then a few weeks later, earlier this month, the Qatari minister -- prime minister met with Antony Blinken, the secretary of state. And in that meeting, he told Blinken that this proposal will never happen. And that's what I've heard from international and American officials, saying that this is essentially a nonstarter. That these guys -- Sinwar, Deif and others -- would rather go down fighting against their sworn enemy. But Phil, it's still remarkable that Israel would propose this at all.",
