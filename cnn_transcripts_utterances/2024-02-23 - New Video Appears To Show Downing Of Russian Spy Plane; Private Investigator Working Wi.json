So what are Russians think about Putin's invasion? We'll be live in Moscow. Plus, potential new trouble for Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis. New cell phone data is raising questions about the timeline of her relationship with her top prosecutor in the Trump election case. And voters in South Carolina hours away from heading to the polls in the next crucial Republican primary. Nikki Haley trying to close the gap with Trump. Will her tough attacks today help? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Jim Sciutto, in again tonight for Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, Putin's prized spy plane shot down. This is new video into OUTFRONT, which appears to show the moment a Russia A50 spy plane is blown out of the sky. Ukraine's air force is taking credit tonight. This is a rare and crucial aircraft used by Russia to detect incoming Ukrainian missile strikes and to help pick Ukrainian targets on the ground. We are now two years into Russia's brutal full scale invasion of Ukraine. The cost in human terms has been enormous and devastating. Many tens of thousands reportedly dead and wounded charges of vast war crimes by Russian forces. And Ukrainian cities in ruins from the beginning civilians have been the deliberate targets of Russian air attacks. It remains the largest and bloodiest war in Europe since World War II and it's far from over. In a moment, I'm going to speak with the Prime Minister of Estonia, Kaja Kallas. Her country borders Russia, is a member of NATO, providing critical aid to Ukraine amid concerns that Putin could spread his war to other countries, including NATO allies. That concern is part of the reason Biden is hitting Putin within new round of punishing U.S. sanctions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Sadow hired a criminal investigator who used subpoenaed cell phone data and cell phone information, which says that Nathan Wade's cell phone was located in the vicinity of Fani Willis' condo on at least 35 occasions in 2021, during the 11-month period. The report goes on to suggest that Nathan Wade cell phone was located there several times well into the late evening and early morning hours, and there was at least 12,000 interactions between Willis and Wade by phone. That's' a text messages and cell phone calls. So listen to this very interesting, because listen to what Nathan Wade had to say last week about this condo in his visits there during his testimony last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

None of this affects the evidence against Trump and his alleged co- conspirators regarding election interference.

This would contradict that in which Mr. Wade said that he did not spend the night at special prosecutor's -- sorry, the district attorney's house or apartment.And the evidence here is not just that he entered into her neighborhood, but on one occasion, it says that she called him late at night and then an hour just about over an hour later, then he appeared at her apartment. There was there for several hours and the other one is that he leaves I like 3:30 in the morning and then he texts after he returns home just about an hour later at 04:00 a.m. in the morning.

So I think that's one piece, but then, of course, that's exactly right that they now get to another prosecutors side, tried to fend off this information and say whether or not they think it's accurate.For example, the idea that Mr. Wade visits her neighborhood, 35 times over nine months, to me that particular part of it is not very incriminating or concerning.

She could be laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 campaign, as others have said, she could be making the argument now that you could make later that she was the one that was trying to stop Donald Trump and trying to bring the Republican Party back to where -- you know, into the party that she knows and was running in ten years ago.But there's also this other issue of whether or not the donors, particularly the large donors will actually see a path for her and try to continue to fund her going forward. If she loses those kinds of donors, she really does lose the narrative and then operationally, she loses the ability to travel to all of these states and actually do that kind of groundwork. So I think both things can be true, but for her to be able to make the case to anyone that she should go forward, she's going to have to get the support of a lot of deep pockets to be able to do so.",

But also, I think it is an important point that Democrats can argue that if you don't like these policies, if you have Donald Trump back in the White House and a Republican Senate and House, you better believe that these policies can become nationalized. And that's a really strong talking point because I would imagine that over the last several decades, Republicans wanted to do a few things, right? Get their judges, get conservative judges on the bench, flip state houses, which a lot of them word during the Obama years Democrats lost a thousand seats.
