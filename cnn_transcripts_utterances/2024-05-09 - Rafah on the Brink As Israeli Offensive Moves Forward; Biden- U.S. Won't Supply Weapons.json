The Gaza Health Ministry says the only dialysis center had to shut down due to the Israeli military operation there. Satellite imagery that we're about to show you obtained by CNN, as you can see there, show the IDF expanding from airstrikes to ground operations. And those images bear really a striking resemblance to what the IDF's initial ground invasion conducted last October if you remember, look like. Meanwhile, the U.N. says nearly 79,000 people have fled the region since Monday when the IDF ordered Rafah residents to leave the area immediately ahead of a major military offensive. And that's led to a dire humanitarian situation that left tens of thousands without anywhere left to turn.

The Israeli military for its part says that it has the weapons needed for the missions. It is planning -- including for the missions. It is planning in Rafah, so, as of now, this is kind of full steam ahead from the Israeli government. So, it could be bluster at this stage, but as of this moment, there's no indication that the Israeli government is going to be cowed by President Biden's comments or choosing to reconsider its future actions. Instead, it is vowing to continue fighting in Rafah, and that was also, I'm told, part of the response from the Israeli government today in Cairo from that Israeli delegation that has been there for several days, responding to Hamas' latest proposal, giving its feedback on what it views as several key points of that latest framework, which are unacceptable to Israel. And also saying in that same breath that it will continue the fight in Rafah, that Israeli delegation has now returned to Israel.

Necheles, Trump's lawyer was questioning Daniels about how as an adult film actress, she's appeared in over 150 of those productions. She could have been startled or shocked when she came out of the bedroom in Trump's hotel room on the 2006 evening of their sexual encounter and saw that he was clothed only in his underwear. And Daniels replied that she sees her husband naked all the time. But if a stranger who was twice her age and larger than her was unclothed in her home, that would be startling. And I think it underlined a narrative about the power dynamic in that encounter. Whatever the details may have been, I think it's credible that, that encounter happened, and that is what prosecutors needed to establish here. And just to tell the jury, look, if this whole messy story had come out after the Access Hollywood tape, that would have harmed the Trump campaign.

The president says, the U.S. will hold some weapons shipments if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu orders a major ground invasion. It's his first kind of red line on Israel aid conditions. The Israeli war, as well as security cabinets, as we told you at the top of the hour, are set to discuss these comments. But some politicians in Israel have already made their stance on the matter very clear. Israel's far right minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted this, really, on Twitter. You do not need a translation. Hamas loves Biden. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, says his country, \"Cannot be subdued.\" This public linking of supplying American weapons to Israel's conduct could widen a rift between Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu, whose relationship, until now, as you remember, as you know, has been ironclad. Well, the president of the U.S.-Middle East Project, Daniel Levy, joins me now. Daniel, appreciate you being with us. Let's -- there's so much -- so many threads for us to talk about. Let's talk first of all about this decision from President Biden that came just late last night. You know, President Biden made it clear that an assault on Rafah would be a red line. Now, he's put a pause on these weapon shipments. There's talk potentially that they may consider others. Is this, in your view, is just a tactic, a pressure campaign, or is this a policy shift? DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S.-MIDDLE EAST PROJECT (USMEP) AND FORMER ISRAELI PEACE NEGOTIATOR: First, it of course, begs the question. Why were those 2,000 bombs? Why was that kind of munition being sent months after the International Court of Justice, the highest court in the world, made its designation, provisional measures, plausible contraventions of the Genocide Convention? Did the President just acknowledge war crimes are being committed last night? Did he just acknowledge that you need an arms embargo to stop this? But the important thing, if one steps back from that, is that the President set out this position. Not all arms, some of the arms. The question now is, because this was never going to be about, you click your finger and Netanyahu says, oh, OK, you've got me. I'll stop. I'll step back now.",
