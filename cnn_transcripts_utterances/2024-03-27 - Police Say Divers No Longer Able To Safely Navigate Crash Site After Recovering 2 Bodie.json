Any moment now we are expecting to hear from federal safety officials with the NTSB about what sent that 95,000-ton container ship into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, destroying the main span and killing six construction workers.Just a short time ago, we heard from Maryland state officials, a state police colonel delivering the grim news that divers today recovered two bodies from one submerged vehicle, but that the remainder in other vehicles are likely beyond recovery. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. ROLAND L. BUTLER JR., MARYLAND STATE POLICE: We have exhausted all search efforts in the areas around this wreckage. And based on sonar scans, we firmly believe that the vehicles are encased in the superstructure and concrete that we tragically saw come down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, like you said, and like Brian said, two of those people were discovered early this morning, tragically in a car that had fallen off of the bridge and that was submerged at the bottom of the water.Brian mentioned the first gentleman was named 35-year-old Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes. And the second gentleman was 26-year-old Dorlian Castillo Cabrera. And I actually had a chance to speak with a couple of people with - from Dorlian's family earlier today. His sister in law told me that he absolutely loved this construction job that he had at Brawner Builders. His brother, when I tried to speak with him about Dorlian, and this was before we knew that he - his body had been discovered, he was in shock and he didn't want to get into a full interview, but said he is just in grief right now. That is all that he and his part of the family could think about. Meanwhile, Dorlian's cousin said that he came to the States to follow the American dream and to help his mother as well. So these are the two men that we know were discovered at the bottom of the lake, rather of the water behind me earlier today. But Anderson, I'll just make a note of two of the other men whose identity we learned over the course of the past 24 hours. We learned about 38-year-old Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval. He was Honduran. He was a husband. He was a father of two, his brother telling CNN that he was the breadwinner of the family. And then we also learned about Miguel Luna. He's from El Salvador, a father of three. And an organization nearby this area where he was a member of said that he'd been living in Maryland for 19 years, Anderson. And the one thing I'll just say, just being out here, speaking with family members, is that really this whole community you can tell is rallying around these families. There have been multiple GoFundMes that have been set up. A number of politicians have promised to make sure that they get aid. And I also spoke to the executive vice president of the company that so many of these workers worked for. And he said very clearly, make no mistake, we're going to take care of these families.",

Well, the executive vice president of the construction company actually told me that seven of those people - of those eight that were on the bridge, belonged to that particular - were workers for that company.So we're still missing a little bit of information about the eighth person. However, the seventh, one of the survivors, he told me that basically it was a miracle that he was able to get away from this incident. And also he said, I asked him, how did he survive, right. This is a huge drop, so many people obviously still missing. The EVP of this company said he didn't quite know, but he believes that he may have swum and, again, called it a miracle that he was able to survive.

She pointed this out and just clarifying that the NTSB's entire focus right now is on collecting what she described as anything perishable evidence, anything photographs, sonar data, any information from the electronics onboard the ship, anything that may dissipate over time or that they can't -- that is time sensitive. So that's what they are getting.They haven't analyzed anything. She didn't come up with any analysis of anything that they have already received. She was simply giving out information. 21 crew members on board, they have confirmed at the time of the of the ship hitting the bridge, with two pilots, 56 containers of hazardous materials were onboard that ship. That's 764 tons of hazardous materials. She described it as corrosive, flammables, lithium-ion batteries. She said, some of those containers were breached. She said she saw a number of them breached on the deck of the ship, also some signs of sheen on the water which would indicate something from those containers is in the water. Didn't seem to have any answers about how concerned people should be. She referred the reporters' questions to other officials. That's really not the NTSB job right now. She also talked about the voyage data recorder, which is the ship equivalent of the flight data recorder, which we are all very familiar with. Difference as she pointed out is that there are what she said were about 1,000 parameters on a flight data recorder that you would find after an accident on board or an incident on board plane with the voice -- the voyage data recorder, it is very basic. She called it a snapshot of major systems on a vessel, nothing to do with engineering. They certainly -- she has urged for over the -- in the past for more what she terms as parameters on the VDR to mandate more recordings.
