Our correspondents are standing by near the frontlines of this war as well as in Washington. First, let's go to CNN's Ben Wedeman. He's in Southern Lebanon right now.

He apparently, according to the Israelis, was -- is responsible for military operations, Hamas military operations in the northern end of Gaza, where, of course, Israel has started this ground incursion last Friday.We also know, however, is that as a result of this airstrike, according to the head of the nearby Indonesian hospital, there are 400 people either dead or wounded as a result.

So, what the IDF say today that they were targeting this Hamas commander in a bunker with other Hamas members fits that modus operandi, if you will, the way the military is operating. Troops on the ground fighting Hamas call in the airstrikes.In this case, the airstrikes came in in this very densely populated neighborhood. But what we're hearing this evening is the pattern of ongoing battle in Gaza. We're hearing helicopter gunships. We've seen helicopters, it appears, firing missiles into Gaza right now. And I'm going to ask John just to swing the camera, if you can, a little bit over this way, and you can see a set of really bright lights there. They weren't that bright a couple of days ago. And we think that's one of the main crossings around the Erez crossing area, where IDF is channeling forces into the north end of the Gaza Strip. And they wouldn't have bright lights on it like this if they didn't feel that they had control over the vicinity around it, meaning no Hamas operatives close to that crossing point. So, I think what we're beginning to see and what we're hearing from here is that increasing footprint on the ground, Wolf, but with the airstrikes, because we're hearing and seeing them. But actually how far into Gaza City and other places have the troops got, we don't have those details.",

But it's hugely sensitive, not just for Egypt, but in Jordan as well, because both Egypt and Jordan feel that they will be the brunt of every inch of Israeli incursion, whether it's expansions into the West Bank or this fighting in Gaza.A new security dispensation, for example, in Gaza, which put up a huge security buffer, which is something that we understand may be under discussion that cut the Gazan citizens off from coming into Israel for jobs in the future would put huge pressure on the international community to potentially manage Gaza and pressure on Egypt to open its border to allow commerce and residents of Gaza to travel into Egypt for work. And this is something Egypt rejects because it's politically destabilizing for them. Jordan rejects the concept too because it's politically destabilizing for them, because they've had a lot of Palestinian refugees over the decades, 1967 being a particularly large influx. And beyond that, they see such an effort, however it's manifested on the ground. They see it as an extension of Israeli expansion, of Palestinians losing their home territory. So, for that reason, it's hugely sensitive. And for that reason, it's not something that the government is saying that they're working on right now. This document that's been leaked, it's something that you say is sensitive because it touches on the core issue, Palestinians, their right to return, and the land where they are.",

House Republicans are pushing for a vote this week on $14.3 billion in aid for Israel and only for Israel. GOP lawmakers are rejecting the Biden administration's request for a combined Israel-Ukraine aid package, putting them on a collision course potentially with the U.S. Senate. Joining us now, the top Democrat of the House, the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries. Leader Jeffries, thanks so much for joining us. We'll get to the congressional funding fight in a moment, but I want to start with Israel's war against Hamas. You were just here in Israel, I know. An IDF spokesman confirmed to me awhile ago that it was an Israeli airstrike that hit Gaza's largest refugee camp earlier today. Israel says the strike was targeting a senior Hamas official that it claims was the leader in the October 7th terrorist attack against Israel. We don't yet know how many civilians were killed in today's strike on that refugee camp, but is taking out one Hamas leader or maybe two Hamas leaders who may have been there worth the deaths of so many civilians? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): I support Israel's effort to defend itself. It has not just the right to defend itself but the responsibility toward its citizens and its sovereignty in the face of brutal, horrific attack that took place on October 7th. And for the good of Israel, for the good of the region, for the good of America, the free world, and for the good of the Palestinian people in Gaza, we need to make sure that Hamas is defeated. At the same time, as President Biden has consistently said, it's our hope and expectation that Israel will follow the international rules of war, particularly as it relates to mitigating and deploying every single measure to try to limit, if not eliminate civilian casualties. And I hope that that will continue moving forward.",

Lieutenant Colonel, thank you so much for joining us First on this Israeli strike on the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, is taking out one Hamas leader inside that camp and possibly some other Hamas targets, is it worth the deaths of large -- a large number of innocent Palestinians, many of them women and children? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Hello, Wolf. Thank you for having me on the show. I would exercise a lot of caution relying on reports coming out of Gaza. I remember how the event in the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City started with reports of 500 dead, then 800 dead, and I know how it ended. We were blamed for killing many Palestinian civilians then, but it later became apparent what had happened and it also became apparent that the number of civilian casualties was greatly inflated by all of the so-called authorities in Gaza, which is basically saying Hamas. Now, I am not saying there are no civilian casualties. What I am saying is that we struck an important military objective, this Ibrahim Biari, who was a battalion commander who was leading operations and fighting against Israel as he was targeted. He and many dozens of enemy combatants were in a tunnel complex underneath the ground. We struck that tunnel complex, and we caused it -- that caused it to collapse. And it is our assessment that dozens of Hamas operatives were killed. Those are casualties that should be factored in in any report of casualties coming out of the Gaza Strip. And I also understand that there is significant structural damage around, and that is because Hamas built that vast tunnel complex underneath the buildings, and it probably collapsed as a result of the strike. We have to put into context that this is the same area, Northern Gaza, that we have been asking Palestinian civilians, non-combatants, to evacuate for almost two weeks. Most Palestinians have. But I really ask and would want to understand why have Palestinian civilians either been forced or chosen to remain in that area, in direct risk of their own lives. They should move to the south, they should not be in a war zone, in a main combat area. And it's not too late to call on all Palestinian civilians in Northern Gaza, please evacuate to a safer area in the south because Northern Gaza is an active combat zone and Hamas uses civilians as their human shields. Today's event is a clear example of it.",
