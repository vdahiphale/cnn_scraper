We expect Donald Trump to head to a New York courthouse this hour where opening statements in his hush money trial are set to begin. Plus, a major resignation, the head of military intelligence for the Israeli Defense Forces steps down. We will explain why, live from Jerusalem. And torrential rainfall leads to devastating floods, affecting huge areas of southern China, a full report this hour.At any minute, we expect Donald Trump to head from the penthouse to the courthouse, traveling from Trump Tower to Lower Manhattan. There in courtroom number 1523, he will sit at the defendant's table, as opening statements get underway in his hush money trial. It is a truly historic moment, the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. President. Opening statements are expected to take much of the morning. After that, the prosecution will call its first witness. That's expected to be David Pecker. He is the former publisher of the National Enquirer magazine, and he allegedly worked with Donald Trump to catch and kill negative news stories about Trump. For some understanding now what Donald Trump has been doing and saying as he prepares for the trial to get underway, let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene in Washington. Alayna, I know you've been reporting on Trump's mindset, and obviously, he has to be very unhappy, knowing that his tactic in trying to delay all of his criminal trials, but particularly this one, hasn't been successful.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I mean, Donald Trump is very frustrated and very angry that he has to go through this, and you're totally right, the part about it being delayed. Behind the scenes, he has told advisors directly, questioned, why were we not able to delay this and push this back? I think there really was a hope, at least on his part, that he believed that he would be able to delay this trial, and really all of his criminal trials until after the election. Obviously, that is not the case. But, Amara, when you look at Donald Trump, you see him as he has been going in and out of the courtroom over the past week, speaking to cameras. We've seen him on social media, posting, railing against a gag order. He is clearly very angry and does not want to be here.And I just want to give you some sense, when you strip all the bluster away, Donald Trump personally does not want to be undergoing any of his criminal trials. But, this one, in particular, is very personal to him. And remember, this -- a lot of salacious details are expected to come out in this. This is about alleged affair with a porn star and then hush money payments to cover that up during his first presidential campaign. And so, there could be a lot of embarrassing things here that are on display during this trial, and particularly, this is something he does not want in the lead up to a presidential election. At the same time, you do hear from his advisors that they're hoping this could help him with a boost in fundraising, with support. But, at the same time, in my conversations with them, they acknowledge that they don't really know how this is going to play, particularly in a general election campaign, unlike when he was indicted and that was happening during the Republican primary. It's very unclear how this could play with general election voters. And so, that's at the top of his mind too. But, again, having Donald Trump for four days a week, being stuck inside a courtroom, not being able to campaign, really, he is kind of bored in there. I think that's another thing that's been I've been hearing from his advisors as well. He is not able to be on his phone. He has to sit there, listen to some of the criticism being lobbed at him. That is not something that this man, the former President, has really had to be subject to over the past few years.",

Both sides are supposed to comment on what they expect the evidence will show. They're not supposed to argue really too much about how things conflict because the evidence even -- hasn't even been introduced yet. That's kind of a frustrating thing for defense attorneys who like to get out there and lay a roadmap and say this is how bad the state's case is going to be. I believe that the defendant's attempts here will be to color some of the witnesses as being unclear -- excuse me, uncredible, and not really reliable. So, that's their gig.The prosecution will more probably than not just try to outline the case in a logical sequence to show how all the evidence will fit together. And that's why I think calling David Pecker first to lay the groundwork for the motive and the intent of the defendant, Mr. Trump, is important, so that they put on everybody else so it fits in seamlessly with what they want the jury to believe Trump meant to be doing.",

Number one, does this -- is this only character assassination, or does it lead to issues of motive, intent and knowledge to show that he'd done it before, so therefore, this is what he was doing now.The other part of it is what we call 403 evidence. That is whether the evidence -- whether the weight of the evidence, that is the relevance of the evidence may be apparent, but whether the materiality of that evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial value. And if it's only being brought in simply for character assassination, they're not -- he is not going to allow it in. So, he is going to have to look at each piece of this impeachment evidence to determine whether in fact he is going to let it in, and it is a little complex, a little esoteric, but the fact of the matter is that that's what he has to look at, and it's really kind of a logical conclusion that he has to reach.",

And there has been a response by the Israeli Prime Minister who has criticized it and he said he will fight it. But, you're right. What we're talking about are sanctions against the particular Israeli army unit, the one that's been sort of identified in the report is a battalion called the Netzah Yehuda battalion. This is an ultra- orthodox male-only Israeli battalion, and it's been particularly active in the West Bank. So, it's not necessarily about the actions of that battalion in the Gaza Strip. I don't know what they've been doing in the Gaza Strip.But, certainly, in the West Bank, for instance, in 2022, they were involved in a raid on a Palestinian village in which a Palestinian American man, something like 78-years-old, Omar Assad was his name, spent much of his life in the United States, came back to retire in the West Bank village where he was from. He was handcuffed and he was gagged, and he died whilst in custody. It was found in an Israeli army investigation that he had a pre-existing condition. The soldiers involved and the commanders of the battalion were reprimanded, but there were no prosecutions. And that's something that really provoked anger amongst the American-based family members of Omar Assad, the old man. And so, it may well be some response to that. But, certainly, there is a growing sense of criticism despite the huge aid that's been issued or has been approved in the House of Representatives for Israel. There is still a growing sense of discomfort with the -- in the U.S. administration about the tactics and the methods being used by the Israeli military, not just in Gaza, but elsewhere in the occupied territories as well.",

Zelenskyy tweeted within a matter of seconds, really, after that House vote took place, saying how grateful he was. But then, of course, the Ukrainians are saying that they need those weapons to come in as fast as possible. Of course, they are also looking towards Tuesday and towards that vote in the Senate, and of course, the President signing off on that as well.But, they do believe that those weapons could then be in Ukraine fairly quickly. A lot of the ammunition that we're talking about is staged in Europe and could come in here very fast. There is essentially three things that the Ukrainians have been talking about, the most pressing and the one that they talk about the most, is artillery ammunition, 155 millimeter artillery shells. The Ukrainians right now see they're losing ground in the east of the country and in the south of the country because they simply can't fire back at Russians that are trying to advance. So, that's been a big issue for them, the starvation of shells, as they put it. The other thing is air defense missiles, where the Ukrainians are saying the Russians have drastically scaled up their campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, but also on the frontlines where the Russians have been much more effective at using their air force recently. The Ukrainians are saying they definitely need more air defense missiles as well. And then, finally, longer distance weapons. We're going to wait and see whether or not the U.S. is going to give the Ukrainians those attack and longer range ground attack missiles and see whether or not those are going to arrive here on the battlefield anytime soon. The Ukrainians certainly want that. But, you're absolutely right. They're saying right now the situation very difficult for them. The Russians have made gains that aren't yet strategic, but certainly it is quite concerning, and the Ukrainians do hope that they'll be able to turn the tide, Amara.",

Good to see you.Well, inside that wide-ranging aid package for Ukraine that's headed to the Senate Tuesday, there is also a bill that was inserted that could ban TikTok in the United States. Now, it would give TikTok nine months to avoid a ban by parting the company -- with the firm that now owns it, the Chinese group ByteDance. The social media app is seen as a national security risk by many in Congress. House Republicans inserted the TikTok bill into the foreign aid package rather than asking the Senate to vote on it in isolation. So, that makes it much harder for lawmakers in the Senate to oppose the TikTok measure, because of course, they don't want to delay the foreign aid package any further. So, if the Senate approves the legislation and President Biden signs it, TikTok could be forced to find a new owner, or be banned entirely from the U.S. Let's bring in CNN's Marc Stewart, who is live for us in Beijing. You've been reporting on this, Marc, for quite a while. First off, I'd imagine it would be difficult for ByteDance to divest from TikTok tock in that timeframe.

Court is in session, which is four days a week, with the exception of Wednesday. After the opening statements, the prosecution will call its first witness. And first up, it's expected to be David Pecker. He is the former publisher of the National Enquirer, and Pecker was set to be a central player in Trump's alleged hush money cover-up with an adult film star.Kristen Holmes is joining us now from outside the courthouse in New York. Hi there, Kristen. So, tell us more about what's going on outside the courthouse in terms of security and what we're expecting. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. In terms of security, we have been told or at least our colleague John Miller has been told by various law enforcement officials, that they are ramping up the presence here, particularly in the park across from where we are located right now. We are told that that is obviously in reaction to the fact that someone lit themselves on fire, and they are worried that the park could become a place for people to essentially make a nuisance or try and make a scene or do something dangerous in that area. I will tell you, just from looking at the area itself, you can see more bike racks up and more of a police presence. [08:35:00] Now, in terms of what we're actually expecting inside the court, this is going to be a very big day for the former President, and expect him to stop at the cameras when he comes in, those cameras that are in the hallway of the courthouse. This is effectively one of the only chances he is going to have to campaign. It's going to be to these cameras in the hallway. He was supposed to have a rally in North Carolina over the weekend. Usually, he uses those rallies to air his grievances, but it was canceled due to bad weather. So, expect him up at those microphones, talking to those cameras. Now, today, we will hear from both sides in terms of the prosecution and the defense, giving their opening arguments, laying out what this case is about. And then, we expect to hear from the first witness. The first witness today is David Pecker. I'm going to give you a little bit of information. This is a longtime friend of Donald Trump, somebody who ran the company that owns the National Enquirer, and he is known to have bought and buried negative stories about Donald Trump, essentially meaning that the National Enquirer or people that approached them about stories related to Donald Trump, he would purchase the stories so that they couldn't go elsewhere, but then not actually publish those stories to protect the former President. And he has allegedly helped broker the deal between Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump and Michael Cohen, obviously, as you know, all three of them allegedly involved in this hush money scheme. So, he has been granted immunity in order to testify. But, the thing we'll be watching closely is not just what David Pecker has to say but also how Donald Trump sitting in that courtroom has to react. Just remember, at the core of all of this is an alleged affair with a porn star, alleged affair that caused a lot of problems with his marriage with Melania while he was in office and really caused Donald Trump to be greatly embarrassed. How does he react to some of these potentially salacious details when he is forced to sit there and listen and know that there are reporters in the courtroom watching him?

So, today, opening statements. How important are these opening statements, particularly from the prosecution? MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; TRIAL ATTORNEY: Absolutely. The opening statements are one of the most important and critical moments of the trial, and the reason is, the prosecution is going to provide the jury with a roadmap of the case. They're going to point out all of the evidence that the jury is going to see along the way, and why it matters relating to what this case is about. So, the opening statements really give the jury context, as they watch the remaining evidence on full, documents, information, witnesses, testimony, whatever that might be. Jurors are often relating that back to the themes that they heard during the opening. So, it's really important for the prosecution, and it's equally as important for the defense to hammer some of the themes of their case home right from the beginning.

So, the whole context surrounding what's going on at that time, the affair with Stormy Daniels, the catch and kill stories with David Pecker being the central person relating to that entire process, both Stormy Daniels, and ultimately killing those stories.That's all going to relate back to, why did Donald Trump want to kill those stories, and was it because of an impending election that he thought this would be a horrible thing for the women electorate to hear about his affair, while his wife is pregnant? And so, he wanted to extinguish that story. Well, the person that's going to be in the best position to talk about those motivations, which is part of the prosecution's case, is going to be David Pecker, who was involved in allegedly brokering that deal between Trump and Stormy, and also killing -- ultimately killing that story. So, he is really a good way to start off for the prosecution because it lays the foundation for a lot of the other evidence that's going to come.",

So, as you can see, it is complicated, and it's something the prosecution has the burden of proof. And so, it's not an easy slam dunk case by any means for the prosecutors.Now, your point about federal preemption, the defense has already tried to get this case dismissed at the state level by this judge. He said, no, the case goes forward. That issue of whether or not a federal law can serve as the basis for the second prong of this case, right, the falsifying business records, in furtherance of a federal crime, that's actually going to be an appellate issue.
