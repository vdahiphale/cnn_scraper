As I just discussed with a top administration official moments ago, President Biden was personally engaged in that negotiation process. Let's get the details from CNN's Arlette Saenz. She's traveling with the president in Nantucket for the Thanksgiving holiday. Arlette, what comes next here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, the White House is watching very closely to see what the implementation of this deal will look like.And a source familiar with the plan tells our colleague, M.J. Lee, that the U.S. has a working list of about 10 people they believe could be released in this first group of hostages. Now one thing that remains unclear is whether any Americans would be included in this release on the first day. Administration officials have said that they are hopeful that three Americans will ultimately be released as part of this larger deal. That includes a 3-year-old Abigail, whose parents had been killed in the October 7th attack by Hamas. But there are still a number of logistical issues that need to get worked out. The source said that the way that this deal is structured, the initial group of hostages would be transferred to the Red Cross, which would then move this group to a designated border point area where they would be able to leave. It's expected that many of the 50 initial hostages would be leaving through Egypt. And then there is the questions about the next phase for these hostages, the rehabilitation that they will all have to go through. Officials are treating the first two days of this hostage release really as a testing period to make sure that the process is working. And by day three, a source said they anticipate a discussion starting to begin about the release of hostages beyond that initial 50. So there are still a number of implementation points that the administration is watching in the coming days as they are hoping to get these hostages back home to their families.",

The authorities there are saying that both sides of that bridge are shut down right now due to a crash. However, this is prompting a federal response. We know that the FBI, the ATF, they are on the scene investigating exactly what happened. Authorities also saying that, at the time of this incident, a car was trying to enter the U.S. through that crossing. So again, limited details at this point. However, a colleague of ours, Paul Murphy, did talk to someone who was actually headed -- was there on vacation for the holiday with his family, was getting out of the parking lot in that area. And he described it as some sort of explosion that happened at that same time, said that there was smoke in the air, and then soon after that, they were escorted out of the area by law enforcement. So very much a fluid situation. Not exactly clear what happened there, but we know it's prompting a federal response. Kathy -- New York Governor Kathy Hochul is aware of the situation, also monitoring this. So we'll keep an eye on this and we'll continue to update you guys -- Boris?",

      "sentences": "Thanks so much.Now to a bizarre high-stakes tale of tech turmoil turning into triumph overnight after the fired CEO of one of the leading names in artificial intelligence is rehired just days after he was forced out of the company that he helped create. Sam Altman is now back as the CEO of OpenAI. The creator of ChatGPT was pushed out of the company on Friday. On Monday, Microsoft, which is a huge investor in OpenAI, announced that they had hired him. And that same day, more than 500 staffers at OpenAI threatened to follow him out the door if the board that fired him didn't resign. Then last night, this development. He was reinstated as CEO and the board was shown the door. Let's bring in CNN business and politics correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, to help us understand this soap opera in Silicon Valley. Vanessa, what happened? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, in less than a week, you had Sam Altman, the CEO and founder of OpenAI, ousted and then returned as CEO. He announced this on Twitter, along with the company announcing it on X, formally Twitter. But now, as part of this deal, though, you have a new board. You have two new board members to start, as well as a holdover board member that is still there. He was a part of the original board. He's still there. But a lot of tech experts are saying this is the beginning of what's going to be a much larger board, nine to 10 people on it. And folks are saying that this group has more experience and is in support of the progress of artificial intelligence. Also returning to OpenAI in just a matter of days is Greg Brockman. He's the co-founder of OpenAI. He, for a hot second, along with Sam Altman, headed over to Microsoft. Now they're both back. You see that photo there. Those are many of the employees that signed this open letter to OpenAI saying, if you don't get the current board out and bring Sam and Greg back, we are out. And just, Boris, to point out for everyday people why this is so important, we use artificial intelligence in our everyday lives whether we know it or not. And this is the next race. How fast do we move? Do we hold back? That was some of the disagreement between the old board and Sam Altman. Artificial intelligence, though, very much a part of our lives. Sam Altman wanted to pump the gas and move it forward, and now it's looking like that is exactly what is going to be happening.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, all this afternoon and evening, we've been hearing continued artillery outgoing from Israel into the Gaza Strip.We have witnessed large plumes of smoke, explosions, and those illumination rounds being fired into the Gaza Strip. Indicating that the Israeli military, as they've made very clear, is going to continue to target Hamas militants and infrastructure inside the Gaza Strip up until the truce actually goes into effect. What the Israeli prime minister also made very clear yesterday is that after this pause in fighting, that the military will resume its campaign against Hamas in Gaza. And the Israeli officials who I've been speaking to have indicated that that will also include pushing deeper into southern Gaza as well. Meanwhile, the Israeli military is also providing what they say is new evidence of Hamas' tunnel infrastructure under Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest hospital. They just released new video, Wolf, showing other entrances to that tunnel shaft, which they revealed last week. They were also able to breach this door that they found inside the tunnel, which they said -- and they show in this video -- leads to rooms they describe as a hide-out room. Another one they say is a bathroom. And they say this includes dozens of meters of tunnels that they've already discovered under Al-Shifa Hospital. They say it also passes under one of the hospital buildings known at the Qatari building there. So CNN obviously can't independently verify the extent of the Israeli military's claims here, although we have been able to geolocate at least one of those tunnel entrances to the Al-Shifa complex. But certainly, this is what the Israeli military says is further evidence of their broad claim that Hamas operates a command-and- control center below Al-Shifa Hospital. If that's so, we have yet to see evidence of -- Wolf?",
