That letter at the time was signed by over 400 employees.And this lawsuit, like that letters, specifically calls out Elon Musk's habit of making crude sexual innuendos in posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. For example, it refers to one 2021 posts where Musk says he plans to open a new university called the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, which, of course, would have a euphemistic acronym. And I want to play for you what one of these former employees told our Laura Coates last night. Her name is Paige Holland-Thielen. She told Laura Coates about the influence of Elon Musk's tweets within SpaceX. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAIGE HOLLAND-THIELEN, PLAINTIFF IN LAWSUIT: SpaceX will retweet Elon Musk's Twitter, and he will retweet them. And so it - it becomes impossible to separate his personal nonsense from the actual day-to- day life of an actual working environment where engineers are working hard and trying to get things done.

And so that is leaning more conservative. But these strategies are used on the left too. And the thing I'll note, which is so interesting, they are intentionally designed to look like they're impartial. So, the names that these types of websites will use are like, you know, \"The Arizona Monitor\" or \"The New Hampshire Democrat.\" These are the types of paper-sounding names that you would use for an impartial news outlet. And that's why I think a lot of people get fooled. Also, it's important to note, this isn't just a digital problem. It's also now migrated to print. So we're seeing a lot of these operatives are printing sort of fake newspapers that are designed to look like your normal local paper, but in reality they are very biased.",
