If anyone you know is thinking about making the day trip to the floating city, listening to this. Starting in the spring of 2024, if you`re not spending the night, you`ll have to fork over five euros. That`s about $5.40 to get into the city on super busy days. The city is making history as the first in the world to charge folks an entry fee. This isn`t a permanent thing. It`s like a 30-day test run. And instead of doing it all in one month, they`re picking days when they expect tons of visitors like holidays in the peak carnival season. The goal, to discourage day tourists during those crazy times. So here`s the deal. Venice can get seriously crowded. On some days, there are way more tourists than actual residents. They`re still working out the official dates when the fee will apply. But here`s the scoop, for those who live there commute, own a second home, or are staying overnight, you`re off the hook. You`ll just have to register online for your visit. The money they collect from these entry fees in part will help cover the cost of this booking system. And you know what, other European cities dealing with Hordes of day- trippers or keeping a close eye on this test, run in Venice. They`re wondering if they too can pull off something similar to deal with the whole over tourism thing. Coming up, have you ever thought about how clean your place really is? I mean, even though it might look clean, what about those sneaky germs hiding where you can`t really see them? Well, up next CNN`s Clare Duffy decided to roll up her sleeves and get down and dirty testing the germs in her home. And one more thing, I`ve always wondered, do we ever truly get rid of dirt and dust? Like if we wipe it up and toss it in the garbage or broom it away, it kind of just gets moved around, doesn`t it? Anyways, let`s see what nasties might be lurking beneath the surface of our spaces. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
