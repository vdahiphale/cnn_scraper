      "sentences": "So the \"Times\" asked economists in Chicago's Federal Reserve how much would the McCallisters have to be earning to actually live in a home like that? And that's where we get the answer. Their answer, working under the assumption the family spent no more than the recommended 30% of their income on housing, they'd have to bring in roughly $300,000 in 1990 or close to $700,000 in 2022.And in today's market, it would actually have to be making more than that to be able to afford that home. But obviously there's a critical question here. Where did the money actually come from? Time to dig in, right? Simple answer, we don't actually know. The movie never actually explains, but fans have theories. One clue they often point to, there are multiple mannequins scattered throughout the house. That seems rare, you would think, which led some to believe that Kevin's mom could have been a fashion designer. That's a career they went with in the official novelization of the movie. So we think we could put a check mark by that. The \"Times\" spoke to the novel's author who says he also made Kevin's dad a businessman because it was, quote, \"a safe bet.\" What about the uncles? One of whom, Uncle Frank, travels with the family to Paris. Not exactly a beacon of generosity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He pays for the whole family, 15 of them to fly to Paris to spend the holiday with his family, including four first class tickets for his brothers and their wives, opening up his apartment. Of course, it has Eiffel Tower views to host them all. This, while maintaining as we learn in the sequel, the Upper West Side Brownstone that Kevin ends up visiting in \"Home Alone 2.\" One other theory that has made the rounds online, organized crime.Now, let's be clear here. This is speculation. We don't know this specifically, but they fans say McCallister's home might have been targeted specifically as a mob vendetta. They point to Kevin's violence as evidence, get a childhood exposed to criminal activity. It's important to know, \"Times\" was not able to rule out this theory and either have my sources. We're going to continue to press for those answers. Public service journalism. In the meantime, one player directly involved in this process did go on the record with a very important point. Quote, \"to me with respect to the fans who argue about the parents income or house cost should instead simply enjoy the movie. That was from Eva Colley, the set director for the movie.

Once an icon of industrial America, the company could soon be owned by a Japanese-owned firm. The White House releasing a statement, the NEC Director Lael Brainard last night saying the President believes the purchase of this iconic American-owned company by a foreign entity, even one from a close ally, appears to deserve some serious scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability.Now, U.S. Steel was founded by the likes of Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan in 1901. It was once the largest corporation in the world. But on Monday, Pittsburgh-based company agreed to be acquired by a Japanese steel giant for $14.1 billion, the purchase triggering bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill with some lawmakers saying the deal should be blocked because of national security risks. Joining us now to discuss David McCall, he's the International President of the United Steel Workers Union, which represents thousands of workers at U.S. Steel. We appreciate your time.
