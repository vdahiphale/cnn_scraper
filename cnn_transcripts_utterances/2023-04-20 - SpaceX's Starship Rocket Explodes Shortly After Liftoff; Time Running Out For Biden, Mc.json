Compare that to even NASA's rocket launch of Artemis One back in November, that was only about 8.6 million pounds of thrust, so almost twice as much.You've got a cluster of 33 first-stage engines. The only other rocket that even tried to do something like that was the Soviet moon rocket way back then, and it didn't even get that far. The most -- the only way -- it only got about 50 seconds into flight before it exploded. So, the Falcon super heavy booster did work. It was not without some problems. We saw some engines had been shut down. And, of course, we saw that Starship failed to separate and then the vehicle exploded. So, there definitely were some big successes here. Perhaps the biggest one is that the booster works. And it didn't blow up on the launch pad because destroying the launch pad would have set them way back.",

It sounds like from preliminary reports that perhaps three engines didn't ignite at launch, and then looking at some camera shots as it was going uphill, looked like maybe six total engines, so maybe three shut down during the ascent. And so, that could have steered the rocket one way.It does have a control system and thrusters on the booster that would correct that. But you know, you would have seen that deviation. But we'll just have to wait for the announcement of the investigation to tell us what exactly happened. But those are good thoughts and I would say right now those are probable causes.",

And today, a manhunt is underway for Singletary.CNNs Dianne Gallagher is at the scene of the shootings. Dianne, you actually spoke to this little girl's mother. Can you tell us what she told you? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right, Brianna. And look, she says that she is just as concerned as all of the neighbors here right now because Robert Singletary is still out there. One neighbor telling me she hasn't slept since the shooting. Now, they say that Singletary moved into the neighborhood a few weeks ago. And ever since then, that he has had problems with the numerous children in the neighborhood that were running through his yard, playing in his yard, and he's often yelled at them and had arguments with their parents. They thought nothing was any different on Tuesday when a bunch of kids of different ages were playing basketball actually at this hoop right here behind me. The ball rolled into Singletary's yard, and that's when neighbors say he started yelling at those children. One of those kids went and got his dad. That child's dad came back, confronted Singletary. The neighbors say something to the effect of don't cuss out my kid. If you have a problem, you can come to me. That's when they say Singletary went inside and got a gun and began shooting at that man who escaped uninjured. And then the neighbors say Singletary turned around and the other children and the parents including Kinsley White and her father who were standing over here, put them in his sights.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has proposed raising the debt limit for a year, paired with some serious spending cuts though. President Biden has already swatted away the plan. And if their standoff isn't resolved soon, it could put a serious dent in your bottom line.Let's bring in CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich to explain. What is at stake here just for regular people as we watch this game of chicken play out, Vanessa? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. Brianna, Congress really needs to raise the debt ceiling so that the U.S. can continue to pay its bills and so that everyday Americans can continue to pay their bills. Right now, what we have in place is something called extraordinary measures. That is where the Treasury Department can move around money in order to pay our bills so that Congress has more time to raise the debt ceiling. But here is what is at stake for everyday Americans. If we do not raise the debt ceiling and we default on our bills, that will mean that borrowing costs will go up. So, we're talking about mortgage rates, we're talking about credit cards, and we're talking about auto loans. Also, Social Security payments will be impacted. So, many millions of Americans rely on these checks every single month. Also, veterans' programs will be impacted by this. Federal employees' salaries will be impacted, and also Medicare. So, when we talk about not raising the debt ceiling, we are talking about impacting some of the most vulnerable Americans right now, Brianna.",

Bring us up to speed where that search and rescue effort is now. PAYTON MAY, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Yes, Boris. Well, it's a very rural community here. We're about 45 minutes south of Oklahoma City. So, the search and rescue really continued overnight into the morning. There were a lot of reports of people still inside their shelters. Now, the community woke up to devastation. There's a home behind me here. As you can see, it's kind of completely caved in the walls here. What's kind of interesting is the closets maintain untouched. And that's one of those areas that typically, law enforcement will say is more of the safer area. And I'm going to bring you around the house a little bit here. This family, there were four family members sheltering in and above the ground shelter. They are again, all safe. These windows, front door completely blown out. We're going to give you a look inside the home a little bit. You can see that closet which I was talking about a little earlier, untouched. The clothes still hanging up in there. But then you have pianos, chairs, bookshelves. The entire back of the home, completely blown out. Debris scattered across the whole lawn. And this is a very small community. Around 600 people live in Cole, Oklahoma. Again, you said three casualties so far confirmed. We have not heard anything different than that. So far, the governor did just pay a visit to Cole to kind of pay his respects to the community. He did say that the governor -- the government here would be helping clean up, repair as quickly as they can. I'm going to show you across the street here there's a wedding venue. And I spoke with the family that owns that wedding venue. They were hiding in a manhole last night when the storms are coming through. They actually took shelter under that manhole. They said there was water seeping through. They were thankfully OK. But again, the community is kind of coming together today just to assess the damage, make sure that everyone is safe, and again offering those thoughts and prayers to those three people who did pass away.
