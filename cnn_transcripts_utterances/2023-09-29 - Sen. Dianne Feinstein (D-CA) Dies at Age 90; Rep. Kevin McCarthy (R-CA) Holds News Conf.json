Stand by for updates there.Also this hour, we may hear from President Biden, who will be honoring the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a huge day here. General Mark Milley is at a farewell ceremony that will be taking place. We're keeping an eye on that. And we are also continuing to follow the breaking news of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein. She has passed away at the age of 90 years old. She was a trailblazer, the longest serving female senator in U.S. history. She has been serving in Congress since 1992, a storied political career starting back in San Francisco.",

      "sentences": "And that's where we begin. Feinstein was the first female chair of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and then went on to become the city's first female mayor. That was back in 1978. She inherited that seat in the wake of the assassination of the city's mayor and San Francisco Board Supervisor Harvey Milk. It had a lasting impact on her. Feinstein then went on to become the first woman from California to be elected to the U.S. Senate.During her long lasting career in Congress, she fought for sensible gun laws, helping to pass a federal assault weapons ban, championed LGBTQ rights, and even helped establish the nationwide Amber Alert Network. She worked, by the way, up until yesterday. She cast her final vote on the Senate floor on Thursday, voting on legislation to prevent the government shutdown that is currently looming.",

He is expected to speak from the Senate floor soon. We'll be looking out for that.We've also received a statement from Dianne Feinstein's office, from her chief of staff that reads this. Sadly, Senator Feinstein passed away last night at her home in Washington D.C. Her passing is a great loss for so many from those who loved and cared for her, to the people of California, that she dedicated her life to serving. Senator Feinstein, he goes on to say, never backed away from a fight for what was just and right. At the same time, she was always willing to work with anyone, even those who she disagreed with, if it meant bettering the lives of Californians or the betterment of our nation. There are few women who can be called senator, chairman, mayor, wife, mom, and grandmother. Senator Feinstein was a force of nature who made an incredible impact on our country and her home state, that from her chief of staff.",

      "sentences": "Well, you just gave a long list of firsts for Senator Feinstein starting back in San Francisco. I'd like to add to some of those firsts, because she was not only the first woman to represent California and the U.S. Senate. That happened in 1992. She was the first woman to sit on the Judiciary Committee. She was the first female chairwoman of the Rules Committee. She was the first woman to co-chair the Inaugural Committee. And she was the first female chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It kind of goes on and on and on.And I was looking back to start with that last one as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. One of the things that she, just like many of her colleagues who was around during the vote to support the Iraq War, she was a very important voice because of her role on the Senate Intelligence Committee. And she said that she read the intelligence and she really believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. She said she really believed it. This isn't based on what she was told. It was based on the way she read it. And she called it one of her biggest mistakes. And she said, what's my lesson? The lesson is you take it all with a grain of salt. And so that is really one of the things that is striking and important. And it's a lesson for all of us as people. Never mind those who are in Washington and covering Washington. But it is to not only acknowledge your mistakes, but try to learn.",

There are some definite fact checks that need to be made there.",

      "sentences": "Well, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy clearly at a point where he knows that he has no good options right now to avoid a government shutdown. He walked the press through there, basically some victories that he says that his party had last night. Yes, they did pass three individual spending bills. They failed to pass another one with more than 20 Republican defections.But none of the bills that they passed last night, none of the bills that he was celebrating would avoid a government shutdown at this point. That is because they are all dead on arrival in the Senate, and they only partially fund the full federal government. Right now, McCarthy's focus is to try to get that short-term spending bill through the Congress, but he does not have Republican votes to do so. He may not even have the procedural votes to get over an initial hurdle, and that puts him in a position where there really are no good options right now. And you saw there, he's trying to basically make this about the southern border. That is a message that he is intending for hardliners who say that they want to crack down on the Biden administration, but he's arguing if they don't vote for this proposal, then they essentially are just supporting the Biden administration. But you also see him, and he has done this in the hall over the course of the last several weeks, blaming Biden for a shutdown. Of course, McCarthy and Biden had an agreement on spending levels That was part of the debt ceiling deal that they brokered in May and yet House Republicans have continued to move forward with individual pieces of spending legislation that are at far lower levels than what was agreed to between House Republican leadership and the White House. So, just a couple of things to keep in mind as you hear House Speaker Kevin McCarthy there. Again, the expectation is today around 11:30 there will be this procedural vote to try to pass a short-term spending bill with just Republicans backing it, but he doesn't have the votes right now. In fact, Representative Matt Gaetz is on the floor of the House railing against that proposal. He has been a key detractor of the speaker and has been threatening to potentially oust the speaker if he doesn't make good on a series of demands that conservatives have been arguing for.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. So, this GOP stopgap bill that has these border security provisions, the White House is saying that President Biden would veto it, assuming that it even got to his desk, which, as you heard from Lauren, is also unlikely, given that the House Speaker doesn't necessarily have the votes. But this goes on to say, quote, playing partisan games instead of working in a bipartisan manner to fund the government and address emergency needs. That is what they're accusing the Republicans of doing.And this is a delicate time for the White House. When it comes to the handling of the US-Mexico border, we have been reporting on an increase of border crossings. But the other side of that, what White House officials have been highlighting is that, in the event of a government shutdown, thousands of Border Patrol agents will go unpaid while they continue to enforce the border. And you also heard House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talk about cities who are receiving an influx of arrivals. Those cities may not be able to get the federal funds they need to shelter migrants in the event of a government shutdown as well. And those are some of the points the White House has been putting out in anticipation of a government shutdown, also including other agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, which will stop processing new business loans in the event of a shutdown, delays in long-term disaster recovery efforts, millions of women and children potentially going out without food assistance and millions of federal workers not getting paid, some of whom will be deemed essential and will have to work. But, again, they won't get that paycheck. All of this of grave concern not only within the administration but also because of the wide-ranging impacts it could have on Americans across the country. So, as we hear from Republicans, the White House is making very clear that there are real consequences here if they allow a government shutdown to happen. And to give you a glimpse of what that looks like just in the building behind, me senior aides are having to learn the jobs of some junior aides who may be furloughed in the event of a shutdown.",

This, of course, very personal to President Biden who served alongside the senator for 15 years, and in the statement he called her a pioneering American and a true trailblazer.And I'll also read another part of this statement where he says, often the only woman in the room Dianne was a role model for so many Americans, a job she took seriously by mentoring countless public servants, many of whom now serve in my administration. She had an immense impact on younger female leaders from whom she generously opened doors. Dianne was tough, sharp, always prepared and never pulled a punch, but she was also a kind and loyal friend, and that's what Jill and I will miss the most. Again, the president served alongside Senator Feinstein when she was elected in 1992 until his election as vice president in 2008, the two having a close relationship. We should also note that the president is expected to speak soon at a ceremony marking the end of the tenure for General Mark Milley and we'll see whether he also addresses her passing there.

I think one of the things I remember hearing from her is that toughness doesn't have to come in a pinstripe suit, and we certainly saw that with Dianne Feinstein.",
