Today, the man who stands accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a New York courtroom. During that arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to 11 state charges, including first-degree murder and terrorism-related charges. Now, if convicted on that top charge, the 26-year-old could be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is, of course, also facing charges in Pennsylvania and at the federal level.

Now, New York would have the argument that their charges were actually filed first, and, therefore, this case is already off to the races, a federal grand -- or excuse me -- a state grand jury has indicted them, whereas the federal case began by federal complaints, that there had yet to be a formal indictment. But that's something to be worked out. And we can't ignore the elephant in the room, that the Department of Justice about to have a dramatic change come January. So, how collegial those conversations are about which jurisdiction will actually proceed first could largely depend on who's at the helm in the attorney general position and the position of the Department of Justice.",

So it certainly could be something where the decision is not made for a couple of weeks as these cases begin to play out. That being said, I think you're going to see a strong push from Alvin Bragg, especially given what we saw, the entourage, the escort of Luigi Mangione to the courthouse with New York City Police Department and the mayor there, it's likely they're going to want to hang onto it and they will be advocating for that behind the scenes.",

She's laying the groundwork for various due process challenges. Remember, everything that happens in the course of this case could result in an appellate issue. So could it potentially be a change of venue request, that she's saying the mayor himself is standing in this entourage front and center, making statements which would tend to undercut a defendant's constitutional right to be innocent before -- until proven guilty? So, all of that is going to be the basis for potential challenges, whether it be to evidence, whether it be to venue or whether it be appellate issues that could occur down the road.

It says that it found evidence that Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on at least 20 occasions, including paying a 17-year-old girl for sex in 2017. Now, Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress last month after president- elect Trump picked him for attorney general, but then Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later after it became clear he would not have the votes to be confirmed. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, though. CNN crime and justice corresponding Katelyn Polantz has been following this all day.

It's also clear to me that there is a -- there's kind of a note of bitterness here on the part of the committee, because they clearly feel like they were not treated appropriately by Mr. Gaetz or by the Department of Justice, for that matter. They spent some time in the introduction of the report relating how Matt Gaetz essentially refused to cooperate with any aspect of the investigation. He refused to be interviewed. They served a subpoena on him. He didn't respond to the subpoena. They gave him some questions and he simply gave some very simple answers publicly, rather than treating this thing with the seriousness with which the committee clearly gave it. They also had some trouble getting any sort of substantive responses from the Department of Justice about their investigation of the former congressman. So, releasing the report, it seems to me, was based partially on wanting to get -- set the record straight with the work that they had done, despite some significant investigative hurdles.",

There's a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve eve report and not in the courtroom of any kind, where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.\" Misty, is this argument going to work here, in your head?",

Those statute of limitations would have tolled. However, it can be extended when you're talking about a minor. So there's a lot of legal minefields here that he's stepping in. And by putting his position out in this way, by saying now buying a gift for somebody that you're dating is prostitution, you're basically putting something out there that can never be retracted and could ultimately come back at you in the courtroom and speak to some of the elements of those potential prosecutions or civil actions, whatever it might be. But, certainly, putting this position out there, to the extent it gets into the court of law, there's an opportunity to do it, but providing these types of factual statements that would ultimately make it into court, from his perspective, not a great idea at this juncture, especially given the results of this report.",

What were the circumstances surrounding their decision to walk away from what the committee describes as substantial evidence? They may have had good reasons to assess that a prosecution would not have been successful. They -- having to deal with witnesses like Joel Greenberg and others who have really terrible records for credibility, that sort of thing. But nevertheless, they should have to provide, I think, some answers to congressional overseers. As for the state level, there is nothing to prevent state prosecutors from going down this road. Now, would they have to eventually deal with the fact that the feds took a look at it and said no? Probably. But, nevertheless, I think Misty's absolutely right.

And I was basically just pointed back to Trump's remarks in Arizona on Sunday, and without any sort of further guidance of what this idea is or where it came from. Talking to some people close to the Trump transition team, they said, look, Trump has been very interested in making trade conditions much more favorable for the U.S. We saw that with his threats to put a tariff on Mexico and Canada. And this is in line with those. But the idea itself has certainly come out of left field, even for some individuals close to the transition team. And it was not the only idea that Trump suggested will be coming out in his early term. He said that he opened the door to potentially allowing TikTok to continue to operate in the United States. He suggested that he would sit down early in his presidency with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, though he did not provide details on how he would do that. And he also pushed back, as you said, against this new Democratic talking point that Elon Musk, his co-conspirator in helping throw a wrench in the funding plans last week, is somehow more powerful than even he is.

And you can see at the end of that line chart right there around 2021, 2022, you just saw inflation skyrocketing at the same time you saw so many jobs that were available, a lot of job vacancies, while at the same time the unemployment rate remained very low. And that gave the appearance of a really tight labor market. And, of course, though, Danny, hindsight is 20/20. At the time, economists didn't think that was the case. But now we know. And that actually may help inform future policy at the Federal Reserve. And economists may think differently about now what the job market actually looks like with this information that people were just really stressed out about the higher prices and were trying to get better jobs, making more money.
