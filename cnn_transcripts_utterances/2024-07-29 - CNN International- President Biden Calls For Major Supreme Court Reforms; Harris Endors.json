We begin with President Biden's call for seismic changes to the U.S. Supreme Court. The president calling for a constitutional amendment stripping the president of immunity for crimes committed while in office. Also for term limits for Supreme Court justices who currently serve for life -- life and a binding code of conduct for the high court. The announcement to come in a speech next hour in Texas. Large majorities of the American public support reforms to the Supreme Court but the political obstacles are enormous. Joan Biskupic covers the Supreme Court for CNN. Joan, this makes Biden the first sitting president in generations to back changes to the way the court operates. Do you have a sense of why he is making this push right now?",

We are in the final months of an election year and you know the last time there was pressure on president, then candidate Joe Biden to put forth some reforms, was back in 2020, and he pulled back. He resisted. He said, I don't want to talk about term limits, but I will set up a commission, and the commission delivered some recommendations that never went really anywhere.But now, he's picking it up again and I think it's because of pressure from his base. That's one reason, but then the other reason that I think cannot be denied is that we have had a series of really striking Supreme Court rulings have delivered a real shock to the nation. And I would say most notably is the justice's decision giving broad immunity to the former president for any from any kind of criminal prosecution. So that's why, as you noted there, Jim, the leading reform issue that President Biden is mentioning is to have a constitutional amendment that would say that presidents cannot be shielded from criminal prosecution for actions while in office. So, you know, this is -- this is an important issue that, you know, gets new life during election years, but it's always been lingering there in terms for people who've been watching the Supreme Court.",

But as I say, it came only after a compromise between justices, Amy Coney Barrett, chief justice John Roberts, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with two of the liberals who had unusual leverage here, just because the right wing of the court had fractured so much on this issue, and they said we will join you to dismiss this case only if you lift that order from January that left this Idaho ban take effect, Jim.",

But now that is going to have to expand. She did put out that statement as you mentioned about her support of what the president is backing today. But when White House officials were asked how involved Harris was in helping President Biden craft some of those reforms, they declined to comment on exactly what her role was. I mean, to be sure President Biden established a commission on the Supreme Court the United States, shortly after taking office that commission spent about six or seven months working on a nearly 300 page report that included some very detailed thoughts on things like term limits and ethics codes for justices, that sound a shelf for a while, but did help to inform the way that President Biden thought about this. And certainly now, as he is in the twilight of his presidency, Jim, it has become clear that he wants this to be something that he has put his mark on at the end of his term, even though when he was on the trail back in 2020, he was very cautious and said, the second, did any party begins making changes are suggesting changes to the Supreme Court?

Now, today, I spoke by phone with the Lebanese caretaker for caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, who told me that through diplomatic channels Lebanon had received assurance it says that the Israeli strike would be limited and he said that Lebanon's interpretation of those assurances was that Beirut, the airport, and specifically the southern suburbs of Beirut where many of his butlers leaders are based would not be struck, because we know in the past that Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah has said that if Beirut airport is struck, Tel Aviv Airport will be struck. If Beirut is struck, Tel Aviv will be struck. So they're -- they've made it clear that Hezbollah will meet escalation with escalation. Now, yesterday, we had to sit down interview with the foreign minister who told us that as far as Hezbollah goes, the Lebanese government is essentially helpless, that they are in contact with the group, but the group acts independently and his concern is that if Israel launches a full scale war on Hezbollah, that others, including Iran, the Houthis, the militias in Syria, and Iraq, will join the fray. So the concern is even though at the moment the conflict in Lebanon is specifically between Hezbollah and its local allies and Israel that it could be a much broader war. Now as a result of these tensions, what we have seen is that several countries, Germany and Italy, among them, have advised them air nationals to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. Other countries have reiterated their advisories for people to leave. And we heard the U.S. assistant secretary of state for consular affairs put out a video posted on X or Twitter saying that people U.S. nationals in Lebanon should leave before the crisis begins.

Likewise, people may see it to be in his interest to keep some kind of war going.He certainly has always maintained that he is doing what he feels is in the state of Israel's interests.

Jim, well, the evidence is that just to give you a little bit of context, here in Venezuela, you don't have a transparent vote counts that leads up to, for example, when we have the proclamation of a precedent, either in the United States or in other countries that the electoral authorities presents and shares, how the votes are being counted minute after minute, if not hour after hour. Here in Venezuela, the announcement came just in the middle of the night. It was just a simple statement from these electoral body that is heavily controlled by the Maduro government, who handed the victory to Nicolas Maduro. However, many exit polls and polls before the election gave the opposition a considerable advantage. The opposition for example, are saying that they've only had access to 40 percent central roughly 40 percent of the ballot reports and they're demanding to see the other 60 percent to contest these election. And it's not just the U.S. that are calling -- causing scrutiny over these results.

For a while, I believe before President Biden dropped out for the current campaign for '24, there was a sort of feeling in the valley, I would say among tech CEOs who thought a Trump reelection would be and inevitability. And you started seeing for Musk sort of coming out in full support of Trump to even Mark Zuckerberg not endorsing him, but sort saying he did a really cool thing when he did the fist pump after the assassination attempt.And I felt like that was kind of a vibe this is probably inevitable thing. And it has shifted in the past few -- in the past week alone, basically, which feels like a month. You've seen Reed Hastings of Netflix gives 7 million to Kamala. It's definitely a vibe shift out here.",
