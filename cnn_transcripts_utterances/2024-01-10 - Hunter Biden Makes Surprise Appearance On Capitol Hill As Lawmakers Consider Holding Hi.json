The president's son making a surprise appearance on Capitol Hill to watch the House committee meeting called to hold him in contempt of Congress. Chaos, shall we say ensued. Plus it's debate night in Des Moines. Get ready for Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis to go head to head for the first time, live on CNN.The stakes are incredibly high, which is five days left for the top Trump alternatives to chip away at his massive league. And demanding answers. Multiple investigations are now underway after the Pentagon waited weeks to reveal the Defense Secretary was battling cancer. Why was even President Biden kept in the dark until yesterday? I'm Mana Raju in for Dana Bash, let's go behind the headlines in Inside Politics. First up, Capitol Hill needs reality TV. A wild scene unfolded today as House Republicans were starting to move towards punishing Hunter Biden for refusing to sit for a closed door deposition when the president's son showed up. Hunter Biden has been asked to testify in public but today he was silent. Instead just watching as Republicans grew angrier and angrier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): Who to bribed Hunter Biden to be here today? That's my first question. Second question. You are the epitome of white privilege coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed? What are you afraid of?

Our colleague, Annie Grayer then confirmed that reporting. He showed up, he sat in the audience and listened for about 20 minutes, and then he exited. But before he left the building, his lawyer did make a brief statement about why he was here today. Let's listen.

He doesn't get to dictate the terms of his appearance.Although we should note that there were several Republicans who in the last session of Congress refused to apply with a congressional subpoena with the January 6 Select Committee. Now, ultimately, it is going to be up to the DOJ to determine whether to prosecute Hunter Biden over this. That's assuming that this resolution passes the full House which we're hearing could happen as soon as next week. But Manu just a remarkable showdown here on Capitol Hill today between congressional Republicans and the president's son as Republicans continue to try to and pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Biden.",

I think the old playbook for something like this would be to try and always take the high road, especially if you're the child of a president who's running for re- election, right? Don't respond, don't give more oxygen to what's going on.I think Donald Trump really changed the playbook and the way that people think you know how, in particular voters are going to respond that they think that people want to see you fighting, that if you let the allegations go unchallenged, that you basically are mincemeat for kind of the sort of churn of our national media. And that's what you saw today. I mean, honestly, I'm really interested to know - what they - what  needed done in the White House, and other Biden officials thought about how they're doing this, but I get why they did it if you're - if you're just trying to defend Hunter Biden.",

You know, the President and his aides will say, look that he loves his son, and he supports his son, but they're not going to be out there trying to counteract everything that the Republicans are doing. They want to show that there is a separation from the Justice Department and from them. And I think that there was a lot of frustration from Hunter Biden and those that are helping him and his and his lawyers, because they - they realized that the White House and that Democrats were never going to provide a support system for him. And so that's why I think what led to this shift, because if - if no one else was going to go out there and publicly defend him, he needed to go out there and publicly defend himself and counteract everything that Republicans are saying.",

We know that the President was familiar with his remarks at that time.Of course, Hunter Biden and his lawyers had argued that he was willing to sit down with these committees if it was in a public venue. But we are still waiting to hear if in this exact instance of whether the White House had any heads up. Of course, heading into these meetings today, they said that they were pushing back against what they described as baseless attacks of amid these House GOP investigation saying that these committee members, Republicans are simply interested in playing politics at this moment. But there have been moments where the White House and Hunter Biden's legal team didn't exactly see eye to eye on the more aggressive strategy approach. But really, they've taken - the White House has taken this hands off approach, not engaging in every twist and turn of Hunter Biden's legal drama.

I'm looking to see whether or not Nikki Haley makes a mistake, that jeopardizes the trajectory that she's on, because right now, she has put herself on one that gives her a shot of denting Donald Trump's kind of the - the sense of inevitability around his - his nomination, right? This is going to be really the first test for her to stand on a stage one on one as Zeleny noted, and to actually show that what he has been out there saying about her isn't true, which is that when the scrutiny lights are the hottest, she doesn't stand up. I mean, presidential campaigns are an incredible crucible, in a way that you know, other campaigns for governor, etc, are not as you know, very well. So that's honestly my big question here. How does she perform? If she can come out of this the way she's come out of the other debates, I think we are in for a really interesting couple of weeks. If she makes a mistake, a very clear mistake, then I think we could be having a different conversation here in a week.",

Just to get a sense on the money that's been spent in the final weeks here. Just in Iowa, this is ad spending since January 1. Pro-Haley groups, whether it's the campaign or super PAC, together a $7.6 million. She is outspending both DeSantis and Trump, even doubling Trump right there more than doubling him.Do you think if this - can - is it possible, Haley can come out on top in Iowa and not beat Trump necessarily, but beat DeSantis?

So I think that if he were to come in third, then he's going to face a lot more pressure to just bow out to potentially give Haley an even greater shot at trying to catch Trump in New Hampshire and in other states.But again, even though she is closing that gap in a state like New Hampshire, when you look at the following state, South Carolina and others, she still has this massive double digit distance between her and Trump. He's leading her by double digits even in her own state. And so the likelihood that she's going to be able to catch him, I'm skeptical about. I mean, I think it's frankly, just stunning that she and DeSantis have not attacked Trump at all on the legal matters, or the character matters even going so far as to say that they'd pardon him.",
