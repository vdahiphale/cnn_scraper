And that's why I am concerned the fate of the 136 Israeli hostages that have been held now for more than 120 days in Hamas captivity. And I think it's a priority for Israel to get them out, but there are certain limitations to how much Israel will be willing to give to Hamas in order to get them out. And I think that it's very important for us to have American involvement in it, but I think that Sec. Blinken will also be coming in order to prevent an escalation into a regional war.
