You not only had the comments from Mitch McConnell, but you had other Republican leaders agreeing that, you know, obviously the former president bears responsibility for what happened that day. And I'm not seeing a lot of really full throated defenses from Republican allies, which has been really interesting so far.",

Senator Rick Scott, he called it political theater.Senator Roger Marshall, it is time to move on. And of course, you have Mitt Romney, who's saying, look, I've said from the beginning who was responsible for this?

But I think one of the questions we've all asked since 2020 is how much power is Trump going to continue to have? You know, people, it seems like it almost matters not what Trump does or what happens to Trump, but what the Republican Party does in response to Trump. And so, you know, with the midterms, like Seung Min said, with the trading cards, with all of these issues that are going on, you know, the question, it just seems like there's just a slow backing away of the Republican Party from Donald Trump. BROWNFor Trump's part, here is how he has responded. He posted on Truth Social, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger. People understand that the Democratic Bureau of Investigation are out to keep me from running for president because they know I'll win. There's a theme here with Donald Trump wanting to win. Hope Hicks, his former senior advisor said as much. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, he's running for president again. On the one hand, I would say, if we can all stretch our memories back to 2015, there were a lot of Republicans speaking out against Donald Trump back in 2015, too, until he became impossible to beat and the train to get on. I think it would be, like, foolish to try to say, well, look, people are speaking out against him, so it's over.The difference is, at the time, there was a big question about what would he be like if he was president? Now we know the answer to that question. The other difference is that the midterm results not great for Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis has surpassed him in much of the polling, and there's some evidence that within a sizable chunk of the Republican Party, people are just tired of relitigating 2020 and want to move on to your point about the Senator's comments. But again, when we talk about that, trying to take lessons from 2016, the more fractured that Republican field is, the more Republican candidates are in that field, the easier it is for Donald Trump to try to make a comeback with his base, even if his base is smaller than it once was if there's 15 people in a race, it's a different race than if there's two or three people in a race. I think it's too soon to really know what things are going to look like six months from now. But I do think Donald Trump seems to be right now in a much weakened state with enough Republican incumbents, particularly in the Senate, who are just having none of it and don't want their own legacies, their own political accomplishments to be entirely defined by what he's done.",

But there are a lot of questions about what's in there, because this bill was drafted only by a handful of members and the leadership, and ultimately, they're trying to pass this by a Friday deadline to avoid a government shutdown. Now, this bill, 1.7 trillion includes money for Ukraine, more than roughly $45 billion in money for Ukraine. In addition to this, it includes $40 billion in disaster aid. It would ban TikTok from federal government devices. And also it would overhaul the Electoral Count Act. Of course, that is the legislation that was passed in the aftermath of January 6th in order to prevent a future President trying to do what Donald Trump tried to do, which to urge Mike Pence in 2021 to overturn the electoral results. That can't happen next time there is a joint session of Congress meets to certify a state approved election results. But there was a lot of provisions that did not get in the bill, an expanded version of the child tax credit. The White House also had been pushing hard for billions of dollars in aid for COVID relief, also not part of that plan. Other measures, such as allowing cannabis growers to use banks to put their cash reserves, and banks did not get in there. But still, Pamela, questioned still by what is in this proposal, because this was just unveiled, even though the initial deadline was September 30th. Now, the new deadline, end of the week, just unveiled this morning. They'll see if they try to get it done within the next couple of days.",

And what it does is it turns a so called dumb bomb into a smart bomb.Dumb bomb, something that simply falls off an airplane, falls to Earth and hits whatever underneath it at that point, but precision guided smart bombs, and that's what this bolt on kit will give Ukraine precision guided weapons much more of a multiplier on the battlefield against Russian dug in targets. And it's what the Ukrainians have been wanting. They have aircraft, but they have to figure out exactly how to modify their Soviet ear aircraft to put these JDAM kits on the bombs to get them onto the aircraft, may not be too complicated, but it's going to take a while to get it all done. So people are watching very much with anticipation to see how soon the Ukrainian air force can get these precision weapons in shape onto their aircraft and begin to fly more against those Russian targets, especially with everybody digging in for a very cold Ukraine winter.
