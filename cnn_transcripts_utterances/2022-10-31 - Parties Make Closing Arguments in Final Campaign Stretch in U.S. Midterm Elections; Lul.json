We have to stop that from happening. There's a push on all sorts of -- trying to get to the voters who voted in 2018 and 2020 but are not regular voters and get them concentrated. They feel like, look, there are a lot of race that are still very close here and if they can push up 5,000 votes, 10,000 votes in a race that could decide a lot of these races. A lot of Democrats whether they're elected officials, party leaders, strategists are panicked that they feel like things are not going well for them in the midterms right now. They are panicked beyond that because they're thinking that this is about democracy and its very core that might be at stake here. Whether it's election deniers who are coming in or people who think they may be paving the way for a Donald Trump return. I was in Baltimore yesterday at a campaign event, Senator Chris Von Holland leading Democrat in the Senate said that authoritarian is on the rise from Moscow to Mar-a-Lago. That's the way Democrats feel here and they feel in a real existential way like if they don't do well next week in the midterms, that American democracy is in trouble and they are worried that that's where things are headed.

Unfortunately, we don't have that sound bite available for you. But according to that eyewitness, he said many children were there during the holidays Diwali and when they collapsed the bridge took place, all of them fell, quote, one on top of another, unquote.

It had recently undergone months of renovation, only recently reopened to the public and we heard also earlier from the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi who expressed deep sadness about this incident.
