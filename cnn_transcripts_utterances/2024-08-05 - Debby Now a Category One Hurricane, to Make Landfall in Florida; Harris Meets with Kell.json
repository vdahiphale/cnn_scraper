Just ahead, parts of the U.S. are bracing for impact as Hurricane Debby churns towards landfall, bringing the threat of catastrophic flooding.Kamala Harris' search for a running mate enters its final hours as the Vice President sits down with some of her potential picks for a final interview. And two Olympic triathletes fall ill just days after swimming in the Seine. It's forcing Belgium to pull out entirely as competition is set to resume just hours from now. Good to have you with us. And we begin here in the United States where Debby has now strengthened into a Category One hurricane as the storm moves towards Florida's Big Bend region. It's expected to further intensify before making landfall in the coming hours. The National Hurricane Center says the storm now has winds near 80 miles per hour or 128 kilometers per hour. Debby is expected to bring historic amounts of rainfall and storm surge to parts of the southeast. Parts of Florida are already experiencing heavy rain and flooding. Emergency officials say some high-water rescues were underway overnight. Hundreds of flights in Florida have also been canceled or delayed. Georgia, Florida and South Carolina have all declared a state of emergency as the storm approaches. The city of Savannah could receive a month's worth of rain in just a single day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES STALLINGS, DIRECTOR, GEORGIA EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT &amp; HOMELAND SECURITY AGENCY:  Rainfall is expected to be around 20 inches in the area of Savannah and locally possibly even more. If so, that will be a generational storm that we've not seen. They're calling it a 500-to- 1,000-year storm. And so with that, we're extremely concerned about flooding. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Throughout the process, Harris has been asking close advisors who would make the best governing partner for her at the White House. Another top consideration, though, is electability.She's been looking at how each of them would balance out the ticket and how they'd help in key battleground states. Shapiro and Kelly, of course, from states that will be critical in November. Now, the VP pick is often a political afterthought once they're selected. But for Harris, this is the biggest decision that she's going to make as the presumptive Democratic nominee. And she's still working to introduce herself to many Americans. She's been speaking with a close group of confidants, including her husband, Doug Imhoff, and former Attorney General Eric Holder, whose law firm is helping with the vetting process. A reminder of just how quickly this process is taking place. Just a couple of weeks ago, Harris was President Joe Biden's running mate, and now she's selecting her own VP. We will hear a decision soon because she and her running mate are expected to appear at a rally on Tuesday in Philadelphia. That kicks off a battleground blitz. They're going to be crisscrossing the country, visiting key states ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts on August 19th. In Washington, Julia Benbrook, CNN.",

I think the top two contenders are probably the swing state governors, right, Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania and Mark Kelly from Arizona. Mark Kelly, I think the only drawback would be that he's a senator from a swing state and he's up for re-election in two years. So it might actually shift the balance of power in the Senate if that's a tough race.But this is a man who looks like he's out of central casting for such a position, his military record, obviously being married to Gabby Giffords, and also the fact that he was an astronaut. This is a man, though, that knows immigration, he's in a border state, so that makes him particularly attractive. Josh Shapiro is just really good on the stump going after MAGA as he did as attorney general in Pennsylvania.

The Democratic Party is finally having this after nine years of not having that. If you recall, the 2020 election was about voting against Trump much more than it was about voting for Biden. So, it's been nearly a decade and the Democrats now have a candidate that they're super excited about. Let's see how long this last. But Kamala Harris now has many paths to victory.

Iran, of course, accuses Israel of carrying out the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political chief, in Tehran last week. And of course, we've been hearing warnings from both the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and just yesterday from the Iranian foreign minister vowing that there will be severe punishment for the state of Israel. But of course, many questions as to when and where this potential retaliation will take place, what form it could be, the scope of this retaliation. We've heard from one U.S. official saying that they believe it could be imminent in the coming days, whether this is a direct attack, as we saw in April, Iran launching drones and missiles on Israeli territory, or whether this is a broader, more complex and coordinated attack with Iran's regional proxies, namely Hezbollah in Lebanon, of course, the Houthis in Yemen, amongst others. And of course, then there are questions around the calculation that would go into the response from Iran, whether they are seeking to re- establish deterrence against Israel without triggering an all-out war directly with the state of Israel, or whether perhaps this could pull many others in the region into a broader regional conflict. Now, take a listen to what Prime Minister Netanyahu had to say yesterday with regards to this looming threat that we are seeing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translation): The state of Israel is in a multi-arena war against Iran's axis of evil. We are striking hard at any of its arms. We are prepared for any scenario, both on the defense and the offense.

We've continued to see Israel targeting and striking parts of southern Lebanon. There have been warnings in the past from U.S. officials telling CNN that there is a chance that we could see Israeli forces perhaps launching a full- scale ground incursion into Lebanon.That would certainly really shift the nature of this conflict, really dragging out this conflict more broadly in the region. We heard yesterday from Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, addressing this potential retaliation by Iran. He said that they are looking at preparing very strongly in defense on land and in the air, that they are ready to move quickly. We've also heard from the Israeli military's chief spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari. He said that they are preparing for any emerging threat. But of course, this is also a huge concern for members of the international community, namely the United States as you heard there from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. We know that Biden is preparing to meet with national security officials in the Situation Room later today in the afternoon. Before that, he will be speaking to the King of Jordan, a key ally in the region, but also a key mediator over the course of the ongoing ceasefire talks and, of course, communications with the Palestinian Authority. We know yesterday that the Jordanian foreign minister was also in Tehran meeting with officials there to discuss the regional situation. Of course, the U.S. has been in touch with others in the region as well. We know, of course, that the Secretary of State has spoken with his G7 counterparts. He spoke also with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mohammad Shia al-Sudani. A very clear message from the Iraqi prime minister that the de-escalation that we're waiting to see in the region, that the U.S. wants to see in the region, will not happen, according to the Iraqi prime minister, until there is a cessation of violence in Gaza. That is something that we've heard from a number of leaders in the region. But of course, at this point, it feels that those ceasefire talks are further away than we have seen towards a resolution in some time now. Rosemary?",

Our chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta weighs in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This week, we asked viewers what questions they had about this summer's COVID-19 wave, and you had a lot of them, specifically about the shots and when you should get your next one. So, first of all, we don't know exactly when the most updated shots are going to be available, but you can probably expect them some sometime this fall. There's a few things to keep in mind. The new COVID shot is going to target the JN.1 variant, which incidentally is a descendant of the omicron variant. Remember that? Now, the predominant strain that's circulating right now is KP.3, which is a descendant of both of those are omicron and JN.1. So the bottom line is the new COVID shot should be pretty protective against the currently circulating strains. Also, remember this: immunity we're learning lasts around four to six months. So keep that number in the back of your mind. That is probably the reason that were seeing a summer surge as the protection, whereas off from the last set of shots. Also, there's been a lot of discussion recently about a combination shot, COVID and flu in the same shot. Moderna, the pharma company, had some positive trial results with that combination earlier this summer, but we're learning it's not going to be ready for this fall. You can, however, remember, get both the flu and COVID shots at the same time in try and do that sometime before Halloween. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
