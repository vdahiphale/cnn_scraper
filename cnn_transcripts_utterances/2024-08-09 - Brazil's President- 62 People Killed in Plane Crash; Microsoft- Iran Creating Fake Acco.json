But you can tell that after it hits the ground that those noises go away completely. So they are related to the airplane.Now, what can happen in this style of situation, too, is that the ATR is very, very powerful engines and the propellers are adjustable pitch. So as the -- you're in the stall situation, if you apply full power to it to try to recover yourself from it, which maybe what happened here, the propellers can actually cavitate. In other words, they're spinning too fast. They grip the pole forward. They're just cavitated. They're causing disturbance of the air on the propeller and that can cause that sound. That it actually is stalling sound. As you mentioned, it's where the aircraft has air over the top of the propeller, it's going supersonic. It's actually creating the subsonic or transonic range that causes that popping sound. That's what you're hearing, is putting the popping sound. So it could be that it was just over cavitated those propellers at that point.",

Briana, U.S. intelligence officials have warned as recently as last month that Iran is trying to run a covert influence campaign targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election.And they had two goals in mind. They want to undermine Donald Trump's candidacy. And they also want to just sow discord more generally in the U.S. by exploiting the societal divisions and the political divisions that already exist here. And this Microsoft report really provides the clearest, most concrete examples we've seen so far. I mean, includes examples of these fake news sites that Microsoft says were created by Iranian operatives. And they target people on both ends of the political spectrum. One example they give is catered to more left-leaning, liberal-leaning voters. And it's all about stoking outrage about Donald Trump. It posts really long-form articles insulting Donald Trump, including one and that was headlined \"Roy Relapse.\" It has a caricature photo of Donald Trump on it. It also includes a quote that calls Trump an opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA China shop. Refers to him as a quote, \"raving mad.\" There's also other sides though that cater more to conservative- leaning voters in the U.S. And they want to talk about issues that really drive conversation among some of those conservative voters, including LGBTQ issues, gender -- gender reassignment issues, things that really get conservative voters heated. They want to really pump up the temperature in those online forums. And in a way, that stokes real-life division and divisions in the voting booth.",

Microsoft is saying that evidence actually shows Iran, and Russia maybe now, are the two most engaged in trying to influence the upcoming election.And they suspect that Russia will continue to try to do what Russia's been doing for the last several election cycles. That is, again, to exploit those divisions within our society, within our political structure. They point to several examples, including an Instagram account run by Russian operatives. They say it's really just geared toward everything that is explosive and controversial in the U.S. They're just trying to really get that conversation and that outrage machine rowing. It includes conspiracy theories, like the CIA -- and claims the CIA instructed Ukrainian troll farms to influence the U.S. elections. It claims the FBI wiretapped Donald Trump's resident, things like that that really do create sort of mass hysteria or attempting to create mass hysteria. China is another one. It's an interesting example. Because Chinas not really assessed at this point to want to influence the outcome of the upcoming election, but they are doing things behind the scenes to sort of push those pressure points in the similar ways to the Russia and Iran are. China is running these fake online personas for amplified outrage on their end. That could target some down-ballot races, according to Microsoft and the intel community. So the big three, really, using their intelligence services and their online tools to try to influence the U.S. electorate in some sort of way.",
