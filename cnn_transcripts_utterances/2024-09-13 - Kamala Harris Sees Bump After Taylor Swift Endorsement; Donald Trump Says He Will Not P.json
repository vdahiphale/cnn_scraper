And we do that largely through iconic partnerships with artists, actors, athletes and other cultural figures.And it's awesome to see a musical icon like Taylor Swift, who's really a role model for so many young people, because she shares a lot of the same values and is concerned about a lot of the issues that they care about. And she's being vocal and encouraging new voters to get to the polls and really emphasizing that no one can sit out in this election. I think the hidden power from her endorsement and her speech at the VMAs that might be lost on some, but for those of us who work to -- work in the youth space, understand that she is actually providing and encouraging basic voter education in both her call to action to register to vote, but also in researching the candidates and the issues. And the reality is, young voters are new voters, right? So, they need that information.",

He was up on the stage in New York and went on to ramble for over an hour or roughly 60 minutes and then never took questions. It's something that they were billing as a press conference.So, we'll see what he does here. But what I would expect today is largely what we've heard from Donald Trump in the last 48 plus hours, which is trying to relitigate the debate. What we saw in Arizona yesterday was essentially him trying to go line by line to prove that he won the debate and that Kamala Harris was lying. He called her a liar multiple times, went after her with personal attacks, went after the moderators with personal attacks, saying it was completely unfair. He has now called for an investigation into this debate, all while again saying that despite the fact that it was unfair, he was the winner. So, we do expect to hear some of that today. He's clearly been airing his grievances. Now, I do want to mention a little bit here about their outreach because their strategy is not so different from what we just heard from Isaac when it comes to Harris's strategy. Everyone knows, both Harris and Trump's team know that this race is going to be incredibly close, that it's going to be decided in the margin. So, what you're seeing is these events in Nevada, which today, possibly one tomorrow. We are told as well, these are trying to reach out to any group that they possibly can to siphon off as many voters as they possibly can. You're going to see Donald Trump way more in these battleground states. Clearly, there is an intense battle being already played out in Pennsylvania, and we're going to see him across the map. Michigan as well, possibly Wisconsin. They are trying to vote in the -- They are trying to reach out to the margins as well. They are trying to expand their electorate with people who don't usually show up to the polls, which is why you're seeing them engage so much in very specific kind of social media, the social media that reaches outside of traditional voting blocks. But it'll be interesting to see what he decides to do today. There are a lot of questions that reporters have for Donald Trump coming out of that debate and the circumstances around it, particularly who attended the debate with him, including Laura Loomer. So, that'll be something to see whether or not he actually takes questions about that.",
