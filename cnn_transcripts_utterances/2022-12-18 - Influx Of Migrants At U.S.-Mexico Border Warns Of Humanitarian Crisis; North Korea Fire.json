First, it is critically important to note that essentially, for over 2.5 years, the U.S. border has been shut to people seeking asylum due to this debunked so-called public health policy known as Title 42.It's important to know that that is how we got here. That's how we reached this point. There's this backlog of people trapped in border cities, waiting to exercise their right to seek asylum. But this reality is simply not insurmountable for the U.S. government. The federal government knows exactly how to process people humanely, efficiently and in large numbers. In fact, it did exactly that with Ukrainians fleeing war, who came to our borders in large numbers earlier this year. The U.S. took in more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in five months, including over 20,000 people who were welcomed along the land border in the month of April alone. There's no reason why, once Title 42 lifts, when it lifts, the U.S. can't do the same for Haitians, Venezuelans, Central Americans. It's just a question of whether the administration and the federal government is willing to exercise the political will to do that.",

Airport and railroad shutdowns caused by widespread protests in the country have left as many as 300 tourists stranded in the ancient city of Machu Picchu.The local mayor told CNN that he had requested helicopter flights to evacuate them. Rafael Romo has more on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  The problem wasn't only the fact that several regional airports, including Cusco, one of the busiest ones, had to close due to the fact that they were targeted by protesters, who were bent on disrupting traffic to the rail line, connecting Cusco to the ancient city of Machu Picchu, also suspended service for the same reason. I have been in touch with Americans, who had planned the trip of a lifetime and wanted to end the year in an exotic location. They told me as early as Monday they noticed people protesting violently on the street in cities like Cusco and Machu Picchu. But when airports and rail lines shut down, they ended up missing connections to travel back to Lima, the capital, and therefore were unable to return home. Peru's ministry of transportation confirmed the Cusco airport has reopened. That is good news for those people trying to fly back to the capital. What is going on in Peru? It all started December 7th, when then president Pedro Castillo was impeached and arrested after he announced plans to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. His supporters have staged violent protests that have left at least 24 people dead, disrupting traffic and leaving many people stranded, including hundreds, if not thousands of foreign tourists. I spoke with an American man who is visiting Peru with his girlfriend. Jon Royer told me there were a couple of times he became scared, as protesters took to the streets after former president Pedro Castillo was ousted last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
