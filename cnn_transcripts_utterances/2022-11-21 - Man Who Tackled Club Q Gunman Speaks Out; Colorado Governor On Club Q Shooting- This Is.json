We can tell you tonight that Ashley Paugh worked with a nonprofit helping foster children. Her husband says she was a loving mother whose daughter was her whole world and that she loved hunting, fishing, and being outdoors. Kelly Loving's sister released a brief statement tonight calling her sweet and caring, and a wonderful person. Derrick Rump was from Eastern Pennsylvania and worked as a bartender at the club. His sister says that in Colorado Springs, he found a community of people he loved very much. He made a difference in so many people's lives, she says, and that's where he wanted to be. Derrick worked side by side with Daniel Aston. He was a bar supervisor, the best anybody could ask for says another bartender. Daniel moved to Colorado Springs to be closer to his parents. His mother says he thought himself shy, but wasn't. He had so much more life to give us, she said. Raymond Green Vance's family says he had just landed a new job and couldn't wait to save enough money to get his own apartment. They say he was a kind, selfless young adult with his entire life ahead of him. He was at Club Q with his longtime girlfriend and her parents, including her father, Richard Fierro, who did help stop the gunman, but not before Raymond was fatally wounded. Now, Richard and I spoke just before airtime and I do want to warn you, it is a raw emotional discussion and what he describes is as graphic as you might imagine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He was receiving all of the information. He was encouraging them to be violent at the Capitol. He was basically abandoning his own Vice President to the gallows.

But I think, you know, as I'm watching this case and watch it unfold, I think authorities are still trying to figure out exactly what they're dealing with. You know, initially they came out and said, this appears to be a targeted attack, there is no concern to the rest of the public. But then since then they've retracted that.
