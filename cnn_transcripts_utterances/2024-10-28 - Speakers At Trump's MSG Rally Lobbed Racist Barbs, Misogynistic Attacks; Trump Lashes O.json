My reporting from inside the arena and the fallout on the campaign trail tonight. Also, with just weeks to go, Republican Senate candidate, and top Trump ally, Kari Lake is here live, to talk about the final days of her race in Arizona. And a ballot drop box set on fire, damaging ballots in one of the country's most competitive districts. What happens to those ballots, those people's votes, and what happens if it happens in your district? The Democrat in that race is my source tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With eight days to go in a presidential race that is so close, it feels like a sneeze could tip the outcome one way or the other, the Trump campaign is doing damage control, tonight, which we almost never see from a candidate who prides himself on almost never apologizing. But the racist and inflammatory remarks, at that six-hour long rally, at Madison Square Garden, went far enough that some of Trump's allies are worried about the fallout, affecting crucial votes, with just days left to go in this race. Take it from someone, who has reported from dozens of Trump rallies, over the last eight years. I was there, covering Trump's packed event, last night, and I'm not sure I've ever witnessed anything like it. I spoke to multiple sources, today, who agreed with me. A bunch of Trump's staunchest allies are even saying as much publicly, with people like Peter Navarro, calling this comment, tone-deaf, not funny and stupid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Trump campaign put out this 13-word statement, last night, saying, quote, \"This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.\" Now, to even get that, is saying something. This is coming from a campaign that doesn't distance itself from almost anything, certainly not at one of its own rallies. It says a lot tonight, even if it's saying very little. They were likely trying to hope to ward off headlines like the one that came out in \"Politico\" today. Puerto Rico Fallout 'Spreading Like Wildfire' In Pennsylvania. But I should note, not everyone inside Trump's campaign seems to be worried about causing damage with persuadable voters. Listen to what Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance had to say.

Now, I think there is something to the fact that, yes, a lot of this is baked in. There are very few Americans, who don't know who Donald Trump is, at this point. But to the very slim minority of people, who are still undecided, in this race? To have this closing message, at this state, is disastrous. I couldn't have hand-crafted, as someone who wants Donald Trump to lose, a worse closing pitch that you could give to undecided voters, considering there's half a million Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania alone.

We want to make sure that women, if they want to keep their babies, know that there's help and options.
