KASIE HUNT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYSTAnd I think one of the things that stood out to me in the minutes since we have learned about this verdict was what Michael Fanone had to say to Jake a little bit earlier when Jake asked what he has to say to Kevin McCarthy, who is, of course, the Republican leader, and who, several weeks after January 6th, went down to Mar-a-Lago, took his photo with Donald Trump and has been hesitant to directly criticize him ever since. And Fanone said, I have nothing to say to him, because the reality is the Republican Party right now, there are many, especially in the House of Representatives, which was one of the buildings that was attacked on January 6th, who have that comment, a normal tourist visit was made by a member of the body that was attacked. And so there clearly were different -- it was a broad mix of Trump supporters who were at the Capitol that day. It is very clear that there were dangerous, organized elements among them. There were people who were carrying zip ties, who were carrying more sophisticated types of weapons who were looking to do very real harm to people. And I think that to Mr. McCabe's point, I think that bringing those particular elements out of the word work, underscoring it, identifying what it was that they did, even though, yes, Rhodes was so careful that he didn't actually enter the Capitol, we still know that as this jury has told us that he was a ringleader of what was going on, that he had a plan that they were trying to implement on that day. So, I think it's going to be very meaningful for people who were in the building as well as for obviously how this is talked about and discussed going forward.",

Sir, thank you so much for making the time for us right after we heard about this verdict. What is your reaction? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, The house and the Senate, of course, had voted that the former president, Donald Trump, incited an insurrection against the union. And here, we have a conviction of a jury of his peers against the leader of the Oath Keepers that he was guilty of the crime of seditious conspiracy, which means conspiracy to overthrow or put down the government of the United States or to interfere with its laws. So, I think that the character of January 6th is now finally sinking into the whole country. I mean, this was a series of events that was designed to overthrow a presidential election and essentially topple the constitutional order and replace it with something else completely different. And so I am excited that the jury system and the judicial system is working. I was pleased to see that they had a very fine grained and subtle approach to analyzing the different charges. Stewart Rhodes was found guilty of certain offenses. He was acquitted of others. And the same was true of the other defendants. And so it shows that the American system of justice is actually working.",

But that is what the rule of law and the system of justice is about in a democratic society. There needs to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual defendant is guilty of the particular things that he or she is charged of. So, I would view as a vindication generally of the work of our committee, but, of course, the other half of our work is forward- looking.

We have to remember that Donald Trump and the forces of chaos and vendetta and authoritarianism are still very much out there. And the democratic constitutional order has held. I think the election that we just came through was a very positive thing in terms of the vast majority of the American people trying to stand up for democracy and freedom and the constitutional framework. But the point remains that there are those people who want to turn the people who beat up our police officers and smashed our windows and stormed the Capitol into martyrs and they would like to treat them that way. That has been the history of authoritarian and fascist coups all over the world that the people who engage in an attempt that is stopped by the constitutional regime are somehow turned into martyrs in order to try to make it succeed the next time. And so I will just tell you that the people on the January 6th committee, I think the majority of people in Congress are standing strong for constitutional democracy, just like the vast majority of Americans are too.

Wade was overturned and when Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that same-sex marriage might be under threat yet.Now, this bill went it outright legalize same-sex marriage in every state, but it would require states to recognize legal marriages in other states. So, it would protect the rights of both same-sex marriages and interracial marriages. But the votes were not always there, Brianna. Democrats had to worked behind the scenes with Republicans. They agreed to make some changes to the bill in the Senate version and they even delayed the vote until after the midterm elections in hopes that if there were political pressures facing GOP senators, that that would be alleviated after the midterms. And, look, it appears to pay off because just now, the Senate voted with a support of a dozen Republicans. So, this is absolutely historic. Now it heads to the House. We are expecting a big bipartisan vote there. 47 Republicans voted on a similar version earlier this summer. That vote is expected next Tuesday and then it will head to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature. Bri?",

And, Kasie, when you look at this, and, of course, yes, to Nia's point, this is mixed and it creates sort of an economy of perhaps same-sex couples, at some point, needing to go to another state if they do want to get married and to come back for that to be protected in their state.12 Republicans in the Senate though here and 47 House Republicans, Melanie mentioned before, voted on a similar measure. How do you see where Congress is on this? HUNT:  Well, Brianna, I think the important thing to underscore here and the goal of what these bill supporters were trying to accomplish is to make sure that states that perhaps want to make this decision not to allow same-sex marriages in the event Obergefell is overturned, as Nia was saying, still would be forced to recognize marriages that have been made in other states in America, so that LGBTQ couples don't necessarily have to live in as much fear that they will not be able to enjoy the protections that they believe they have because of their marriage. And I think it is very interesting. And one of the things that I think is worth underscoring from a political perspective here is that Democrats made the decision, and Nia mentioned this, they decided to put it off until after the midterm elections to try and really actually get this done. There is a lot of cynical politicking that is often done in Washington where one party or the other will try to force an issue ahead of an election because they know it makes it harder for a opponents, but at the end of the day, it may not actually be the best for the people who stand to benefit from the legislation. It is just better for people who are trying to keep seats in Congress or win more seats in Congress. And to the credit of the people who backed this in the Democratic Party, they worked very hard and very quietly behind the scenes, they worked very hard to make this something that was supportable by Republicans who otherwise might have been in a tough spot. And that included saying, okay, you know what, we are not going to do this until later. So, I think it's important to give some credit to the way that Democrats handled this because it really, I think, helped ensured that they were actually able to get something done on this, to get some additional protections here, obviously, in the wake of the fear that was sparked by the overturning of Roe versus Wade.",

It just doesn't say that. It essentially says the states still have the power to discriminate against same-sex couples and not issue a marriage license. If you're in Alabama or Mississippi or any of these other states who might may want to discriminate against same-sex couples and deny them the right to marry, this bill is saying, that is fine, you can do that, but you would have to recognize somebody who is married in New York or Massachusetts or something.

He was able to play for a couple minutes after apathy came off in the second half and he didn't feature at all.Of course, U.S. soccer fans will be praying that he is fit and able to play for Saturday, because he was the difference between the two teams today. It either doing so well in this tournament, they're so organized and tight. They don't concede goals, but they don't score money either. They haven't really got a top striker. So if it wasn't Pulisic, they would be going to the knockout round so they will be desperately hoping he's back and able to play against the Netherlands.",

They've really been put in an impossible position. One of their former teammates was arrested the other day for spreading propaganda. We understand that he was released on the eve of this game.But we cannot imagine what these guys have been going through. A lot of the Iranian players are based overseas, and so they're not all going back home, but yes, I imagine they would've been rattled with the threat of their families.",
