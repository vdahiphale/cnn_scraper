This comes less than 24 hours after police raided the compound, firing stun grenades and rubber bullets. They arrested more than 300 Palestinians. These violent clashes taking place and they're happening as worshippers were inside, offering prayers for the holy month of Ramadan, and they're sparking retaliatory rocket fire from Gaza.

And we are seeing a sort of similar cycle now twice in less than 24 hours. The Israeli police have raided Al-Aqsa, and twice, in less than 24 hours, rockets have been fired from Gaza and into Israel.Now, overnight, the Israeli police raids into the Al-Aqsa Mosque seemed to be a little bit less, you could say, dramatic than the night before, not nearly as many people were injured or arrested. But it also happened during a much busier time period. There seemed to be for kind of your regular worshippers who were inside the mosque. But, once again, Israeli police saying that they had to go in because they believe that there were dozens of what they call juveniles who barricaded themselves inside with fireworks and stones they were preparing to throw at Israeli police. But, again, it's hard to underestimate how or hard to overestimate how provocative and offensive it is seen around the Muslim world, especially for Israeli police to even step foot inside of the Moscow, let alone engage with things like stun grenades and rubber bullets. Of course, then again, overnight, once again, we saw the response from militants in Gaza, saying that they were responding specifically to what was happening at Al-Aqsa with at least seven rockets fired. So far, though, I have to say it doesn't seem as though right now there's an interest by either the side of Hamas or the Israeli military to escalate this further, but Hamas has called on Palestinians today to march here, to march to Al-Aqsa, to show their support.

This report, it was just released by Maryland's attorney general, and it alleges sexual abuse of at least 600 children over six decades, beginning in the 1940s, that abuse would have been committed by 156, at least, clergy members, from priests, deacons to teachers, others employees of the archdiocese.The report alleged how victims they were plied with alcohol and drugs, and then they were coerced and forced to perform sexual acts. I want you to see exactly from the report. It says from the 1940s through 2002, over 100 priests and other archdiocese personnel engaged in horrific and repeated abuse of the most vulnerable children in their communities while archdiocese leadership looked the other way. Time and again, members of the church's hierarchy resolutely refused to acknowledge allegations of child sexual abuse for as long as possible. Now, $13.2 million has been given to 303 victims at this point since the 1980. The money is going for counseling and for settlements. Many alleged victims were too late here, because according to the civil statute of limitations in Maryland, victims have no recourse if they are over 38 years old. The report cites why they didn't come out sooner. Some wanted their parents to pass on before they would come forward. They didn't want their parents to know what they had endured. And by the time they did that, it was too late under the law. Others just didn't admit it, wouldn't acknowledge it and others have repressed memories.",

Can we actually start with M.J.'s last piece of reporting there that it's just unclear if there was any involvement in the White House and prepping McCarthy and you guys for this meeting? Can you answer that? Because the stance they've taken has been really neutral and uninvolved. Is that correct? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA):  Well, I did not receive any White House or administration briefings. I'm not sure if the speaker of the House did or not. But, look, this is a very bipartisan event, and it's a routine event. President Tsai met with leader Hakeem Jeffries at the Democratic Party in New York just a couple of days ago.
