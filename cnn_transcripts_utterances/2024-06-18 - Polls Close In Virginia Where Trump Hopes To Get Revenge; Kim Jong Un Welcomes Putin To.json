And you can see him leaving court after his release this morning. Arrest records show he refused to take a breathalyzer test three times. \"The New York Post\" reporting the officer who stopped him was so young he did not recognize the pop star by face or name.Elizabeth Wagmeister is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Singer songwriter and actor Justin Timberlake known for hits like sexy back, leaving the Sag Harbor, Long Island, police station this morning, charged with driving while intoxicated. Timberlake, known as the prince of pop, left the American Hotel at 12:37 a.m. this morning in a 2025 BMW, pulled over by police after allegedly rolling through a stop sign and failing to stay in his lane. According to court documents, Timberlake's eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and his breath had a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. An officer said he had slowed speech, was unsteady and perform poorly on all standardized field sobriety test. The document says the 43- year-old rejected a breathalyzer three times and told police, quote, I had one martini and I followed my friends home. He spent the night in jail before being released on his own recognizance. The \"Better Days\" singer began his career on the Mickey Mouse Club and shot to stardom as a member of the boy band NSYNC in the '90s, before launching a multi-platinum solo career. Timberlake had a highly publicized relationship with Britney Spears from 1999 to 2002. In her tell-all book published last year, she wrote about having an abortion while dating the singer, alleging that Timberlake was not happy about the pregnancy, writing: If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it\". Timberlake has not responded to that revelation. He later married actress Jessica Biel, and the pair are now parents of two young sons. The couple recovered from a scandal in 2019 when Timberlake was seen cozying up to female co-star. He released a statement apologizing to his wife saying, I drank way too much last night and regret my behavior. I should have known better. Like his high profile relationships, Timberlake's career has also had ups and downs beyond his music and acting. And appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\", he was part of the infamous wardrobe malfunction after tearing Janet Jackson's top during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004. In 2021, he apologized to both Jackson and Spears for his missteps in the past after renewed attention on his relationship with Spears prompted him to make a statement. Timberlake's arrest comes in the middle of his world tour for his sixth album, which was met with lukewarm reception and weak ticket sales. At a concert promoting his newest album this past February, Timberlake seemed to address some of the public scrutiny, sharing a few choice words on stage. JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, ACTOR/SINGER: I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely (EXPLETIVE DELETED) nobody. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
