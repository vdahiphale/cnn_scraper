And those kinds of voters make up the margins. And I've been very worried about whether or not they would go for Kamala Harris.But you know what's happened in the intervening time is that these voters have increasingly become so frustrated with this choice, so down on Biden. I mean we were seeing a ton of backsliding in swing group - voting groups of people who had voted for Trump - I'm sorry, who had voted for - no, voted for Trump in '16 and then voted for Biden in 2020. A lot of them were moving back to Trump. And now, as we've been talking to swing voters, you hear that breath of fresh air. They're just - the contours of this race changing are exciting to them. And that is being helpful. And also, a lot of it depends how she runs and what her vice president looks like. I think that if she can pivot somewhat to the middle - and, look, if J.D. Vance can go from calling Donald Trump America's Hitler, to being his vice president, there's room for her to pivot to the middle of it. And so I think if she does that and doesn't run like the progressive Californian that she did in 2020, and runs more like an AG who is a tough prosecutor, I think she can pick up a lot of these swing voters.",

And when you hear President Biden, having continued to harp on, well, we created 15 million jobs, but voters saying, but I'm not making enough, this is an opportunity for Harris to come out with a stronger economic message to try to turn the tide of those numbers. Again, I mentioned the call that her campaign held with donors earlier this week, but I think it's really instructive because they asked, again, what is her message on the economy?

Vance become a drag on the ticket when he's got other issues that he's got to deal with.There's also a tone question here that this brings to my mind in terms of, how does the Trump campaign, and I think they're wrestling with this and so far coming to the wrong answer, how do they deal with Vice President Kamala Harris? What are they going to say about her? In my view, to say that she's a progressive from San Francisco and to regard her as the most liberal member of the United States Senate, that's all appropriate. That's all debatable. That's all fair game. To talk about her as a DEI hire and to say anything that smacks of misogyny or racism, I think is going to have enormous blowback. So, they've got to get their act together and decide now how they're going to handle her. And what I'm seeing in his Truth Social responses so far, meaning President Trump, tells me he's taking the wrong approach. He should have been more dignified. He should have come out of that convention as the victim that he was of an assassination attempt and continued to try and maintain that level of dignity. HUNT: So, Michael, I absolutely take your point. I mean we've - we've seen Trump on the stump once since this all unfolded, and he seemed to mostly stick to policy-based attacks against Harris. He did warn that he wasn't going to be nice.

She's no longer needing to worry about progressives. And she didn't have a fight anyway. And he's got his base.

I think for people watching the Olympics over the last years and decades, you know, you think of the stadium, you think of the flame coming in, the athletes coming in behind the flags. This time the athletes will be on boats on the Seine River. And the fans will be along the river on the bridges as the athletes, as the performers, as the entertainment comes along on the Seine. It's an incredibly ambitious undertaking by the French. Fingers crossed they're going to be able to pull it off. Of course the disruptions with the trains earlier today. But I - as we are standing here, we hear the police going by all the time. The security is incredibly tight. And here's hoping if the weather holds, rain has stopped for now, that they can have the celebration that will be really a once in a lifetime event for the Olympic games.",

Everyone has - has been alerted. They're all on the international SOS system. So, they're getting the same updates that we are.And the U.S. OPC will have all of their athletes on buses. So, no one's taking a train to an event anyway. But, of course, the great concern is hundreds of thousands of people, according to various reports, that are now being impacted, who are trying to come into Paris for the opening ceremonies and for the actual competition, which, of course, women's soccer and others have started. But the big events, of course, tomorrow, swimming, right off the bat Saturday morning, Katie Ledecky, the Chinese, all the issues that we've been discussing, and people have tickets for that. And they bought those tickets, in some cases, months, even years ago. And now they are, of course, caught in this same, you know, the issue of, can they get here on the trains? And so kind of surprising that this is what's happened. But we know the Olympics are a target, Kasie, for possibly anything, knock on wood, that this will be as bad as it gets here. And let's hope that's the case, that this is all it is.",
