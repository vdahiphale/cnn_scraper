I believe that we can fight on principle and do these things simultaneously. When you have a small majority, it requires -- some things are going to have to be bipartisan.But I think these are issues that every member of Congress should agree on. We are on an unsustainable track with our debt. There -- there's no two ways about it. And I think everybody recognizes that we've got to get down to the matter, the heart of this to change the way we do business. We have an important role to play in the world, but we have to take care of our own house first. And these things must be done simultaneously, and it needed to start a generation ago. It hasn't, and we're on the job now. We're going to make it happen.",

Everybody cools off. Members have been here for, as Leader Scalise said, for 10 weeks. This place is a pressure cooker. And so, I think everybody can go home. We can come back, reset. We're going to get our group together. We're going to map out that plan to fight for those principles. And we have some great plans in the playbook already. And I look forward to rolling that out.

And we've seen very close allies to this president, Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon and others, talk in detail about the plans that are being discussed. Now, what I find fascinating about the Trump campaign leadership team putting out that statement is, it seems to me a very clear signal that there was some concern about how this was being portrayed, that there is some sense that this may not be, in terms of a general election message, everything that they want to put forward yet, and they want to control that a bit more than they feel it's being in control right now.",

This is a congressionally mandated report. 750 scientists, experts, and over a dozen different agencies. Five years ago, the Trump administration put it out on Black Friday, hoping that no one would notice. This administration has built podcasts and websites and you just heard him talk about an interactive map where people can really understand how this is impacting them.Overall, this report is very stark. It says that the global warming has sped up in the last five years. it's more intense here than the rest of the world. The United States is warming up more. Water is a huge problem, not enough or too much. It is unfair. It is ungodly expensive on the American economy, on productivity, on mental health, on traditions from fishing to winter sports. All of these things are slowly going away even though the cheapest forms of energy man has ever known right now are solar and battery or onshore wind. But the richest companies, multinational corporations in human history, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco and others show no signs of changing their business model. So, right now it's sort of a fight between invested interests and a cleaner future right now. But really, this administration really leaning into this and really the most robust way we've ever seen right now. And now putting some money behind updating the electrical grid, which is this creaky big Rube Goldberg machine, the biggest machine, really, in the world that somehow works, it needs to be modernized as well. As well as helping out communities that have the smallest carbon footprint, but are suffering the most, tribes and communities of color, those sorts. So, funding for those as well.",
