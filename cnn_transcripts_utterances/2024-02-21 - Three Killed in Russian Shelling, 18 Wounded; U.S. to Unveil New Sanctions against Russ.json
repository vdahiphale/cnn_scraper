I'm Becky Anderson for you in Abu Dhabi. As Ukraine shoots down more than a dozen drones, the Kremlin says it's just making more and it's seizing the narrative, publicly awarding medals to those who took Avdiivka. There's starvation in Gaza. Ahead this hour, an exclusive CNN investigation into what happened to one U.N. aid convoy stuck -- or struck in the war zone. Right now, the high court in London is hearing final arguments in Julian Assange's extradition appeal. We could learn the WikiLeaks founder's fate anytime now. And in a court in the United States, jury selection begins in the manslaughter case against the armorer on the set of the Alec Baldwin film, \"Rust.\" That begins in just 30 minutes from now.

And in this situation, the Russian disinformation that appears to be coming in, at least through this informant who's now charged with crimes in the United States, that information would be coming in about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, his son. So step back a second. The person who's charged, his name, Alexander Smirnov. He's an American citizen, who lives in Las Vegas and he was arrested last week because he had been lying to the FBI. He had been giving them information for many years. And some of that information about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and their connections to Ukraine and the Ukrainian oil company, energy company, Burisma, that was false. So he's charged with that lying scheme. And then separately, the Justice Department is now saying in court filings that Alexander Smirnov has been telling them that he's getting information, including about Joe and Hunter Biden, from the Russians. They say that he has extensive and extremely recent contact with Russian intelligence, with foreign intelligence, with Russian spies and also with people involved in assassination efforts by Russia in third party countries, that have high, high level contacts with Russian officials. People who are family members of Russian government officials. And so that's what this man is telling the FBI. What does one believe? Well, as far as we know right now that the FBI does not believe what he was saying about the Biden family connections to Burisma and money exchange there, at payoffs, a bribery scheme, all of that the FBI says, that was not true. And so that is undercutting quite a bit of what House Republicans in Congress in the U.S. have been trying to pursue related to Joe Biden foreign contacts, money that may have been exchanged or that there were allegations of money being exchanged. That's not true. And now this man, Smirnov, we're learning more about this Russian disinformation coming through him into the FBI, clearly with Russia intent on disrupting American politics and potentially smearing Joe Biden even more.",

Essentially, it's a hearing aimed at working out whether he will have the right to appeal that 2022 decision by the high court, that the extradition order should hold, confirmed by the home secretary of the time. So we will find out shortly. It has been a complex couple of days of arguments made by lawyers for the United States, lawyers for Julian Assange. Many of them have hinged on the question of whether what Julian Assange did as WikiLeaks founder, by publishing, in 2010, 2011, those classified military documents that related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, fall under what might be considered ordinary journalistic practice. United States' lawyers argue that it does not. He went far beyond what an ordinary journalist might do in the gathering of information. This has been the argument by his allies and by his lawyers, as explained on \"CNN THIS MORNING\" in response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it's my organization's position and actually that of his own defense that this was done in the public interest, the leaked classified documents, informed public interest reporting around the world. And if Assange is prosecuted in this way, the precedent would then be set that could apply to journalists and media organizations, to many others.

And that could mean that, within a few weeks, he finds himself across the Atlantic in American hands and in the hands of the judiciary. If the hearing goes his way, then it starts yet another legal battle. This is a man who's been essentially locked away now for many years, first in the Ecuadorian embassy; remember he was holed up there for seven years from 2012-2019. And since then he's been in Belmarsh Prison, now hoping that the appeal will go his way. Essentially, his lawyers are arguing, Becky, that this is a political being, persecuted for his political opinions. And much will hinge on whether the two judges in charge hear that or whether they stand by the earlier decision that the extradition should go ahead, Becky.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice-over):  These are scenes from inside the hospital last week. The witness says, when Israeli troops took control, they forced doctors and other medical staff to leave the building. The IDF says it arrested hundreds of Hamas militants in the complex, including some posing as doctors, and that troops found medicine labeled with the names of Israeli hostages. Well, Nasser hospital was the largest functioning hospital in Gaza. But vital medical services there collapsed in late January, according to Doctors without Borders. After Israel laid siege to Nasser, it left only five doctors remaining inside to care for 150 patients. My next guest was what -- is one of those five. Dr. Hatem Raba told CNN that never in his life had he prayed for, for example, a patient to survive, because that was his responsibility, to save a patient's life as a doctor. But now, the fate of his patients is not in his control because he doesn't have sufficient supplies, anything like the equipment he needs to care for them. On Tuesday while caring for an extremely ill patient, he said he prayed and wept that that patient would survive. Well doctors and others' prayers actually came true.

Well, the U.N.'s food agency said this week it is pausing aid deliveries, food aid deliveries to northern Gaza, because it's not safe. It says its trucks have been shot at and looted. Now that announcement comes after Israeli forces fired on a convoy, despite taking a route laid out by the IDF. CNN's Katie Polglase has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER (voice-over):  This is how desperate the people in northern Gaza are. This aid truck filmed at the end of January is one of the last to enter the region. And here's why. Aid so often caught in the fighting.",

POLGLASE (voice-over):  The truck set off as part of a U.N. marked convoy of 10 up Al Rashid road in the early hours. It reached an IDF holding point at 4:15 am, stationary for over an hour. It was then hit at 05:35 am. Fortunately, no one on board was killed. The U.N. says they were hit by Israeli naval gunfire. And in satellite imagery taken just two hours after the attack, CNN identified ships that could only be Israeli naval boats. They've been deployed along the coast and are attacking Gaza from the west.",

Many other aid trucks have been hit since the beginning of this conflict. The U.N. says northern Gaza is still home to reported 300,000 civilians. UNRWA says half of its mission requests to the north have been denied since January. And since this latest attack, they've taken the painful decision to stop trying to deliver aid to the north at all. The IDF says it's helping to coordinate humanitarian relief in Gaza. But aid agencies say they faced repeated delays while some staff are detained and even tortured. A U.N. mission in December described one aid worker who said he was stripped, beaten and blindfolded. Even when convoys are allowed through, some routes are simply not passable.

We are turning into a communist country in many ways. And if you look at it, I'm the leading candidate. I never heard of being indicted before I was I got indicted four times.

It shows his self-absorption, his own inability to look at any issue in the world unless it's refracted through a prism of his own interests. It's a grotesque comparison if you think about it. Navalny went back to Russia to confront an authoritarian leader. Yet Trump, who has his own authoritarian tendencies, is comparing himself to that heroism. On a practical level, there is no comparison between what Trump is saying and the conditions in Russia. He is benefiting from a fair legal system and guarantees of a fair trial, the right to appeal, the right to produce evidence in his own defense that are guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution, that he has said that he would like to terminate. If there's a comparison in this case, it seems to be that Trump has instincts that are more in line with those of President Putin in terms of his desire to have a second term presidency with zero constraints, in which he would be immune from any type of prosecution or checks and balances than Navalny. So but this is classic Trump. It shows how he will damage anything to help himself, the U.S. legal system, the political system and millions of Americans believe him because of his ability as a demagogue.",
