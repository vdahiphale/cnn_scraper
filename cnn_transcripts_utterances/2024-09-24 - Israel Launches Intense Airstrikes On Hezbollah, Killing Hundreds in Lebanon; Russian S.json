The Israel Defense Forces say it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets and what the defense minister calls an impressive operation, but for those displaced civilians, there is nothing but fear and despair as they flee their homes in southern Lebanon and seek safety, some finding at schools that have been turned into shelters.

Well, the Israeli government announced last week that it was heading into a new era of this conflict that had been largely localized along the border for the course of the last year. And I think that Monday was definitely, I don't know what else to describe it as, an aerial bombardment, an aerial assault. If you want to get a sense of the scale of it, as Israel has said itself that it targeted some 1,600 plus locations. Take a look at this heat map, a 24-hour heat map created by NASA, which shows you areas of heat and fire across southern Lebanon.Now, not every one of these would particularly be an air strike, but it gives you a sense of the ferocity of this Israeli aerial assault on Monday. And the death toll is pretty staggering, where the Lebanese Ministry of Health says nearly 500 people, 492 people were killed in a single day. Among them, 35 children and 58 women, with more than 1,600 people injured. And to give you some context, Lynda, Lebanon has had generations of war, Civil War, incursions, invasions, occupations, the 2006 for war. The last time that for a month, Hezbollah militants and Israel fought head to head for an entire month, resulted in 1,100 people being killed on the Lebanese side of the border in a single day. Now you've had nearly half the casualties incurred by Israel's bombardment that were incurred in a month of fighting 18 years ago.",

The former president stuck to the teleprompter a good amount in the beginning of his remarks, he focused on the economy, on the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan, and hit on fracking, of course, an important issue here in Pennsylvania, but he did drift off topic as well, at one point, lamenting Johnny Carson no longer being the host of The Tonight Show, complaining about the moderators of the last debate and also criticizing vice president Kamala Harris for her interview with Oprah recently. But the supportive crowd here, they really ate up a lot of what the former president was saying here, including when he spent time talking specifically about immigration. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She's been in office for three and a half years. She's saying what she's going to do if she becomes president, but she's been there almost four years.
