And later, a surprising look at what happens when a Republican longshot, Vivek Ramaswamy goes looking for support in a sea of Trump voters. Good evening, John King here, in for Anderson tonight, and starting us off, the former president gets a date. It's one he had been hoping would be never. And as we will detail tonight, he's still trying to put it off past the next election. But today, federal judge, Aileen Cannon said Trump's trial on 37 document related felony counts could begin as early as the 20th of next May, with a preliminary hearing the week before. His lawyers wanted it postponed indefinitely. Special Counsel Jack Smith was asking for this December. Splitting the difference, Judge Cannon also had to thread her way between three other federal and state, civil, and criminal trials the former president is facing this October, next January, and then again in March. CNN's Paula Reid joins us now live with the very latest. Paula, what can you tell us about this trial date the judge has now set.",

But John, she also in her order included a very detailed schedule, everything that has to happen between now and a trial and it is easy to see how this could slip if a few of those deadlines are delayed. And today, the Trump team said they are confident they'll be able to push this back until after the election. Now, right now it's unclear if this will happen before after the election, but most experts I speak with, John, they say they do not expect this to happen this year.",

It's a trial date that's later than the prosecution wanted. It's after most of the Republican primaries or the most important ones, but it is before the general election. And she very clearly said in her order that she didn't see any reason why she couldn't set a schedule now, including the fact that the defendant was currently running for president. She didn't see that as a reason why she couldn't set a schedule. So I took it as a very positive sign in light of the context and the prior rulings that you just mentioned, which had raised real concerns about whether she was affording preferential treatment to former President Trump.

They are about a criminal president of the United States who attempted a coup, who tried to take over the legitimate functions of government by staging a coup so that his lawfully elected successor could not take office. What we have, Bob and I wrote in the 50th anniversary edition of \"All the President's Men,\" a new foreword largely about the criminal president, Richard Nixon; and the criminal president, Donald Trump, and the greatest danger is obviously from Trump. What is he? He is the first seditious president in the history of the United States. A president who attempted to foment an insurrection to stop the legitimate transfer of power and functioning of the United States government. Listen to what Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader said on that day after January 6, that only one person was morally and practically responsible for this insurrection, Donald Trump. So let's keep our eye on the facts, as Bob said, and what it is about. The Republican Party, which historically has done the right thing in the moment of Joe McCarthy, the great demagogue, did the right thing in Watergate, forced Richard Nixon from office. Are they going to allow an insurrectionist seditious president to carry our democracy into a terrible, horrible place where it has never gone?",

All the musicians were in there with us. You'll notice also we didn't have any headphones on. He liked to hear everything just in the room. We had a few little speakers in there, but otherwise he just wanted to hear it as we were doing it and couldn't think of a more fitting lyric than that one you just played for the way that he embraced life, embraced music and embraced the way that he worked with other artists.",

You know, sometimes they say, don't meet your heroes because you don't want to be disappointed.In the case of Tony Bennett, I just had a feeling, and was absolutely correct, that he was going to be one of the kindest souls that I'd ever collaborate with. He knew the power that he had and the influence that he had on younger singers. And he took that influence with such an enormous amount of grace and gratitude. And, you know, one of the first things I asked him when I stepped into the room with him, because he knew that I was nervous. We all -- no matter where we are in life, to stand in a room at a microphone with him is nerve wracking. I just, you know, he asked a lot of questions about, you know, what drives me, where my passions are, and I asked him the same thing. And at the time that I recorded that with him, and he was in his 80s, he said, you know, I get up and I'm still -- I still have the fire to find new things, to find new places to put my voice, to find new ways to interpret songs, new songs, old songs. He never stopped wanting to be a student. And so I think one of the things is for somebody that felt very much like a student in that moment, to know that the teacher in that moment also had that spark to keep learning was something that I'll carry on with me forever.",

In Tony's case, it's his musical memory, his ability to be a performer, those are an innate and hardwired part of his brain.
