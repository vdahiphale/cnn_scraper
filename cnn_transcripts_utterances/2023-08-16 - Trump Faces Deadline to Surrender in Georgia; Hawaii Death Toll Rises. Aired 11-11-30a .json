The death toll this morning is up to 106 people killed, but only about a third of the fire zone has been searched by recovery crews. The governor says, until now, most of the remains were found along the seaside road. And, today, they will be shifting their focus to begin searching homes. On Monday, President Biden, we have now learned, will see this all -- all of this damage firsthand. He and the first lady will travel to Maui to see what's left behind and also speak with survivors who have clearly lost everything. On the investigation into how this all started,there is still no official cause of these fires. There are a lot of questions, though, remaining about whether power lines could have played a role. CNN has new video in that may show the moment a power line essentially explodes and, moments later, flames are seen. Take a look at this, but a note, this video was taken on another part of the islands separate from the fire that destroyed Lahaina. The video was captured at a bird sanctuary on Monday, August 7. After a few seconds, you would see, a white flash is seen. You will see the white flash, and then we have paused it so you can see it a little more clearly very clear. In the following moments, the camera pans around. Then, minutes later, you can see the flames in the distance. We have highlighted -- highlighted it there. The video was first reported by \"The Washington Post.\" Hawaiian Electric, Maui's main power company, released a statement to questions put in by \"The Washington Post\" saying this: \"We know -- we know there is speculation about what started the fires and we, along with others, are working hard to figure out what happened.\" CNN's Mike Valerio on the main road into Lahaina, he's joining us now. Today, that road will be open to the general public, Mike. But, after seeing all these images, what is that going to mean for the public now?",

You can see this is the before, but look at the after. Look at the after. That area is just gone. And we have a side-by-side look at it right now. Again, this is that neighborhood before. Over here, you can see it's just completely gone. We have another view we can show you, and this is a view from the port side. You can see these buildings with the green roofs there.

We have seen some of this video that \"The Washington Post\" put out showing a spark, it appears, from a power line and then fire not long after that in one part of Maui.

Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, he isn't talking about turning himself in. What he's focused on now, it seems, is trying to get his case moved out of Georgia and into federal court. Either way, it seems clear a lot could happen between now and August 25, which is the deadline to surrender for all of them.

We did reach out to the sheriff's office. They told me, so far, none of the defendants had turned themselves in. They put out a statement saying that the jail is open 24/7, so anyone can turn themselves in at any time. Meanwhile, we're getting a taste of a potential defense strategy for the former president. His former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has filed a formal petition with his attorneys, arguing that he should get his case removed from state court and into federal court instead, those attorneys arguing that anyone who is accused or charged with actions that they allegedly took while they were working as a federal official should have their criminal proceedings heard before a federal court. And here is what they're saying in part of that filing: \"Nothing Mr. Meadows is alleged in the indictment to have done is criminal, per se, arranging Oval Office meetings, contacting state officials on the president's behalf, visiting a state government building and setting up a phone call for the president. One would expect the chief of staff to the president of the United States to do these sorts of things.\" Meadows says that he's going to file a formal longer complaint at a later date.
