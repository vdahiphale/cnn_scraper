      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to have you with us and no time for a Friday feeling today. In fact,I don't know where to start. We certainly need more than two eyes this morning, one eye on strong U.S. jobs numbers. But I have to say they'll keep us guessing, however, on what the Federal Reserve does next. I'll explain shortly because the other eye is watching the drama playing out in California where a lender to the tech industry known as SVB financial, that's going to happen a few times remains under severe stress amid significant deposit outflows. Now take a look at these shares at the firm tumbling more than 60 percent pre market before the shares were suspended. And that followed a similar 60 percent plunge on Thursday. I'll explain too, if we can what's happening there shortly to. Now I think the key point here is its just one bank. And it's a bank that relied heavily on the tech sector for deposits that we know are struggling more broadly and this is key. But I have to say its plight has spooked what feels like the entire financial sector. And it sorts of plays into many of those worst case scenario fears like broader financial instability in a rising interest rate environment, because we still have too high inflation. And that's an even more pronounced pickle for the Federal Reserve to be in. But just to be clear, we aren't anywhere near that yet. There are fears, that SVB might be a sign of broader banking problems triggered a sharp pullback in some of the major U.S. averages on Thursday. In fact, the full biggest U.S. banks losing more than $50 billion in market cap during the session. For now, futures are turning mostly higher, a big improvement from where we were a few hours ago. Thanks to those just released jobs numbers. I can give you a look at Europe too, though European banking stocks are still seeing a sharp pullback, a case perhaps some investors playing catch up with the U.S. price action on Thursday. Now the question is, is this all an overreaction tied to the issues at one bank? The irony here, of course is that 24 hours ago, we were discussing the absolute resilience of the U.S. economy and the need for even higher Federal Reserve interest rates. So my view calm heads perhaps are required at this moment and keeping that third eye on the fundamentals, which remains strong. Now the jobs numbers show the U.S. adding a stronger than expected 311,000 jobs last month. The devil however, is in the detail that headline number, though, at least argues that the Federal Reserve does need to press on with interest rate hikes. The big question, will bank stress give Powell pause about moving more aggressively in the future? We're going to answer some of these questions over the next hour. I hope you're still with me. Someone who is with me though, Matt Egan he joins us now. Matt, great to have you with us! Good luck explaining all of this. The CEO of SVB reportedly urging everyone to stay calm, as the company works through its funding crisis. Let's just take a step back help us understand what's happening and why investors got spooked in the last 24 hours?",

So in anenvironment where you've got concerns with one specific bank, but then everyone looks at them in the situation and says, Oh, dear. But we're in a situation where the Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates, because inflation is too high. They have to continue to do that. But if we've got a situation where there's problems in the banking sector, now, what do they do, and I feel like we made all of those jumps in the space of one trading session, and we need to actually have calm heads and cooler heads prevail. And the key word that you use, there was diversification, because this bank was so directly connected to your point Silicon Valley to venture capitalists. All their deposits were taken, or the majority of their deposits were taken from the sector. And when we talk about job losses and challenges and valuations dropping, it's all really based in the tech sector. So we're seeing shaking for one bank. And I don't think we can translate what we're seeing for this bank across the broader sector. Particularly if we compare it to the financial crisis, and the sheer extent of regulation of oversight, stress test, Matt, that you often talk about, that the banking sector now receives, would you agree?",

But we really haven't seen any major, major cracks in the credit markets or in the financial markets until maybe now. But to your point, some of this may be an over-reaction, you know, investors are jumping to the next logical conclusion about what banks could be under pressure as well. Even though a lot of these banks have different business models, they have different customer bases. And so they're not all the same. But one thing I should note here, Julia is there's already some talk about whether or not the government should have to step in here to provide some support. A billionaire investor, Bill Ackman, he was tweeting about how he thinks the government needs to prop up SVB bank here by maybe trying to protect depositors because of how central the tech community is to the economy. He said on Twitter, the risk of failure and deposit losses here is that the next least well capitalized bank bases a run and fails and the dominoes continue to fall.",

That's some 100,000 jobs net higher than Wall Street was looking for. But and it's a significant one, wage growth actually came in weaker than expected and the unemployment rate rose.

But when you look at sectors like retail, when you look at sectors like leisure and hospitality, which are lower wage jobs, we're still seeing gains there and we're still seeing wages moderate.

But in any case last night, he came into the place their Kingdom Hall as they call it, where they were having a meeting last evening, just after that meeting, he started this attack. He had with him, semi-automatic pistol, and he fired 9 magazines have shots. According to the Security Official, this is not something that is a terrorist related.

Yes, jobs growth is really strong and really solid. And we saw that accompanied with moderation and earnings, but the composition of those earnings has changed over the course of the last six months. It's much more dominated by low paying jobs when we look at ADP at our payroll numbers, and we pay about 25 million workers in the United States. And we account for this composition effect; we still see that the moderation and wage growth is very, very slight. It's very modest.

They can't find the talent, but there is some sense that this is easing. It's a little easier to find talent than it was six months ago. So that's good news, even though it's still hard.

Simply because the challenge, again, of rehiring, and perhaps paying people more when you try and get them back is a huge concern, too.

Those are very interest rate sensitive sectors, and we saw a decline in manufacturing jobs. And so we're not going to see the sectors of the economy move in lockstep. And that's going to be a challenge in interpreting these job numbers. Also, we're not in the same, even though the unemployment rate is similar as it was pre pandemic, the jobs market is quite different. It's much tighter, and there are many more job openings. And so that reluctance to let go of workers, you see that in our signals of layoffs are still below pre pandemic levels.

And so if you fast forward it, some of those challenges have not gone away, it's still very hard to find childcare, and that childcare has gotten even more expensive than it was before the pandemic. So that means that many married women with children are staying out of the labor market, and even proportionately single women have advanced into the labor market. But overall, that advancement of women in the workplace has not resulted in a narrowing of pay gaps and I think that's what's the most disappointing. We love to see an inclusive economy because that economy means that it's more positioned for growth. So the more women in the economy, the - but if that comes at the expense of wages, it's problematic and so there's still some more work to do to close these wage gaps.",

But the key word when it comes to the U.S. banking industry is resiliency. And this is night and day versus the global financial crisis from 15 years ago, and then banks were taking excessive risks and people thought everything was fine. Now everyone's concerned. But underneath the surface, the banks are more resilient than they've been in a generation. So that's resiliency of the balance sheets with the quality of their loans, resiliency of the business models with the additional capabilities from technology, and yes, resiliency of funding. And the funding is much more diversified. And banks can either have core funding and those are savings accounts and checking accounts. Or they can have overnight borrowings what I call hot money, money that can leave in a nanosecond and that hot money is what really brought down the failure of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. That's been reduced by over half in the last 15 years. So you have much more resiliency in the funding. And so, you know, if you have money in the bank, its fine. This is not a liquidity issues, not a solvency issue. Banks are not about to fail and mass, this is not the global financial crisis 2.0 This might be an earnings event, it could be a stock event, but it's not anything bigger than that at the moment.",

We're going to have to see as this plays out, you know, any bank can discretionary, say, hey, we're goingto some of our assets, some of our securities, take some losses and fill the hole. So to the extent that, you know, a bank that, you know, doesn't have fraud, doesn't have excessive leverage, doesn't have bad loans, chooses to take an action and has this sort of backlash is something we're going to have to look at after the fact. So that seems to be more of a one off. And if you take a discretionary move like this, and you don't have a good reaction, then the other banks won't take that discretionary move. But I think over seeing all of this, you have to say, you know, thank you, regulators, for all the moaning about regulation. The regulators are on top of this. So at least if you're a depositor, or if you're a creditor, or if you're the government or a taxpayer, you can say, all right, I don't have to worry about the banking system functioning. Banks should be like, when you turn on the water every day. The water should come through the faucet, you should be able to turn on your lights in your house, and likewise, your bank should always be there. That was not the case 15 years ago with the global financial crisis that is the case now. And each year, the banks, the largest banks are subject to a stress test that, you know, in my view, the stress test is the combination of the last three recessions combined. And banks have to pass a scenario like that, before they can even increase their dividend or anything like that. So once again, the key word here is resiliency. And look, this is not a zero defect industry, you know, the banks and the overseers. Look, they try to make no mistakes. But if you're going to take risks, there's going to be mistakes, there's going to be losses, and there are going, in some cases be failures. So that's just part of coughs during the business. And that part of having, you know, the capital markets and the economy, the way we function, and you have a $20 trillion economy, and the banks have the heart of that.

And it just seems to power on and the tailwind for the global travel industry will be getting China reopening Asia Pacific. People want to travel and our consumer research shows that travel is one of the last discretionary spending items that people will stop doing.

And the team is doing extraordinary job share some data points. Chinese New Year was that to 90 percent of 2019 levels. And I just talked to the team the other day and looking at January and February for the market travels back to 96 percent of 2019 levels. So it's a phenomenally resilient market. And that's pretty much all domestic because if you think about air lift capacity into China, it's probably only around 10 percent. And it's going to take time to come back. Those planes have been mothballed. Those pilots have been furloughed, potentially. So it's going to take a while to bring it back. So the Chinese are traveling, they're traveling in China. But the international inbound and the international outbound is going to take time to recover and so the Chinese market probably won't fully recover until 2024, maybe beginning of 2025. But it's going to get pretty close in 2023, given the strength we're seeing so far.",

So the Chinese consumer wants to travel internationally, and those that are actually staying much longer. So they're doing much longer trips out of China, because they haven't been able to leave for three years. And so they may be seeing family in other parts of the world or so forth. But definitely they want to travel and then that's going to be a great tailwind for many, many international markets as that reopens and they get out of China. Interestingly, Hong Kong is beginning to boom, again. Because the Chinese have enabled the Mainland China travelers to go with just their Chinese ID card versus passport. So we're seeing China travel flood back into Hong Kong, which is fantastic. That market was really hard hit through COVID and lock downs.",

But the great thing about our business is we're able to price on a daily basis. And so we saw our average rates rise significantly around the world, particularly in the leisure segment. So give you some data points, leisure up 14 percent in rate, business, travel up 7 percent groups meetings and events up 7 percent and rate too. And so while we are seeing inflationary pressure on wages, which are coming off now, we're able to price for that and really be able to drive performance in our hotels, and really make sure we can protect the profits of our owners and our franchisees.",
