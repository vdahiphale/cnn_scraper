Do they have the votes on the House floor? There is the narrowest of margins right now in this body. That means that Republican leaders are going to have a tough time convincing every single one of their members to get behind these two articles of impeachment. But that work has already begun. Right before I joined you guys, I was just finishing up talking to Chairman Mark Green. He said that he is continuing to have conversations. He's continuing to do the work that he needs to do in order to get the votes. When I asked him and pressed him if he could guarantee those votes would be there, he said he doesn't know at this moment, but he said he does believe his committee is doing the right thing. Meanwhile, you do have Mayorkas hitting back, saying that he has done his job to the best of his ability, that the immigration crisis on the southern border is nothing new. He's also arguing that if House Republicans wanted to do something on immigration reform, there is an emerging package waiting for them across the Capitol in the United States Senate. Of course, we haven't seen text for that legislation, but that is something that he says is an option. Meanwhile, most House Republicans rejecting that emerging deal out of hand. John?",

And you have to remember as well that there are Iranian assets that are outside of Iran's borders as well, including Iranian personnel in Iraq and Syria that could be targeted, Iran-backed Iranian warehouses and weapons storage facilities in these countries that could be fair game for the United States. But it's a really delicate balance that they have to weigh here. And according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the response might not be all in one day. It might be, quote, multi-leveled, common stages, and be sustained over time. So, this is likely to be a much more powerful response that we see from the administration in contrast to previous strikes that had been more narrow and targeted, but still they are still very wary, of course, of getting into a larger conflict that could embroil the U.S. in the Middle East in a larger war.",

As we said for the first time since the 1800s, the House is moving forward with impeaching a U.S. cabinet secretary.Let's go inside the House Homeland Security Committee. This is the chair, Mark Green. REP. MARK GREEN (R-TN):  -- roundtable on the border that our Democrat colleagues refuse to attend, burying their heads in the sand as if there wasn't a crisis. We held many hearings at the subcommittee and full committee level, and we heard from a variety of witnesses, including former senior DHS enforcement officials, state's attorneys general, the victims of Secretary Mayorkas' crisis, Democrats have consistently claimed these hearings were a waste of time. Tell that to the families of 150,000 Americans who died from fentanyl poisoning in '21 and '22 alone. We have also submitted dozens of requests for information to the department. Many of these have been stonewalled. At every turn, our Democrat colleagues have met these oversight efforts with mockery. They labeled a recent committee hearing with a mother who lost her son to fentanyl poisoning as, quote, Republican border hearing number 746. And when we heard from a mother who had lost her daughter to fentanyl poisoning and another mother whose daughter was brutally raped and murdered by an illegal alien MS-13 gang member, the minority labeled the hearing a sham on their website. Are they actually saying these things never occurred? What a slap in the face. During that same hearing, one member from across the aisle even went so far as to lecture the mom who had lost her daughter to fentanyl, claiming that she was being used and didn't have the background to understand the issues before this Congress. On the contrary, this brave American mother who lost her daughter because of our open border is more qualified to speak on this issue than any of us here today. For almost a year, committee Democrats have turned a blind eye to the victims of the border crisis while berating us for spending what they believed was too much time investigating Secretary Mayorkas' handling of the border. Let me repeat that. Democrats have berated us over and over for spending too much time investigating Secretary Mayorkas' border crisis. Keep that in mind when you hear them claim today that this impeachment is somehow rushed. [10:10:00] The truth is that this process has been painstakingly thorough. We made sure of it. Our intent was to be fair, comprehensive and meticulous. Unlike House Democrats, we take the use of impeachment extremely seriously. I am proud of the work my Republican colleagues have put in through our five-phase investigation. We have uncovered a lot. Phase one of our investigation documented multiple laws, court orders and rulings that Secretary Mayorkas disregarded, ignored or abused, and that dozens of times he has been dishonest with both Congress and the American people. In phase two, we learned that Secretary Mayorkas' actions and unlawful policies have surrendered control of the southwest border to the drug cartels and enriched the cartels to the tune of $13 billion per year just from human smuggling alone. The national security implications are dire. More than 300 individuals on the terrorist watch list have been caught crossing the southwest border. In phase three, we documented the devastating human costs of the border crisis, the fentanyl epidemic.",

You have some Republicans, including Nikki Haley, who is running for president, demanding retaliation against Iran itself.

      "sentences": "Sara, that would be very possible if in fact that is the route that's taken. I mean, I have to say that sitting on this side of the Atlantic, much closer to where the war zone is, it sounds extraordinary, as many of the commentators here have said, to see all these people in the United States baying for another war in the Middle East. And that is what is it.If they want to call on the Biden administration to strike another country in the Middle East, a sovereign state, not out-of-state actors, like the Houthis or various militia groups and the like, that is a massive escalation and you just don't know where that's going to end. And notice who has been quiet on this, and that is, as it's been reported and noted, the MAGA crowd, right? They're not yelling for this because nor is Donald Trump, because they don't want to see this, they're much more isolationist in that regard. And Trump himself didn't do that, even under great pressure, even when there were attacks. He did, in the end, end up killing the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Quds Force, as we all know, Qassem Soleimani, in response to certain attacks on Americans, but did not attack Iran itself. So, in 43 years since the Islamic Republic, there has been no direct U.S. hit on Iran. This would be huge. However, clearly, the president needs to do something to make it clear that the United States will not tolerate the killing of its personnel. The only thing is that right now, as you've seen for the last several weeks, the U.S. and its ally, Britain, both with extremely capable air forces and weapons systems, have been targeting the Houthi militias in Yemen. That has not worked. So, you have to put this in context about what you're trying to achieve, what is doable, what's proportional, and what kind of signal you're trying to send.",

You are listening to Ranking Member Bennie Thompson with his response to the Republicans.REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS):  -- grounds for impeachment. Indeed, no official in American history has ever been convicted after impeachment for a refusal to follow the law. These disputes are settled in the court system, not through impeachment. Apparently, Republicans are upset. They lost in court and are trying to re-litigate their cases through impeachment. The Constitution does not allow that. Breach of public trust requires conduct intended to serve an official's own benefit or the benefit of a foreign power. No serious person can allege that Secretary Mayorkas' action meet the standard for breach of public trust under the Constitution. Nevertheless, throughout this truncated impeachment process, Republicans have ignored the facts and misrepresented the law to justify their scheme. But the law is clear, and so is the secretary's record. He's leveraged a full range of authorities at his disposal while stretching the resources provided by Congress to secure the border. He has removed record levels of migrants detained by more people than Congress has provided funding for and prevented record levels of fentanyl from entering our communities. Constitutional law experts agree the secretary has not committed any impeachable offense. Rather, he has faithfully implemented the administration's border policies, policies Republicans apparently disagree with. But policy differences are not impeachable. House Republicans' impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas accomplishes nothing, which would be consistent with their abysmal record this Congress. At a hearing before the committee this month, Constitutional Scholar Professor Deborah Perlstein said, quote, no branch of government has more power under our Constitution to address matters of border security than Congress, unquote. At every opportunity, Republicans have turned their backs on legislation to provide resources to the Department of Homeland Security. In doing so, they are turning their backs on border agents and officers. If House Republicans were serious about improving conditions along the border, they would provide the department the funding necessary to do so. They have not. If House Republicans were serious about improving conditions at the border, they would negotiate border security legislation with the White House and the Senate. They have not. Instead, they sit on their hands as a bipartisan group of senators worked with the Biden administration to hammer out a deal. The extreme MAGA Republicans who are running the House of Representatives are deeply unserious people. They don't want progress. They don't want solutions.",
