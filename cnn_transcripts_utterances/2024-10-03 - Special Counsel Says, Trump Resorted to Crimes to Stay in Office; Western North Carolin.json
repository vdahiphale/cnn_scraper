Houses crushed by trees as power poles dangerously lay across lines. Coming up, I'll speak with people in charge of a food bank and an animal shelter who are still helping their communities even as they recover.Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. But we begin this morning with new evidence from special counsel Jack Smith's office. The unsealed brief weighing in at more than 165 pages provides perhaps the clearest picture yet of Smith's 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump and comes less than five weeks before Election Day. Trump is already sounding off on the new filing. More on that in a moment. But let's go straight to CNN's Zach Cohen. Zach, a lot to unpack, 165 pages, what does it tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. Jack Smith is really laying out why he believes Donald Trump should still face criminal charges even after the U.S. Supreme Court granted him limited immunity for those actions deemed under his official duties as president, right? But Jack Smith is arguing here that Trump attempts to overturn the 2020 election, that those all -- he carried those out under a personal and a private capacity that he was acting as a candidate, not as president.And Jack Smith lays out some additional evidence here and some evidence we hadn't seen before in sort of making this case, this post- Supreme Court ruling case. And some of that evidence deals with Donald Trump's communications and interactions with then-Vice President Mike Pence. We obviously know Mike Pence is a key part of these charges against Donald Trump. And Jack Smith again alleges that Trump tried to pressure Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election and goes into what Donald Trump allegedly was trying to do on January 6th when he sent that now infamous tweet, right, saying Mike Pence did not have the courage to overturn the results. Jack Smith writes, quote, it was at that point alone watching news in real time and with knowledge that rioters had breached the Capitol building that the defendant issued the 2:24 P.M. tweet attacking Pence for refusing the defendant's entreaties to join the conspiracy and help overturn the results of the election. It goes on to cite a witness who told prosecutors that when Trump was informed that Mike Pence was being evacuated from the Capitol, his response was, quote, so what? So, that sort of gives you a sense of the tone of this. of the allegations in this new filing. It also goes through some additional evidence and what witnesses told prosecutors during the course of this investigation as well. It refers to an interview or a conversation between Steve Bannon, somebody we've identified as Steve Bannon, and Donald Trump one day before the January 6th riot. And shortly before Donald Trump tweeted the, be there and be wild tweet as well. And then it also gets into how Donald Trump was communicating directly with Republican legislators at these various states that the Trump team was targeting as they tried to overturn the election results. In one witness interview, it talks about an interaction with Governor Ducey of Arizona. Governor Ducey asked Donald Trump directly to provide proof of the widespread voter fraud that he was alleging and he says, quote, but the defendant never did. So, that's another key part of the allegations. Jack Smith is making that Trump knew he lost the election and tried to overturn the results.",
