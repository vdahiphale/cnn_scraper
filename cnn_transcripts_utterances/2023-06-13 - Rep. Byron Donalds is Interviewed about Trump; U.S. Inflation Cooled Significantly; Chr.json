So that stuff is being leaked to the press. CNN, you guys picked it up first, and it's gone on from there. I don't know the context of that audio. And even in this conversation, I don't know the context of that because an indictment is a one-sided argument. That is all it is. And that's why you actually have full -- a full proceeding in front of a judge where a defense counsel gets to go back and forth.I think from a political perspective, the way a lot of Republicans and, frankly, a lot of Americans are looking at this is, they basically say, well damn, if you're Donald Trump, they're going to come get you for anything. But if you're Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, they're going to investigate very, very slowly, and let's see where it actually ends up. That is not good for the United States of America.",

When the clock strikes midnight, it turns back into a pumpkin. You're supposed to deal with that before you leave often, and with good reason. You have a transition period.Number two, the Department of Justice has assigned the role of this prosecution to the special counsel. They don't have to go back to the White House Council or any conversation with President Biden's office or the White House Counsel on this - in this issue to decide what to do next. That would essentially be saying and confirming that this, in fact, was some political probe. Jack Smith's entire role is to make sure that there is not just a ten foot pole, but a really long pole and total separation from what they're doing. Now, that perception is very king (ph), though, and I know, perception really much is king. But, finally, when you're talking about this, you really have to grapple with what this prosecution team has to confront, and that is there is the indictment, there is the singular focus of what the allegations are with respect to Donald Trump, but Hillary Clinton will be a part of this conversation. You'll have Joe Biden as a part of the conversation. Mike Pence as a part of the conversation. The distinction will have to be, what was the reaction and behavior of those different entities when they were told specifically, in no uncertain terms, under the law or otherwise, you are not authorized to have these documents, we want them back.

I think he pretty well captured the Republican zeitgeist right now.And there's a different between legal exoneration and political exoneration. And what he is doing is prosecuting the public case for a political exoneration. You're hearing the concerns about Jack Smith. It's absolutely true on the Bob McDonald case. And a lot of Republicans have been mad about that case for a long time. Number two, he talked about the fact that there's no trust with a one- sided argument. I mean you're -- if you talk to the average Republican right now, if you said, hey, the Justice Department says this or the FBI says that, immediately they're going to say, oh, well, consider - consider the source. There's just no trust. And when he is saying there's a one-sided argument and you don't know everything that Donald Trump might say, that's going to give a lot of Republicans something to hang their hat on. Now, why is that important? Because it may be forever before - or never that we actually get to a trial for them to put on an actual defense. So, the public political exoneration of part of this is so vital because it protects them from having to deal with the facts of what is in the actual indictment. I think you're going to continue to hear attacks on Jack Smith. I'm hearing that ramp up more and more. And, you know, Donalds, of course, is one of the leading surrogates for Donald Trump. I expect to see him out there more and more.

I think there's two things notable in what we just heard, because I've heard them before, which is, one, it was a factual misstatement of what the Presidential Records Act says. To everybody that we've advised this morning to go read the 49-page indictment, I say, go read the Presidential Records Act. You Google it. It's right there. It doesn't say that. It is actually crystal clear, which is, the president's records, at the stroke of 12 noon, when the new president is sworn in, becomes the property of the government, and there's no license to have two years to kind of go through them. That doesn't exist.The second part is, the Biden/Pence comparison, they had classified documents, why -- the core of this case, if you read the indictment, is the obstructive efforts to hide, conceal and thwart the ability to enforce the National Archives' abilities to get those records back.

That is 11 months in a row of cooling prices that you can call this significantly cooling price pressures here.Month-over-month up just 0.1 percent. So that is a two-year low for inflation. That inflation reading, right? This is - this is really an important milestone to get back in that - that -- down to 4 percent. And when you look at the trend, you can see that inflation has been cut in half from that 40-year high of 9.1 percent last summer. Eleven months in a row now of a decline in inflation pressures. So, where are people paying more? What is driving it? Shelter, used cars and trucks were the two biggest categories. This is still, guys, by the way, twice what the Fed would like to see. It would like to see more like 2 percent. But I think this gives the Fed some room to pause potentially. That's what a lot of economists think, the Fed will pause and not raise interest rates this week as they wait to see whether all of that work that it's done is starting to cool the inflation story, guys.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I want you to take a look at this trend line on favorable view of the FBI and compare Democrats versus Republicans.Go back to 2015. Seventy percent of Democrats had a favorable view of the FBI, 70 percent of Republicans. Jump ahead to 2023. Democrats have stayed pretty steady, right, at 65 percent. Look at Republicans, though, dropped all the way down to just 38 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of the FBI. Talk about the Justice Department, favorable view of the Justice Department. Look, in 2015, Democrats like the Justice Department under Barack Obama. Republicans didn't. We go ahead to now, look, those numbers have stayed about the same. They didn't like it under a Democratic president eight years ago. They don't like it now. But those voters are very much emblematic of how Republicans feel about both those agencies.",

Back in 2015, Democrats were far more favorable towards the judicial branch than Republicans, 66 percent to 42 percent. Jump ahead now to 2022. Look how much more favorable Republicans are. Sixty-six percent have a great or fair deal amount of trust, versus just 25 percent of Democrats.And the CIA. Trump has done after a lot of former CIA heads. Look at this, back in 2015, Democrats and Republicans, about the same, a favorable view of the CIA. Today, Republicans, far lower, just 37 percent compared to 54 percent of Democrats.",
