And we are following two major international stories this afternoon. The first of them out of Israel where the U.S. and Jordan have conducted more humanitarian aid drops into Gaza. And the first equipment to build a temporary port in Gaza for aid is now en route to that region. We're going to get to more on that in just a moment. We will begin in Haiti, where the U.S. military has evacuated nonessential personnel from the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince. The airlift operation was ordered as the gang violence in that island nation worsens. Gang leaders are now threatening civil war if the prime minister does not leave office. And now Haiti is under a state of emergency until April 3. CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt is joining us by phone and CNN's Patrick Oppmann is live from Cuba with the latest details. Alex, let's start first with you. Tell us more about this evacuation. ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, Jessica significant concern growing about what's happening in Haiti as this evacuation is due to what the embassy in Port-au-Prince in the capital is calling heightened gang violence in the neighborhood near the U.S. embassy compounds and near the airport. And that according to their social media post, led to this decision to send home the nonessential personnel from the embassy, which we should note is still open, still functioning. This evacuation was an air lift on a military aircraft carried out by the U.S. military, specifically by U.S. Southern Command. They're also stepping up security at the embassy. So (INAUDIBLE) operations can continue. And just as you noted, Haiti and its capital has seen this wave of significant violence highly coordinated gang attacks on law enforcement and state institutions like police stations, thousands of inmates have been released from at least two prisons. And this gang leader, prominent gang leader, saying that the goal is to overthrow the government led by the Prime Minister Ariel Henry and warned that if he doesn't step down, there will be a civil war that will end in genocide. Now, Henry, the prime minister, is believed to be in Puerto Rico right now. He had been in Kenya to sign an agreement for a multinational mission to restore security that was due to be led by Kenya. And the U.S. is now calling for an urgent movement towards a political transition, essentially for the prime minister to step aside. But the Biden administration is not saying that. the U.S. wants to see that Kenyan-led multinational security mission in place to, among other things, support the local security forces, the local national police. And then Jessica, for new elections eventually take place, Jessica.",

But you had a protest outside with people throwing flaming objects into the embassy. And so you are starting to see a wave above of embassies and diplomats taking people out however they can. I was talking to a diplomat last week in Port-au-Prince who said that they always have stockpiles of food and water. But now they are running low because this crisis has been going on for so long. Clearly the Haitian police force are overwhelmed by the gangs as gangs control more and more of the city and the country. [14:05:00] OPPMANN: And there is a growing fear both within -- within Haiti and with outside that it's just a matter of time until the gangs seize control of this country and actually manage to take over a place like -- like an embassy, like the airport, like the national palace, and simply this police force, the little security that remains. It's just a question of time if they do not receive reinforcement soon.",

We have hospitals in Port-au-Prince that's part of the embassy, by the way. They were awakened this morning by the helicopters of the U.S. marines. So it's still possible to work.

We live in a very polarized era, we have for a couple of decades and voters don't move from red to blue very often. There are again, small pockets and they matter a lot. But by and large, I would expect a lot of those Republicans who voted for Haley to move over to Trump in the general election. They will come home. That's what happened in 2016, despite a lot of speculation of would there be Republicans voting for Democrats? And I think that's going to happen again today.

We're talking about something that's less than 120 feet long, though it'll tow behind it a small barge also loaded up with aid. We're talking about things like rice, beans, lentils, canned goods -- the absolute essentials that people need to survive. And it's being organized by the World Central Kitchen. People will know that obviously because of celebrity chef Jose Andres that started it. It is well-known in disaster zones and in war zones across the world, including in Gaza, where it has a sizable footprint and almost 400 local employees. What's really needed here though is some maritime expertise to get it there. So they're working with an NGO called Open Arms and the ship that they're using would normally be used to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, not for delivering aid. And the precise details of where exactly it's going to land, when it's going to land -- they're being kept under wraps for obvious security concerns. Not only is there a war happening there, but you can imagine the number of desperate people who may want to try to board that ship or tried to get the aid more quickly. And so you can imagine the chaos that may ensue. World Central Kitchen says that it is building a jetty in order to get the aid from the ship to the actual shoreline. But what it's going to be built up, how long it will need to be -- these are all still very much question marks. And this is separate as well from the American effort to build this temporary pier to transport aid on a larger scale.

What can we expect to see? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this is a great effort and frankly it's one that probably should have been in place a little earlier, but that's hindsight the challenge primarily is that when this pier begins -- begins to be constructed by U.S. military personnel, the key issue now becomes security. I mean, the United States will now be caught directly between efforts by Israel, efforts on the part of Hamas. And it wouldn't be surprising to see, you know, the downside could be green-on-blue type of challenges, the Israelis clearly will want to conduct their military operations. There's no reason to believe that they're going to stop. Certainly, there are efforts on hostage transfers and release the additional civilian, the NGO delivery of goods and services that we've -- that we've just seen scene is wonderful. But the challenge really becomes, how is Hamas going to look at that? And how are they going to use, inevitably, I would say, the false flag type of operations where they could attack the very hand that's trying to feed them, and then cast blame on the Israelis. And now this thing gets inflamed more. But from a very national perspective, the U.S. will be caught right in the middle of it now. These are challenges. These are conditional challenges.

And one of the first nations to recognize Israel back in the late 40s United States is again as the president indicated, is not going to abandon Netanyahu's government, maybe in the future, it may encourage the removal of Netanyahu peacefully.But the challenge is, is that the United States sees the horrific brutality of 7 October where Hamas intentionally targeted civilians. And now, there is I think an inappropriate comparison between the targeting by Israel of Hamas fighters and then the unfortunate collateral damage and the killing of Palestinians. Those are two entirely different issues here. But the United States needs to be very firm with Israel and say, look, it is long overdue, humanitarian assistance needs to pour in there. It's going to be very messy. It's not -- there's going to be a lot of spillage. This isn't going to necessarily get to the right people. And Hamas will do everything in its power to disrupt it. It will cut off its arm, its own arm. It already has. Hamas is already encouraged to the slaughter of Palestinians, so the world vilifies Israel. But the United States is wise to say, look, were going to stick by you. But let's have some very private conversations about what's acceptable behavior. And the further slaughter as a result of the targeting of Hamas, the slaughtering of Hamas, which we all should agree without being flippant, is okay. But the killing of Palestinians is now the challenge that needs to be arrested and arrival of humanitarian assistance long overdue.",
