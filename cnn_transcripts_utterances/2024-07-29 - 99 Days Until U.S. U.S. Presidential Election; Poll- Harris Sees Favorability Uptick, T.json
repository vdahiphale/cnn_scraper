Both Harris and Trump, not particularly well-liked, certainly better-liked than former President Joe Biden, but look at this, a minus 11 net point favorability rating, a minus 11 point net favorability rating.But look at where we stand right now since Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee. Her net favorability is now actually in the positive territory at plus one point. And look at Donald Trump. His net favorability has actually dropped from minus 11 points to minus 16 points. So the last week has been one in which Kamala Harris has received a load of good press, while Donald Trump, coming off of his Republican National Convention, perhaps not some necessarily good news for his vice presidential choice, J.D. Vance. And what we've seen is clear movement on this particular metric towards Kamala Harris. I think the question ultimately will be, as we get more of that horse race polling, does it translate to the ballot test? But certainly, I think Democrats would argue that this is one of Kamala Harris's best polls so far, showing her much more popular than a week ago, while Trump has fallen back a little bit. So let's take a look at those Great Lake Battleground states, because I think that this will give you an idea of how tight the race is in the Great Lake battleground states. Look at Wisconsin, a point race well within the margin of error, no clear leader. Michigan, tied. Pennsylvania, tied. And of course, these were states that post the first debate, in fact, the only debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. We saw that Trump was picking up ground in these states and holding an advantage over Joe Biden. Not the case against Kamala Harris. Why is that so important? Well, it's so important because if, if Kamala Harris can win up in these Great Lake battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, even if she were to lose in Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, of course, those Sunbelt Battleground states that Joe Biden won four years ago. Look at that. She would get to exactly 270 electoral votes. She would win the election. So the fact that she's holding her own there definitely suggests that the Great Lake battleground states are a potential pathway for her to allow Democrats to hold on to the White House.

Still over 350,000 acres just since late Wednesday. When you do the math, that roughly equates to about 50 football fields on average every single minute, so that really goes to show you how quickly it's spread. But it's not just the flames. It's also the smoke. You have a lot ofstates under air quality alerts just because of how thick that smoke is and likely to cause some problems, especially for folks that already maybe have respiratory conditions or illnesses. Now, one other thing to note, we got a brief reprieve over the weekend in terms of temperatures. That helped firefighters out a little bit, be able to bring those containment numbers up by a little bit, but it will be short-lived. Notice Sacramento here, those temperatures get right back up into the mid to upper 90s and even triple digits by the time we get to the end of the week. Now, in the eastern half of the country, the bigger concern here is actually flooding, and this threat stretches from Minnesota all the way down through Florida as we head at least through the early morning hours of Monday. Now, once we get into the back half of the day Monday and especially into the evening, the focus really becomes areas of the southeast and Ohio Valley, so places like Cincinnati, Knoxville, Charlotte, even down through Atlanta and even towards Orlando and Tampa. The thing here is that it's been so much rain over the last two weeks, now we're adding more rain on top of it. Most of these areas likely only to pick up about an extra one to three inches, but it's on top of four to eight inches that many of these areas have seen in just the last two weeks. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
