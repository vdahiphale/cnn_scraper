We're giving you a live look this morning of Perry, Florida as Hurricane Debby inches closer to making landfall on the Florida coast. The storm strengthening to a Category 1 overnight. It's been packing winds of 80 miles an hour, but it is the rain that is the issue. We're seeing some flooding along Florida's big bend coast. Debby could drop a month's worth of rain over the next few days. Several days expected to make landfall later this morning. We're going to have more on the storm's path and impacts for Americans across the region throughout the hour. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. We want to start today with politics. Kamala Harris has the biggest decision to make of her campaign so far. She's given herself just a few more hours to make it. She spent much of the weekend meeting with the top contenders for her vice-presidential pick. Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. Sources familiar with the process telling CNN it's not clear whether Harris has made up her mind yet. The full Democratic ticket will make its debut on Tuesday at a rally in the must win State of Pennsylvania. Sources also telling CNN, Harris expected to try to keep her choice a secret for as long as possible. This is a story as old as veepstakes has been a story. Her choice, of course, going to be shaped by the need to keep her campaign's momentum going. And they're going to have to balance that against trying to win voters in swing states. Maybe the same may not be. Four in 10 Democrats say Harris should choose someone from a battleground state, that someone could be Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. In recent days, Democrats have raised red flags about the popular Pennsylvania governor. This is how these things tend to go down. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman is reportedly concerned that Shapiro is too focused on his own personal ambitions. The National Women's Defense League has asked the Harris campaign to look into Shapiro's handling of a sexual harassment allegation against one of his former top aides. And pro-Palestinian groups have come out against Shapiro, citing in part, an op-ed that he wrote 30 years ago. Shapiro is trying to take this head on. Here's what he said on Friday. This was before his weekend meeting with Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  Something I wrote when I was 20? Is that what you're talking about? I was 20. Look, I have said for years, years, long before October 7th that I favor a two-state solution. Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side. The vice president has a deeply personal decision to make. She will make the right decision for her and for the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Don't expect that issue to go away, certainly. I will also say this. Stepping back, we are seeing the Democratic Party remade possibly for the next 15 years, right before our eyes. Remember, Joe Biden was always supposed to be a jump ball among the coming fight between the liberals and the kind of the more establishment, moderate faction, and whether he served two terms or one. And now, with Kamala coming in, you know, without kind of a primary and now, picking a vice president, that fight is being shaped in a way that, you know, without a primary and without kind of that battle being rage, if Kamala wins and serves two terms, you know, whomever the VP is, you're -- this is a generational battle that's happening and we don't know it yet.

So, we'll have to continue to watch that storm surge as it continues to come in. This storm also rapidly intensified in the last 24 hours again. We have another landfalling hurricane, that was a tropical storm just 24 hours ago and rapidly intensified because our ocean temperatures are near record warm. We're talking about upper 80s and low 90s. That is fuels for hurricanes, and it allows them to intensify just before landfall. And intensifying hurricane means higher storm surge and higher rain totals as well. The problem as we go into the week is going to be a slow-moving storm. When you have a tropical system that crawls, we're talking about you could even walk faster than this pace of the storm, we are going to have prolific amounts of rain along the Georgia, South Carolina coast, possibly breaking all-time records.
