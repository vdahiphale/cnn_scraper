The IDF rescues four hostages during a raid in Central Gaza. But as Israel celebrates the reunions, Palestinians mourn the lives of those killed during the operations. Details on how the mission unfolded ahead. President Joe Biden commenting on the rescue during a state visit to France. What he had to say in the role. The U.S. played. And trash talk between North and South Korea. We're live at the Demilitarized Zone with a look at how the latest tensions are unfolding. An Israeli military raid on a Palestinian refugee camp led to emotional reunions for four newly freed hostages and their families. But now, there are questions about the deadly toll of the rescue mission. Well, this was the scene at a hospital in Israel where the four hostages met with family and friends for the first time in eight months. The Israeli military released this video showing some of the reunions. The IDF says the rescued hostages are in good medical condition, but were taken to hospital for medical examination. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the former hostages and their families. He told one of them, \"We didn't give up on you for a moment.\" Well, CNN spoke with a doctor who examined the four about what they need to recover from the experience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. HAGAI LEVINE, HEAD OF HEALTH TEAM, HOSTAGES AND FAMILY FORUM: They don't need politicians visits for PR purposes. They need some quiet. They need to be able to recover, to think, to regroup, to get more into some kind of a routine. It's personal. It's dependent on the people. And, you know, I just was in the hospital when Almog visited -- his friends visited him and it was important for him to thanks his friends who were for him for the last eight months working to release him. But still, they need comfort. They need what we call a tender love and care and examine all their medical conditions, but try to get them back to life, try to get them more independent because they didn't have any control.

The hospital was overwhelmed by the injured, many of them women and children. The corridors jammed with staff trying to treat the wounded with desperate relatives begging for attention for those awaiting care. The morgue is full, the dead, some shrouded in white sheets, others still in their blood-soaked clothing were laid out on the ground surrounded by weeping and praying loved ones. The rescue operation is being lauded by Israel's friends with little, if any, reference to the Palestinian death toll, but the reaction elsewhere was one of anger. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and the E.U.'s top diplomat, Josep Borel, described reports of what he called another massacre of civilians as appalling. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Beirut.

So, the rescue operation was carried out simultaneously in both apartments. They went in there, they -- the Israeli defense forces say that they rescued Noa. They took her captors by surprise and rescued her without too much fuss. But then an intense gunfight ensued with those who were guarding the three male hostages. They managed to extricate them from the building. And as they left with the hostages, Israel says they came under intense fire, including from rocket propelled grenades. They were given further cover by airstrikes and managed to get the hostages to the waiting helicopters by the beach and then flown back to Israel for emotional reunions with their friends and family.

So, there's no let-up in terms of the pressure. I don't think it buys Netanyahu time. It may buy him a few points in the opinion polls, which have repeatedly and consistently shown that were an election to be held tomorrow that he would lose it. And I think it would also give him and other members of his governing coalition perhaps a bit of vindication from their perspective that, as they've been saying all along, it is military pressure on Hamas that will ultimately lead to the release of the hostages rather than solely negotiation. That said, the deal that President Biden announced that he said was Israel's proposal for a hostage deal and a ceasefire that would ultimately lead to a full cessation of hostilities that remains on the table, but there are still very large gaps between Israel and Hamas, and they seem to be the same gaps that have been there for months, namely that Israel wants to be able to return to fighting after a temporary ceasefire. Hamas wants guarantees of a complete end to the war, and unless they can square that circle, Anna, there is not going to be a hostage deal.",

The Palestinian -- the pro-Palestinian protesters here have prepared what they call an indictment of alleged war criminals from the U.S. and Israel. They're reading some charges here. They have judges sitting behind them on the dais there. Again, a symbolic court of justice for what they believe are war crimes committed in Israel and Gaza. Earlier, what they did was they unfurled a huge red banner symbolizing what they call a red line. They called it the people's red line, symbolizing what they believe is President Biden not sticking enough to a red line that he drew with the Israelis regarding the incursion of Rafah. So, this red banner was two miles long in 100-foot sections. It was unfurled and protesters ring the entire White House complex earlier with that banner. That banner is now on the ground here, laid in rows, but it had a lot of writing on it, messages, signatures, that was part of the visual earlier today. We've got crowds here watching now the mock trial at the ellipse here on the south side of the White House. Earlier, we did witness two statues in Lafayette Park with graffiti written on them by protesters. So, that was part of the kind of a dust up that happened earlier with police moving in and trying to get protesters off of the statue. But that didn't last very long.

When the two leaders delivered statements together, those statements reflected the closeness of the alliance. The closeness of that bond and the areas of alignment on policies like the continued need to support Ukraine, the need to contribute to more collective defenses at NATO, as well as the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. All of those were part of the part of the statements that the president's made as well as the 13-page road map that they released following that. So, by that measure, Anna, it is safe to say that this trip was a success for both presidents. Now, the hard work is what happens now.

They want things to go back to where they were. Like in 2018, for example, the last military agreement between North and South Korea, when both sides somewhat pulled back their military presence from the DMZ. So, in terms of why we're here and what we're waiting for, it's exactly what you described at the top of our segment, we're waiting for new loudspeaker broadcast from South Korea to the other side pointed towards the North with propaganda announcements. But, you know, when we talk about propaganda announcements, these are loudspeaker broadcasts of K-pop music albums and also news reports of human rights abuses perpetrated by Kim Jong Un's regime, again, pointed in the direction of the North, in some instances audible for about 20 kilometers. So, to sound the message loud and clear. But what exactly precipitated this latest heightening of tensions are the photos that we have new this morning of 80 trash balloons reaching the Seoul area, the heart of Seoul. One balloon, there's an image, floating in the middle of the -- in the middle of this megalopolis. So, South Korea is saying, OK, well, now that you have had this response, we're going to go back to where we were in 2018 before the last military agreement, which since has been technically abandoned as a few -- as of a few days ago. So, we're here at the Gateway Unification Bridge in Paju, South Korea. This is one of the last spots, Anna, you can get you -- where you can travel to get to North Korea before you are restricted from going any further.

Now, of course, he's probably not going to listen to them, right? He hasn't listened to them all along.

As long as the United States will not be decisive enough and put some conditions to the aid of -- to Israel. As long as this aid continues to flow in an unconditioned way, Israel is free to do whatever it wants.",

My heart goes to all those demonstrators, but they don't touch the core issue, and the core issue is stopping the war. The core issue must be stopping the war. It's not the case. They want to see Netanyahu fall, and they want to see the hostages being released. Both are very important goals, but they don't call to stop the crimes, to stop the killings, to stop the war.Now, unfortunately, this camp of demonstrators is not the political base of this government and not the political base of Netanyahu. And therefore, from their point of view, this pressure is not a real pressure on them, because they are much more concerned with their political base. And let's remember, there is a majority of Israelis who wants to see this war continue. And there is a growing number -- again, growing number of Israelis who support Netanyahu and his government.

We're a little bit closer to average for those temperatures in Palm Springs at 102 degrees, about five degrees above average in Las Vegas, temperatures at 103. By Tuesday, we're going to start to find those temperatures get back up to that 110-degree mark from Phoenix to Las Vegas and Palm Springs as some of that more extreme heat continues to build. Until then, again, we're on the warm side of things. Above average, still in the 90s in Salt Lake City, triple digits in Las Vegas. Overnight lows still above average as well. Not quite giving you too much relief with those overnight temperatures in the upper 70s and low 80s. Just again, getting a little relief at night. Now, we do know that the summer season is warming since 1970 in Las Vegas. It has a 5.6-degree fever. Summer is literally hotter than it used to be. And what that looks like is more warm and above average days. We have 39 more days that are warm and above average since 1970 as the season is just more extreme and longer. That heat starts earlier and last later as we go through the summer months. Now, on the overnight temperatures, we actually find some of the biggest fevers. Since 1970, overnight temperatures are nearly 10 degrees hotter than they used to be on average. Now, that's bad news because we just don't get that relief at night after the extreme heat during the day. It would be nice to cool off and get some of that relief so we can kind of cure ourselves from some of that heat sickness at night. But with trends like this, that's just not happening. And for a lot of cities across the U.S., the overnight temperatures are warming faster than the daytime temperatures.",

And then at 2:56 p.m., two girls between the ages of 15 and 17 were also attacked.

And then, you would have to go back to 2005 when a 14-year-old girl was attacked on a boogie board 250 yards from the shore and died after being pulled under by the shark.While the risk of being bitten by a shark is extremely low, Florida tops global charts for the number of shark bites, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History's annual shark attack report.
