The fact that they are, if they are knocking down as many as they are, it surprises me because three years ago, we virtually had no counter drone capability. You just had to shoot it out of the sky.

But I think what they're watching for is he's built a really big ground game in Iowa. He talked there about how the endorsements that he's gotten in Iowa, that is something Republicans have paid attention to as kind of learning his lesson of what happened with the lawmakers in Florida that came out and endorsed Trump. And I think when it comes to Iowa, obviously everyone's going to be watching that because if he is able to beat Trump there, it'll show that Trump's support with Republicans is slipping. It'll give him a huge boost going into New Hampshire and all the states that follow that. And so I think that is what people are watching to see how he's sharpening his language against Trump.",
