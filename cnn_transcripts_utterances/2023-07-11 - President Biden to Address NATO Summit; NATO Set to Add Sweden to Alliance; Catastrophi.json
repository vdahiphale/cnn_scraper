We're going to take you to Lithuania. These are live pictures from Vilnius. Just moments from now, President Biden is set to speak at that critical NATO summit with allied leaders as the war in Ukraine rages on with no end in sight. The high-stakes meeting comes after the huge announcement that Turkey will no longer block Sweden from joining the alliance. It's a giant strategic blow to Vladimir Putin. National security adviser Jake Sullivan says the U.S. is coming into this summit with, quote, \"full\" -- \"with a full head of steam\" following the Sweden announcement. He says the allies will also discuss a path for Ukraine to possibly join NATO in the future. We're going to start with CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz. She's live on the ground there. And Arlette, what exactly heading into this high-stakes summit is the White House hoping to achieve?",

And this meeting between the two men really comes on the heels of a big win for both of them, after Turkey announced a stunning reversal to approve Sweden's accession into NATO. Turkey had been blocking Sweden's entrance into NATO for a little over a year. And the fact that Sweden will very soon be joining NATO really speaks to an expanded NATO alliance that, in part, has been driven by President Biden. Now President Biden spoke with Turkish President Erdogan as he flew from the U.S. to Europe over the weekend on Air Force One. And he made clear in that call that he wanted Sweden to be accepted into NATO as soon as possible. We are expecting to see President Biden and Erdogan hold a bilateral meeting a bit later today. But another big question facing leaders at this summit is the future of Ukraine and a possible pathway for Ukraine to one day join the NATO alliance. President Biden poured cold water on the idea of Ukraine joining the alliance at this moment as the war in Russia is ongoing. But Zelenskyy has been trying to seek some security guarantees and a clearer pathway to membership. This morning, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. and allies will be ready to send a positive signal to Ukraine when it comes to that possible membership. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: There's consensus, including from Ukraine, that the question is not Ukraine and NATO now here at Vilnius. The question is what's the pathway towards Ukraine's future membership? I think we can come to a good understanding about that here in Vilnius among all of the allies and with Ukraine. That's really what these next two days are about. And I think that's what will be reflected in the communique. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he's been very sensitive about this.But it became clear over time that he had his price. And part of the price was that Turkey is not in the European Union. It looks like they will now get an accelerated way into the European Union. The U.S. Congress was not going to release F-16s to Turkey until they approved Sweden. It now looks like he's going to get his F-16s. The other question is what other concessions were made to Turkey? Turkey is a very unusual NATO ally, because it flirts with Putin left and right. It's bought a good deal of his weapons; it's done a fair bit of trade with them. And so there's always been a lot of tension back and forth. But this was a surprise, and it was a surprise to me and Ben as well as to you, Phil. So you weren't missing anything.",

But Erdogan has done a number of things over the past few days. Releasing the Azovstal leaders. Saying publicly that Ukraine should be a member of NATO; and saying that he and Ukraine will agree to extend the Black Sea grain initiative even if Putin doesn't and that he'll use Turkish warships to escort.

It's a contradictory one. There are moments when they're on opposite sides of these issues.But it is born, essentially, of mutual need, different needs than they have with the Chinese. I think where -- the place where you're going to see this really play out may well be in the decision about what to do with Ukraine getting admitted to NATO at some point in the future. You heard Jake Sullivan say it's not going to happen now, but you also heard President Biden, in his interview with CNN last week, say to Fareed Zakaria that he had two objections. And the first objection is that Ukraine isn't ready, that it's not yet a democratic country. It hasn't gone through the reforms. But the second one was that, if you go in now during a war and bring Ukraine into NATO, then the United States is directly at war with Russia, because the core of NATO is a self -- a mutual defense pact. And that's really going to get in the way here. So you'll have President Biden, Germany opposing anything that sets too much of a time line. You're going to have the Baltic states try to say it's time for this to happen.",

And the new Swedish government changed the legislation. And there was a point -- I used to be the government security minister, and there was certainly -- you know, Sweden had a set of legislation that wouldn't really reflect the legislation we have or the United States have. So, I think they made those changes. And when they started to show the Turks they'd made actual solid recommendations, they've taken bills through Parliament, I think that helped move the Turkish a long way.

But you know, after this war, I think first of all, given we have an open-door policy, it's important to state that we believe Ukraine does belong in NATO. There are some steps that need to be met to get there. And those steps would involve the likes of making sure its military is up to standard. But we can see right now that its military is up to standard. Its military is taking on a vast superior-sized Russian force and has dealt it a heavy defeat. So I think overall, you know, Ukraine is not far off membership. But obviously, we're an alliance of, by then, 32. And everyone has to move at the same pace. But from Britain's point of view, Ukraine belongs in NATO. But we agree with the White House, we have to wait until this conflict is over.
