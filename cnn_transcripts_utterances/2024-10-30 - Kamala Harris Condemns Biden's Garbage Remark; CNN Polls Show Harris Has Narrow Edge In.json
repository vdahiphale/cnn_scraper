Well, look, I think there are two problems here for the vice president and Democrats as a whole. Number one, there's the practical implication. When the president said this, the vice president was just hundreds of yards away in front of 75,000 people delivering the start of her closing message, not just to those 75, 000 people, but to the nation. And he stepped on that in a big and meaningful way. It cost her coverage that night and it cost her coverage the next day where she's had to go out and clean it up. But, number two, I think it speaks to a larger issue here, which is why Donald Trump has been the nominee for the Republican Party three times. He won the presidency back in 2016 and he's neck-and-neck right now to do it again. It's because people in this country, whether you're Republican, a lot of Democrats, and certainly independents, feel like the political class looks down on them, that they do think they're garbage. And so no matter what the president intended to say there, it fed into that narrative. And I think when you saw the president and his team really do a good job taking advantage of that today.",

But I do agree with my colleague here in terms of it's just too much name calling and people do feel as though the political elites have left them behind and do look down on them. I mean, as soon as I heard President Biden say that, he didn't stumble over his words. He meant that. He said it because people are getting caught up in this. I think people are getting -- you know, it's kind of group think that's going on right now. And it's not just on the Republican side. Democrats do it too, even though President Donald J. Trump is the master of petty. I mean, he really is, and that is his territory. And when Democrats start to navigate his territory, then Democrats lose.

And there were probably two candidates that she was choosing between the lesser of two evils almost all of the time. Our vote is not a gift that we give candidates.

You saw Sean Spicer, Rudy Giuliani. The list is endless of guys who have shows. But look, one thing that's really clear and I think is important to know about this is they're really setting up their audience, Trump supporters, for this idea, one, that Trump is not going to lose. He can't lose. They're very selectively looking at polls that happen to show Trump being a hit. So one, they're saying that. Then it's two, the only way Trump can lose is if the Democrats steal the election, in their words. Again, that didn't happen last time, of course, either.
