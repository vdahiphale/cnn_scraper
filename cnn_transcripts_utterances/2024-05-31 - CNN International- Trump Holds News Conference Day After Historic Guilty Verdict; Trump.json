Just a brief recap of some of the language he used in his response here as well as some of the false or certainly hard to prove statements that he has repeated. He accused those behind this conviction of being bad people, sick people, fascists. He called the judge conflicted. He called Michael Cohen, a witness for the prosecution, a sleazebag, again, the former President's words.He also falsely accused President Biden of being behind this prosecution, given it was not a federal prosecution. The President has no involvement. It was brought by the Manhattan DA. He also accused Biden again without basis or proof that he can't put two sentences together. It's a consistent framing that Trump uses against his opponent for the presidency in November. He also seem to be attempting to adjudicate the case again, claiming innocence. And just at the end there, you heard him cite a number of conservative lawyers and legal analysts, a handful of them who have said that they don't believe this conviction was justified, and then goes on to claim that everyone says this conviction was unjustified, which, of course, Rahel, as we know, is not true, because you and I have spoke to (inaudible), including conservative jurists who find this at least substantive. Whether they agree with the ruling, is another question there. But again, many of these are frequent comments, charges and falsehoods from the former President.

We have a team of reporters, correspondents, legal analysts, all covering this for you, as we see our Brynn Gingras outside of the courthouse there. Katelyn Polantz live with us there.Brynn, let me start with you. There is obviously a gag order that is still in place, the former President alluding to it quite often there. Just remind us of what exactly it covers and your takeaways from what we just heard there. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So, that gag order, of course, which he says and he did violate it several times and has had to pay fines and limits who he can talk about when it was in regards to this case. He could not speak ill about the witnesses in this case, including Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels, and he couldn't go against any of the prosecutors or their family members of the judge. He could speak about the judge. He could speak about Bragg, which we heard him talk about so many times during the trial, and then right there. What I really took out of that from listening to him, of course, we have the usual sort of bullet points that he hits many times when he speaks, when he is at a rally and also just when he would speak right outside this courtroom, but I almost felt like he was saying some things that he wish he could have said if he testified. It's very clear that he wanted to take the stand in this trial. His defense attorney says he wanted to and he said it right there. But, as you can see, the way the former President talks, he goes off on tangents. He says things that are not true. When he took the stand in the civil fraud trial, that was last year, the court kind of went into a little bit of chaos of what he was saying, and that was not in front of a jury. That was just in front of the judge. And that was certainly something that was at risk. His defense attorneys knew that was something at risk. But, he is making it out to be that he couldn't really take the stand because he would be asked about things that he didn't think he should be getting into or was it wise to get into in his past. So, that was one of the things I certainly just took about what he was saying there. And I know you guys are going to go through some fact checkers. But certainly, there were many talking points, we've heard before, that he was making there that are just simply not true when it came to these specific charges that he is now convicted of.",

We're going to try to get Randy back up.But, in the meantime, let's talk about the politics of the moment. It is a historic moment, no doubt, but it is also an election year. And this verdict may not cause any major shifts at the ballot box this November. The Marist Poll released this week, 67 percent of registered voters said that it wouldn't make a difference if Trump is found guilty. 17 percent said that they would be less likely to vote for Trump if he were convicted, and 15 percent said that they would actually be more likely to vote for the former President with his conviction, and with this conviction. Now, American voters are now faced with the decision that they've never had to make before, choosing whether to vote for a convicted felon as their next President. Could a guilty verdict impact Trump's campaign? Joining me now to talk all about it, including with Jim as well, is CNN Political Commentator and Attorney, Bakari Sellers, and former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush and CNN Senior Political Commentator, Scott Jennings. Do I have you both, Scott and Bakari? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; FORMER SPECIAL ASST. TO PRES. GEORGE W.

And while the law behind the conviction might not be clear to many Americans, at least the story, the narrative of that is one that is not positive for the President. And after all, you have a jury of his peers in New York who looked at the evidence, considered it and convicted him.Is that entirely a fair view? Because you understand, and you and I've talked about this before, that Trump attacks the system whenever it doesn't go in his favor. The 2020 election he lost, it must have been rigged, right? The DoJ is right to indict Hunter Biden, but it's rigged to indict me. You know that his argument is anything that doesn't go his way must be rigged or somehow unfair.

Number one, I heard our CNN's colleague Fareed Zakaria say that he doubted that any defendant not named Donald Trump would have ever been indicted in the way Alvin Bragg did this. I think that view is shared by many Republicans. And number two, actually, I think one of the biggest Trump skeptics in Washington, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, kind of summed up people's feelings in her statement last night by saying that she didn't believe that this was a pursuit of justice under the law. It was just a pursuit of a guy named Donald Trump.And I think for Republicans who are skeptical of how this went down, one of the big issues they have is, would anyone other than Trump had been taken down this road, and especially when there was really no underlying crime that he has ever been indicted for or convicted of? The campaign finance theory at the heart of this, the Department of Justice passed on it. The Federal Election Commission passed on it. He has never been indicted or convicted of breaking campaign finance laws. And so, a lot of Republicans are wondering, how could you cover up a legal violation that you've never been convicted of, in the first place?",

Joe Biden obviously understands that there is a lens in which people are viewing this, where some may feel like it is politicized. So, is he doing the right thing? Is the campaign doing the right thing by sort of just sort of stepping back? I mean, if you were on his campaign, what would you be doing the day after this conviction?BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; FORMER DEMOCRATIC SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: No, definitely. You let this issue breathe. I mean, there is nothing else you can add to it. The fact is, and I think Jim laid out those facts, you have an individual who had cheated on his pregnant wife with a porn star and attempted to cover it up. Now, people may say that that should be a misdemeanor, not charged as a felony. But, many individuals know what those facts are. They may not understand the underlying election law violations or state law violations as they may have occurred. But, they know those very tangible facts and reality. And so, I think letting this breathe sometimes, down south, we always say you got to leave well enough alone. Sometimes it's OK to leave well enough alone, and there is nothing else you need to do to help the situation out. They need to focus on the fundamentals. And Scott and I agree on this one point. Joe Biden is actually doing extremely well with senior citizens. He is doing extremely well for Democrat with college-educated whites. I expect him to get a small bump, nothing that is going to be monumental, nothing that's going to be on the teens, but it's going to be a small bump, and this election is going to be one on the edges. And so, I think that a lot of college- educated white women in particular, enough college-educated white women in particular will be taken aback by this that either they won't vote or they'll vote for Joe Biden.",

And again, that's out of all of our hands, right? The Supreme Court has to decide the immunity question. And we'll see what steps follow and over what period of time.

So, that would be January 6. That would be the documents case. These things, to me, need to be dealt with, and it looks like they're not going to be dealt with. That's what makes this case and verdict yesterday so silly, is that we're dealing with an alleged sexual encounter that happened in 2006, 18 years ago. We're dealing with a payment that happened in 2016, eight years ago, and at the same time, we have these front burner issues, which you just referenced, Jim, that are not going to be dealt with. They're not going to be adjudicated.And so, I think voters deserve a chance. I think the prosecutors and the legal system here have just failed the American people. And by the way, I think it goes both ways. I think Donald Trump deserves a chance to try to clear his name. I mean, being indicted for the documents, being indicted for what happened on January 6, I mean, these are serious allegations. He is never going to get the chance to get not guilty, or to clear his name on it either. I think it's a real disservice. I believe that for months now and I think it's true today.",
