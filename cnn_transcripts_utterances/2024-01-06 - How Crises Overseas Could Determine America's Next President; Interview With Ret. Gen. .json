In the Middle East, the war on Gaza threatens to spill across the region. Just this week the assassination of a Hamas leader in Lebanon, massive casualties from twin explosions in Iran, and attacks on world shipping by its Houthi proxies in Yemen. All of these keep a tense region on a hair trigger. And then there's Taiwan where this is also an election year. Results there could determine China's next threats in the Indo-Pacific. Already these crises consumed President Biden's attention, stealing focus from his reelection campaign. While chaos around the world could play into the hands of Donald Trump, America's foremost chaos agent. Now, as a former CIA director and CentCom commander, retired General David Petraeus has been there, seen and done it all. He now advises civilian and military leaders as a partner of the global investment firm KKR, and he is joining me from the nation's capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, again, having communication is a positive development, but this is not enormously positive. This is a beginning, an effort between the two countries, noting that as our national security adviser has described it the relationship is one of severe competition. What we have to do, of course, is ensure that the elements of deterrence are rock solid. The potential adversary's assessment of our capabilities on the one hand and our willingness to employ them on the other cannot be questioned. But we -- while needing to be very firm -- do not want to be needlessly provocative. But again, I think modest encouragement, the efforts to build their nuclear capability, to expand it, those have been ongoing for a very, long period of time.

And I think this will get resolved. The question is when and how much longer does Ukraine go before we can really crank on, turn back on the spigots having already provided a very substantial amount. $44 billion is not trivial, but that's is very affordable. Keep in mind that's across a two-year period in which we had a defense budget in aggregate of $1.7 trillion. Two years, of course, of that. That's very affordable. It is very necessary. In my view, this is as right versus wrong as it gets, a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country right on NATO'S borders and we should have no question that if Russia succeeds there, if Putin is able to achieve his very substantial objectives in Ukraine, that it won't stop there. Moldova will be the next in the crosshairs, perhaps one of the Baltic states or some others.

Landing in Havana he implored, \"May Cuba with all of its magnificent potential open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.\" Now many heard that as a call for the United States to end its harsh trade embargo against its island neighbor.
