We are covering the story from all angles. In Poland, Ukraine, Russia and Brussels. Then Donald Trump will be running for president in 2024. But does he have the support he needs? We'll have the latest on divisions in the Republican Party. Plus, Brazil's President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says his country is back in the fight against climate change. We have reports from Sao Paulo ahead. But first, tonight, Polish leaders say it's likely the missile that killed two people in eastern Poland was a tragic accident, not a Russian missile and not an act of war against a NATO member country according to Poland's investigation. There is a high chance the missile was a Ukrainian air defense missile that landed across the border while intercepting a massive Russian air attack. Well, on Tuesday, Russia if you remember launched some 85 missiles on Ukrainian cities. It's most ferocious assault in fact in weeks. NATO Secretary-General says that makes only one party responsible for what happened in Poland on Tuesday. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO:  Let me be clear. This is not Ukraine's fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.

And so, you know, people here are still frightened and shocked by this horrible event. As you we know, two Polish citizens were killed and since last 30 hours, Polish authorities are trying to explain what really happened here. Around 500 police officers, technicians, military specialists and prosecutors are working at the scene and trying to collect evidence. Today, this terrain was scanned with special 3D technology to find any new possible rests of the rocket. So they are working right now here, and as we know, and that is the message from the Polish authorities. We know that President Andrzej Duda said today, it's very likely that the rocket was produced in the USSR  in '70s, and is very likely that, it was used by the Ukrainians to defend themselves yesterday during the massive Russian rocket strike. So that's the official message from the government. And the Ukrainians are denying that -- they want to work very closely with Polish authorities right now. As you can see, we are here, and we are waiting for this crisp and clear message from the Polish government with 100 percent confidence what hit NATO member's territory.",

And I think it's an important reminder, even as President Zelenskyy makes this announcement, insists that Ukrainians should get access, of course, this does not make the job of NATO countries any easier. And I think there'll be quite a lot of disquiet within the ranks of NATO that this should be coming out at this particular point. Even as he makes those pronouncements, the mood, the attempt here from NATO has been really to try and calm things down. To try and ensure that people wait for the end of the investigation. But in the meantime, that everyone roll back from the talk we were hearing this morning of Poland seeking to invoke Article 4, which forces the consultations of NATO, any talk of Article 5 being a vote. I mean, I think clearly you have to keep in mind, Isa, that whilst -- and we've just been hearing the American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in his press conference speak about this. One of the things that's been remarkable over the course of the last nine months, has been the unity of NATO. It has been steadfast in support of Ukraine, remarkably so, giving its past  divisions. And I think that unity would almost certainly be tested if it were time for NATO to abide by that foundational Article 5 and intervene in one way or another. How far would they go? How much would they intervene? What shape would that take? That extraordinary unity of NATO would no doubt be tested. And I think that is probably in the mind of people like Jens Stoltenberg as well. As they seek with that preliminary assessment to keep the mood as calm as they can. Of course, we'll have to wait for the investigation itself to find out more about what went on for the time being. You're talking about Polish, American investigators who are on the ground, experts looking at a list, and again you saw also those very strong NATO alliance come together here in Brussels. And look at that preliminary intelligence. For now, their assessment is the one you've been hearing from the likes of President Duda and the Secretary- General of NATO, Isa.",

Well, I want to bring in Robert Pszczel, a NATO official and former Polish diplomat, he joins me now live from Brussels. Can we discuss how the region is reacting to these developments? Rob, thank you very much for joining us. We've heard as Melissa was saying there from the Polish president who said today that this was an accident. We've heard from Stoltenberg who says this was likely caused by Ukraine's defenses. Yet, Ukraine as you've heard me talking to Melissa there, is saying the missile that fell in Poland was not Ukrainian. How do you assess what we are hearing here? How do we process this? ROBERT PSZCZEL, FORMER POLISH DIPLOMAT &amp; NATO OFFICIAL:  Well, I think let's kind of, you know, stick to the facts, you know? It is true that we've heard that we all pray for right reasons, natural reasons. The Polish president, we heard the Secretary-General, but the Secretary-General spoken on behalf of all the allies after the meeting of the NATO ambassadors. OK, it was not a meeting under Article 4 which Poland could have invoked, but actually that depended on the evaluation of their situation because it does make a difference, whether the missile was fired with the intention of, you know, hitting Poland. Whether something has happened, you know, and that is the version which all the allies actually agree on. It is based on the evaluation provided by individual countries, but also, on the valuation provided by NATO military authorities. You know, I was not there at the meeting, but I know that this meeting started with a breaching by that -- you know, as actually strategic commanders care. And I've heard from many people, this was very impressive. And let's also not forget, NATO's presence both on land, sea and in the air in Poland and other frontier NATO countries has been dramatically stepped up. So, NATO has a very good idea in terms of the picture in the air, including, for example, the trajectory of various missiles. So, Ukrainian colleagues, we understand. They -- you know, their point of view, but there is a simple next step. They should provide information they have. And I'm sure they'll do that. And I can assure you, nobody in Poland, no one in NATO is blaming Ukraine - -",

And if there's new data which our Ukrainian colleagues, you know, want to provide, they should do so and appropriate procedures to them. But I have no doubt that, you know, we should not focus -- there is no kind of disagreement that there may be some emotions involved, and that's understandable. It's Ukraine which has been under attack, and It's Russia that we need to focus on. Also, in terms of providing Ukraine and perhaps NATO-fronted countries with more air defense systems that would actually ensure the security is better and we'll have no more this kind of incidents. And that's the message that Russia is hearing loud and clear. That's the thing we have to focus on. And I have no doubt that, you know, we will come out stronger in this.

It sort of seems kind of a dual strategy that the Russians have here. Well, on the one hand, as you mentioned, Dmitry Peskov praising Joe Biden, the U.S. President for what he called a restrained response to all this, trying to get the facts first. And then hysteria, as the Russians put it on the part of the Polish government. And you know, a lot of things have been happening here between Poland and Russia throughout the past, I would say 15-16 hours as the days unfolded. The Poles summoned the Russian ambassador to Warsaw, and the Russians tonight summoned the Polish ambassador to Moscow. And he was only in the foreign ministry only for about 20 minutes. But of course, this is a hugely symbolic and important act in all of this, as the Russians are saying, they believe that the Poles should have come out earlier and said that they did not believe that this was necessarily a Russian missile or a missile fired by the Russians, I guess we need to say, that landed there in Poland.

Where the Russians or at least some of them had said that they wanted to defend that territory. That, of course, hasn't happened. You know, at the same time, if you look at the initial invasion of Ukraine or the big invasion of Ukraine as we've been calling it on February 24th and see what's happened since then, it really seems as though the Russians have been losing a lot of ground since then, in the northeast of the country, in the southeast of the country, and of course, in the area around Kyiv as well. And that certainly is something that you'd also noticed here on Kremlin- controlled television, but also with some officials as well. When you do see that the mood certainly has changed from the early stages where the Russians thought they were going to have a quick victory to now complete uncertainty as to what exactly the aims of what the Russians call their special military operation is. The Russians continue to say that all the aims need to be achieved as they put it. There's varying names for it. On the one hand, they called the operation to liberate the Donbas area, on the other hand, they still at some point say that they want to change the government in Kyiv as well.

He made sure that it wasclear from the U.S. perspective, the Pentagon's perspective, that they stand behind Ukraine and Ukraine's right to defend itself. But he also said they had no information to contradict what Polish President  Duda said, that they believe based on the preliminary information that this was a Ukrainian air defense missile that had inadvertently or accidentally landed in Poland, killing those two Polish citizens. Of course, it was one of the first questions the media asked of him. And he said, again, the information the Pentagon has, the information the U.S. has supports what the Polish president said that it was a Ukrainian air defense missile. So, you see, there is certainly at least, some daylight here between what the Pentagon says and what you hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman, General Mark Milley were quick to immediately say, look, this is Russia's fault. It was because of a Russian barrage of missiles that Ukraine had to launch air defense missiles. And if that's why there was a Ukrainian air defense missile that crashed in Poland, then it remains Russia's fault. Austin underscored that the U.S. would continue to provide Ukraine and would chair a group, which is what was happening this morning of international countries that will continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons that it needs to defend itself. So even if there is some gap here, small, but what is on what happened in Poland and whose missile it was that landed in Poland, there is no gap on what the U.S. will do going forward to make sure that Ukraine is able to keep carrying out what has been a very successful operation and a counter offensive against Russia's invasion.",

He advocated ruthless policies against drug traffickers which he said he would model on those in China. And he set himself up as the strong man that was needed to return to fix everything. Now, this might be a message that plays well on the campaign trail among the most activists, Republican grassroots voters. It doesn't really solve the riddle the Republican Party is facing between getting a candidate that can appeal to those voters and winning over the more independent swing state voters that deserted it yet again last week in the midterm elections.

When that didn't happen, he would have looked like he was weak and backing down. He sort of put himself into this political vacuum, blamed everybody else, apart from himself, for those losses, even though a lot of people in the Republican Party believe that Trump-style candidates really turned off a lot of voters. I think Trump also wants to kind of try to freeze the race a little bit. There's a lot of talk about Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who you saw in that clip there, he's getting a lot of good press. Trump wants to sort of stop that gaining any more momentum. And as we heard, there are these investigations of the Justice Department, and in Georgia, into Trump's behavior, not just after January, the 6th, 2021, but his hoarding of classified information at Mar-a-Lago. He wants to be able to portray those investigations as political persecution. I think it's a lot easier for him to do that if he's already a declared candidate.",

Let me sum up our top story this hour.Poland's president said the missile that hit his country Tuesday was probably an accident from the Ukrainian side. He adds that there is no proof that it was a missile fired by Russian troops, even if it is most likely Russian-made and thinks that it was shot by Ukraine's air defense. These comments are aligned with what NATO secretary general said after an emergency meeting and what the U.S. Secretary of Defense just told the press in the last 45 minutes or so. An adviser to Ukraine's president in a statement to CNN did not explicitly deny the reports that the missile came from Ukraine. He pointed to Russia's responsibility in starting the war. This is, of course, the first time a NATO country has been hit since the start of the war. Standing by in Ukraine is Sam Kiley. What are we hearing from all sides here? Polish president saying it's an accident. We have heard in the past hour from President Zelenskyy. He said he is convinced that the missile that fell in Poland was not Ukrainian. They don't seem to be in lockstep here. Why not?",

I think the balance of evidence coming from allies ofUkraine is that they believe it was a Ukrainian air defense missile that was fired at an incoming Russian cruise missile in self-defense, in an area close to the border with Poland. It accidentally came down inside of Poland, killing two farmers. The position of President Zelenskyy is, it wasn't our missile, at all. This may be -- and he is citing his chief of military staff, the head of the armed forces here, as his source on that. They say they have always been accurate in the past and I don't see any reason to disbelieve them now. But he did say yesterday, very publicly -- pretty quickly after this incident -- that it was two Russian missiles that had landed, impacted in Poland. That turns out to be based on the Polish preliminary investigations, supported by American experts and others, to not be the case. It may be an issue where he simply has to catch up with his own information loop. The attitude among many of his subordinates is, not, well, we definitely know it was a Ukrainian missile. The reason they all accepted is that no one is blaming Ukraine for this. NATO, the United States, Poland itself, very explicitly blaming Russia for the fact that they've created the situation in which Ukraine has to fire surface to air missiles in self-defense. It is a rather strange set of circumstances. But a lot better than it was this time last night when there was concerns that, if there had been Russian missiles, the Article V would trigger a all for one doctrine in NATO could've been set off.",

The tragedy that unfolded in that Polish farm is ultimately probably going to accelerate theneed -- some hinting of this coming out of NATO today -- for Ukraine to get more modern surface to air missiles. It is inevitable. Ukrainian and NATO officials say that, if they use this old style Soviet equipment, these types of accidents are more likely to happen. They are more old-fashioned weapons. The United States pointing out that the recent supply that they have made of surface-to-air missiles have 100 percent success rate. I think that is a broad hint from Americans to other allies to step up. There are at least seven of these countries General Austin said, were contributing already with surface to air missiles, anti missile systems and anti aircraft missile systems. They could be expanded, I think. There is an increasing desire to see the Ukrainians continue the success they have had on the ground by not having to deal with the aerial bombardment that they suffer in retaliation.",
