      "sentences": "For the third time in recent weeks, the U.S. and the U.K. carried out joint strikes against Houthitargets in Yemen. This time, the coalition airstrikes targeted 36 targets across 13 different locations in Yemen. As the U.S. and the U.K. backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand try to disrupt the ability of the Iran-backed rebel group to target international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The U.S. went after underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, drone storage and operation sites, radars, and helicopters of the Houthis. So, in that target list, you see the effort of the U.S. to try to disrupt the abilities of the Houthis to continue to attack commercial vessels as well as U.S. warships. It`s also worth noting this is the first time we have seen the U.S. strike Iraq and Syria simultaneously. The U.S. carrying out strikes at seven locations across Iraq and Syria, more precisely four in Syria, three in Iraq, targeting 85 different targets and using more than a 125 precision guided weapons. That is an order of magnitude more powerful that the strikes we`ve seen the U.S. carry out in Iraq and Syria over the course of the last several months. The U.S. had made it clear it wasn`t trying to start a war with Iran here and very much trying to avoid that possibility. So, no strikes in Iran directly. But very much going after Iran`s proxies in the region and the ability of the proxies to carry out attacks on U.S. forces. Worth noting, these strikes, of course, come five days after a drone attack in the region killed three U.S. service members in Jordan and wounded scores more. But it`s not just that. There have been more than 160 attacks on U.S. forces in the region and this was effectively a more powerful response to all of that. And yet there`s no expectation that this is the end of it. President Joe Biden saying there could very well be more to come. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin being more blunt on this in a statement after, saying this is the start of our response. The key question here, of course, what does the rest of that response look like? And where does it play out? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

North America`s largest rodent typically weighs between 35 and 65 pounds and comes in at three to four feet long. But capybaras in South America are the largest rodents in the whole world. Let`s hop on across the pond to the wetlands of England, where the Eurasian beaver, a species hunted to extinction are returning to London for the first time in 400 years. CNN`s Anna Stewart introduces us to the family of five that was relocated from Scotland to West London in hopes of rebuilding the country`s lost beaver population. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the moment that a family of five Eurasian beavers happily settled in to their new home.",

I have to admit my heart was going like the clappers when I opened that first box and big mama beaver came out. She is a whopper. They did fantastically, I was absolutely thrilled. They came out, they showboated in front of the world`s media. It`s only, you know, a few generations ago that they were exterminated and yes, it was a real proud moment to see them swimming around here in this main pond at Paradise Fields again like they had never been absent. STEWART (voice-over): Hunted to extinction over 400 years ago, Britain`s largest rodent was welcomed back to a wetland haven on the outskirts of the capital, adjacent to a retail park and a busy highway. The project has been done with the support of the Mayor Sadiq Khan`s \"Rewild London Fund.\"",

In highrainfall event, we`re getting flooding of this area and the water is basically gushing through and it`s going into the storm drain systems and into the sewers and it`s gushing out in Urban Greenford downstream.

So absolutely incredible, this started as just a couple of twigs across thestream bed and as you can see now, you know, we`ve got almost a meter difference in height between the water upstream and the water downstream. STEWART (voice-over): Beavers create dams under the cover of darkness, not because they care about urban flooding, they have an instinct to create pools of deep water to hide in. The happy consequence for us is that their refuge systems actually slow down the flow of water.",

So they build resilience in the landscape especially in times of climate change. I`ve been in a very privileged position to be coming in here every day, on my own or with a pair of volunteers at a time and seeing it for myself. But I think the real proud moment will come when we are showing the urban community here in Ealing just what beavers can do. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
