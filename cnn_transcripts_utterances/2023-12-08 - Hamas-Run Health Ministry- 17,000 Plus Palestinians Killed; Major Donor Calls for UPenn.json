Today Russia launched abarrage of cruise missiles on Kyiv and Eastern Ukraine after a nearly three month pause. Now these are live pictures of Gaza, where the IDF ground offensive continues in the next hour, the United Arab Emirates where I'm based. We'll ask the U.N. Security Council to vote on a humanitarian ceasefire draft resolution. And some American University Heads find themselves in hot water with donors after congressional testimony on anti-Semitism. We will explain. Welcome to the show. And Israel's military says it struck 450 targets over the past day in Gaza, in what is the heaviest day of bombardment since the temporary pause in fighting ended a week ago. The IDF claiming it's killed \"Numerous terrorists and precision strikes in Khan Yunis\". The military release video showing what it says are Hamas rocket launchers near a humanitarian zone as it targets Hamas infrastructure. Civilians caught in the middle of this war. Well, this video shows people running from gunfire at the Jabalya Refugee Camp in Northern Gaza. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry reports the Palestinian death toll now tops 17,000. Alex Marquardt has been reporting from Israel all week. And he's connecting us this hour from Tel Aviv, Alex, good to see you. We have been seeing an increase in fighting significant increase since the truce ended. And basically the news reports that we're getting is that the IDF is going in aggressively trying to target what it says are Hamas strongholds.",

      "sentences": "Yeah Eleni, that pause in the fighting ended exactly week ago last Friday. And the fightingstarted up again, very quickly and very intensely. In the past week we've already heard the Israeli military say that they have seen their fiercest day of fighting yet since this conflict began. And this morning, the Israeli military said that some 450 strikes were carried out in Gaza in the previous 24 hours, not just strikes from the sky, but also from ships out at sea and from the ground as well. And so the fighting really does continue quite intensely, not just in the north, you show those scenes from around Jabalya Refugee Camp where the IDF continues to operate. They say, trying to continue to clear out Hamas elements. But so much of the focus has gone towards the southern part of the Gaza Strip, particularly around Khan Yunis, the second biggest city in all of Gaza, where so many people had fled to from the north, where now the hospitals are overwhelmed. The W.H.O. said that they are at more than double capacity. So many people in Gaza -- in Khan Yunis have been told to flee even farther south, told to evacuate by Israel because of that focus on that city because they believe that there are some Hamas leaders there. And that has resulted in this humanitarian catastrophe all over the Gaza Strip. But particularly acute in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where so many people have fled near the border with Egypt, we now have 85 percent of Gaza that has been displaced. And as you noted, the death toll continues to grow significantly, Eleni. The latest numbers from the Hamas run Ministry of Health 17,177. So it has gone past 17,000. The majority around 70 percent according to the Ministry are women and children, Eleni.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so the IDF from the very beginning has been telling Gaza residents to evacuate from the areas that they intend to operate andessentially saying stay at your own risk. So for example, if you know when you saw those scenes around Jabalya and you know our own producer had family members who were killed nine of them in a house in the Northern Gaza Strip and essentially the Israeli response to that was well they were told to move south. And so what Israel is saying is they essentially are absolving themselves of that responsibility of civilians are killed once they tell people to move out of those areas. But Eleni, the way that they're doing it doesn't necessarily mean that the message is getting across. They're posting on social media. They're dropping leaflets with QR codes that then take you to a website with a very complicated map. And as we've reported extensively throughout this conflict there has been - - there have been repeated blackouts whether localized or all across Gaza where people haven't been able to get online. They can't use their phones to get onto the Internet. And then even if they were able to, they'd see this incredibly complicated map. The other day, Israel dropped a leaflet in Southern Gaza around Khan Yunis that had a Surah, a verse from the Quran that referred to Noah's warning about a flood coming. And it was -- it was rather cryptic, but it appeared to be sort of a rather ominous warning telling the people in Khan Yunis to get out because the fighting is about to intensify, and that's exactly what we've seen Eleni.",

This comes as images posted on social media show a mass detention of men in Gaza by the Israeli military. You see a large group here stripped to their underwear, kneeling and sitting while blindfolded. The exact dates and circumstances of the detentions are not clear. The Israel Defense Forces has not responded to CNN's request for comment on these images that we're seeing right now. For more on these developing stories, let's bring in CNN's Ben Wedeman in Jerusalem for us. Ben, obviously many questions on how the IDF will be screening these men where they were arrested, how they were arrested, what more do we know about what we're seeing these images and any information that we know about these men?",

Magill along with the Presidents of two other Elite Universities Harvard and MIT did not exactly and explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the code of conduct. Now one Penn donor is threatening to take back a $100 million donation from the Wharton Board of Advisors from Penn's Business School is calling for a change in leadership. Here to talk about the backlash, we've got CNN's Athena Jones, she joins us now from Philadelphia. Athena, great to see you. Frankly, watching back some of that hearing it was really difficult to watch because it was a very clear question. We know there are a lot of nuances and the context is important. But this is going to have long term ramifications for the leadership of these universities. ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi Eleni, it certainly could. And here at the University of Pennsylvania may be the University President who's receiving the most pushback right now when it comes to calls for her to resign. As you mentioned, the Wharton Board of Advisors, which is made up of a who's who of business leaders in a letter that they sent directly to President Liz Magill, saying on Wednesday, this was the day after that what they call disastrous testimony on Capitol Hill. They said in part in the letter, in light of your testimony yesterday before Congress, we demand the university clarify its position regarding any call for harm to any group of people immediately, change any policies that allow such conduct with immediate effect and discipline any offenders expeditiously. This Board of Advisors also said that they remain deeply concerned about what they're calling a dangerous and toxic culture on campus that they say the university leadership has allowed to persist. You also mentioned this $100 million worth of stock that CEO Ross Stevens, he's a Penn Alum and the CEO of Stonebridge Holdings. He has threatened to resend $100 million worth of stock that Penn currently holds. If President Magill stays on board, and finally that the House of Representatives -- in the House is now investigating the University of Pennsylvania as well as Harvard and MIT after the three Presidents' testimony on Tuesday. I should tell you, Eleni, we've been here talking to at least two dozen students so far. Students and people affiliated with the university in the last half hour or so, and several expressed concern about how the President has been performing. A couple said that they see that there could be a financial impact here with donors pulling back with this potential Astok (ph) retention, and they believe that that's going to force her to step down. We also talked to people who are on the pro-Palestine side who said that they felt unsupported by this President and felt that that she went -- didn't have their back as well. So she's really getting fired from all sides here and we'll have to see if she retains her position, much longer Eleni.",

A major politicalflashpoint in the United States has taken a dramatic turn. A new federal indictment charges Hunter Biden with nine criminal counts related to tax fraud. He was already facing federal firearm charges. The news comes as Republicans push for an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. And they say he profited from Hunter's business dealings, a claim the White House strongly denies. We've got Katelyn Polantz with us to give us more on this developing story Katelyn, great to have you.

They lay out much of their handiwork, the work that they did to trace the facts here, including the amount of money that Hunter Biden was bringing in from foreign entities that he was doing business with. That's the area in particular, that House Republicans have wanted to try to tie Joe Biden to. They haven't had evidence that Joe Biden was getting any bribes or payments or anything like that, from these foreign entities, even if it at different points. He may have had money in one of his accounts or something like that, but it isn't. It isn't a clear line at this point in time. And as much as Republicans have tried to have spine some sort of fact, they haven't been able to produce that level of evidence to fuel an impeachment inquiry of the sitting President just because his son has these allegations he's facing. Of course Eleni, this works on the other side as well. So Hunter Biden's defense team has been out there and saying he's a political victim. The reason that he's facing these charges is because he's the President's son. And the statement we received last night from his lawyers was that if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges would not have been brought. That's what they are saying. And they are clearly going to be trying to argue that in court as well. Now, of course, though, in the United States, people do get charged with tax crimes like this. People go to prison for it if they are found guilty. This isn't something that is totally out of the ordinary to be charged with these types of offenses.",

The Israelimilitary said today it had struck some 450 targets in Gaza in 24 hours. That is the highest number reported since the truce between Israel and Hamas ended last week. Meantime, air raid sirens have been going off in Tel Aviv today, about 30 minutes from now. The U.N. Security Council is set to meet to consider calling for humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The Secretary General is pleading with the Council to take action to try to stop what he calls the appalling human suffering from the war. The Israeli military in the meantime is responding to an allegation in Lebanese media that Israeli artillery shelled the outskirts of a Southern Lebanese town with white phosphorus. The toxic substance is restricted under international humanitarian law and the Israeli military says it only uses legal weapons and ammunitions. The video obtained by CNN shows columns of white smoke rising into the sky, though we are unable to confirm whether phosphorus was indeed used. Now this comes as the IDF confirmed it carried out airstrikes on Syria and Lebanon Thursday in response to incoming missile fire. CNN has also learned that investigations by two news organizations and two human rights groups found that Israeli tank shells killed a Reuter's videographer back in October. For more now on this, I want to bring in CNN's Ivan Watson in Beirut. Ivan, great to have you on. What more do we know about the allegations of white phosphorus being used?",

While the Israeli military has responded saying that none of the shells that has been firing have included this phosphorus chemical that it only uses, \"Legal weapons and ammunition\" and that the rounds that have been fired are being used to create smoke screens and not for targeting or causing fires. It does raise a question what would be the point of creating a smoke stream deep into Lebanese territory? But that's a question for another day. Meanwhile, the accusations and the conflict continue. Yesterday, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while visiting Israeli troops in the North of Israel. He basically made -- issued a threat saying that if Hezbollah wanted to open out an all-out war with Israel, that it would result in Southern Lebanon and in Beirut looking like Khan Yunis and Gaza City, drawing a direct parallel between the damage that the Israeli military has done to those densely population centers and what would then happen here in Lebanon. We've heard in a sermon from the Deputy Chairman of Hezbollah's Executive Council, him basically justifying attacks carried out by Hezbollah and by allied groups in Yemen and Iraq on U.S. and Israeli interests, saying that it is a moral duty for these pro-Iranian groups to support Palestinians in Gaza, Eleni.",

So we're hearing that the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has met with his Qatari CounterpartMohammed Al Thani to discuss efforts to release the rest of the hostages. The Israelis believe they are still 137 hostages were remaining in Hamas custody and they want those released. We know that the terms of the deal previously was that for every extra day that Hamas could release 10 hostages, again an extra day in a positive fighting. So that's one aspect. In fact, this statement from the U.S. State Department says Secretary Blinken expressed appreciation for Qatar's critical efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and the recent humanitarian pause in Gaza. This is important because if they can agree to release more hostages into the humanitarian pause. Because what we've been hearing over the past few days, Eleni is desperate dire warnings from the UN, the World Health Organization, from Save the Children, from UNICEF from every aid organization operating in the Gaza Strip, that the situation is completely on its knees. Its risks falling out of hand. The U.N. Relief Agency in the Gaza Strip, UNRWA now saying that it's barely operating, it's on the verge of collapse. And if it collapses, then there's no more humanitarian supplies going into Gaza or being distributed. That is how serious it is. So this 57,000 pounds of aid coming from the U.S. coming through Al-Arish Airport here in the North of Egypt and then into Gaza, are going to be critical. But in a situation where there's no more food, there's no more water, there's no more cooking gas, there's no more fuel, it's a drop in the ocean still, because so many people are displaced. We're hearing stories of parents having to decide if they eat or the kids eat to the given the kids food and deciding not to eat or families only having one meal a day.
