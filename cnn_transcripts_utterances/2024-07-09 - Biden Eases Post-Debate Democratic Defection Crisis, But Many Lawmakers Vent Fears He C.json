When he got through with only a single new Democratic lawmaker publicly calling for him to end his campaign, a day that ended with remarks welcoming NATO leaders, which though he read them off a teleprompter, gave doubters of his candidacy and competency little in the way of fresh ammunition.

Joe Biden is absolutely right about what the stakes of this election are.However, I think we're in a state of denialism and what I think we've seen today is an act of collective denialism about this election and where Joe Biden is now. Elections are about not the past and his achievements which are considerable and we've written about them endlessly, but they're about the future. And unfortunately and it was deeply unfortunate that Joe Biden in front of 10s of millions of people at a debate revealed that his - not that he had a bad night, but it confirmed suspicions that people have been having for quite a long time well-founded and from very well- meaning people, and it was an absolute disaster. And we are in a state of denialism if we continue to dismiss the effect on the polls. This election, as we know, is not just about Democratic diehards and people who are going to vote for Joe Biden no matter what. It's about small margins of voters in six swing states, first of all, and we're seeing those polls being extremely negative where Joe Biden is concern and that is extraordinarily dangerous. And so if we care about, and I know we all do, about this country, we cannot make these decisions in a state of denialism. And what we've seen today and I don't know where it'll go the rest of the week is a kind of frozen situation of collective action. I don't doubt the sincerity of the Congresswoman or anybody who feels that way. But to watch that debate and to think that there aren't going to be more moments like this ahead is to ignore time, it's to ignore the cruelties of biology and reality. We've all experienced it with our parents or grandparents and the problem is - what's at stake here is not just your father's or your mother's ability to drive anymore or to do effective work and you have to have hard conversations with them. It's about - it's not about Joe Biden, it's about this country, it's about this future, it's about the future of democracy. And if we continue to ignore this, I fear that we are in a state of denial and that we'll head toward November and again, I'm not in the prediction business, but the outcome could be miserable.",

This obviously is notable given what we are hearing about the calls for Joe Biden to step aside and the fact that his campaign, as we know, has been calculating what exactly that would mean for the rest of his campaign until November. What happens if Kamala Harris is at the top of the ticket?I want to read to you exactly what he said because he just said it moments ago, so we haven't been able to cut that sound yet, but he says, whatever else can be said about crooked Joe Biden, you have to give him credit for one brilliant decision, picking Kamala Harris as his vice president was the greatest insurance policy of all time. If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from his office years ago. The reason why this, again, is so notable is, one, Donald Trump and his team have really spent almost no time talking about Vice President Kamala Harris at all. So, they are clearly monitoring this situation very carefully. Now, they have told me that they have spent millions of dollars in modeling and gathering data to go after President Joe Biden. They have not switch their -- they have not flipped their switch yet to go after Kamala Harris, to look into that data because they are waiting to see what exactly happened. Now, the other thing, tonight, one thing we didn't hear was any sort of announcement for vice president. Interestingly, he made a very brief comment about Marco Rubio, saying he believes that all of the media here is because they think that they're -- he's -- they're going to announce -- or he's going to announce Marco Rubio as vice president. But then, quickly moved on. The campaign had been teasing when he's going to announce, but we are still are no closer to his actual announcement. Obviously, as we have reported, he has to make that decision by next Monday. They had said it could come as late as Monday morning. But Senator Marco Rubio, he was here. He spoke. His whole family was here. This is his hometown. Yet, only that brief reference to him in the crowd and then moved on.",

I mean, just to put this in perspective, this is the best week and a half Donald Trump has had since he was elected in 2016. The immunity ruling from the Supreme Court, the GOP lining up behind him ahead of the convention, and Joe Biden falling apart in the Democratic Party, frankly, in shambles with the latest polling that we've seen and questions over if he can stick this out. But what I do think is important is, Donald Trump wants to run against Joe Biden. He sees that he will win, there's a chance he will sweep at a greater level than he previously has. They are nervous of another candidate, despite what he might convey. Even someone younger like Kamala Harris with vulnerabilities she has, that he would be fearful of a change in the candidacy.",

But there are pros. Of course, if there's a change in the race and you're running against someone like a vice president, Kamala Harris, the first black woman running for president, having a Latino on the ticket might be an important factor. I think that he -- I -- well, it's said that it's decided who he -- by Trump, who he's going to be choosing. He's somebody, to Maggie's point, who may change his mind up into the last minute.

So, what he needs is very different and what he might want in a vice president is very different. I mean, Donald Trump is a chemistry player. I've said this to a number of people recently. He did have chemistry with Mike Pence. He has a lot of chemistry with J. D. Vance. I don't know about his levels of chemistry with Doug Burgum. They have a fairly recent relationship.
