The federal government has declared a public health emergency in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida and will deploy disaster and medical teams to assist states in their recovery. Floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have killed at least 192 people in Nepal. As rescue workers reach more remote areas, officials warn the death toll will likely rise. Images show floodwaters are sweeping over parts of the capital city, Kathmandu. Other videos show entire buildings collapsing as the land below gives out. A rooftop fire at a chemical plant near Atlanta, Georgia, has forced evacuations and road closures. Officials say water from a faulty sprinkler head came in contact with the water reactive chemical causing a massive plume of smoke. As you can see, crews managed to get the fire under control, but the smoke may be visible for several more days.",

And this comes after Israeli airstrikes hit within the city limits of Beirut for the first time since this began.Video shows the chaos and fear unfolding for Lebanese civilians in the capital following the attack on Monday morning. The country has faced days of intensifying strikes, which Lebanese officials say killed more than 100 people on Sunday alone. Well, the World Food Program warns that, quote, Lebanon is at a breaking point with an estimated one million people displaced by the Israeli attacks. Pope Francis is calling for an immediate ceasefire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) POPE FRANCIS (through translator): Defense always has to be proportionate to the attack. When there is something disproportionate, you can see a tendency to dominate that goes beyond morality. A country that with its force does these things, any country, I mean, that does these things in such an exaggerated way. They are immoral actions. Even in war, there is a morality to respect. War is immoral, but the rules of war indicate some morality. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "For the first six months immediately after October 7th through April, Netanyahu and his government were suffering in public opinion. People blamed them for the failures to detect and prevent and cope with October 7th and everything that happened afterwards. And their poll, their polling numbers were very poor.But from around early April, beginning with the assassination of a senior Al-Quds commander in Damascus and the fact that there was an exchange of fire with Iran that did not escalate out of control, there began an incremental recovery of polling. We saw another inflection point in August after the double assassination of Fuad Shukr, senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut and assassination attributed to Israel of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. And that also did not fully escalate into a regional war. It looked like Netanyahu had some sort of strategic control over the events in the regional dimension. And the polling got better for the government. Now, the government has regained at this point all of what it lost in those first six months of the war. And I can, you know, my assessment is that it's because of the regional dimension. There's no evidence that Gaza is playing out well in the Israeli public. People are still devastated by the fact that there hasn't been a hostage release deal. They consistently prefer a hostage release deal, including the concessions that would mean on Israel's part to the government's position. But everybody feels like the regional threat is kind of above politics. And that does play well for the government. However, it should be said, the government has not been able to regain the majority that it had in the November 2022 elections and surveys. So if elections were held today, they still wouldn't win. But elections will not be held today. They haven't even been called yet. And the government could also last the full term.",

Quote: Israel and Hezbollah have turned the corner into full scale war. No one can say how it will end or how much rubble and how many bodies will be left in its wake. But one modest prediction is credible, based on recent experience. Thanks to the war in Lebanon, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government will probably strengthen his political hand. And I think you've just spoken to that. What's your assessment of the appointment of Gideon Sa'ar?",

And he has been playing fire with the relationship with the U.S. Having said that, I think what he's trying to do is, you know, from his perspective, he has long sought a greater conflagration in the Middle East that even draws the U.S. in. And, you know, it's hard to say for sure what's going inside his head, but just reading the actions of the last number of days, it looks very much like he is pushing the U.S. to a situation where there could very well be a severe escalation in the Middle East, including possibly attacks on U.S. forces that would drag the U.S. in. And so it's almost as if he's not really going to give his allies a choice about international isolation or not. He's trying to pull them in and create the kind of binary divide that he described in his U.N. speech. The good guys and the bad guys, it's how he sees the world, or at least it's how he wants the world to see Israel. The problem is that Israel behaves like the bad guys in many ways with its undemocratic and conquest-oriented positions of this government, and yet feels like it legitimately can expect the support of what it calls the good guys who advance peace and democracy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty around how those democratic allies will see Israel in the coming years.",

Of course, that was the site of the assassination attempt earlier this summer that certainly changed him and the campaign. He talked about that assassination attempt at a rally in Erie on Sunday afternoon as he delivered an excoriating recitation of Kamala Harris, talking very little about his own policies but repeatedly questioning her mental acuity. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Crooked Joe Biden became mentally impaired, sad. But lying Kamala Harris, honestly, I believe she was born that way. There's something wrong with Kamala. And I just don't know what it is, but there is definitely something missing. And you know what? Everybody knows it.",

That was not what Donald Trump did. There is no question that the base of his party enjoys those types of attacks. The larger question is, what does it do for persuadable voters in the middle?Now, Erie, Pennsylvania is a fascinating place to campaign. Certainly, one will be watching as the election goes forward. Barack Obama won this county twice in 2008 and 2012. Donald Trump carried it in 2016. Joe Biden won it in 2020. It is indeed a swing county inside a battleground state. That is why Donald Trump was campaigning here on Sunday. There is no doubt the vice presidential debate is coming up on Tuesday in New York. And then one month remains until the election.
