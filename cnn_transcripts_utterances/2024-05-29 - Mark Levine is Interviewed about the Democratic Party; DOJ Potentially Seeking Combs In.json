Now, as you noted, there have been eight lawsuits against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, seven of which accuse him directly of sexual assault.

There may be a way to lower the risk of your child developing a lasting peanut allergy. A new study saying, well, it's a pretty simple step. It's introducing your children and feeding your children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood. CNN's Jacqueline Howard has the details. She's joining us now on that.

What the researchers found is that children who were fed peanut products early on in life regularly, from infancy, around four to six months old, all the way through age five, they had a 71 percent reduced rate of peanut allergies later on in life in adolescents at around age 12. And that's in comparison with kids who avoided peanut products in infancy.And I will say, it was previously recommended to wait to introduce your baby to peanut butter until age three. But since then, in recent years, medical groups have shifted their position and the American Academy of Pediatrics now says that an early introduction to peanuts may prevent peanut allergy. And, Kate, this new study not only seems to support that, but it takes it further and shows that that reduced risk of peanut allergy can be sustained all the way through adolescence to age 12 or 13.

I mean if you have a child who has eczema or an egg allergy, they are at higher risk. But once you develop that plan with your doctor, they'll likely recommend to start with a soft peanut butter puree. Obviously, peanuts are a choking hazard. And start with this small amount, like this pea sized amount. See how your child responds to that. And then reintroduce it three to four days later, see how they respond to a larger size. And slowly over time increase in size and see how they do.Of course, if you notice something's off or if they don't react well, talk to your doctor about that. But having a plan is so important because we know, Kate, food allergies are a public health concern. About 2 percent of kids here in the U.S., that's nearly 1.5 million, have a peanut allergy.

A federal judge in New Hampshire has struck down a conservative-lead law restricting how teachers could instruct students on topics such as gender and race, or as the law described it, divisive concepts. The judge ruled that the law was unconstitutional. This move marks the first time in the nation that a judge has overturned such a measure, which could set a precedent for similar moves in other states. This ruling, though, could still be appealed if the court fight continues. And Washington, D.C., is preparing for some pretty high-profile diplomats.
