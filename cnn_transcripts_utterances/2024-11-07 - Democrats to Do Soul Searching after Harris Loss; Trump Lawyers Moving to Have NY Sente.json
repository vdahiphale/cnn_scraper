The power of the middle is unbelievable. I just hope when they get to Washington, they remember how they got there. REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): We have to be honest as Democrats. We do have a problem connecting with working-class voters. This started to emerge about a decade ago, and it was focused on white working-class areas. That has now spread.

This is a situation where this is a big loss, but it's -- it was big -- bigger than they expected it to be in so many different ways, that it has just pulled the guts out of Democrats across leadership and across the country, it seems.When you look at the size of this loss, though, you can make the argument it was about the working class, black working class, white working class, Latinos. You can make the argument it was about losing faith among suburban voters or Jewish voters or Arab voters. The truth is, Kamala Harris won New Jersey by 5 points. That is a tiny margin. She was 30 points behind Hillary Clinton in Lawrence, Massachusetts, which is a heavily Latino area of Massachusetts. The -- the scale of this loss is something that the party is going to have to really grapple with in a way that doesn't get solved, I wouldn't think, by saying, OK, we need to tack more to the center. We need to tack more to progressives. They really need to try to figure out how to make more of this, going forward. And they don't have a clear leader right now. They don't have, really, any clear leaders of who the national person would be. And it also may be that we are seeing Donald Trump ride, in addition to his own strength, what has been going on all over the world, of people who have been kicking out the parties that were in power in the post-COVID age. I'm not sure that Donald Trump has a huge amount in common with Keir Starmer. But what happened to the -- the way that the Labour Party triumphed a couple months ago in the U.K. is similar to what happened on Tuesday for the Republicans.
