China lowers interest rates to try to support its struggling economy. And French Police raid the offices of the Olympic organizers. Investigation now underway into potential corruption. Live from New York, it is Tuesday, June 20th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, just about 40 hours of oxygen left. That is the grim assessment of the situation on board a submersible missing in the depths of the North Atlantic. The small craft lost contact Sunday morning while diving to the wreckage of the Titanic. It was carrying the pilot and four other people. US and Canadian rescue crews scanning the area now with planes and ships, and now they have the capability to search underwater. And here is where they're looking, it is an area more than 900 miles east of Boston, Massachusetts, and about 3,800 meters deep. The US Coast Guard gave this update a couple of hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, US COAST GUARD:  We know there's about there's about 40 hours of breathable air left based on that initial report. Again, that was just the initial report based on 96 hours from when the vessel -- We will do everything in our power to effect a rescue. Again, it's going to depend on -- if the ROV finds something, it is going to depend on what they find, what needs to be -- what steps need to be taken next, and really that is for the experts within the unified command to take a look at it and then decide what the best course of action is.

It has this remote control vehicle that is now going to hit the depths of where they believe the submersible might be at this hour. The problem is, as your guest was just saying is, how do you then lift it to the surface if you do find it. So, that is what Canadian and American officials are working on right now. They are already pre-positioning, Rahel, health equipment that they need. Again, the expertise that they need, trying to get it in place, either on the waters of the North Atlantic or first re-position it in St. Johns Newfoundland, to make sure that if they spot it, that they are ready to bring it to the surface. What was a bit disheartening about the Coast Guard press conference, Rahel, was that, you know, I had been saying having been in these waters before that it takes a long time, and a lot of resource to just search the surface of the water. Having said that, they explained they have already searched 76,000 square miles. It is unlikely given the capacity of this submersible that they would find it just floating on the surface right now, whether it had communication or not, and I think that's what's most disheartening. They knew all along that it would likely have to be retrieved from the deep sea and that is what is proving so difficult this hour. And as you said, I mean, two hours ago, they said it was 40 hours, right? So we're at 38. I will add, though at least two of the people on board have expertise in these deep sea missions, which means they know how to preserve oxygen, right? They know what to do in order to tell everyone on that submersible to use their oxygen sparingly. So that's why certainly, Canadian officials are not giving up hope at this hour.",

I think the issue here is they need to find it first, and after that, they will do everything they can and that includes personally some engineering feats that they've told me about that they will see what they can do. Certainly, we all know about submarine accidents in the military and those are very grave situations. Perhaps as your expert just said, this is even riskier than that.

Now last summer, CNN reported that the potential charges had been narrowed down to tax crimes and the one outstanding gun charge. Then in April, Biden's lawyers demanded a meeting with the Justice Department. Seven months had gone by since that CNN story saying the case had narrowed, but nothing had happened, and during that meeting with the Trump-appointed US attorney, David Weiss and other career officials, Biden's team, they made their pitch about why their client shouldn't be charged. But then in the subsequent weeks, there was a lot of negotiating back and forth. We're told that it really ramped up in recent weeks trying to resolve this case, and that's how they landed on his plea deal. As part of his plea deal, Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax offenses. Prosecutors allege in court filings today that Biden failed to pay his taxes that he owed for 2017 and 2018. He owed about $100,000.00 in each of those years. Now, we will note, he has subsequently paid those back, plus fees and penalties, but he'll plead guilty to that, and we're told by our sources, the Justice Department will recommend probation for the sentence, but ultimately, it'll be up to the judge. Now, there is also one other felony gun-related charge, but he is not pleading guilty to that. If he can follow through with some court requirements that we expect will have to do with not owning firearms and also staying clean from drugs, that will likely be expunged. But again, this is all up to a judge, and as of right now, they don't have a date on the calendar for Hunter Biden's first hearing, for his arraignment.

They mostly looked into his foreign business dealings, makingaccusations about unscrupulous deals, but the Justice Department isn't charging anything like that today, but that hasn't stopped Republicans from criticizing this deal, making questionable comparisons to the charges filed against former President Trump. What I have to say is that the charges filed against former President Trump also come out of an investigation that's being handled by special counsel, Hunter's is being handled by a Trump appointed US attorney, so these are independent prosecutors looking at this, but the Trump investigation was much broader in scope, in scale, and the nature of the crimes that are being investigated, I mean, pretty much everyone who work for former President Trump testified in that probe. The Hunter Biden case, some of these potential questions are much more serious, but it appears the Justice Department didn't believe that they could bring a broader case successfully, which is why this resulted in a plea deal. So Republicans are trying to argue including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that there is some sort of two-tiered justice system, but it does appear if former President Trump had listened to his lawyers and been honest with them earlier in the process of returning those documents to the government, he too may have been able to get a plea deal or no charges at all.",

But also, all to do with contracts really, that were giving out favoritism is another of the allegations being looked at as part of both those probes. So what you're looking at here are the contracts that were given out, both by the organizing committee of the 2024 Paris bid, but also by the public company that is charged with the building projects, the infrastructure that even now is going up on the outskirts of Paris ahead of the games that are due to start on the 26th of July next year. So what we understand is that it was early this morning that raids were carried out in several locations, several of the buildings that belong to the organizing committee and to this public company, they came as a surprise to them. They were launched without announcement, of course, as the financial police tried to get their hands on the documents they were looking for, and they went on for most of the day.

We don't know either what documents have been seized. That will take some time, but certainly what this does indicate is that this early period, when we were going to start to look at the publicity ahead of these 2024 games, a lot of the buildup, the excitement, the enthusiasm is likely to be overshadowed over the coming weeks as a result of these investigations, and as we get more details of exactly whom is accused of what.",

There is a history here. What you're looking at is essentially whenever a country goes to bid, or certainly when a country gets these games, extremely large infrastructure projects going up very quickly. A lot of that public money in the hands of a select few people who may be tempted at times, to hand out the contracts to friends, or certainly go about giving out the in ways that are not as transparent as they should be. Certainly, the temptation is there. Hence, that announcement by Tony Estanguet that these games would be different. And yet here we are, Rahel, with just over a year to go before the start of them and these very serious allegations being brought not just against one of the organizations involved, but the two main organizations at the helm of getting these games up and running.

Inside the controls are very limited. Now a lot has been made about the controller that seemed to be from a PlayStation or an Xbox or whatever it was.

That said, the communications service are very minimal once they are down. It is a type of texting every 15 minutes, which they also use for guidance because GPS and all the things you would rely on don't work down there. And most importantly, most importantly, there is this question of how you get back to the surface. He talked about how it is all based on these weights on the outside, which they shed by rocking the vehicle back and forth to knock them off, where it will automatically float up. And, if they can't knock them off that way, they have these pneumatic jacks that they can hit, that should knock the waves off and allow it to come back to the surface.

There is so much pressure down there, that, if something's wrong, it is likely the whole vessel would fail very, very quickly. There would be no time to send out any kind of warning. One of the features of this vehicle, though, that is really quite interesting is that, when you are inside, you are bolted in from the outside by all accounts. There is no way to release from the inside. So if you did float to the surface and you were not spotted or you could not get a beacon to be recognized, where people would come to you, the truth is that you would still be on the surface of the ocean but trapped by only the air you had inside. You would have no other way to rescue yourself until you are found.

That could be 3,000- 5,000 pounds of cable alone to reach the craft. And then, you would have to have a robot to somehow attach it to the craft, to start pulling it up. That is really, really hard. All bets would be basically on trying to get some kind of buoyancy system to it. And again, do you have the system? Do you have the robotics to get it down there? Can you get them in place and can you raise it with that clock tick-tick- ticking?",

Store leaders, incentivize to print profits and worry about the bottom line. That led to a lot of internal conflict and essentially lack of speed in execution, that they are still trying to make up and they're doing a better job in recent years. Another one is, just storytelling in business narratives matter. And the narrative for a very long time, that Walmart did not really help go against, was that they are all about physical.
