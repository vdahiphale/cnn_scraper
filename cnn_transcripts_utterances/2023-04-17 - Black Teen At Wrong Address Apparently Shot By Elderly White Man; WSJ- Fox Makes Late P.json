The shooter apparently a white man in his 80s has not been charged with a crime. Yarl's family says the boy mistakenly rang that man's doorbell while attempting to pick up his siblings.This was last Thursday. That homeowner allegedly shot the teen twice, shooting sparked a large protest on Sunday. The community demanding to know why the accused shooter was let go less than two hours after he was taken into custody. CNN's Camila Bernal, she is following all of these latest developments, including what we're learning about the shooter. So, tell us -- or the alleged shooter I should say, tell us what we know. CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hey, Jim. So, authorities just not naming the shooter and CNN also not naming the shooter. But we do know that he is a white man in his 80s. We also know that this all happened on April 13. But he was taken and booked in jail on early morning hours. So, he got booked at around midnight that night and was released at 1:24 a.m. So, he was only in jail for a couple of hours. The chief of police in Kansas City had been talking about this 24-hour holding period, that according to state law, you have to -- or you're allowed to keep someone for 24 hours. But after those 24 hours expire, you either release the person or you charge them. We know now that this man was only in jail for a couple of hours and he was not charged. This was a mistake. This teenager went to 115th Street. He was supposed to go to 115th Terrace. He was a block away from where he was supposed to be picking up his brothers. And that's where he was shot. Of course, the family is now focused on his health, but thankful that he is alive. Here's his aunt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAITH SPOONMORE, RALPH YARL'S AUNT: My nephew is alive. And he is human. It is not the story that that individual intended for us to tell. He is telling a story that is different from the stories that you normally hear. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is thanks to reporting from the Kansas City Star, the local newspaper there citing an interview with the father.And the father is saying that Ralph spent three days at the hospital and is now at home recovering. It is his mother who is taking care of him. She is a nurse. We have reached out to the family for comment. But we do know that really what they wanted is to focus on his health. Even though they are doing that, they still have a lot of questions as to what happened here and why. CNN also talking to a neighbor who says she was told to stay inside the house. She said she had to clean the blood but wanted to say that this was a brave young man who stayed awake and tried to tell her look, I am in the wrong house. So, again, this is just a devastating story, but thankfully he is OK, Jim.",
