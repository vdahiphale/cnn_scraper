That's not going to happen.The people that we're talking about in this town are here legally. In fact, they are brought specifically in to bolster the economy, the sagging, you know, Rustbelt economy of Springfield, Ohio where manufacturing has all but died and the current residents won't live there. It has exploded in other ways because of problems with infrastructure and housing and things of that nature. And what we're seeing is something that Donald Trump is really good at doing, which is exploiting fear and exploiting anxiety. And so, he has found consistently, really over the last eight years, that fear, anxiety, and exploiting that and speaking to that actually works incredibly well.

They offered O'Brien a primetime speaking slot at the RNC, relatively costless action that clearly got them a benefit. He asked to speak at the DNC. He did not get it. It's a huge deal. They have two million members, if you count their retirees, who turn out to vote 70% of the time. That's not a group that you want to alienate.Frankly, the lack of curiosity by Democrats about why they're hemorrhaging working class voters, I think those are interesting questions they need to ask. Why is Trump so appealing to the rank and file? Why does he have some firefighters, buildings, unions? He has -- majority of unions are with Harris, but he's making some inroads there that are interesting.",

The jail opened in the 1990s and holds about 1,200 inmates right now, most waiting to stand trial. But it has been plagued with problems like violence, staffing shortages, drug smuggling, lockdowns, and power outages. Even Diddy's lawyers highlighted the -- quote -- \"horrific conditions of detention\" in his appeal to free their client, knowing the jail is infested with drugs and calling it an ongoing tragedy. Now among the dangers he cited, an inmate who was murdered there just over the summer, and four inmates have died by suicide in just the last three years. You can hear the desperation for some of the inmates when they yelled out of their windows to lawmakers during a visit two years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Help us! No commissary.

Both women took abortion pills that they received from out of state because they couldn't have the procedure under Georgia's six-week abortion ban. Both women later died because their bodies did not expel all of the fetal tissue. A rare complication, but a complication that ProPublica reports was -- quote -- \"preventable,\" according to the state's committee of maternal health experts in this instance. In Amber Thurman's case, ProPublica reports she went to a hospital in pain, waiting for 20 hours before doctors began to operate, and died during surgery. Candi Miller never made it to a hospital. Her family says she didn't go because of Georgia's abortion law. She died in her own bed. Her three-year-old daughter by her side. Both women died in 2022.
