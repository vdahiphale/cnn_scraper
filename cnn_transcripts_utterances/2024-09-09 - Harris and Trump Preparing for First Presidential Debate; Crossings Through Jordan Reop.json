Just ahead, we are one day away from the high stakes presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, a make or break moment for both campaigns as they look to win over undecided voters.A manhunt underway this hour in Kentucky where authorities are searching for the suspect accused of opening fire on highway drivers. And Pope Francis lands in East Timor, kicking off the next leg of his tour throughout Southeast Asia. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are just one day away from meeting face to face for the first time on a debate stage. Well, that showdown in the first presidential debate with 57 days to go until the November election. It will come just before early voting begins in several key states and as new polling shows that the race for the White House remains tight. A \"New York Times-Sienna College\" poll shows no clear leader with a similar theme found in a new CNN poll of polls which shows Harris at 49 percent and Trump at 47. The two candidates spent the weekend in battleground states. Harris meeting with voters in Pittsburgh while preparing for the debate as Trump held a campaign rally in Wisconsin. Well, Harris is set to travel to Philadelphia in the hours ahead. On Sunday, she told reporters she's ready for the debate. CNN's Eva McKend has more from Pittsburgh. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  It is perhaps no surprise the vice president, a former prosecutor, has a reputation for intensely preparing for these big moments. She has likely been pouring over briefing books, anticipating what the moderators might ask her, anticipating what former President Donald Trump might say. We know one thing is for sure though, her campaign, not so worried about these polls. Brian Fallon, a spokesperson for the campaign, tweeting that they have always viewed themselves as the underdog in this contest and they still have that mentality. They recognize that they have a lot of work to do in the 50 plus days until the election. Meanwhile, they're already telegraphing what they're going to do after the debate, a battleground blitz they're calling it, with the vice president campaigning in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, Governor Walz taking to Michigan and Wisconsin, and their respective spouses fanning out across the country as well. The campaign will have a presence in every battleground state. Eva McKend, CNN, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",

I think that Harris will sidestep some of the insults and the nastiness. She's been studying Trump's past debates, so she's going to know how he operates. But you can't avoid that.

Now, law enforcement has been focused on one specific area near where the shooting took place, but this is very rugged wooded terrain. Police have said that there are a lot of trees, it is difficult to get around and that is making it very challenging for them to continue the search into the night. Once the sun comes down, they said they were going to pull back their officers out of an abundance of caution. Now, the White House has been in touch with law enforcement in Kentucky, which has been using several resources, including at least one helicopter, canine units, as well as a drone in order to search the area. For now, authorities have not determined a motive behind the shooting, but they do believe that the shooting was planned. And while there were no fatalities, at least five people were critically injured, some of them suffering gunshot wounds to the face and across the chest.

And let me dive even a little bit deeper on that jobs report. Why it is what you were mentioning fragile a little bit. It was the growth was largely concentrated in two areas, construction which added close to 34,000 jobs in health care. So, then we are seeing this kind of slowdown and we started to see that pressure are starting to go into and guess what, right into in a couple of weeks, the big decision on will the Fed start decreasing the rate and what rate?",

So you know, so I also thank the flip side of this and I have to mention the GDP of the third quarter is also still growing. The Atlanta Fed came out an increased its outlook.

So I think the candidates, both of them should be focusing on economic growth. How are they going to do that? And what sectors and how to grow the sectors faster in certain the wage growth and even the living and the consumer price index.

We also see the wage both not catch job to somebody who's opportunities when you either travel or go.So I think when you think of what's top of mind in the short term, you see the price sticker shock is still there. We still see big stock, you know, we still see big items, ticket items people are choosing not to purchase them and holding back. So people's lifestyles are also changing, too.

But they certainly have some real work to do to avoid this.Still not settled is how long a stop gap bill, known as a continuing resolution should go. Democrats, they prefer a short-term spending bill into December. They want to kick the negotiations until after the election. And many Republicans, they want to fund the government into spring, pushing the fight until after the leadership races and the House, which would help Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. They will, of course, need to settle on spending levels, and there's a separate battle brewing over whether to include a non non-citizen voting measure. Now, this is a controversial so bill that Republicans are pushing to include. It is already illegal, of course, for noncitizens to vote. But the legislation would require proof of citizenship to vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in a statement on Sunday said, quote, they will not let poison pills or Republican extremism put funding for critical programs at risk, and the deadline to get this completed, its September 30th.
