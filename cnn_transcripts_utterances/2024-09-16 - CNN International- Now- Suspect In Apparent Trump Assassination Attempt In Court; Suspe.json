      "sentences": "Well, we're learning a lot about his background. Now, if you think about it, the first attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump, the motive in that case is still unresolved. Authorities don't quite know why that individual opened fire on the former President.But, in this case, much different, and that's due to what law enforcement sources are pointing to his robust online presence. This is someone who had multiple accounts, authorities believe, on Twitter and Facebook and other outlets, where he essentially had ridiculed, criticized former President Donald Trump. He was also fixated on Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, at one point, allegedly traveling to Ukraine, trying to get people to travel over to that region in order to fight Russian forces. So, again, there is still a lot that we're digging into. Authorities are doing so as well, but at least according to that online footprint, this appears to be someone who was aggrieved by the situation with Russia and Ukraine and his animosity towards former President Trump.",

He also put out a post on Truth Social overnight, thanking the U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcements for their quick response. And just now, we are just getting into CNN his remarks that he made in his first interview after the apparent assassination attempt. He told Fox News Digital that the rhetoric of the Vice President and Biden and Democrats, is blank, is quote, \"causing me to be shot at?\" He believed the rhetoric. He being the shooter. He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it.Trump went on to say, the rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country. Obviously, the former President there being quite forceful in assigning the blame for yesterday's attack. We still don't know, though, so much information. And I will also point out that the former President continues to also push inflamed rhetoric on the campaign trail. He recently continued to make fun of Nancy Pelosi after the aftermath of the attack on her husband at her home in San Francisco. We obviously have seen the bomb threats in in Springfield, Ohio, there, as well as a result of some of the conversations by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance about the Haitian immigrant community there. So -- but, those are the former President's first public remarks in an interview in the aftermath of another attempted attack on him.",

They can always go back to the court, to the judge, and try to file additional charges. In this case, authorities have a certain amount of time before they either have to release or charge someone. And so, it's not surprising, in this case, that this is specifically gun-related charges. The first, as you mentioned, being a felon in possession of a firearm. We know that it's an individual who had a past criminal history, including in 2002 in the U.S. state of North Carolina. He was arrested after barricading himself in a building with a weapon. So, someone who was certainly known to law enforcement. And the second charge there, as you mentioned, having a firearm with an obliterated serial number. That's a crime in the U.S. Firearms have that unique serial number, which allows authorities to track a weapon if necessary, if it's involved in some kind of crime. We've seen criminals try to get rid of that serial number on these weapons, which makes that a federal crime. These charges not quite severe right now. Certainly, what we're waiting for is the big charge, which, in the U.S., if you threaten a protectee of the United States Secret Service, that is a federal crime. We haven't seen that charge yet. But, I think, again, that we could expect additional charges as this investigation plays out. And then finally, I'm told from law enforcement source that this investigation has now, quote, \"gone global\". Authorities trying to track his movements, his alleged travel to Ukraine, any associates. Right now, no indication that this was any type of conspiracy, but a lot of work for investigators to do.",

When you look at the President of the United States, there are -- the threat environment around the sitting President is extremely vast. You have domestic issues. You have foreign issues. There is national security issues constantly pressuring in creating additional security challenges around the sitting President. Now, once you leave office, that threat environment starts to diminish. If you look at the threat environment to former President Clinton, Bush or even Obama, that threat has been significantly reduced. Why? Because you're out of power. You no longer control the military. So, some of those threats naturally reduced over time.Uniquely, though, with former President Trump, that threat environment really did not diminish. It actually has been amplified. If you think about, the former President has basically been running for reelection since the moment that he left office, that threat environment has remained very high for him, both with domestic issues as well as this ongoing very credible threat from Iran. Now, all of that threat landscape around the former President necessitates a different type of model. You can't just say anymore that he is the former President, so he gets X resources. That can't be the case anymore. We've had two assassination attempts against the former President. He is at the highest threat level right now, and he needs to have all of the appropriate resources that the Secret Service and the federal government at large has available to, again, defend against domestic and foreign threat actors.",

Jonathan, speaking of addressing, I mean, do you think -- the fact that this has now -- this attempt has now happened twice in two months, does that indicate to you some sort of failure on the part of Secret Service? I mean, how do you view this, the fact that this person was even close enough, within a few hundred yards of the former President?Well, I mean, let me take the second part of your question first, I mean, yesterday, the protective model actually did work. The protective operations for a golf course are very complex. Yes, they are reduced right now because he is not the sitting President, but it's actually really robust. The Secret Service recently has increased the level of staffing for the former Trump detail, and we saw some elements of that come together yesterday, one of which is we had agents pushing out in advance of the former President and the close working detail. They were working on the fringes. They were working the wood line. They were working to the left and to the right of the fairway, specifically to identify, locate and potentially neutralize this exact type of threat. So, the protective model that has been put into place for these golfing operations was successful yesterday, but there is more work to be done. Again, we shouldn't be able to have somebody come that close to a perimeter that had a direct line of sight to the protectee, again, going back to the threat environment. The Secret Service needs to reassess constantly how they're deploying resources, both around the former President, again in thinking about those concentric rings of protection out, and what may need to be bolstered even further, now knowing that there are two assassination attempts.",

I mean, we spoke with our reporter Kevin Liptak about the sort of balance or the difference between how many Secret Services agents they currently have versus how many they hope to have. There have been reports of agents feeling burned out by overtime shifts and long assignments leading to high turnover.

I've heard the number thrown around that it's -- they're looking at a staffing level of approximately 9,500 personnel. That's a little bit arbitrary, right? Like, how are you coming up with that number? Again, the numbers should be predicated upon fully executing the dual mission of the Secret Service. And most people think about the Secret Service from the protective standpoint. There is also a significant investigative mission that the Secret Service has that is focused on crimes against the Treasury and protecting our financial infrastructure.And we have to make sure that both sides of the mission are appropriately resourced, again, matching the threat environment on the protective side, putting every available resource we can there, but also not diminishing the investigative responsibilities, and that can be done, but it takes a strategy moving forward to raise that level to the -- raise the staffing level of the Secret Service to the appropriate level, ensuring that both the protective investigative mission can be successful.",

He also learned the two counts that have been filed against him, as you mentioned, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.And I would expect, Rahel, that additional charges will be filed against him in the coming weeks and months. But, this investigation is still very new. So, they're going to need to figure out what specific charges fit this case, because some of the charges people may think of, either they may not exist in federal law or they're difficult to support. Now, the next hearing here will be his detention hearing. That will be on Monday. And Rahel, prosecutors say they want him to remain detained for the rest of this case, Rahel.",

Ryan Wesley Routh, seen here, being apprehended on Sunday, has criticized the former U.S. President for years. That criticism can be seen on both his social media and in his self- published book on Russia's war in Ukraine. The 58-year-old has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. In 2022, he said that he was willing to die in the fight. Now, let's being in CNN's Clare Sebastian, who joins us live from London.

We know that he was in Ukraine in the early months of the war, and that he had several ways that he wanted to help, all of which seemed to have failed. He originally wanted to volunteer himself. But, according to his self-published book, he was told that he was just too old and didn't have any military experience. He then turned his hand to trying to attract foreign volunteers. You see him there, this picture from June of 2022 on Maidan Square, where apparently he became a bit of a fixture in that first summer of the war. He sort of set up his makeshift volunteer center, which was then, again, according to his book, disassembled by the police. He tried to target Afghan soldiers, but that didn't seem to have gone anywhere.In fact, one U.S. Army veteran working for the International Legion in recruitment in Ukraine told us that actually he was so unqualified to be involved in the recruitment that it was more unhelpful than it was helpful. So, his efforts were largely frustrated. The -- there are various units in the Ukrainian military that handle volunteers. One -- both of them, actually, have said to us that they -- he had nothing to do with them, one calling his ideas \"delusional\". So, look, clearly, his passion for Ukraine also fueled his disappointment with U.S. leadership, and we can see this clearly in a clip from an interview that he did, also in June of 2022, with Newsweek Romania.
