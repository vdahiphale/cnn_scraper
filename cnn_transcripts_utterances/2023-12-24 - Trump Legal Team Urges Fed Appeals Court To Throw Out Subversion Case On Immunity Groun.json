Circuit. This D.C. Circuit case is moving on a rocket docket. Why do they do that? Because when it comes down to presidential immunity, they know, like the rest of us, they have a tough haul to say that the president is absolutely immune. Judge Chutkan has ruled that out, so they are grasping at straws to have another argument. It won't work.",

Nobody knows for sure.As I look at the calendar, I don't think this is going to prevent Jack Smith from trying his case in 2024. Here's why. Why did the D.C. Circuit order Trump to file his brief before midnight a couple days after Christmas on the holiday weekend? Because they are in a big hurry. They want the case fully briefed and they are going to have an oral argument on January 9th. They will decide within days after that. And then guess what happens? Back at the Supreme Court. So I think we are most likely seeing a short delay, short-ish. Of course, nobody knows for sure, but most likely 60 to 90-day delay and then Trump will be back in front of Judge Chutkan and in front of that D.C. jury.",

Now, the problem with that good decision is that it heads to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court is going to have the final word. They have never decided this 14th amendment question before.

And the -- that's because very like -- a similar tape that exists with Georgia and Brad Raffensperger pushing state election officials where court after court said the president has no business pushing them to make decisions to block the actual winner of the election from taking office, Joe Biden, and instead, Donald Trump to perpetuate himself by having these individuals violate their duties, so he can stay in office.And that raises the most profound legal questions and that's what the Jack Smith case is about. That's what state prosecutions of Donald Trump and others are about. And that's why John Roberts is, I think, going to try to find a way to move this Jack Smith case quickly.

If you can't run your, your computer system, your software, or your I.T., well, you can't be running an airline because, let's face it, airplanes are flying computers.
