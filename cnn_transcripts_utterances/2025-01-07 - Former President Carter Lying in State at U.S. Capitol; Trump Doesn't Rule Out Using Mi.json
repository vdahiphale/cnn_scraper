And atthe Capitol Rotunda, a commemoration is taking place marking the life of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. A service began in his honor last hour with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, among those providing eulogies. Members of Congress now filing past the coffin, paying their respects. His casket arrived at the U.S. Capitol earlier this afternoon, and he will now lie in state until his funeral on Thursday. Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill for us now, Manu, a somber day, but also, I think, a reflection of a life well lived, providing great service for many decades to the people he clearly loved.",

Of course, during his time, before he passed, Republicans often would criticize Jimmy Carter and his time in office. That was certainly not the case today. In fact, they were very effusive in his life that he has lived. The two Republican leaders who spoke at this eulogy in the Capitol Rotunda, Senator John Thune, who's the new Republican majority leader of the United States Senate, as well as Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking about his humble upbringings, from living in Plains, Georgia, really a remarkable ascension all the way to the presidency. And also talking about some of his achievements in office, trying to achieving peace between Egypt and Israel is one of his major lasting achievements. But also, not only that, but his work after he left the White House, what he did in terms of trying to advance the cause of peace and human rights through various causes, whether it's the Carter Center and working with in the Habitat for Humanity, actually going and building homes for people who are less fortunate. They talked a lot about that service as well. And we did hear also from the vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, who did eulogize and praise his life and his service, both in office and in -- and after office as well. This is the beginning of a process where official Washington will commemorate the life lived for -- by Jimmy Carter. This will now in the aftermath of today's service, he'll lie in state in the capital. The public will -- can come into the United States Capitol, pay the respects as he lies in state up until Thursday, and that's when the formal funeral will take place, where we expect to hear eulogies and also visits over the next couple of days, not just from President Biden, also, President-Elect Donald Trump is expected to pay his respects as well. So, a moment in which Washington, which is constantly, of course, feuding along party lines, coming together on a bipartisan basis to praise the life and service of the late Jimmy Carter, dead now 100 years old.

There was more discussion on the future ownership of Greenland. Trump also reiterated his offer to have Canada become part of the United States, suggesting he could use what he called economic force to make that happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Why are we supporting a country 200 billion plus a year? Our military is at their disposal, all of these other things. They should be a state.

I guess he hopes that his harsh words will be heard not just in Gaza, but also In Iran. To your first point, I think you're exactly right. I think Trump does see the world as a contest between strong countries and weaker ones. That's how he tries to coerce power. In fact, he told us in his -- one of his U.N. Assembly addresses in his first term that each country should aggressively pursue their own interests, and that's just fine. And that, of course, means like big countries like the United States, China, Russia, they get more of the spoils because they're bigger and more powerful. And I think Trump thinks that's just fine and that the United States is using its inherent advantages. That is a key underpinning of his attitude to the world.

Trump does have a history of getting wins and deals. For example, I would argue the first term U.S., Canada, Mexico trade pact, which honestly wasn't that much different than NAFTA, but which he portrayed as a massive win for American consumers and manufacturers. So, often this bluster does get a deal, but it doesn't amount to very much. Although, I would suggest in this term, his second term with this new administration and with some of the foreign policy professionals he's employing here, he's looking for more than just a little deals. He's looking to absolutely reshaped the way the United States operates in the world. ' CHATTERLEY:  And so, happy with the USMCA or the follow on from NAFTA that he now wants to renegotiate it, apparently. There's some irony there somewhere.

But later on, tonight, Julian, this number will probably approach 80 miles per hour. So, 120, 130 kilometers per hour over an area that is literally already on fire. So, this is going to be a dreadful disaster for the people there, Pacific Palisades, California. Here's Los Angeles. You'd know that Hollywood. You also know the Disneyland. But other than that, this is the area here as you begin to take the PCH toward Malibu. And the Pacific Palisades is a very affluent area of the part of Los Angeles County there and in toward Ventura County that you have very large homes in the mountains. And those homes are going to be on fire tonight. Many of them will be. This is a radar picture. I've taken the color away. Normally, it's green and blue and all that. I've taken the color away so you can see the ash in the sky. Radar can see raindrops, it can see snowflakes, but it can also see the ash in the air. The ash from the plume of the smoke that's been blowing offshore now, 100 miles offshore from the winds that are blowing across the area. Obviously, red flag warnings were posted. All this critical infrastructure here, we knew it was coming. They turned the power off in some places so that the power lines didn't come on and make a strike as the power lines fell off the pole. That spark would eventually make a fire. Well, that didn't even have to happen. We don't know what caused the spark and we wouldn't have had a fire without the spark. This was not caused by the wind. The wind caused the fire to explode to -- at this point in time, we're looking at over a billion-dollar natural disaster here with this fire. So, without a doubt, this is going to be a significant, significant storm, even if the homes that haven't burned yet, there's still so many embers out there that are blowing. And you can see here, this is the arrow of where the fire is, right here compared to Los Angeles down here and also towards San Diego. This is the area that's on fire now. If there are more fire starts, if there are more sparks we could get winds here again 80, 90 miles per hour tonight, that could cause more fires, Julia. And this is a disaster, all the way down to the Pacific Coast Highway, not quite to Malibu that actually burned last month, some of it did. And then not over toward L.A., which is kind of protected by a few canyons. But it's not out of the question that these 80, 90 mile per hour wind gusts tonight couldn't push these flames, push these embers for miles and miles and miles. Eventually, it'll get to the coast and then the flames won't matter and the sparks won't matter because they'll just land in the ocean. But for tonight, the people there of Pacific Palisades, California, are in for a fight. The firefighters are there, they're trying to take care of it, but there's not much you can do when the wind is blowing like this. Julia.",

We're seeing this broader shift at Meta, this effort to appeal to Trump ahead of his second administration. We also saw Zuckerberg visiting Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the election. The company has said it will donate a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund.

In South Korea, authorities haveextended an arrest warrant for the suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol. Investigators want to speak to him about his shock decision to briefly declare martial law last month. The warrant had been due to expire on Monday. Officials tried to detain the impeached president last week, but pulled back after being blocked by his security detail and soldiers. South Korea's transport minister says he will resign in response to last month's deadly Jeju Air crash. 179 people lost their lives when the Boeing plane crash landed and overshot its runway, hitting an embankment and bursting into flames. Seoul's transport ministry says it's working to improve the safety of airports landing systems to prevent a similar accident happening in the future. More than 120 people have died after a powerful earthquake struck Tibet. The 7.1 magnitude quake injuring close to 200 people with tremors felt as far away as Nepal and Northern India. Chinese state media reporting that rescue teams have been flown in to help locate survivors. And a fast-moving wildfire fanned by powerful winds is threatening homes and businesses in Los Angeles. The city says the Palisades Fire has now burned through nearly 800 acres or more than 300 hectares in around three hours. The area between Santa Monica and Malibu is home to around 27,000 residents. We'll have more on the development in this fire later in the show. For now, a reminder of one of our top stories today. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, ending its third-party fact-checking program, saying it's been too politically biased. X owner Elon Musk calling Meta's move, quote, \"cool.\" This is one of the significant changes Meta has recently made ahead of the incoming Trump administration.

On one hand, you have conservatives who have been begging for this for a long time. They've argued that their accounts have been shadow banned or censored. On the other, you have more progressive users that say, why am I getting this misinformation, this junk in my feed? And I will say, as a platform, this is a little bit of a risk that Meta faces. If you were to side too much with any one side, you risk alienating a huge chunk of the American population. This is the market where they make the most money. So, Meta today might be appeasing the new incoming Trump administration. They might be appeasing a large chunk of this country that agrees with that conservative outlook on free speech, but it also might be alienating a huge chunk of progressive users, and that's a business risk.",

They started to get political pressure because they were adding fact- checking partners from the right and from the left. And so, the fact- checking process itself became politicized. This is a very delicate dance move for anybody in media, as you mentioned, in tech.
