This is \"Connect the World\". And coming up this hour, the Iranian Foreign Minister says attacks will stop only when the assault on Gaza ends. And the United States Republican front runner Donald Trump is in court before heading to a campaign rally. Plus, China's economic data for 2023 is out. And while they experienced mild growth, the population shrank for the second year in a row. All right, and that is sure to have an impact when markets open those Chinese growth numbers really rattling the markets and what it means for the global economy. In New York markets are about to open in 30 minutes time as you can see we're red all round DOW Futures pointing to half a percent in the red. Right, now we start with the escalating tensions in the Middle East as Iran ramps up the attacks in the region are using missiles and drones to strike what it says are two Sunni militants' strongholds inside Pakistan. Pakistani officials say the attacks killed two children in the Koh-e-Sabz area. The Foreign Ministry is warning Iran of serious consequences. Iran says the militant group, it was targeting stormed a police station in Iran last month and killed 11 officers. Now the strikes in Pakistan come a day after Iran launched attacks in Iraq and in Syria claiming a targeted an Israeli spy base in Erbil in northern Iraq and anti-terror groups in Syria. Iranian media say the attacks were launched to address security concerns. Now Paula Hancocks joins us live here in studio, Paula, great to see you. There's just so much happening. This is pretty much a domino effect in terms of what we've been seeing of potential tensions, escalation spilling over into the region. But the Iranian Foreign Minister was speaking in Davos at the World Economic Forum has a very clear message, basically blaming Israel for what we're seeing today.",

      "sentences": "So I can paraphrase quickly just what the Prime Minister said. He effectively said that it was Israel that brought the conflict out of Gaza,specifying that they had targeted Hamas Leader in Beirut to saying that they were the ones that spread the conflict and made it a wider regional issue. Also pointing out that if the conflict in Gaza ended, if the war in Gaza ended then all of the proxies all of the allies of Iran would stop what they are doing as well. So really saying that it is all contingent on Israel ending what they are doing. But the fact is, we and many analysts don't know for sure just how much control Iran does have over many of these proxies that the Houthi rebels for example in Yemen. There's no guarantee that if the war in Gaza were to end tomorrow, that they would then pull back and stop their missile launchers against commercial vessels in the Red Sea for example. There's no guarantee that Tehran actually does have the control to be able to pull them back. Because even though many of these proxies and you're looking at proxies in Iraq and Syria in Yemen, in Hezbollah in Lebanon for example many of them are funded by Iran. They're equipped by Iran. They're often trained by Iran but they are not necessarily completely controlled by Iran. Tehran does not have the operational control of many of these groups. So it'll be interesting to see if and when this does end in Gaza whether this does calm the situation across the board?",

We know that a number of the hostages being held by Hamas have chronic medical conditions and have been you know require medication that they have not had access to during the time that they have been held hostage. An Israeli official telling me today that this deal is now underway that the transfer of this medication is indeed underway although we don't know exactly where in the process that medication actually is, this was agreed to by Hamas in exchange for Israel to allow the entry of additional humanitarian aid and medication into the Gaza Strip to some of the most affected areas of the Gaza Strip. We don't know exactly how much additional humanitarian aid that actually entails. But what we do know certainly is that conditions in Gaza are dire. The United Nations warning that a large swath of the population in Gaza is already facing famine.

      "sentences": "Yeah, so I would frame this as kind of a continuation of the rhetoric that we have seen from theBiden Administration over the last several months beginning of course, really in the secondary stages of Israel's war in Gaza where the administration started to have much tougher language when it came to protecting civilians inside Gaza. And urging the Israelis that to take greater steps to protect them and saying that the number of civilian deaths that were coming out of this conflict and that were being -- that resulted from Israel's war there were really unacceptable. And the administration has been pushing this line for a while now. But it does not seem to be changing Israel's behavior. As you mentioned there the administration had wanted to see Israel transition to a lower intensity phase of this conflict really by earlier this month. We have not yet seen that happened really in earnest. They had wanted to kind of see this shift more to a more targeted approach, more targeted operations, going after senior Hamas leaders inside Gaza in a way that would significantly reduce the civilian death toll there and that has not really occurred. And so the administration they've been pushing the Israelis to do this. But on the other hand, they're also looking past this current phase of the conflict towards what comes next in a post war scenario. That is really what administration officials here have been honing in on in their conversations with Israeli officials, not only to try to scale back the intensity of their operations in Gaza, but also to try to push forward, for example, normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Connecting that with the possibility of a two state solution create -- creation of a Palestinian state, leveraging the influence that they have over these negotiations between the Israelis and the Saudis to try to get to a place where maybe all of this is solved by the creation of a Palestinian state. Now obviously, that is very optimistic. And Jake Sullivan the National Security Adviser, he recognized that he acknowledged that in his remarks in Davos this week. But he said that Israeli one of the main priorities right now of U.S. officials is trying to get to this place where they can see the war solved really in a manageable and long term way that creates a two state solution and ultimately peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.",

We're seeing thatplaying out in real time in the Red Sea. The U.S. has said that anything that it does in Yemen is because they're trying to defend shipping routes. And it's an act of self-defense. We saw these strikes again in Yemen on Houthi assets. What is the assessment in terms of how successful they are in order to degrade the ability of the Houthis to target vessels?",

The U.S. has continued to launch additional kind of ad hoc strikes here and there against Houthi targets yesterday. It was against four ballistic missiles that the Houthis were apparently preparing to launch and that the U.S. had posed an imminent threat to vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. Navy vessels. So they're kind of taking out these assets as they see them being prepared, being you know, potentially launched by the Houthis. And the question is whether that is sustainable? Is the U.S. going to continue its surveillance of the Houthis to that extent where they try to preemptively prevent the Houthis from launching missiles into the Red Sea? But as we've seen even after the U.S. launched their strikes on these ballistic missiles yesterday, the Houthi still were able to launch a missile into the Red Sea that actually did strike a commercial ship. Did not cause significant damage but clearly it's going to have a continued the chilling effect on Red Sea shipping and ultimately international commerce.",

So she is expected to testify today sitting face to face with Donald Trump, who will just be a few feet away from her as she testifies about the impact of those statements. Her lawyer saying that Carroll has been scared since this happening saying that Trump's followers kind of latched on to his words and then bombarded her with hate filled messages and threats. So she says that Carroll has been scared that she sleeps with a gun beside her bed and the jury will now hear Carroll tell that in her own words while Trump is there. At the last trial and this took place last year Donald Trump did not tend to any days of the trial, but he was there yesterday. He's there again today. And he will be there when his lawyers cross examine E. Jean Carroll later today. And his defense in this case is that he can't be held responsible for the actions of his followers. He shouldn't have to pay for the mean tweets that people sent her. And they also argue that E. Jean Carroll wasn't actually harmed. And in fact her career prospered as a result of the fame that she received by going public. So ultimately, it will be up for the jury to decide. This is a jury of seven men, two women all from New York and the surrounding areas who will be making this decision and Donald Trump saying that he himself may take the stand later in this case, case is only expected to go about a week and Eleni, E.
