The judge's ruling as to fraud did not address issues of intent, issues of damages, and issues of victimhood, that is to say whether or not anybody was actually injured by the fraud. All of those are issues in which President Trump has some reasonable things to say. And if he said them, he could mitigate in a legal sense, the harm to his brand and his image.The problem for him is that he can't swallow the fraud charge at all. He can't admit to that in the first instance. So, his lawyers are constrained against trying to mitigate the damage. They have to fight this in a way that will not be successful.",

I mean, people are calling their pediatricians offices and being told that they don't have supplies, that they could schedule visits further out. Keep in mind a couple of things, Kate, first of all, this is the first year where the federal government has not handled the rollout. It's not to say that the rollouts went perfectly in past, but now providers, you pediatricians, for example, needs to call the manufacturer, get the right number of doses, not over or under order. There's a lot that goes to it. Another thing is, well, when the Public Health Emergency ended, Kate, that also meant that pharmacies could no longer give these shots to children under the age of six. So, now that the Public Health Emergency has ended, if your child is under the age of six, you have got to go to the pediatrician instead of the pharmacy, that can create bottlenecks as well. I should just point out, to your point, Kate, if you look at, sort of, the demand for these shots, in the past they hadn't been super high, but we have seen a five-fold increase now in the number of children were being hospitalized with COVID. Back in June, it was 237. Last week in September, it was closer to 1,200, 1,175 children hospitalized. So, you know, that -- those are obviously concerning numbers. I should point out that if you look at children under the age of four, they're making up about half of these admissions. So, it is really affecting young children primarily. And overall, kids, more than half of them, did not have any pre-existing conditions that were hospitalized. So, it is not just kids who are at risk for some reason. So, I think that that's added to the demand as well, Kate.",

MANDY COHEN, CDC DIRECTOR:  We do know that our manufacturers and distributors were getting out the adult vaccines first. So, that was what was shipping in the first number of days. And now, they are shipping pediatric vaccines. So, what I would say is that the supply is filling out. (END VIDEO CLIP) DR. GUPTA:  So, again, it makes sense in some ways. People over the age of 65 are still the highest risks. So, making sure the vaccine was available for them first. But this should've been available before the start of schoolyear when we knew the numbers were going go up just like we've seen there. So, hopefully it will settle in as Dr. Cohen suggests.",
