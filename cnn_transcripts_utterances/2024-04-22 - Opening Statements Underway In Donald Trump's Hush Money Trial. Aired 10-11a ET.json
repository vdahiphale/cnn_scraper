Hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Joining us now is CNN senior and crime justice reporter Katelyn Polantz who's been following this all very closely. So, as we look at where we stand here, things really getting underway. The judge giving the jury instructions. There was one juror earlier this morning, before court began who actually went and spoke with the judges and the attorneys. This juror was concerned about all the media attention that this trial has received. And there was some currency -- maybe jurors could drop out, ultimately the jury is going to stay. What more do we know though about the concerns?",

It was a female juror, we don't know that much about this juror that she had called Trump, our president in her voir dire, but there wasn't much more that we could really flesh out of where she stands on things. She had some concerns. She talked to the judge, the prosecutors and defense team were also in chambers talking with her, took about five minutes. And the judge ultimately said she's going to stay on the panel at this time. These things may come up. We saw a lot of jurors coming back for a second day during the jury selection process last week, where they were saying, you know, I changed my mind. I can't -- I can't do this. And so, that's possible. But that's why you have six alternates. Yes, at this point, no alternates are being used.

So, as we look at -- you know, Katelyn, just laid out for us what the judge said couldn't be included if Donald Trump decided to take the stand. It is remarkable how much of that would be allowed in.

There's no way he would want to be on that stand. Putting aside he has a terrible penchant for perjuring himself and, you know, misstating facts. The idea that he would subject himself to that kind of cross examination, be out of control, having someone else be in control over him to ask these embarrassing questions, going to his credibility and its truthfulness, there's no chance.

And yet, that gag order, of course only applies to certain people. It only applies to Donald Trump, it was interesting, his campaign sending out an e- mail over the weekend, railing on the case, saying that it relies on testimony of some of the most disreputable and fame thirsty characters on the planet.

So, the question becomes, assuming Judge Merchan includes, yes, he did, in fact, violate the gag order. What is the actual punishment he'll impose? The D.A. isn't asking for anything beyond monetary fines right now, which Trump could easily pay and stricter warnings to Trump. But Merchan has a lot of discretion. And so, there's going to be a point here, especially if Trump doesn't get the hint, based off what Merchan says of does Donald Trump gets stuck in jail for a night or two?

He got immunity from the feds back in 2018, when the Southern District of New York was looking into this and they ultimately prosecuted and convicted Michael Cohen, the media organization who was running the National Enquirer got a non-prosecution agreement. He has critical facts, but he's a bit of a wildcard because this was a longtime friend of Donald Trump. And as far as I can tell, he hasn't ever stopped necessarily being friendly to Donald Trump.

And as those instructions are being given, of course, everyone sees it one another there. Reminder, Donald Trump is there as a defendant because he's charged with 34 felony counts rather of falsifying business records to hide the reimbursement of what's known as hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That was of course in advance of the 2016 election. And prosecutors say that's crucial here because they say the former president did it as a candidate then, because the election was coming up and he didn't want that information out there.

On the one hand, I think there are many abroad who don't understand why the first trial is not about the core questions of whether or not the president tried to illegally seize power through manipulating the election. And of course, explaining that the way these come to the calendar works on these is not easy. But on the other hand, I think there is a respect for the United States of the rule of law actually does reach as well to the president and former president.

If he won the president seat in the federal trials, there's a lot of speculation that he would try or more likely that he would derail a prosecution once he was in office. In any case, almost all prosecutions would be delayed until he was out of office. So, it tells you that the stakes for former President Trump in running are pretty high because he's not just running for office, he's running for his freedom here, whether or not or potential freedom, whether or not he would stand trial. And then, of course, there will be the constitutional questions that will have to be adjudicated if once the president comes in, could he interfere in his own prosecution? Now, we're not there yet.

So, that hearing is incredibly consequential for Donald Trump not only relating to the cases that apply to which would be the January 6, a federal case of being prosecuted in Washington, but also repercussions for forever relating to that question and that issue of presidential immunity.

They wanted to ask him about all of the lawsuits that he's faced and lost his civil fraud verdict. That was the one where there was a gag order that he violated. That verdict is quite significant from New York State against him. He's trying to appeal it to hold it off at this very moment, in fact. And then, on top of that, they'll be able to ask about the defamation cases E. Jean Carroll one against Donald Trump also resulting in sizable verdicts for defaming her. So, this is a lot that the defense will take into consideration as they weigh whether to call Donald Trump take the stand. He says he wants to be a witness on his own behalf. He is very likely a man who may be tempted. He did so in one of the E. Jean Carroll cases. He took the stand, made quite a scene in the courtroom, attacked the judge, derailed things. This is a criminal case. And he would be under oath. And there will be a decision his defense team will have to make.

That strategy, prosecutors are saying is going to show there were three things that were happening., One, to make flat -- make flattering stories about Donald Trump, be out there in the National Enquirer. Have attack stories about Trump opponents. So, stories that would make his opponents look bad, other people in the Republican Party. And then, crucially, there was also an effort to prevent information from getting out there. That is the piece of this. The Stormy Daniels' payment to keep her quiet. The other payments to women, to Karen McDougal, that American Media was part of, that Pecker has already said publicly that yes, he was -- he did that. (CROSSTALK)",

The type of records that you would have, because you were doing legal work. And so, the prosecution isn't just going to be talking about Michael Cohen, and what he said and David Pecker and what he said, it's very much going to be connecting this all back to the campaign.

Additionally, if this is a conspiracy case, and it is. A conspiracy just means an agreement. So, it's not just words, but it's also how someone acts in accordance with what the alleged agreement is. So, I suspect the state is going to have ample evidence to show that Mr. Trump acted in accordance with what the agreement was. That this just wasn't a happenstance cooked up by other people. That he went along with it. I think there's going to be evidence of a meeting in the White House with Mr. Cohen. Now, I think Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump are the only people there.

We are getting some really interesting details from this statement from inside the courtroom. You can follow them along as well in real time, as you see there on the side of your screen, as the prosecution is laying out its case. Donald Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment in 2016 ahead of the presidential election. And the prosecution laying that out now. I want to bring in my colleague, Katelyn Polantz, who's here with me, we are seeing some very specific evidence be referred to by the prosecution. They say they're going to talk about the recording of a phone call between Michael Cohen and former President Trump. They are going to talk about also decisions that were made in a separate deal to keep information out of the public eye ahead of the election. That is not what's on trial here, but they are bringing it in why. Just to set up a pattern of behavior?",

What has been so far articulated by the prosecutors is they are telling the jury, not only are you going to hear about what American media was doing with David Pecker, he'll be expected to be the first witness. They also were here a recording Michael Cohen took with his cell phone in September of 2016 with Trump talking about not the Stormy Daniels payment, but a payment made of $150,000 to a woman named Karen McDougal, a model and actress she had approached the National Enquirer through a lawyer and said I have a story to tell in 2016 about an alleged affair with Donald Trump. And at that time, that is when David Pecker, his organization and the editors there said to her, oh, well, we'll find a way to get you money to get your life rights to this story. And then, what they did once they acquired the rights to the story is buried. And so, that's the idea of catch and kill that we're going to hear playing out not just in this, but in a couple other instances. What David Pecker is very likely to be testifying about Karen McDougal, is not the falsification of records charge here, that is about the separate, $130,000. How that was marked on checks in financial records of the Trump Organization, to Michael Cohen, those are the charges, but it is a very similar pattern, and a very similar idea as far as what Trump wanted to do, and why?
