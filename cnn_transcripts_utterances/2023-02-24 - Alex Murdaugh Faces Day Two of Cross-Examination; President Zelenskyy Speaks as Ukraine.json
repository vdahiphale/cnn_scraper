The millions of Ukrainians who've endured this war over the past year. It's a day of sadness because they recognize that the war indeed will continue for quite some time.There are so many parts of this country that have returned to, you know, some kind of normalcy. There are cities where people have gone back to life, that people who had left the country have returned to, whether it's Lviv or Kyiv or Odessa or here where I am in Dnipro. But this is not a normal life. This is a time when air-raid sirens are going off all the time. Attacks, missile attacks, drone attacks taking place all across the country. And of course in the eastern part of the country, towns and the cities have been decimated. This war is essentially at a standstill, that frontline is quite stagnant, it is grinding, and it is active. And so there is a recognition that it is going to be quite some time before the Russian forces can be pushed out. That's why President Zelenskyy is saying time is of the essence to get that foreign aid into Ukraine as fast as possible -- Jim, Kristin.",
