I'm Poppy Harlow, with Phil Mattingly in New York.This morning, we are watching growing threats of the Israel/Hamas war spreading to a much wider conflict. New overnight, the Israeli military ramping up air strikes after announcing it was expanding its ground assault to the entire Gaza Strip, including in South. That is where so many civilians have fled. The IDF says the strikes destroyed 200 Hamas targets.",

Now the Israelis have, over social media, put out a map showing hundreds of individual blocks that are numbered. And in theory, people can go onto that map. There's a QR code, and know where is safe and where is not. The problem is most people in Gaza don't have electricity to charge their phones; don't have an Internet connection. And therefore, they're very much really left to their own devices. And of course, another problem is, already the shelters, the schools that have been converted into shelters in Gaza are already crammed with people, as many as 4 to 500 people per toilet, if there's even an toilet. And therefore, when they hear that the Israelis are going to expand their ground operations to the entirety of the Gaza Strip that really doesn't leave anything anywhere, for anybody to go that could possibly be safe -- Phil, Poppy.",

The U.S. says the attackers launched ballistic missiles and drones that hit three ships linked to several countries, including Israel. The Navy sent the USS Carney to respond and shoot down those drones in self-defense. [06:05:04] The U.S. blaming the attack on rebels backed by Iran, operating in Yemen. It is the largest attack targeting ships in the region, and it's stoking fears of a wider conflict. Want to bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who joins us live from the Pentagon. And Natasha, before I start with you, just to give kind of an example for people on the map of where this is all happening, obviously, Israel up here, Ben talking about what's happening in the North near Lebanon. Syria is also an area where proxies have been operating. We're talking specifically in this area here: the Red Sea, down in Yemen, which also has proxy organizations tied to Iran. They have been a significant player in the dozens of attacks on U.S. ships, on other commercial ships over the course of the last several weeks. I think the big question right now, particularly in the wake of those hostage negotiations breaking down, that pause coming to an end, is this a sign that an escalation is coming, or is this just a return to what we saw the six of seven weeks before that pause?",

This is a number of attacks, four attacks on three separate commercial vessels in the Southern Red Sea, including one attack in which the Houthis used a ballistic missile. Now, the USS Carney responded to each of these attacks which occurred on Sunday at several different times throughout the day and many of them resulted in damage to these commercial vessels in the Southern Red Sea. And the U.S. now says that this is really, really dangerous, obviously. Not only did the USS Carney respond to these attacks, but they also shot down a number of drones that were launched from these Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, according to Central Command. So clearly, they're taking advantage right now of the tumult in the region of all of the U.S. presence in the region to try to attack these ships. And the Houthi-run Yemeni armed forces actually acknowledged these attacks in a statement yesterday, saying that they will continue to wage these attacks against these, quote, \"Israeli ships and those aligned with Israel,\" standing in solidarity, they say, with the Palestinians. In a statement, U.S. Central Command said that these attacks represent a, quote, \"direct threat\" to international commerce and maritime security. They say that \"they have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing dozens -- multiple countries around the world,\" as many as 14 different countries. And importantly, they said that they have every reason to believe that these attacks are fully enabled by Iran. Now, the big question is how the U.S. is going to respond. Of course, we've seen the U.S. military strike these Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria over the last several weeks. But Yemen, whether they're going to go after the Houthis in Yemen, that remains an entirely different question. But they said that they will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with allies and partners -- Phil.",

There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are running out of money and nearly out of time.\" She added, \"Cutting off the flow of weapons and equipment will kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield, not only putting at risk the gains Ukraine has made but increasing the likelihood of Russian military victories.
