You`re looking at 4,000 tons of steel and concrete that are sitting on top of that bow. That is going to be the most complicated part of this operation. Moving all of that debris and taking it off the ship so that they can begin this cleanup process and then there`s everything that`s laying below the surface. The part that we can`t see. There is more metal, more concrete, more debris in the water and that`s going to be critical because they have to be able to make that safe for the divers whose mission it is to get back into the water and continue searching to attempt to recover the bodies of those who were lost. But as we`re sitting here, you know, now finally being able to really see it and get up close to it, you really just get a sense of the enormity of the job at hand. But all the officials here have told us that they are confident that they`re going to be able to get it done. They`re working together, have all of the technology necessary and they`re going step by step, taking a meticulous approach to make sure that they get it right and that eventually they can reopen the port. They can start rebuilding and that this important symbol for the City of Baltimore, and the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland can get cleaned up and the people here can start getting back to normal. I`m Gloria Pazmino, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Wolf is your answer here. They`ve created havoc in \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\" \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" and \"The Three Little Pigs,\" just to name a few. Owooooo, sorry, just getting reintroduced to my inner wolf. And that`s a lot like what`s happening in Colorado, where people voted to reintroduce wolves back into their state. That`s the first time ever in the country`s history that a state has voted on this kind of ballot initiative. But as Lucy Kafanov shows us, after the vote passed by a slim margin, some folks in the more rural parts of the state weren`t exactly howling with joy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
