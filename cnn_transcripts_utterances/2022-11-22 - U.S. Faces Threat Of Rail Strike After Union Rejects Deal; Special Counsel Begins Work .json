      "sentences": "Workers at the biggest and most powerful rail union have voted down a tentative contract deal, and if the two sides cannot reach an agreement soon there might be a strike, which industry officials have estimated could cost the economy more than $2 billion per day.Freight rail obviously makes up a huge chunk of the American supply chain. And a strike means that food prices could skyrocket even more than they've already been raised because rail is absolutely crucial in getting those products to consumers. Even gas prices could increase given 300,000 barrels are moved daily by rail. And about 75 percent of all cars and trucks built in the United States or imported here are also moved by rail. That could mean a big shortage and massive price hikes. And if you're a commuter, you might also be in trouble because nearly 97 percent of passenger rail used by Amtrak actually runs on freight lines. On top of all of that, the holidays are obviously right around the corner, meaning the strike could come during peak buying season. So, joining us now to talk about the stakes here is Jeremy Ferguson, who is the president of SMART Transportation Division. That's the union that yesterday rejected that tentative labor deal and represents about 28,000 conductors, brakemen, yardmen, and others who all have a lot involved here. So, Jeremy, thank you so much for joining us this morning. You say that you believe a strike could still be averted. How? JEREMY FERGUSON, PRESIDENT, SMART TRANSPORTATION DIVISION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, first, thank you for having me. It's a pleasure to be on here. And I would just simply like to say that yes, a strike could be averted. The ball is back in the carriers' hands at this point -- or back in their court. And we go back into negotiations this afternoon. Talks will begin. I will be there with the three other unions that had failed agreements. But it will be a difficult process and we're going to do our best. We want to keep America moving and we sure - surely want to help Santa Claus get those gifts delivered for Christmas also.",

It's the quality of life and how they're treated with dignity and respect while they're at work.

And a lower court granted that request. A so-called special master was appointed to go through about 22,000 documents. And the need for speed is really what's at stake here. As we know, the former president -- he has successfully used delay as a litigation tactic for decades. But there are concerns about how far this investigation will go into the 2024 presidential cycle. You heard the attorney general on Friday when he announced Smith's appointment, saying this is not going to slow anything down. I've even spoken with sources close to Smith who say look, this is not a guy who dawdles. He's someone who moves quickly.
