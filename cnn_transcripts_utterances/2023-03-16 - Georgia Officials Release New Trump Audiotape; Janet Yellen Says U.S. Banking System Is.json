Goldman Sachs says the chaos unfolding in the banking sector has boosted the odds of a recession in the U.S. within the next year. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is about to wrap up her Senate testimony, and she argued the fallout has been contained. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I can reassure the members of the committee that our banking system is sound, and that Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when they need them. This week's actions demonstrate our resolute commitment to ensure that our financial system remains strong and that depositors' savings remained safe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, as you mentioned, all of these stocks, they were actually down very sharply earlier today. First Republic was down 36 percent at the opening bell, very steep losses, after days of steep losses. But look at this. They're all moving higher. First Republic is now up 10 percent on the day. And that's because we have Wall Street banks. They are in talks to rescue First Republic, this ailing regional bank. That's according to a person familiar with the matter. Now, these banks that are in talks to rescue this company, they're talking about a major capital infusion. And the rescue would come from the industry itself, Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo. These are some of the banks that are in talks for a rescue. Now, nothing has been announced officially. These banks, along with First Republic, they're all declining to comment. But a deal could be announced as soon as today. Now, just word of this potential rescue has turned the entire stock market around. U.S. markets opened the day in the red. But look at this. Now we have the Dow up 350 points, 1.1 percent, even bigger gains, 2.2 percent for the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P is up 1.7 percent. Now, over in Europe, they already have a rescue in place for Credit Suisse. This is the ailing Swiss bank whose stock was crumbling yesterday. But the Swiss National Bank, their Central Bank, announcing a $54 billion rescue. Now, the fact that the markets are all up on this shows, Brianna, just how concerned everyone is about the banking industry right now.",

You're backed up there. But we're looking, of course, at maybe some folks who have more than that and businesses that have more than that and may not be insured.

We know that the FDIC insures up to $250,000, no matter what the bank is doing, no matter what the bank stock is doing. The question is, what would they do if the next bank failed? And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she was asked about this, whether or not all depositors would be saved above the $250,000 limit, and she sort of said they would be saved if a supermajority of the regulators, herself, and, after advising the president, they all agreed that they needed to rescue them. So it was sort of a dodge, but I do think the government is implying, Brianna, that they would rescue all depositors, even the uninsured ones.",

This is particularly significant, because last week there was actually this big spike in jobless claims that raised some questions, are there some cracks showing up in the jobs market? The latest numbers suggest that is not the case. Mortgage rates -- we know mortgage rates they have spiked as the Fed has waged this war on inflation. Some good news on that front, because mortgage rates, after several weeks in a row, they have gone down in the last week to 6.6 percent. Of course, that is almost double where they were a year ago. I think the question now is, what does all this bank stress mean for the economy? And as you mentioned at the top, Goldman Sachs is actually out with a new report raising the risk of a recession. They're still betting on a soft landing, Brianna, but they now see a 35 percent chance of a recession in the United States over the next 12 months. And they point specifically to the risk that all the stress in the bank industry causes banks to slow down loans, and that would actually trickle down into the real economy.",

So, Justin, we heard the CEO of one of these embattled regional banks telling CNN this morning, the crisis is over. That was the quote.

And we saw that there were some banks were that were more exposed to financial distress than you might hope for. Secretary Yellen is correct, though, to say the government then moved forward with an absolutely forceful plan, effectively saying to all Americans that, if you have got money in the bank, we're going to make sure that it's there, no matter what sort of financial distress your bank gets into. Now, banking is a confidence game. And so that gives you and I and all our viewers the confidence that your money will remain in the bank, and that, in itself, is enough to prevent further financial distress. So there may be a few smaller banks that have some trouble along the way, like First Republic. But I think the overwhelming message right now is, think about the dog that didn't bark. Over the past few days, we have heard no really big stories about new bank collapses, about people being nervous, about enormous amounts of money flowing out of banks. And it's the absence of bad news that is really terrific news about the stability of the financial system.",

That's completely different than 2008.So if we do have further banks like First Republic collapse, that'd be very sad for the folks who work there. And the shareholders will lose money. But in terms of its implications for the broader American economy as a whole, even if all the small banks tightened up their lending enormously, it would have a very small effect, because most of the lending happens out of the large banks. And so I worry about the people who are directly affected by these collapses, but I'm not so worried about broader macroeconomic spillovers.",

So they still have a structural impact on the banking system. And, really, what it is goes back to this fragility and confidence. So the key thing here right now is, if you look at where the marketplace is, yes, the market is reacting positively to what the Treasury secretary said on the Hill today. We have to calm fears. If J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley, who were in discussions with First Republic Bank right now, can find a happy solution, that will abate the nervousness in the market right now. The issue, though, is that a lot of venture capital and technology money, a lot of health care money were associated with some of this bank risk. So, when you simply just say, OK, some of the midsized banks not as big an issue, as long as we know that they're folded into another large institution, and you can feel safe about that. But there will be impacts in the commercial market, right? We're seeing what's debt, basically, on companies that are what you call high yield, a little riskier, get a little dangerous, right, because can they pay their bills? Right? Those will be the kinds of questions we start seeing in the months ahead. So the reason Goldman Sachs is coming out and saying they have increased the risks of recession by 10 percent is because what we're starting to see are some structural issues that we need to wrap our arms around. And some of that, right, is a reflection of raising interest rates so quickly to address inflation.",

I mean, it's no surprise that the assessment is that the orders to interfere with this international airspace peaceful mission the part of the United States was directed from above. And then you have two Sukhois that are in the area. And so they do their thing. I mean, it's -- and it's crazy. Who drops fuel on another aircraft? And then you ram into it, which affects its ability to maneuver. And so the United States very wisely puts it down. This is a level of provocation that is incredibly -- look, it's incredibly unbelievable, but it's believable when it's coming from the Russians. This is the Russians, Brianna, operating in what's called the gray area. Look, they're not going to directly take on NATO and the United States and Ukraine. So they will operate on the tangents. And they will do what they can, even though this is completely within legal parameters. I mean, the -- this is international airspace, international waters, yet the Russians are interfering. So it's their ability, their desire to try to exercise influence. And I would also think this is a sphere of influence thing as well, where they're directing or at least they're stating through their actions that the Black Sea belongs to them, which is lunacy as well.",
