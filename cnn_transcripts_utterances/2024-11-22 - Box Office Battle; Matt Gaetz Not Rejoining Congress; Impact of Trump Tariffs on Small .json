Ryan Zagata, president of Brooklyn Bicycle Company, and Laurel Orley, the CEO and co-founder of Daily Crunch, joins us. And I have been looking forward to this conversation because we talk about what it could mean for small business owners, and now we can speak to you directly to see what's going through your mind as you look ahead. Laura, you are a relatively young company. Bobbie formula, it's an organic baby formula. And I'm just wondering, as you look ahead to the next four years, what are you expecting, based on what you have heard from president-elect Trump and his plans? LAURA MODI, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, BOBBIE:  I mean, I think we're going to see a big push around tariffs, yes, and I think questions around our own supply chain and what it means around prices. And what we clearly saw was that there was questions from those that voted around the cost of goods. And as an essential product that is feeding those vulnerable audience, we can't ignore it.",

And only against that backdrop are you going to see those tariffs. And the thinking is that we will be able to absorb that, that our economy will be able to absorb that. And that's what happened last time is, we put in tariffs, there wasn't huge inflation because there were all these other things going on. And then when you really drill down to a product-by-product basis, it's different, right? There are some products where what's going to end up happening is that other countries will absorb the costs. And there are some products where costs will get passed on. There's no question about that. But the point is you have to look at that holistically. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have bags where we were sourcing them in the United States and we wanted to source them to come from China to save five to 10 cents a bag.

So -- and they're going to keep on going up, because everybody's getting their raw materials shipped now. And there's not a lot -- enough space for all of this to go.

You almost need to look in a targeted way.And in some ways, it could actually help some industries. So, for infant formula very specifically, the more you can invest domestically, the more you can invest in domestic manufacturing and domestic supply chains, over time, you will be able to reduce those prices. So scale gets you lower prices. And when -- I can't ignore feeding babies and the fact that there is parents and there's families out there who are looking at the cost of goods, and they have voted on the fact that prices are high. So we're actually going to take action and we are going to reduce our prices across the board for infant formula because we have spent the last two years to invest domestically.",

I think, again, for us, considering that the manufacturing hub is predominantly in Asia, there is -- if it's a blanket tariff across the board -- I think there was talk of a 60 percent tariff on China and then a 10 percent to 20 percent tariff across the board.There isn't really an easy solution beyond passing that cost onto consumers. As I mentioned before, our margins are not such that we're lining our pockets with costs. I think that the bulk of our money is going to manufacturing and then our other partners, and we'd have to pass that cost on to consumer. I mean, small businesses are very much uniquely challenged. I don't have the option of calling up Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan to do a bond offering to build a factory. We have limited options in contract manufacturing work for us. So we have to work within the framework that we have built our business on. And that's going to be passing that price increase on to consumers.",

I think we're trying to take this day by day and really trying to understand how we can get ahead of the curve.[11:40:05] We produce in the United States. So, both our co-manufacturers are based in Wisconsin and Connecticut. We're very proud of that. But, also, we are scaling so fast that we no longer can warehouse our materials and everything in our co-packers. So now we have to go ahead and head with finding a warehouse, and with all these costs increasing, that's going to affect our margins. We also don't have a lot of margins to play with being such a fast grow. We're only 4 years old. So we were hoping to save on some of these margins and to help our margins increase.

This obviously comes as we know that there are still questions about whether or not that Ethics report is going to be released. But in this interview, he also talked about what happened in some of those meetings up on Capitol Hill. He downplayed any kind of impact that the Ethics report had, but instead said that, while he had some momentum with senators, he felt he had to explain himself quite a bit. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  And, again, while our discussions were going well, I found myself having to do two jobs at one time, Charlie, and you got a front-row seat to this, I had a full-time job explaining to senators that maybe a tweet I sent about them was rash and not reflective of how I would serve as attorney general.
