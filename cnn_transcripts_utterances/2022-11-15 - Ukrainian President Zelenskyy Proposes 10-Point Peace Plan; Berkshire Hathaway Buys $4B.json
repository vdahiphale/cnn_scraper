His huge Tesla pay check has a plenty of irate. Walmart's results still looking great, but will holiday sales be a little sedate. And fresh look at inflation at the factory gate and let's begin there just released numbers show inflation at the wholesale level, aka factory gate prices rising some 8 percent year over year last month that is a substantial easing from September levels and month over month CPI raising half as much as expected too. Today's numbers of course coming after last week's encouraging read on consumer prices too. We'll dive into the data with Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, later on in the program. The big question remains have we seen peak inflation? And of course, how quickly will it come down? Here's the post PPI price action U.S. futures ready to rally. Tech futures are up some 3 percent or near so you can see that in the middle of your screen Europe mostly higher too, as Germany enters a new bull market for stocks. New data shows Investors they're feeling better about the inflation picture too. That said, of course inflationary concerns certain to factor into the holiday shopping outlook. Walmart today posting very strong third quarter sales numbers they're also raising their guidance. It's a strong contrast of course to Amazon, which is reportedly set to layoff some 10,000 workers after warning of weaker holiday sales. In the meantime, though nothing but green arrows in Asia today a fresh push higher. After conciliatory words from the U.S. and China at their Monday meeting in Bali and we discussed that yesterday strong online shopping data from today, China also helping too. Alibaba and Tencent soaring in fact more than 10 percent the HANG SENG where those two stocks are listed is now up more than 12 percent over the past three sessions. You can see that some pretty beaten up levels but wow, what a turnaround. And another Big Tech winner, Taiwan chip Colossus TSMC Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealing a multibillion dollar investment, chipmakers already on a roll in recent weeks. But this move has also huge geopolitical implications, too. We'll discuss that later on in the show. But first, we've just learned that, there have been two explosions in Kyiv. Air raid sirens astounding across Ukraine and people are being asked to shelter in place. Government officials say air defenses have been activated. And Sam Kiley joins us now.

Images circulated widely on Chinese social media show residents under lockdown in Guangzhou defying local orders. Some are seen breaking through roadway barriers that were meant to confine them at home. And in one video, a woman's voices heard in the background saying \"They are revolted\". Now CNN has been able to geo locate these images to the hydro district of Guangzhou, but we cannot independently confirm them. On Tuesday, local officials confirmed that large parts of the district are still under lockdown with the area's Deputy Head Su Ming-Qing saying this \"We have also realized many of our shortcomings\". Guangzhou is a major economic hub that's home to 90 million people as become the epicenter of a nationwide COVID 19 outbreak. On Monday, Guangzhou reported record COVID 19 infections along with other major cities including Beijing. And even though the case numbers are very low compared to global standards, China has been holding tight to its zero COVID policy a policy of mass testing lockdowns and border controls, which has disrupted both lives and livelihoods of the protests in Guangzhou come weeks after video emerged of a rare protest in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa over China's tough pandemic rules. And that brazen protest in Beijing that directly attacked China's zero COVID policy. One banner read in part \"No to lockdown, yes to freedom\". And despite the rising public discontent, China is sticking with zero COVID. To Beijing, the policy is necessary to save lives and to protect China's medical systems.

As I mentioned earlier in the show newdata released this morning shows U.S. wholesale prices rose by 8 percent year over year last month. That is, in fact a slower pace than the 8.5 percent we saw back in September. Now our next guest says the Central Bank of may have done enough already to tackle rising prices, though Investors did overreact to last week's inflation report. And Paul Krugman joins us now he's Nobel laureate, economist, columnist for the New York Times and a Professor of Economics at City University of New York. Paul, fantastic to have you on the show as always! One data point does not a trend make, especially in this crazy world and economic cycle. But just talk us through your thinking and why you believe Investors certainly overreacted to last week's print with such great enthusiasm? PAUL KRUGMAN, OP-ED COLUMNIST, NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I mean, it's clear, I mean, monthly data are really noisy. And you really shouldn't be reached conclusions based on one month. That's been the lesson all the way along. But the thing about inflation, I think the issue here is that if you look under the hood, if you look below the headline numbers below the standard calculations. But we know that there are issues, there's a lot of evidence that inflation is coming down, and wage growth has been decelerating. A lot of the growth we've been seeing in the CPI is shelter inflation, which we know lags far behind actual market rents, which have drastically decelerated. The trouble I think for markets was it was hard to believe that even though people know about all of that. It's really hard to place your faith in underlying sources when the headlines keep on coming out bad. And so these now two inflation reports that are favorable, are, you know, are a good basically give people the excuse they needed to look at the underlying data.",

And just explain that, because you've also been quoted and widely quoted as saying you think the Federal Reserve has probably done enough tightening at this stage?

There's inflation lags the state of the economy, and actually the way we measure inflation, notout of any kind of malice or bad calculation. But you know, the, the measures we use, particularly the consumer price index is to measure the cost of living. But we're using it as a gauge of the state of the economy and because shelter prices play such a large role, when they those basically feed off of market rents. Well, most people who rent have leases that are a year or more. And so you don't actually see what's happening in the market for a long time. So there's a big lag in published inflation numbers behind what's actually happening in the market, then there are long effects of monetary policy that Milton Friedman said monetary policy works with long and variable lags. When the Fed raises rates, that has to work its way through it operates largely through housing. So you have to have a decline in housing starts, which then translate some months later into a decline in real residential investment. And that, in turn, has multiplier effects on consumer spending, all of that takes quite a while. The channel that runs through the value of the dollar takes even longer. So, you know, what is the Fed is doing now is really going to have its impact on the economy, you were into 2023. So there's a pretty good case. And I will say that the consumer spending is surprisingly strong, the economy is surprisingly strong. But I still think there's between the fact that we know there's a fair bit of inflation reduction in the pipeline already and the fact that we know that a lot of the effects of monetary tightening have yet to be felt. There's a pretty good case for saying that the Fed has already done enough.",

And relying on you know, what's happened over the past three months as a kind of compromise that filters out some of the noise, but it's still fairly close to current events. If we end up with a 3-month inflation rate that is way down and that would be two more good prints, then I think the Fed would say, OK, let's, let's freeze this thing. So it'll be a little while before they're willing to do that. But you know, they're making the same, they're operating in much the same framework as all of us on the outside looking at them. And I think they may be inclined to be tougher, because they feel they need to make up for having under cold inflation before, but ultimately, it's the same, it's the same logic.

While leaders meet in Bali for the G20 back in Egypt, delegates at COP27 continue to discuss ways toaddress the climate crisis, including how we grow and produce food. And to be specific raising livestock for human consumption generates nearly 15 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, that's more than transportation yet, look how much we talk about that. It impacts biodiversity; it's a leading cause of deforestation. And yet as I mentioned, it's rarely discussed. Well, our next guest is determined to turn the planet away from this type of farming and focus on this instead grown in a lab. He describes it as sustainable, safe and importantly doesn't compromise on texture or taste. The company behind it insists this is still real meat, meat without killing animals or tearing down forests. Enjoyed by diners attending COP27 meat substitutes, though, have struggled to go more mainstream in the real world, including how to make the entire business itself profitable. And that's how we find Josh Tetrick. He's the CEO of Eat Just. Josh, fantastic to have you on the show! Now I leadingly there said people were enjoying it at COP27.

So what we're trying to do is to say we don't need all that, we don't need all the land, we don't need all the animals, and we don't need all the carbon emissions. Let's start with the cell. That's step one. Step two is identifying nutrients for the cells. So think amino acids, fats, sugars, salts. Step three is we place that cell on with the appropriate feed in a vessel. It's a stainless steel vessel that essentially enables a cell to grow. And then step four, we get the meat out. So it's a way from sell to final product, making meat without all the resources and we have 8 billion people on the planet today. How many more animals can we have? How much more of our planet can we actually use to feed them? This is a different way. And ultimately we think it's going to be the way that we all produce meat.",

Now, the big challenge is different, it sounds a little bit different. And we've talked to lots of consumers about it. And basically, if you're under the age of 30, what you say is, listen, I don't care if my meat is made in a stainless steel vessel, and if you're over the age of 50, you have lots of questions about it. And if you compare the time, so let's use a chicken as an example, it takes from chick to slaughter about 45 days for chicken to grow to produce our meat, the time it takes to do it with a cell is about 12 to 14 days. So it's a quicker, cleaner, safer, much more carbon efficient process. And ultimately, in addition to it just tasting like chicken, this is why we think it's going to win.",

Today, we're many times and the only place in the world where this is sold is us. In Singapore, we were the first company to ever do this. And we've been selling for about a year and a half. So it's many times that today. But ultimately, as we make more and as we move to larger vessels and we get our feed costs down, we see a path before the end of 2028 to be below the cost of conventionally produced chicken, beef and pork. Animal meat technology today just doesn't make sense for a single planet with 8 billion people. You know, when we had half the population, when we weren't using a third of the world to plant soy and corn, maybe it made a little bit more sense. But things are changing.

So the time we've had an interesting, they're arguing that the 56 billion pay package that was set out in a series of sort of incentive based milestones four years ago, that was really too much that he didn't need that kind of incentive to stay at the company that it breached the fiduciary duty of the board, that he had too many sort of cozy relationships with other members of the board, including his own brother, for example, that helped them to sort of agree to that pay package, which was controversial. At the time, the plaintiff, a Tesla shareholder is arguing that the pay package should be rescinded, so that court case started on Monday Julia.

It just so happens that between when they announced that package and the peak of Tesla's stock, which was about a year ago, it went up some 2,000 percent. So he has now hit 11 out of 12 milestones in that pay package, which has made him the world's richest man. I think you could argue that as the plaintiff in this case is that he already owned a big chunk of Tesla's, he was already incentivized to stay in that regard. They didn't need to shell out 56 billion, which by the way, the lawyer for the plaintiff pointed out was in the vicinity of the GDP of the state of Delaware where the case is taking place similar, he said to about 15 rebuilding of the World Trade Center.
