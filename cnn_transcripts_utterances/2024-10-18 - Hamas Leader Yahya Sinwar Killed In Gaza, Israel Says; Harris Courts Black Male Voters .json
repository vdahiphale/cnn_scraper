In that case, those individuals are extremely susceptible to pressure from the Qatari government.So there have been many who have said that now is the time to apply pressure on the Qataris to in turn apply pressure on those leaders of Hamas who are there to bring the war to an end. To release those hostages, tell their people to lay down their arms and call this war over. I think there's a great deal of momentum right now and we hope that they will do that for the future not only of Israel but, of course, the Palestinians as well.",

So I don't think he was pandering. I think he was actually hoping to speak to folks emotionally about this election. Yes, we have policy issues that we may disagree about, but we also have to recognize that when someone goes into the ballot box they're voting emotionally. So when we think about this election from an emotional perspective, I personally have to think about how Donald Trump has characterized the Black community. He -- remember, he was in office for four years. Remember what happened in COVID? Remember that Black people died. Remember that Black people lost their jobs. Remember unemployment was very high.
