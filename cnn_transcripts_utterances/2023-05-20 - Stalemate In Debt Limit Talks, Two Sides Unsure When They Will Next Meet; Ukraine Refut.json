The US inching closer to running out of money to pay its debts. A deadline is as close as 12 days away, but the high-stakes negotiations between the White House and Republicans have collapsed and it is not clear when face-to-face talks will resume. Meanwhile, President Biden will cut short his Asia trip to address the looming debt crisis, but before heading home tomorrow from the G7 Summit in Japan, Biden will meet with Ukraine's president. President Zelenskyy is making a dramatic appearance at the gathering to ask world leaders for more help in the war against Russia. Zelenskyy's plea comes as Russia claims a major victory in Ukraine. Today, the head of the mercenary Wagner Group says his fighters have captured Bakhmut after months of brutal fighting, but Ukraine says it still holds a small portion of the city. CNN's Phil Mattingly is at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan. Phil, let's begin with the debt crisis. A US default would of course, hurt economies around the world. So what is the level of concern there and where do things stand?",

And what the White House is saying, what White House National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan has said he has told them is that the President is confident there will be a resolution.The President believes there's a path forward and this will get solved before the first default in US history. The problem at this point in time, or at least the kind of divergence between the President's words and what he's telling foreign leaders and the reality is there is no path forward in the current talks, at least as they stand. There have been no meetings between top White House negotiators and their Republican counterparts today. There is no schedule for a next meeting. And the pathway forward now seems to be further apart than it did just a couple of days ago. I think that creates significant problems, not just because of the domestic problems, the domestic economy, how catastrophic a default would be for the US, but the cascading effect across international markets, across the world's economy is very real, very palpable. And, Paula, as you noted, it is just 12 days away, something needs to start happening soon. I think the reality is, when President Biden returns home, things aren't going to be much further along than they were when he left. He is going to have a pretty big issue to solve on his plate and not a lot of time.",

They're an exceptionally versatile platform and for that reason, they are the desired platform for the Ukrainians. They do have some drawbacks. They can't be used on steer runways, for example.

We, the lawyers still haven't even been able to see all those documents. It comes down to a lack of knowledge yet, Trump told Kaitlan Collins several times over, he knew what was in there, he had the right to take them, he laid them out on the sidewalk, and people were taking pictures of them.

They have actually already made a motion in Manhattan to push that case over to federal court. They are going to make the exact same motion in Georgia. I've predicted that in my book, and Mr. Parlatore seems to have confirmed that they will be making that motion. And if they can get these cases, either or both of these cases move from the local state courts into the federal courts, the next move -- and Mr. Parlatore said this to you as well, Paula, is then they're going to say now dismiss it because he has constitutional -- Donald Trump has constitutional immunity, because this conduct related to his tenure as president.
