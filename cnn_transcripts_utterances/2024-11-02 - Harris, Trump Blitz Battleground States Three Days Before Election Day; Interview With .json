(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And these horrible people back there said, well, Trump is soft with women. I don't believe I'm soft with -- they said Trump is -- he's very good with men. I don't know. Thank you, men. Thank you, men. No, I'm through the roof with men. She ain't got you those men.

More than 71 million early ballots have been already cast and in a cycle unlike any other in history, this election remains a toss-up. In polling, we're seeing razor thin margins across crucial swing states. In Pennsylvania, there is no clear leader with an even split between Harris and Trump. In Georgia, where Harris held a rally earlier today, and in North Carolina, where both candidates have rallies scheduled for tonight, the candidates are neck in neck among likely voters. Both campaigns focusing in on the battlegrounds in this final stretch. The vice presidential candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Walz also blitzing across the southwest with stops in Nevada and Arizona. But we go now to Virginia, not necessarily considered a battleground state, where former president Trump is making a campaign stop tonight, and CNN's Steve Contorno is joining us from Salem, Virginia, with the latest. Steve, Virginia tends to vote for Democrats in the presidential races and each of the last four elections that has been the case. Why is Trump there tonight?",

And so he will have to find an alternative route to eclipsing 270 electoral college votes. And one of the states where they have remained bullish for months is Virginia. Now they had a lot more optimism about Virginia back when Joe Biden was the nominee and there were actually plans to run a robust campaign here, as well as in states like Minnesota, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and New Mexico. We have seen him visit New Mexico in recent days and now he is making this trip to Virginia. Now the Republicans here acknowledge it is a longshot, but they can't leave any opportunities on the table. If this is close, they want to do what they can to gin up some enthusiasm in these final moments. And he is coming here from North Carolina, sandwiching this stop in between two visits in North Carolina. He will also be in North Carolina tomorrow and in North Carolina on Monday so clearly just showing how important this battleground is. And of course the vice president also holding an event there. In fact, our Kate Sullivan snapped a picture of both Air Force Two and Trump's plane at the same airport at the same time. Just showing how these campaigns are converging on each other in these critical battleground states. North Carolina, not a state the Trump campaign expected to spend so much time in, in these closing weeks.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, first of all, you know, I coined the blue wall back in 2009 and initially it referred to the 18 states that ultimately voted Democratic in all six elections from '92 to 2012. The most states either party had won over six consecutive elections since the formation of the modern party system in 1828.Trump of course famously dislodged Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from the blue wall in 2016 and now when people talk about the blue wall they're usually referring just to those three states. So in my mind these kind of the bricks that fell out of the wall have become the wall. Now what's really important is that since 2016, Democrats have regained the initiative in those three states. I think the evidence is that the counter mobilization or the backlash to Trump has been more powerful than the mobilization that Trump effectuated in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democrats won the governorships in all three in 2018, they won it again by more in 2022. They flipped three state legislative chambers. They hold five of the six U.S. senators. And of course, Biden won all three in 2020 by a combined 260,000 votes. The difference is that inflation, in particular, I think creates a tougher environment for them. But given what's happening in the national numbers, Jessica, where the erosion the Democrats are seeing relative to 2020 is primarily among non-white voters and Harris is largely holding Biden support among white voters, which was higher than Clinton's four years earlier. Clearly I think these three states that are predominantly white and older paradoxically are considered a safer path for her at this point than the sunbelt states that are younger and more diverse.",

And that, you know, the party really -- that he has broken the party, and broken their will to resist him on anything.It's a mistake. I mean, there's no other way to describe it. I mean, you know, Nikki Haley-type Republican voters, probably independents who lean Republican rather than people who identify as partisan Republicans, are the most logical place for Harris to grow relative to Biden in 2020. I mean there are a lot of parts of the electorate you look at, young men, Latino men, maybe black men, where she's probably going to struggle to match what Biden did and may lose a few points. Where can she offset that? I mean, the most logical place are these big, racially diverse, well-educated, populous inner suburbs around Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Phoenix. And, you know, the Nikki Haley voters broadly described are I think a very attractive target for her. It is -- I think if you look at -- we talked about this before. If you look at the 2022 election results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and also Arizona, they show you that Biden's performance in 2020 among white women with a college degree was not the ceiling for Democrats. After Dobbs, after January 6th, the Democratic gubernatorial candidates in those states did better among those women than Biden did two years earlier. All four of them. And Harris probably is going to have to do better among those women. Haley could help Trump, but Trump will not pick up the phone.",

Which is what most Republican professionals would want voters to be thinking about as they go into the booth because most voters, despite all of the success of Biden in the job market and the stock market and in the investments in the manufacturing, will say no because of inflation.But that really isn't the question we've been discussing in the last few days. We've been discussing island of garbage. I will protect women whether they like it or not. RFK Jr. will get control of federal healthcare policy. Vaccines and women's health. Liz Cheney should face rifles on the other side. I mean, Donald Trump has been almost on a crusade to remind people of everything else that they didn't like about his presidency, aside from the fact that at that point gas and groceries were cheaper. Now this may or may not be enough to get Harris over the top. It looks like Pennsylvania is the Battle of the Bulge, you know, in this election and someone is going to win it by a tiny amount and very likely be the president. But in terms of what we are discussing in the final days, the construct certainly would seem to benefit Harris more than Trump because it is so focused on all the hesitations people have about Trump even if they consider him better for their bottom line.",

The polls are not perfect. They are a tool. They get you in the neighborhood. But when the race is this close and all the key battle states are within three percentage points, that is within the average error band. The average error band for state polling averages since 1972 is -- get this -- 3.4 points -- 3.4 points. And then if you talk about a margin of error, right, like a 95 percent confidence in a poll, we are talking more like plus or minus nine points. All of the key battleground states are within this error band. And they are actually within the average error band as well. So let's look talk about what happens if you have average error and apply it to the electoral map, right? Well, if we have an average error and Donald Trump benefits from average error, guest what? He gets way past 270 electoral votes. He gets to 312. Why? He carries all of the Great Lake battleground states. He carries the southeast battleground states of North Carolina and Georgia. He carries Nevada and Arizona out west. Of course, Jessica, there is no guaranty that the polls necessarily benefit Donald Trump, even though they did both in 2016 and 2020. Because they could, in fact, the polling could benefit Kamala Harris, like it did the Democrats in 2020. If there was a polling that benefited Kamala Harris, in average polling, she would get north of 300 electoral votes. She would get to 319. Why? She carries the Great Lake battleground states. She carries Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. She carries the southeast battleground states of Georgia and North Carolina. And she would carry the southwest battleground states of Nevada and Arizona. So the bottom line is this. The polls, at this point, point to a race too close to call.

But there is a chance that, if the election ends up being at little bit wider, you go back to 2022 in Pennsylvania, that Senate race was called at 12:00 a.m. on Wednesday. Now, of course, the key point there is the Senate margin in 2022 was five points in 2022 versus a point back in 2020. But with fewer mail-in ballots, a chance of counting those mail ballots people are more used to in a couple of states. Now Pennsylvania has changed the laws. Michigan makes it easier to count the ballots before the election actually is completed. On Tuesday, you can back it up and get closer to when the polling times actually close.

The supreme leader vowing a crushing retaliation against Israel and the United States for actions against Iran. Speaking at a meeting with students ahead of the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened what he called a \"teeth-breaking\" response for what they are doing in Iran on the resistance front, a reference to the embattled militant group like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Khamenei added that Iran has the right to respond to Israeli strikes according to Iranian state television. Now Iranian officials have played down the Israeli strikes last week on missile production and defense sites in the country. But in recent days, that language appears to have hardened. Earlier this week, a high-ranking Iranian source told CNN that Iran would carry out, quote, \"definitive and painful responses\" for the attacks, probably before the U.S. election. An Israeli source told CNN that Israel was on a high state of readiness for an Iranian response. Jessica, back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
