And with a bitter cold, possibly keeping some of the older Republicans at home, it may give younger crowds a better chance at being heard by the candidates who are here.Joining me now is the chair of the Iowa Young Republicans, Mary Weston. Thank you so much for joining us. I am glad you're inside there in Cedar Rapids where I will be going in just about an hour. I want to ask you first. Do you think that the GOP is doing enough to prioritize its appeal to court young Republicans in Iowa?",

And my answer has been, you know, as much as policies are important, we talk a lot in our meetings and at our get-togethers about the term electability. You know, who is the nominee that's going to go and beat Joe Biden, who's the nominee that's going to reach out to the independents and the moderates, and make sure that, you know, they defeat Joe Biden in November?And I mean, you know, obviously, the southern border is something that's very important to young people. And the economy with a lot of us being fresh out of college and starting to build our savings accounts.

I heard you guys talking earlier about, you know, Ron DeSantis, maybe his folks are going to show up because they know how critical this caucuses whereas Trump folks might think this is an easy win for them and might not show up. I do expect to see some of that tonight.

The 2020 caucus was, you know, Trump or Trump.But you know, I think with the amount of exposure we've had to political conflict in this country, I mean, at least my experience in Iowa being pushed around a lot in high school and in college for my beliefs, that just pushes me more to want to go to the polls and support my candidate and eventually the Republican nominee. And I think that's true for a lot of young people. I think we're going to show up in historic numbers and get out there and support our favorite candidate. And also -- I mean, this year, you've got younger candidates. I mean, Vivek Ramaswamy is a historically young candidate. And I think a lot of people are ready to support those younger candidates. SIDNER: That's really interesting because Donald Trump is the front- runner. He's the oldest of the candidates running. When it comes to young people, is it Vivek or who that they feel the closest to and that they feel like is prioritizing young Republican voters the most?",

However, I do know from talking to members of our group that they don't think Vivek has properly represented the young population in a professional manner, just with comments made about Chairwoman McDaniel at the debates. You know, low attacks, that maybe -- it's not someone we want representing our age group, necessarily.But I see a lot of you know people who want to point to Donald Trump or Ambassador Haley, or Governor DeSantis in this caucus. You know, I think we're not going to have any surprises tonight. But I do think that a lot of young people are split between those three candidates primarily.",

First of all, there's just something magical about, I don't know, 150,000 people showing up to kick off a process that ultimately ends up with somebody sitting in the Oval Office representing 330 million of us. And that's why we love Iowa is because of the on-the-ground nature of the campaigning.But in terms of predictability, no. Especially in Republican caucuses, John, take a look here in recent caucuses. Ted Cruz won them in 2016. He wasn't the nominee nor the president. Same story for Rick Santorum in 2012. He won Iowa went nowhere. 2008, Mike Huckabee, he also won the Iowa caucuses, not the nominee. You have to go back to 2000. And remember, you covered this campaign to George W. Bush, who had a big victory in Iowa. Obviously, went on to be the nominee and become President of the United States. And that 41 percent, John, that he got in terms of his level of support on Iowa caucus night is a record in the Iowa Republican caucuses. One we will see if Donald Trump can break tonight.",

Obviously, we'll also be watching the margin of victory over who comes in second and third. But I do want to note, John, if we go into the map here in Iowa, so how will Donald Trump who didn't get nearly even close to 50 of the last time around eight years ago, how will he do it?Well, I think if you just take a look, I'm just going to say he's looking to boost strength up here with evangelical voters, hardcore conservative Republicans, but he's also looking to perform better than he did in the suburban areas than he did last time. Take a look. If I go back now into 2016's map. What you see here is there's a lot of Ted Cruz yellow in here that Donald Trump is looking to replace with his own supporters this time around, and there's a lot of Marco Rubio orange in the suburbs. This is where Nikki Haley is playing for votes, but also where Donald Trump is hoping to get some support that he didn't do. So, can he boost the big conservative vote out here? And can he make some inroads with the suburbanites in the Republican caucus that he didn't have necessarily eight years ago?",

He was trying to dig into the evangelical vote. Visited all 99 counties.e's put everything on Iowa. If he comes up in a third place, especially a distant third place, it's going to be very hard for him to have the money and the fuel needed to continue this campaign. Nikki Haley. She is trying to recreate that Rubio map from 2016. Again, those orange areas here in suburban areas. And she's trying to make an electability argument. Remember the suburbs sort of won against Trump in a general election context in 18 and 20 and even 22. She's trying to say I can win those kinds of votes. If she ends up in a strong second place, given how she's performing in New Hampshire, she's going to have a bunch of momentum to make the case why she should continue on in this race.",
