Happening right now, the House of Representatives is in session for a rare high stakes Saturday vote. Live pictures right now. Right now, lawmakers are debating military aid bills for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, totaling $95 billion. GOP hardliners are pushing hard against more Ukraine aid. But supporters, both Republican and Democrat insists the aid packages are critical for national and global security. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): The world is on fire. From Putin's full- scale invasion of Ukraine, to Chairman Xi, threatening Taiwan in the Pacific, to the Ayatollah, rearing his ugly head, invading Israel through his proxies. The eyes of the world are upon us. And history will judge us by what we do here and now. REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Today, with the vote on Ukraine security aid, we rededicate ourselves to who we are. We meet today under the white dome above us, a universal symbol of freedom and freedom loving people everywhere. And today, we cannot disappoint those who seek what we have. REP. FRENCH HILL (R-AR): In two years, we'll celebrate the 250th anniversary of this country, this freedom, this democracy, which would not have happened without money from the Netherlands, money from France, guns from France, and Navy from France. Allies stood at the side of the birth of this nation, the birth of freedom was born here. So, today, we come to this House floor to see that freedom is fought for here in this House.

There are several of them who said that they absolutely will. But the Democratic leadership has yet to take a position on this. Yes, that's one of the questions here that they may have to grapple with. Whether what Marjorie Taylor Greene decides to do, also inserted our colleague Ali Maine, just asked Greene outside the House floor, whether or not today was the day to try to force that vote seeking his ouster?

They have desperately wanted to see them get passed.And the White House has maintained over the course of all this time that it is urgent and necessary for Ukraine. Oftentimes, when President Biden would come out to talk about the necessity of these funds for Ukraine, as well as other national security priorities, he would frame it as a national security priority, noting that they cannot cede any ground to Russia. And in an op-ed this week in The Wall Street Journal, President Biden called it a \"pivotal moment\". And in a statement yesterday from the White House Office of Management and Budget, they echoed that. Saying, \"Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment. The administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the president's desk.\" Now, it's important now that they note the strength of American leadership. Because over the last several months, what we've also seen is a recurring topic of discussion in the president's conversations with world leaders, in which he has affirmed that the U.S. will stand by Ukraine. But that has been a difficult argument to make when these funds are stalled in Congress. Now, we should also note that US officials say the stakes are high. In fact, this week, CIA Director Burns said that Ukraine could lose the war by the end of the year if they don't get these funds. So, all attention on the House floor today.",

Maniacal terrorism dedicated to the destruction of not just the state of Israel, but of all Jews. Israel fights not only to destroy Hamas's Iran-backed military capabilities, but to send a clear message to our adversaries who seek to erase the Jewish state, you will not be successful. President Biden, leader Jeffries, and Democrats have fought for months to send this critical security assistance, as well as life-saving humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people who are also victims of Hamas. A vote against this bill is a vote to deny that aid. I am proud to support this vital effort to help Israel in this existential ballot, battle, and aid civilians.

And to your other question about Speaker Johnson's legacy, how he comes out of this, you know, the question really is who you're asking there, because he is once again, having to rely on Democrats to get through some of the biggest moves and biggest packages he's had to handle thus far.

Yes, because they're really important, because, like you said, even with the word swamp, some people think, not really interested in that. But sometimes these marshes are incredible bird sanctuaries, right? Mostly they are. I mean, and mangroves are incredible places of birthing, real nurseries for a lot of, you know, wildlife.
