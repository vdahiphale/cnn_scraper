That's the latest assessment from officials after a deadly missile explosion in eastern Poland. We'll have all the latest details for you this hour. Plus, the campaign is on. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is setting his sights on the White House once again. But what are his chances? And success in space. NASA's Artemis mission blast off. We're live at the Kennedy Space Center. NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance remains vigilant calm and closely coordinated after a Russian made missile landed in Poland on Tuesday. But he stresses that all the indications are, it was a Ukrainian air defense missile fire to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian missile attacks. Two people were killed when the missile exploded in a small Polish village near the Ukrainian border. Russia denies responsibility. The President of Poland also says the missile incident was likely an accident and not a deliberate attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDRZEJ DUDA, POLISH PRESIDENT (through translation): It was probably an accident of Russia attacked on Ukraine and Ukrainian Air Defense shots quite a few Russian missiles in order to neutralize this attack. And maybe it's more than half of Russian missiles were shut down. And some of them fell under Ukrainian territory. And there is a high chance that maybe one of the missiles that Ukrainian Air Defense just fell on our territory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Max, I'm in Kryvyi Rih which is in the southern center of the country and industrial city that like Lviv, way over on the border with Poland was subjected to a very substantial storm of cruise missile attacks. These attacks were right across the country, the Ukrainian government said upwards of at least 85 cruise missiles.These equipped missiles, Max, that carry a warhead of 400 kilograms, nearly half a ton of explosives in them, and the Ukrainians have air defense systems to try and shoot them down. They've been asking for more sophisticated air defense systems. They were using around Lviv as they do around Kryvyi Rih and around Kyiv where two people were also reported to have been killed by the Russian missiles. S-300, Soviet areas -- era surface to air missiles, it's a very big sort of old school missiles with a fairly limited warhead in comparison to what they're trying to shoot down. And occasionally, and we've seen this inside Ukrainian territory, they either miss and land somewhere and cause damage, or they hit the missile that they're trying to knock out and the warhead carries on and hits areas in Ukraine. Now I've seen that myself the results of that, very tragic and spectacular in a negative sense in Kyiv. They're clearly -- the Ukrainians are now saying that they are going to cooperate fully with any kind of an investigation. They are like Jens Stoltenberg there from NATO, insisting that if you like the original sin was that the Russians have invaded this country were raining missiles down right across this country, including right on the Polish border. The Russians, so far, are maintaining the lie, frankly, that they were not firing any missiles close to the Polish border. If you're attacking Lviv, which they were, then you are attacking very close to the Polish border. And these are very fast-moving missiles with a pretty substantial range. I think the S-300, several 100 kilometers range indeed. So, there is always going to be a danger of bleeding. And they use the term advisedly of this war into neighboring territory. This is something that the Ukrainians had been warning of. And now tragically, it seems that the Ukrainians have caused accidentally perhaps some deaths in Poland. Max?",

It is that framework around the idea that it was Russia's fault that Ukraine had to defend itself that we are likely to hear throughout the day, but that's really all Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mentioned when he spoke of this missile that landed in Poland. He did accidentally say there multiple missiles or multiple explosions before he corrected himself back to one explosion. Then he essentially moved on to talk about Ukraine's liberation of Kherson. I will point out one more thing right at the end of his comments there. He talked about helping Ukraine through training keep up the momentum throughout winter. You see Austin there step away from this idea that perhaps there will be a low infighting. Instead, he says, look, we're going to do what we can in terms of training and arming Ukraine to make sure they can keep moving ahead and forging ahead with the counter offensives they've seen not only in southern Ukraine, but in eastern Ukraine, and keep up those offensives throughout the winners of the U.S. And Austin there stepping away from this idea that there's going to be some lull in fighting or some window in which there might be an opening for diplomacy. Also stressing, of course -- and we saw that again yesterday, and recently -- the need for more air defenses for Ukraine, saying that since the last Contact Group meeting last month, seven countries have committed or have already set air defenses to Ukraine.",

But implicit here, in what the Ukrainians have said, and what the United States is saying about the rush to try to help Ukraine with more sophisticated NATO style, 21st century defense systems is that, if you use old Soviet kits, like the S-300, things go wrong.So from the Ukrainian perspective, they have been asking for more and more precision guided short and long range missiles, both for land to land operations, but very importantly, for surface to air missiles. Particularly, since the arrival of these drones from Iran, which are unsophisticated, but very long range. They can loiter for many hours in the sky, and they can be fired in enormous numbers. So trying to bring down a 200-pound drone with an S-300 is, excuse the pun, overkill and a massive waste of resources. They do need that help. And I think that is emerging from this accident. Max?",

What happens now? Do you think you're still going to be able to get that? And they really do. And I think that's one thing to pay attention to.

Donald Trump has a unique fundraising ability that many other Republicans don't have. And that's why we've seen so many of them latch on to Donald Trump.

That is why -- or they say that that is likely what the President had been referring to yesterday, when he said that it seemed that it did not originate from Russia. Now, this comes as you saw the President really adopt this very methodical approach in the aftermath of this missile landing in Poland. He convened an emergency meeting with G7 leaders and other NATO leaders at the G20 Summit, where they talked about the assessments that they had been seen, and also said that they would fully support Poland's investigation into the matter with President Biden saying that they would get to the bottom of figuring out exactly what would happen. But this of course, comes as the stakes at play are very, very high. And that is why the White House was careful in trying not to assign exact blame in the moment. And now based on these preliminary assessments that have seemed to be confirmed by the Polish president, it seems that this was simply a mistake and not an intentional act.
