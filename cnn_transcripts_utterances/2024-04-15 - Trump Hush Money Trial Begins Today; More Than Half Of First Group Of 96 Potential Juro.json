There's a whole fundraising appeal that is built in every day reacting to what is happening inside the courtroom to try and drum up his supporters, which we've seen him do with pretty good success over the last year.They're also trying to use this as yet the biggest example yet about how the government is coming after him. And as he has talked about on the campaign trail, I am your retribution. If they aren't coming after me, they'll come after you, which of course is not true because it's very specific to him. But the point is they're going to try and use this trial and all the proceedings of it as a megaphone for them. But there are unexpected things that will happen on this. So every day he may not want to come out and sort of talk about what happened inside there when Stormy Daniels is on the stand, for example. So they, of course, will be trying to redirect in shaping the image of everything that happens. But what we don't know is how the public will react to this. Does it add to the Trump exhaustion? Possibly. Does it add to the Trump anger? Does it add to his support? Perhaps all of those. So we're just going to have to sit and watch this unfold.

And we didn't really know at that moment that he was going to galvanize the whole Republican base. You could sort of feel it in the months after. This is a different moment. It may be the same. It may not be. The difference is the general election audience requires independent voters. They are an active participant in the process here.

So you never know what's going on. And I'm not in the courtroom, so I don't want to judge. But I do think that there is something to the fact that he wants to be there to look all these people in the face. And it sounds like some of them are ready to look back.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf, I think it does. I think I saw a statement coming out of the White House this afternoon that said they would not accept a standalone bill coming out of the House just for Israel. And they shouldn't, by the way.Both Israel and Ukraine face the same -- I'm sorry, both Israel and Ukraine face the same threat. They have a very aggressive neighbor who is attacking this democracy, these respective democracies, and they need U.S. support, and U.S. leadership is on the line. So I think we should support the funding. It should move quickly. And I hope the House will pass a bill. And they shouldn't go on recess at the end of this week without passing the Ukraine supplemental. BLITZER: We'll see how that unfolds. The president, President Biden, has urged Israel not to retaliate and says the U.S. will not take part in any counterstrikes against Iran. Is Israel in danger, you think, Mr. Secretary, of further straining its relationship with the United States and possibly expanding its global isolation if it were to launch a military strike on Iran now?",

      "timeStamp": "15:40:00",
      "speaker": "ESPER",
      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think President Biden is mistaken on both points. You know, look, first of all, urging Israel to act with restraint at this point in time doesn't make any sense, given the neighborhood that they live in. A week and a half ago, Israel said very clearly to Iran, don't strike. If you do strike Israel proper, there will be response.They have to follow through on that now. By the same token, President Biden told the Iranians don't as well. To me, that looks like a red line. And so for Israel not to act now, that would undermine their credibility. Plus, I might add, look, for 20 plus years, Israel faced a constant threat from rockets from Hamas in the south and rockets from Hezbollah in the north every year. In some years, well over 1,000 rockets attacked, and this led to Israel going into either to fight. Now, Iran has changed the paradigm, and they've acknowledged it. They said it publicly. They've created a new normal that they're no longer afraid to strike Israel. So now does Israel have to deal not just with a southern front and a northern front, but an eastern front? I think they need to hit back hard. And look, the other thing that I think President Biden has made a mistake on is taking the military option off the table. He did this with Ukraine. I think it was a mistake. He did this with Gaza. It was a mistake. And once again, he's taking U.S. military options off the table before anything's happened. Now, look, I think it made those circumstances we probably weren't and probably shouldn't have done anything. But just to take it off the table, I think, undermines U.S. credibility as well in the region.",

And I will suspect it will be the Iranians before the Israelis.Iran does not want this war. They can't afford this war economically. And of course, they have a public that is very unhappy with the regime. They can't tolerate too much here. But on the other hand, Israel cannot allow this to stand, or else they will face a new threat, a new invigorated, emboldened Iran that will feel like it can shoot missiles and rockets and drones and cruise missiles anytime it wants, or anytime it seems to be losing the proxy war to Israel, they'll shoot rockets and missiles at Israel. That's a new normal that Israel cannot tolerate, which is why I think they need to hit back fairly hard and show that they are serious and restore deterrence with Iran.",

More than half of the prospective jurors, there were 96 in the first panel, they were excused. They were asked, could they be fair and partial? Raise your hand if you can't. And more than half of them raised their hand. Joining me now, John Dean, former Nixon White House counsel, and Tim Naftali, CNN presidential historian and former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. All right, so, Tim, you know, what do you make of that? You know Paula Reid has been reporting that the Trump team expected that number to be high of people who recused themselves, essentially, because they said they couldn't be fair or impartial. But they thought it'd be about 40 percent. It was over half. Does that surprise you?",

But actually, it seems that the flip of it may be true when it comes to who actually gets into the jury, right? If people are being honest about being biased, doesn't that say something significant in and of itself?You know, it's not --they're not trying to sneak through. They don't view this as some, you know, calling of activism to hold the country back from the abyss and serve on this jury. No, they're raising their hands and saying, I'm biased.",

That's not -- the perception of the jury is important for -- none of us really know what's in that heart or that mind of that juror, but the process is what's important.And it's very difficult, Erin, to reverse a jury verdict. It's almost impossible. So this is a very thin reed to build your appeal on. They're going to be building it on anything and everything they can find along the way. So I think that, in fact, the judge has gotten a good response from his question. He's eliminated half the pool. He's down to the people he can really talk to now.

I mean, essentially, President Trump, former President Trump, has made the argument that somehow presidents are almost like super citizens and that there are certain elements of our, the rule of law that do not touch presidents.What's happening in the courtroom today is a reminder that no, indeed, as George Washington established the principle a long time ago, yes, presidents have power while they're in office. But afterwards, just like before, they return to being ordinary American citizens. And Donald Trump today is being treated, as he should be, constitutionally as an ordinary American citizen with ordinary American citizens sitting in judgment. BURNETT: And they are sitting in judgment. And that this selection, now, we understand about 100 jurors sort of per pool, John, until they get to the final group of 12 jurors on six alternates. Given what we're seeing right now, half of 96 gone, then another nine. So we're looking at about a third left to actually consider for the jury. We know 18 to 20 of them were then randomly selected or going through this questioning. We don't know if any will formally be selected for the actual jury today or not yet.

Hutchins was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin. I want to play for you the moment the judge read Gutierrez-Reed's sentence. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE MARY MARLOWE SOMMER, 1ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT, NEW MEXICO: Leaving you in the detention center would be giving you a pass you do not deserve. I did not hear you take accountability in your allocution. You said you were sorry. You were sorry, but not you were sorry for what you did. You were the armorer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone. You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon. But for you, Ms. Hutchins would be alive, a husband would have his partner, and a little boy would have his mother. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
