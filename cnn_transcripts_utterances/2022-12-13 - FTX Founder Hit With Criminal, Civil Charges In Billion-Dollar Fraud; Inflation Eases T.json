Today, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was hit with a one-two punch of charges, criminal indictments from the Justice Department, and civil charges from the Security Exchange Commission. And Bankman-Fried was in a courtroom today in the Bahamas where he was arrested and indicted on eight criminal counts.",

Well, they will put more meat on the bones and explain more about what these federal charges are. But what we do know is eight criminal counts, two counts of wire fraud, multiple counts of conspiracy all relating, as you say, to the misappropriation of billions of dollars of customer deposits that prosecutors say Bankman- Fried had used to cover his own personal loans.He took up more than a billion dollars from this company. He also used it to buy luxury real estate in the Bahamas for him his family and other top executives. And he also diverted some money to go toward tens of millions of dollars in political donations. A colleague of mine had tallied the numbers and we've seen more than $900,000 in the last campaign cycle went to candidates and nearly $39 million to outside groups. As we will -- we do expect this press conference to get underway with the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, Damian Williams. We'll kick it off. And then we'll also hear from the FBI, the chiefs of enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Both of those regulators levied civil charges today. And as you know that Bankman-Fried is in the Bahamas. We'll wait to see how soon he will show up in a court here in New York. Bianna, Victor.",

That's when we're told that a judge here in Nassau could decide whether or not SBF is going to be given a bond pending his extradition back to the U.S. The magistrate out here in the Bahamas said she expressed some reservation about whether or not she was going to move forward and allow SBF to post a bond in large part because she said in her experience here on the bench, she's had a number of individuals, folks who she said left the Bahamas after posting bond, no matter the amount.The 30-year-old, he's been in court for much of the day. He's been sitting in the front row of this courtroom here behind me, really showing no emotions throughout this hearing. He's either staring at the floor and occasionally looking over at his defense attorneys. Now earlier in the day, SBF was asked whether or not he was going to waive his right to extradition. He said he was not going to do so. He told the judge he would not be doing that. And so, there is going to be a legal process that plays out here in the Bahamas before SBF is eventually taken back to the U.S. to face charges there. It is important to note, Victor and Bianna, that Bahamian authorities, they are also conducting their own investigation into the collapse of FTX. [14:05:02] And, in fact, the SEC complaint that was unsealed, that this morning against SBF makes a note of the allegations that he used some of the money from FTX to buy a number of expensive pieces of property here in the Bahamas. It's worth also pointing out that the 30-year-old was arrested yesterday in a gated community, a rather wealthy part of the Bahamas. He was taken to jail around six o'clock at night. He spent the night in jail. And we're told he really did not get a chance to meet with his attorneys until this morning. Again, the judge that is handling this case could have a decision on whether or not he's going to be given bail at 2:15 this afternoon when she comes back to hear the remaining arguments and decide whether or not to move forward with granting him bond, guys.",

And I will just say that the early indictment here of, Victor, the fact that they indicted him basically a little over a month after the collapse of FTX tells me that prosecutors are very confident in the case.",

And on the defense side, now I defend clients sometimes who are -- who are facing problems from regulators around the world. And I have never seen a case move this quickly. And this is such a large consequential case, so it's really shocking the speed in which the United States government has acted here.And really, the only way I can make sense of the speed here is a couple of things. One is the fraud that's been laid out by the DOJ, the SEC, and the CFTC is so brazen and wide-ranging. So, I do think that that is part of -- part of what happened here was just the fraud was so brazen. But also, Sam Bankman-Fried, himself, was talking to everyone who would listen with this in thoughts and feelings and answers to all sorts of hard-hitting questions to journalists, Twitter, and really anyone else.

Renato, I'm curious what stood out to you because what I heard was that we heard officials say for other investors to reach out to them if they feel that they've been defrauded. I'm curious, what's the likelihood that they will get their money back even a penny's worth given that the majority of the money initially has to go back to the creditors, and we have over a million creditors involved here?",

The ones that are self-serving will never make it into the trial because they're going to be hearsay under the rules of evidence.But the prosecutor is -- prosecutors are going to be able to take the bits and pieces of the statements that do incriminate him that are problematic, and they'll be able to put all those in as admissions against him. So, he's really painted his attorney into a corner. I think his defense team is going to have a very difficult time with this case. And I think that that's one reason why they moved so quickly. It's not easy to take a team that is as big as they have. And to put something like this, put a marker down and say that they're going to take this case on this early and just weeks after the collapse of FTX.
