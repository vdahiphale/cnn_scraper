But look at the totals right, 366 to 58 in favor of passage. You hear a couple cheers there taking place, but we have not heard officially. Let's listen to it right now.So voting has ended for the fourth and final of the foreign aid packages as of today's very rare Saturday session there in the U.S. House of Representatives. And you look at the totals, 366 to 58 in favor of passage of this $26 billion Israel aid package, $17 billion of it would go to offensive and defensive weapons for Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian an aid for Gaza. Of course, we still have to hear them officially say that this has been passed. But Manu Raju back with this there outside there on Capitol Hill. They had four items today to accomplish. Checkmark on three of them. You've got to national security aid package that's been approved, the Ukraine package approved, and money for the Indo-pacific region allies, that of Taiwan as well. So this seemingly was embraced by a majority there, just looking at the tally. This was to be expected for the Israel package.",

But yes, it's well on its way to passage here. But it's different from the other ones because there are more Democrats who oppose it, even though a majority of Democrats did support this. Still, it's just 37 Democrats, it looks like, and counting about who have opposed this, 21 Republicans and counting. There were those Democrats who were concerned. They signed on the letter that raised concerns about moving forward, Ukraine aid, wanting more of especially offensive weapons in Israel aid, and asking for more conditions on aid to Israel, which is why you're seeing some of those opponents on the left flank of Hakeem Jeffries opposes measures. Some of those Republicans voted against this, concern about the humanitarian aid that would be going, including some billions that could go to help in Gaza. That was important to for Democrats here.But it sounds like they may be calling this vote any second here, Fred. So feel free to interrupt me if and when they do.

I'm going to keep my eye up over here just in case some members who we're interested in speaking with, particularly some of the ones who have threatened to move against Mike Johnson, if they emerge from here we'll ask them what their plans are today.But you are hearing just a lot of anger and frustration from the right flank of his conference's vote. So significant is because of what is happening in the Middle East with the war in Gaza, what is happening with Ukraine, which has desperately called for more aid at this key moment. So how they decide -- how these detractors decide to move ahead will be very important. Marjorie Taylor Greene, she has the ability, as any one individual member does, to actually call for a vote seeking the ouster of a sitting speaker. [14:05:05] That, of course, is a deal that Kevin McCarthy cut in order to assume the speakership. That same deal ultimately led to his ouster when Matt Gaetz led the charge back in the fall. Ultimately Mike Johnson came in. The conservative were very happy with him coming into the position because he's ideologically aligned with them. But as he came in recognizing the narrowness of his majority and the fact that he had to govern with Democrats and leading the Senate with Democrats in the White House, cutting a deal on keeping the government open, cutting a deal on issues such as a key surveillance law, and now calling this deal on this foreign aid package that includes billions, $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, all of which he aligned himself with Democrats and Democratic leaders, in part because of his own classified briefings and how he's learned about these subjects changing and evolving and his views. But as a result, angering those folks on the far right who are coming after. Marjorie Taylor Greene has refused hey all day long if today was the day she would try to call for that vote. She could do that, and then within two legislative days, they would have to act on that. Now the House is all streaming out here because they're going on a one-week recess, so it's possible --",

And maybe that could hurt her ability to go ahead.Now, one other important thing. What do Democrats do? Hakeem Jeffries, as we've been reporting, has not said what how the Democrats should deal it. A lot of Democrats are going to wait for Jeffries's decision on what to do here, about whether or not to push him out from the speakership. Jeffries just left the House floor. He was asked by our colleague Ali Main whether or not he is -- what he's going to do now, because he had said, let's wait for these bills to pass before I make a decision on that. He's simply declined to comment, refer back to his previous remarks. So it's still uncertain what he will do, perhaps because they are waiting to see what Marjorie Taylor Greene decides to do, then they will decide whether it's time to save Mike Johnson's speakership.

OK, we heard real contrasting views on how to see the passage of these four foreign aid bills today from the House speaker. As it pertains to Ukraine, he says it provides for greater accountability, better outcome of the war, and there's that loan aspect. Contrasting that with Marjorie Taylor Greene who says this is a sellout of America. Where do you stand on this? REP. JASMINE CROCKETT, (D-TX): Well, I take issue with things that both of them said. I do want to applaud the speaker for finally waking up and deciding that he wanted to stand on the side of governance instead of obstruction. And he said that this aid is timely. It is not timely by any stretch of the imagination. This is one of those things that he finally had to settle in realize that there's actually more support for Ukraine than he thought. He could have actually passed every single piece of legislation on a suspension. He didn't even have to go through rules. That's how much bipartisan support existed. Now, honestly, we know that the Democrats, per the usual, are the ones that held it down. But Marjorie Taylor Greene saying that we need to fund the border, she needs to go talk to her master, aka Donald Trump, who specifically said, do not go through with the border bill. And that's the only reason they don't have anything. So if she has a problem, she needs to go talk to Donald instead of blaming her speaker. And also, she's talking really big talk about how she believes in governance. And so that's what she wants to be responsible, because she cares about the institution. She didn't care about the institution on January 6th or even after January 6th as she continues to support those that were trying to tear us down. So I don't really have much patience for Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has done everything that is the opposite of anything that will keep this country on track.

Governing is what we are supposed to do, keeping America safe as what we're supposed to do. Honoring our obligations to our friends and allies, that is what were supposed to do. I will tell you this. The difference between Mike Johnson and McCarthy is that Mike Johnson believes in communication, and he understands when he needs to go and talk to Hakeem Jeffries.

This is the Republican Party that is still so bitterly divided over how to proceed that it led their -- what America's place is in the world, how to spend U.S. taxpayer dollars, their agenda as they head into the majority, this infighting has played out. And because of the narrowness of Mike Johnson's majority is why his speakership continues to be at risk.But clearly it is he is not going to be at risk, at least in the short term, because as what we heard from Marjorie Taylor Greene, she's now going to move forward today. She said she is going to wait until there's backlash in the district as voters are outraged at the Republicans who did vote to move forward on Ukraine aid. We'll see if that happens. I've talked to a number of swing-district Republicans who are proud of their vote, who say they're proud of Mike Johnson for standing up to the far-right elements of the conference. Then you hear Thomas Massie. I tried to get that question, as you heard there at the end, about, look, this is a point where the tensions are really at a peak, because after this, the House goes on recess, people go back. They're with their families or their districts. They come back and they're really it is not any major, major issue that is going to divide the GOP really until the fall when they had to keep the government open past that September 30th deadline. So we have a significant amount of time before then. So what is the point -- at what point are they going to go move forward if they're not going to move forward today? And that's something that they are struggling with at this moment. The calculation has to be, one, do they have the votes? They seem to think they do, but Democrats likely would come to save him, although they have now said so officially. And two, they don't -- they don't really know what the game plan is if they were to somehow succeed. If they become the dog who caught the car, what happens if Johnson is vacated? Who is the successor? Do they throw this institution yet again into a state of paralysis? Because this House cannot do anything until a speaker is elected, as we saw last fall. So all those things are part of the discussion. Marjorie Taylor Greene continued to say she's being responsible in this because she's trying to argue that she's not doing what Matt Gaetz did in the fall, which was call for the vote that led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, and then Republicans had no idea what to do, ultimately leading to the election of Mike Johnson. But Mike Johnson making the calculation here and deciding it is time to take on those far-right elements in his conference, take them on, work with Democrats and deal with the aftermath. At the moment he's in his speaker's chair because Democrats very well could come to his defense.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, I mean, they don't have -- the big problem is that there's no consensus candidate. I mean, yes, if he were to resign, then what? We saw what happened in the fall. There is absolutely no consensus candidate, and that is a problem.So two things can be true. One, there's nobody to replace Mike Johnson. Perhaps he survives this motion to vacate vote, but he is badly damaged, there's no doubt about it, by the deals that he had to cut in this narrowly divided House and not having much leverage with the Democrats in the Senate and himself evolving on some of these key issues. The question will be, as Thomas Massie said and other critics are saying, can he be speaker again if the Republicans keep the majority and it comes up again in January of next year, will he have the votes? And I'll tell you, I've talked to a lot of Republicans. They do not believe that Mike Johnson will be able to sustain this. Yes, maybe you can survive to the end of this Congress. But next Congress, that is a different situation, especially if Democrats are forced to come to his defense which would be seen as something that would essentially weaken him even further in the eyes of a lot of his colleagues. So that is key. One other point is that Thomas Massie made the argument to me here that this will demotivate our base, he says. He said all this will make our base not want to come out in the fall and help us push to the finish line. I put that question to the member, the leader of the House Republican campaign arm, Richard Hudson, a congressman from North Carolina, if he's concerned this will cost them the majority. He said absolutely not. He said they're more concerned about other issues, grocery prices and the like, not Republican infighting. So we'll see how that will play out. But as you can see, different calculation since here as Republican leadership ready to plow ahead and hope that voters don't care about that come the fall.",

First of all, I think pretty much the entire Ukrainian government and anybody who is in the Ukrainian military, probably the whole country was on edge watching this vote go down in the House of Representatives. And the president of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he came out in a matter of seconds with his first tweet thanking the United States.I want to read you part of it, because I think it is quite significant and just shows how big a deal this is for the Ukrainians. He writes, \"Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it. The vital U.S. bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and will help our nations to become stronger.\" So you can see just how important this bill was for the Ukrainians. Of course, some of the things that they've been saying is that they are running extremely low on ammunition and also on missiles for air defense. In fact, we've also already been in touch with a soldier who is fighting on the front line here in Ukraine in the southern direction towards Zaporizhzhia. And he told us that they badly need air defense missiles to keep the city safe so the soldiers know that their families are safe. But also they say that the issues they've been having with ammunition, and I've covered this for months here in this country, as the ammunition stocks of the Ukrainians have been dwindling, that has now really reach critical levels. So they say they badly need artillery ammunition. Of course, we know that a lot of the U.S. aid is staged in European countries, and so it could get here very quickly once that bill is approved by the Senate and then passes the president's desk. Definitely something that the Ukrainians are looking for very quickly. Also, I have something just to couple of seconds ago for you, Fredricka, because the foreign minister of this country, Dmytro Kuleba, he had a comment specifically for us. This is him to CNN, saying that this is a historic day when not only Ukraine got a boost of hope, but also the United States and all the free world. In the end, defeating Putin as Ukraine is about averting developments that will shatter the security and prosperity of the United States and every American.\" So obviously the Ukrainians trying to say that the aid for them, will also benefit the United States, Fredricka.",
