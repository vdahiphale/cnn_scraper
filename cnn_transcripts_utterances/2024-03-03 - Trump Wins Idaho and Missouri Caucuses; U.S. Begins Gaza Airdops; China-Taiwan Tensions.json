I'm Lynda Kinkade.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Donald Trump wins big in Missouri and Idaho, defeating lone rival Nikki Haley in the Republican caucuses. We'll speak with an expert about what to watch as we head into Super Tuesday. The U.S. begins airdropping desperately needed aid into Gaza as President Biden admits that it's nowhere enough to meet the need. And later, heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, the recent flare up that has the region on edge. We begin this hour focused on Super Tuesday now just two days away. That's when 15 states will hold Republican nominating contests with 865 delegates at stake. It takes more than 1,200 delegates to win the GOP presidential nomination. And Donald Trump is on his way with more wins Saturday. He claimed nearly 85 percent of the vote in Idaho's Republican caucuses compared to just over 13 percent for rival Nikki Haley. Missouri's Republicans also held caucuses Saturday. Trump commanded a whopping 100 percent of that vote. Trump now has 247 delegates compared to Haley's 24. Trump mostly ignored her during campaign stops on Saturday but couldn't resist taking some swings at his only remaining opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I haven't heard about her. So, I won't even use -- people say, don't even talk about her, don't talk to her. But I have to, when I have some, I have to talk, front row Joes, because she's bad news. I know her very well, she's very average. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Polls show Trump leading by double digits over rival Nikki Haley. If she doesn't do well, is this the end for her?Well, you would think it would be the end. This might be because she just might not have enough money to go forward. And she spent a lot on her campaign thus far, about $100 million compared to only $60 million for Trump, and it hasn't led to any victories in any of the states thus far. But she does have a strong backing among some moderate Republicans that may want her to stay in the race simply because Trump has so many issues going on, so many legal issues with 91 criminal counts, and also just due to the fact that he could make some sort of serious gaffe that might turn off voters. Because of the X factor of a Trump candidacy, she may have support to stay in it, but there isn't really any path to victory here for her. She's so far behind it. If we look at Super Tuesday, these states are going to use a winner-take-all method. And she's been gaining some delegates here and there by coming in second place. And she's not going to be able to benefit from that. And the other problem is that the primaries really bring out more extreme, more passionate voters. And she's winning not really with Republicans, but with independents. So, it's possible she may stay in the race because she's gaining some attention. It's benefiting her. She has a national platform and attention on her. Maybe she thinks she needs to stay in it because anything can happen, but the math really isn't on her side.",

Now, of course, he is doing better with African-American voters today than he was doing, when we look at the polls at least, than he was doing in 2020. Biden still has a lead with African-American voters, but I think it points out something about his criminal issues.If you look at the primary voters, the Republican base, they don't care at all about his criminal liability here. There's a problem that he could be actually put in prison, that he could be a felon, that he could not even be able to vote. This almost seems to galvanize Republican voters and excites them, and that's been drawing in a lot more campaign funds. But if we look at the general election, how do people feel about that, and we have at least about half of Americans that, according to a recent poll in February, said they do want these trials, these court cases to be finished up before the election, which is really important. And if we look back at a poll that was taken in 2023, it was 62 percent of Americans that felt that if he were convicted of a serious crime, then he should be barred from running for president. So, while he is gaining some support from his hardcore voters due to all of his criminal issues, he's not going to win the general election if something serious happened and he were convicted.",

This compares to back in 2012 when there was a vote of 9 percent for uncommitted when Obama was running for president again.So, there's definitely some angst, there's some disappointments and anger with the way that Biden has handled the war in Gaza. And he doesn't have a very good approval rating with younger voters, those that are say under 35, 70 percent disapprove with how he's handled the war in Gaza. So, he has an uphill battle ahead of him because he's not going to be able to make a complete U-turn with the war in Gaza. And he doesn't seem to be able to resonate and connect with Arab-American and young voters on other issues. And in these swing states, like you mentioned the state of Michigan, where there are 300,000 Arab Americans, this will make the difference. I mean, Biden only won Michigan by 154,000 votes. And there are Arab- American voters in Arizona, in Georgia, other important swing states. And then, of course, the bigger issue is how does he bring out younger voters? He's not doing very well with them. There's very low level of enthusiasm for his candidacy. And if we look at to the recent New York Times poll, there was about half of Democratic voters that don't want him to run again, that would prefer another candidate. That doesn't mean they won't vote for him come November, but he has a lot of issues bringing back this very complex coalition of different voters that were able to help him win office in 2020.",

But it's deeply frequent, deeply troubling, as you've just heard them claiming the lives of the very youngest. It's also potentially a sign of what Ukraine says is one of the first things that will suffer because of a lack of western aid, and that's air defenses. Now, Russia is also fielding huge amounts of drones and aviation bombs at the moment. They seem to have a huge supply of those, and it comes too amongst troubling signs on the front line, particularly around the east near where I'm standing, near the town of Avdiivka, where Russia took that town about three weeks ago now and Ukraine withdrawing from it. But since then they've been able to apply intense pressure, moving forwards and taking some of the villages to the west of that, three confirmed that we know of. But the area that Ukraine essentially declared its new defensive line now appears to be under intense pressure from Russian assault. Some geo-located drone footage suggesting, in fact, that one of the most important villages that Ukraine thought it would hold onto to defend that front line, or Livka (ph), may now be partially under Russian control, or at least destroyed beyond any kind of recognition. This is troubling because it suggests Ukraine is not necessarily in control of its defensive backlines, and it may suggest greater Russian momentum than is being discussed publicly by Ukrainian officials. Also too, the new commander of Ukraine's forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, for the second time, berated some of his commanders for poor tactics, saying that they had the staffing, the equipment that they needed, but they simply hadn't done their job, and so now he needed to send advisers in, or in some cases, make personnel changes. Stark comments, frankly, in the middle of a pitched battle from the key commander here in Ukraine, new to the job after his replacement was taken out by President Zelenskyy. The second time that Mr. Syrskyi has indeed suggested that his commanders are not up to the job in this area, and it comes amid signs that Russia is really on the front foot here on the front lines, with territory changing hands. Potentially, stark weeks or months ahead here for Ukraine, as western munitions and aid dries up fast, and they begin to see what that really means on the battlefield.

Look at all these deep purples in the Sierra Nevada. That's where we're looking at impossible travel from heavy snow and gusty winds.That is not only making visibility tough to see, but it's even knocking out some power, whiteout conditions, damaging winds from those gusts and extremely heavy snowfall rates. We're talking up to four inches of snow per hour. Some of these snowfall totals just through Saturday are measured in feet. We're talking 27 inches from Homewood Mountain and we're finding some totals already over 40 inches, 42 inches in Kingvale, California, Soda Springs nearing 40 inches. So, just incredible to see the feet of snow already falling and these blizzard warnings continue through a decent chunk of Sunday. So, expecting additional feet on top of that. And you can see that too, where all that moisture comes in off the Pacific. You've got the rain showers along the coast, but once we hit some of that colder air and the higher elevations, you get that snow machine to keep pumping as we go through the day on Sunday, additional snow likely as we go into Monday as well. Now, we're looking at totals possible up to 12 feet locally in some of the highest elevations over 5,000 to 6,000 feet. So, some of those highest peaks up to 12 feet of snow, but even in some of the lower elevations, we're still measuring that snow three to four to five feet, so, just really incredible. And it's coming with winged gusts that have been just incredible, over 100 miles per hour, 114 mile-per-hour wind gusts that has been reported at Mammoth Mountain in California. Some gusts nearing 150 miles per hour near Alpine Meadows. So, this wind, that's where you get the damaging part of it, and you get the whiteout conditions and the blizzard conditions as well. Now, we could continue to find these gusts upwards of 50 to 60 miles per hour in California as we go through Sunday. But the storm is so impactful that those winged gusts are spreading inland into the central plains. But we're looking at winged gusts up to 30 miles per hour possible from Albuquerque, Amarillo, and then up into the Oklahoma panhandle. Now, a couple of those gusty winds with incredibly dry air. That's where that fire danger is continuing. You've got relative humidity values that are down to 20 percent or lower as we go through the next day or so. So, that's keeping that fire danger elevated as we go through Sunday because we have the strong winds gusting up to 35 miles per hour. We have temperatures that are much above average and we have dry air with those relative humidity values pretty low. Plus, we already have ground conditions that are already dry, burned scars, where we've had the biggest fire in Texas history over the last couple of days, burning over a million acres of land. Here's a look at these temperatures. I mean, soaring into the 70s and 80s, a good 10 to 15 degrees above average.

So, many developing nations are staring down the barrel of aging populations, and they're wondering what they're going to do about it.And the first departments that end up in the line of fire, of course, are healthcare. How are you going to cope with the increased needs of a more elderly population? What the Korean government is saying, South Korean government is saying, is they may face a shortfall of 15,000 doctors by 2035 if they don't address the problem now. And the solution for this is to train up more medical students. In fact, they want to train 2,000 of them by 2025. Well, this is what the incumbent doctors are protesting against. And they're saying, we're already overworked, we're already underpaid. And in terms of overwork, some estimates put it at 100 hours a week in a five-day week. That's 20 hours a day. It's the system that's broken, fix the system first. It's not that we don't want reform, it's just look at the initial problems and also government. They want the government to give them the rationale for that 2,000 figure. Obviously, this is impacting on the public. There are people being turned away from clinics in the midst of all of this. Here's what one university student has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIM HYUN-JOON, UNIVERSITY STUDENT:  I want the number to increase, but I hope that the medical industry and the government can discuss well and come to an agreement to resolve the current situation.

And I think that's a really important point.One of the issues in the system right now is the higher pay amongst doctors is on services, like dermatology or plastic surgery. What the government is trying to do is to see that we have more qualified doctors in the essential areas, such as pediatrics, obstetricians, general practitioners. And this is very much about the economics of and resources that are given out to these various services in the big cities. The other big challenge they face is making sure that more doctors are going to rural and regional areas. Now, this was part of a bill that was submitted in parliament, but it was blocked by the opposition, interesting ahead of an election on April 10th.",
