We have lots of friends and colleagues from the Explorers Club, which is, by the way, a professional association of explorers, about 3,500 strong. And so we have members on board a lot of the vessels at sea right now. And so we get both official data and a bunch of unofficial data, which, in many ways, creates additional confusion versus clarity as to how to interpret those signals. So, we do need to wait for official word.",

But I have been both in spacecraft to space and a variety of submersibles down to the very deepest point at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.And what is interesting about both spacecraft and submarines is that many of the issues are almost identical. For example, on life support, you have to add oxygen, you have to scrub out the CO2. You have to manage the total pressure of about one atmosphere. You want to keep the temperature within livable range, that sort of thing. But then when you get to the pressures involved, the two types of vehicles deviate dramatically. In the case of a spacecraft, you're only having to hold in one atmospheric pressure compared to the vacuum of space. When you are going down, down to the Mariana Trench, it is a thousand atmospheres of pressure. Here at the Titanic, it is merely about 500 times the surface pressure of air, which is still obviously an enormous amount of pressure. And that is why a spaceship hull is very thin, not much more than a coke can, but it takes numerous inches of steel or, in this case, carbon fiber to hold out the enormous pressure. Plus, the design is, you know, a spacecraft has often a more complex shape, a submersible, the hull of that pressure, is almost always a cylinder or a sphere.",

So, ultimately, the U.S. was initially pushing for a two and two, two American reporters, two Indian reporters getting to ask the two leaders questions. Instead, it will be a one and one. But U.S. officials here are certainly seeing that as a victory to get the Indian prime minister to take questions, a sign of democratic values and, of course, press freedoms, which we know have eroded under Modi's tenure as Indian prime minister.

Today's mission, defending the Penghu islands situated right in the middle of the Taiwan Strait from a Chinese paratrooper assault. In rapid succession, infantry units storm a captured airfield. A column of tanks quickly follows. This maneuver is just a training exercise but with the very serious goal of readying these forces to defend Taiwan from a Chinese invasion. COL.

      "sentences": "Totally. But let's just get the basics first, \"ProPublica\", which earlier reported on Clarence Thomas and Harlan Crow, another megadonor billionaire, \"ProPublica\" reported on their relationships. What happens last night, suddenly we first see Samuel Alito calling attention to this report before we know what's in it.But here are the basic outlines so everyone can know what was in the report, that Samuel Alito had taken a luxury trip to Alaska back in 2008, with Paul Singer, somebody who has given lots of money for conservative causes, and has litigation before the Supreme Court. These are the kind of details that were in that report, that the fishing lodge had charged more than $1,000 a day. The private jet going one way could exceed $100,000 and the wine they drank there reached about $1,000 a bottle. Now, Samuel Alito responds. As he responds, he does mention he's not sure he drank on this trip, but knows the wine wouldn't be $1,000. But here's what he says is most relevant when he talks about the event. He says that my recollection is that I have spoken to Mr. Singer, I know more than a handful occasions, all of which was a small talk during the fishing trip 15 years ago, consisted of brief and casual comments on events attended by large groups. On no occasions have we discussed the activities of his businesses and we have never talked about any case or issue before the Supreme Court. And the reason this is important, Alex, and the reason he's trying to rebut this is, is that, first of all, there are all sorts of ethics rules about -- or first of all, as you know, the Supreme Court doesn't formally abide by these, but there are general restrictions on what judges can do. And one is not to take these kinds of gifts. Private jet travel like this, $100,000 one way, that should have been disclosed on his report. He didn't do that. And then, following up on it, when cases came to the Supreme Court involving Paul Singer and many did, including one billion dollar deal against Argentina, Samuel Alito didn't recuse, he's saying he never should have. But this just goes again to the fact there's no form at code of ethics, and there's no way for someone to lodge a complaint and try to get a resolution.",

And I have really just made a dent, a fairly modest dent in the Russian lines, no great swaths of territory have been seized.Now, we were speaking with the troops on the frontline and they basically said that they have been successful at routing Russian infantry. The problem is that when they take new territory, a come under a massive barrage from Russian artillery, Russian artillery throughout this war has really been one of the main weapons the Russians have used to their advantage, just using a massive amount of ammunition that they clearly have in large supply. So, the morale seemed to be high when we were up there, when we were at the front. But there was a certain level of frustration that this offensive, which was anticipated by so many, but also by the Russians -- that it just is not working out the way people were hoping. And, of course, let's keep in mind the Russians, as well as the Ukrainians, had months to prepare for this. And, for instance, after the destruction of that dam, which flooded a huge area, by all accounts -- and certainly, even Ukraine Ukrainian officials are acknowledging it -- the Russians were able to move some of their forces to this front, south of here, south of Zaporizhzhia. So, it's becoming more complicated. What we did see is, there are western weapons there. We were with a mortar unit that was firing a brand-new American 120 millimeter mortar rounds towards the Russians, and they were very happy with his weaponry. They said it was great. It's amazing, and very accurate. But they still, perhaps, don't have that critical mass to allow them to make the sort of dramatic gains that they were hoping to make when they launched this offensive earlier this month -- Alex.",
