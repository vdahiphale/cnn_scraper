It was taken by a tourist who witnessed King taking off.King's mother told ABC News that she's shocked her son crossed into the hermit Kingdom, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Officials say that Army Private Travis King was supposed to return to the U.S. on Monday for disciplinary action over an alleged assault in South Korea. But instead of taking the flight back, he somehow ended up on a civilian tour of what's known as the Joint Security Area where he then ran across the demarcation line. U.S. military officials say that King did so, quote, \"willfully and without authorization.\" CNN's Natasha Bertrand is a Pentagon tracking this for us. Natasha, the big question here is motivation. Have we learned more about why Travis King did this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, we are getting a few new details here and there from members of his family.Notably, his uncle did speak to \"The Daily Beast\" and suggested that the recent death of Travis King's young cousin may have contributed to his unstable mental state, at which the uncle speculated may have contributed to his deciding to run across the border there and into North Korea. We're learning more about his back story. He was facing disciplinary action in South Korea as a result of assault charges from allegedly assaulting members of the public in South Korea. And he actually spent 50 days in a South Korean detention facility before being released on July 10th. Now July 10th, that was just a little over a week before we saw this all play out where he crossed that military demarcation line into North Korea. And actually, just the day before he ran across that border, he was supposed to board a flight home back to Fort Bliss in Texas because he was due to be administratively separated from the U.S. Army. He was going to be removed from the military all together because of those assault charges that he had faced in South Korea. Well, now we know that when he was going to board his flight at the airport on July 17th, he actually never made the plane. He never boarded it. Instead he ended up booking a tour, this private tour at the DMZ. And that, of course, is the photo that we now have showing him in civilian clothes on that tour. Now, U.S. officials have been trying to reach out to their North Korean counterparts about this, but they have had no luck. U.S. military officials say that they have not received any response by the North Koreans. Which is not surprising because, as you mentioned, Boris, the U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with the North Koreans or even spoken to them really since the Biden administration came into office. So this is going to be very challenging for the administration to resolve. Travis King's mother also spoke to ABC and said this is very surprising to her that he would do something like this. But, of course, she really wants him to come home -- Boris?",

He's been to the Joint Security Area twice. So, Josh, let's talk about this area. I'm curious about your impressions of it, this demilitarized zone. It separates North and South Korea, established in 1953 as part of the Korean War Armistice agreement. It's roughly 150 miles long, a mile wide. This is the little bubble where there is sort of a porosity and, normally, you have this fence stretching the area and there's barbed wire along that part. I think what sort of stood out to me, once you get out to this area where you can tour, is, are you kidding me, this little curve is the border between North and South Korea, the only thing stopping you from going over to the other side.",

And you can see over here a North Korean soldier who is looking in from the North Korean side as she's in. But just talk a little bit about the political leaders who have been in here.",

In other examples, it's been a show of peace and diplomacy and outreach.There's the Trump example, which was just crazy because he became the first sitting American president to cross that border and, you know, had his various meetings with Kim Jong-un. That was the most interaction that the two governments ever had. Didn't work for a lot of reasons, but that was probably the time that it was the most significant. And he showed up on a whim. He wasn't supposed to be there. He tweeted to Kim Jong-un, \"I'm on the way,\" and he showed up with his daughter and son-in-law and sent John Bolton to Mongolia so he wouldn't be there. So you know, a lot of -- it's a piece of history. But right now, it's just a place of tragedy. And I think we need to understand that this is not really about diplomacy. This is about apparently a troubled young man who, you know, threw his freedom away and did something very foolish for reasons we can't really pretend to understand. That he's now turned that border into a much more dangerous and heightened place of tension because, you know, if you can just run over it, who knows who is going to run over it next.",

He came home and died days later. We think of Jeffrey Foul as well in 2014, leaving a Bible in a hotel room and being detained for six months. This is serious business, Josh.

There isn't a hidden private story that is more complex. That was interesting. He said that essentially Putin cut that deal with Prigozhin to, quote, \"save his own skin.\" But he used some kind of color metaphors to describe quite how Putin had flip-flopped over Prigozhin. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIR RICHARD MOORE, BRITIAN MI-6 CHIEF: He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin. He cut a deal to save his skin using the good offices of the leader of Belarus. So, look, I can't see inside Putin's own head.
