Tens of millions of Americans right now are facing the brunt of one of the biggest winter storms in modern memory. From the Pacific Northwest to New England, Texas to Tallahassee, we have seen temperatures plunge in some places by tens of degrees an hour. Coastal flooding, gale force winds, blizzard conditions, roads iced over causing massive pile ups, including the one you see here on the Ohio Turnpike, which took at least one life. We're also seeing more than a million homes without power tonight, more than 5,000 flights canceled. CNN's Polo Sandoval is in Buffalo, Ground Zero right now for the storm, where we're just learning that hundreds of drivers are now stranded on icy roads in arctic temperatures; Omar Jimenez is at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, meteorologist Derek Van Dam is in the Weather Center. We begin with Polo Sandoval in Buffalo. Polo, I wonder what you can tell us about these stranded drivers and what exactly they're facing tonight.",

I'll let you really kind of look at this for yourself. These whipping winds started early this morning and they have been relentless. They have not stopped and Mark Poloncarz, the Executive of Erie County reporting that it is very likely that these conditions will continue all night. And then finally, perhaps some relief from the snow come daybreak, but these winds are likely to continue. Earlier today, wind gusts at 79 miles an hour confirmed by the National Weather Service here in Buffalo, that surpassed what they saw it during a historic blizzard in 1977. So authorities certainly not kidding, Jim, when they said that this was going to be an extraordinary storm. And finally, authorities here are sending out as much advice as they can to some of those folks that are stranded. I know sometimes folks will listen to us on satellite radio in the vehicle, so the key advice that is coming from authorities right now is, if you are stranded, to stay in the car and simply run it for 10 minutes at a time for heat, make sure that exhaust is clear and to make sure that authorities could see you if they pass by. But again, the key, to stay in the vehicle. And finally, I'll show you why as I make sure that there is no traffic coming, if you step out of the car, it is so easy to basically lose any visibility and become extremely disoriented and that's what authorities are tremendously worried about right now as it comes tomorrow morning that many people could or at least they could wake up to some horrible news and that's why authorities are going to be working all night long, braving these conditions to make sure that people are safe. And the really what I've heard time and time again hear, Jim, coming from even Governor Kathy Hochul, people need to resist the urge in the area to leave their homes to spend Christmas with their families if they're not with them already.",

You've heard about the wind, and you saw Polo's live shot coming out of Buffalo, that is Ground Zero for the heaviest snow, but when it comes to the dangers from this system, it is this bitter, bitter air that we're all experiencing in places that don't normally experience these types of temperatures as well.Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Atlanta, Georgia -- we're going to be below freezing for at least 48 hours. This is on the eve of the Christmas Eve that could be the coldest in the record books for Atlanta that goes back 50 years. So get to my graphics because I want to show you the location of where this Arctic blast of air is. Its cold front is quite significant over the Eastern US, and as we move into the I-95 corridor, there is not a lot of precipitation going on, but of course the cold air has reached you in New York, DC, and Boston. The cold front has moved through, settling into Buffalo. It's the wind direction that makes this so potent because it is carrying all of that moisture from the relatively warm waters of Lake Erie and producing that snowfall on the opposite end right where Polo is located and that is where we're going to be measuring snowfall in feet. I mean, we might not see Buffalo for a couple of days because of how much snow will fall downwind from Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, as well as Lake Michigan. My hometown in Grand Rapids is getting hammered right now. Now, these wind gusts are not typos, right, we're talking about near hurricane force gusts for many locations as this cold front moves through with wind advisories and warnings in place all along the Eastern Seaboard -- Jim.",

Now, you have these people stranded in their cars in Erie County. What's the latest we're hearing about them. Are you able to get to them? MAYOR BYRON BROWN, BUFFALO, NEW YORK (via phone): Jim, you're right. It's a real blizzard here in Buffalo. In the city proper, we have about 50 people stranded in cars; in Erie County, it could be as many as 200 people stranded in cars. We imposed driving bans this morning at 9:30 AM. Myself and Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, we knew that this storm would get people caught up that people would get stuck if they drove unnecessarily, and what we feared when we imposed the driving ban, certainly is happening right now. We will be sending Buffalo Police, Buffalo firefighters, and Erie County Sheriff's out to rescue people that are stranded in their cars.

So right now, if you're not here, if you're not with family, it is going to be very challenging. The roads are really bad. We're looking at between 36 to 48 inches of snow. That's the latest projection from meteorologists. As has been mentioned, wind gusts of 79 miles an hour. So, this has been a very challenging storm.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): We don't know his whereabouts, no information about him nor do we even know where he is.

Defendants having court appointed counsel forced on them. Many defendants having their right to appeal refused. Some defendants faced with charges which could carry the death sentence being handed down in a single sitting. Terrified Iranian families believe that while the world is busy celebrating the holiday season, busy with their families, that they in Iran face imminent execution of their loved ones.

They told us that in the days after his arrest, they were unable to get word from him or about him from authorities, even as the Iranian authorities denied his arrest.
