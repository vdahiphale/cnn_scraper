Among the dead, a member of President Zelenskyy's cabinet. The chopper went down near a kindergarten and we're told the crash also killed children who were on the ground, sadly.

You can see there's an ongoing effort to try to comb through the debris and the wreckage of this kindergarten to see if any other children or teachers may have been killed, may be injured, or beneath the rubble. Basically, what happened was about 8:20 this morning, local time, a helicopter carrying nine officials, including the interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, his deputy, the secretary of state of the Ministry of Interior, and six others basically appeared to have lost control somehow of the helicopter and crashed into this kindergarten. And what we know now is that 18 people were killed, at least. That includes all nine people who were on board the helicopter. We saw earlier on at the scene at least four bodies covered with gold foil blankets. But they are concerned that there could be more who were killed. Three children, tragically, have also been killed. Among those who were killed who were not on the helicopter, Don, were people and children. They were coming here to drop their kids off to school, and then sadly, this tragedy unfolded. We don't know yet exactly how this happened or why this happened. But the visibility was very bad this morning. We spoke to one neighbor who said the fog was so bad he could hear the crash, but he couldn't even see it from his window.

This was all before the shootings began. And I spoke to both of these lawmakers, and they say that he was complaining that he lost the election. And I just need to point out that he lost by such a massive landslide that you could double the amount of votes he got       and he still wouldn't have won. Now, the arrest warrant says that he was driven by election lies, and we see that, really, echoed in his social media accounts. He tweeted on his candidacy website and account that, quote, \"Trump just announced for 2024. I stand with him.\" He also says, \"I never conceded.\" And in another -- another tweet he said, \"Mine was also rigged, and I will fight it until the day I die.\" He does have his first court appearance later this morning, Don.

It's a lot of power for someone who was once stripped of her committee assignments two years ago because of her extreme views, a lot of the ones that you heard there. It's also a lot of power for someone who has repeatedly spread misinformation about the 2020 election, claiming it was stolen, that mass voter fraud tipped the scales, and blaming the media and, quote, \"deep state\" for Biden's win. It's also a lot of power for someone who once speculated about space laser causing the deadly 2018 wildfires in California, saying it wouldn't be a good look for the Rothschild banking firm. Marjorie Taylor Greene also spoke at a white nationalist convention last year, something that provoked then-Minority Leader, now House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to say, quote, \"The party should not be associated any time, any place, with somebody who is anti-Semitic.\" By now, the two are often side-by-side.

And that is because it is full of his allies, and it often reflects the speaker's wishes. So it's significant that George Santos was seated, not just by this committee, but also because it reflects the fact that Kevin McCarthy, throughout the last several weeks, has been arguing that George Santos was elected. He was elected and represents a million people, and therefore, while the ethics investigation plays out, he believes that George Santos should be seated on committees. Now he got two committees that are not known as A-list committees. They are not as high-profile as perhaps Financial Services or Foreign Affairs Committees that he wanted to have. But he was placed on the Small Business Committee, as well as the Science Committee. And it's going to be really interesting to see what kind of player he is.

The administration has been facing criticism over this even from some Democrats over how they've handled the matter related to the handling of those documents when they made it first known to the public. And in a call with reporters on Tuesday, there were a lot of questions, but not a ton of answers on what has happened behind the scenes. M.J. Lee is live at the White House for CNN THIS MORNING. M.J., I know you were on that call with our -- the rest of our White House team. What questions still were not answered by White House officials on this matter? And why did they say they couldn't answer some of those questions? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kaitlan, it's curious. You'll remember over the weekend, the White House Counsel's Office said now that there is a special counsel investigation, we are going to refer all questions to the special counsel's office. Well, yesterday they convened a press call with reporters to try to defend their handling of all of this, saying the president takes classified documents very seriously, that they have been cooperating from day one and will continue to do so. But after about 30 minutes of taking many questions from reporters, we basically just didn't learn any new facts. And these are important questions that are still outstanding. Questions like why did the White House wait to disclose the fact that there were classified documents that were discovered? Why did Biden lawyers who don't have security clearances proceed to look for classified documents after that initial discovery on November 2? Now, but the fact that they had this call anyway, even though clearly, there were a lot of facts that they just simply cannot share, I think just goes to show the struggle that the White House is facing right now, feeling like it really cannot address the facts of an investigation that is still ongoing.
