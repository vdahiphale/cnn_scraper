Joining us now from Tel Aviv is Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces.I just want to let you know, in case you can hear that noise, that is not a siren, that is just here at the port. It's an alarm going off in its normal course of business for those who may have been a little taken aback by the sound of the beeping. Thank you so much for joining us. I want to ask you about the Palestinian situation right now in Gaza. They are amassing at the Rafah border crossing to escape, as we heard from our Scott McLean, out of Gaza into Egypt, but there's confusion over whether it will actually open to humanitarian aid. Can you give us some sense of what you are hearing because Egypt and those in Gaza have been saying, look, there is a bombardment that has been going on in the region since -- of course, since the Hamas attack. We've all seen that happen. What's the status, as you know it, of the - of the critical crossing right now, that Rafah border crossing into Egypt? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Sara, we are on day ten of our military operation against Hamas in order to destroy Hamas's capability as a terrorist organization, as a governing body of the Gaza Strip, and an - and as the organization that perpetrated the atrocities against the families of Israel living in the Gaza - living in the surrounding areas of Gaza Strip. That operation is ongoing, and we are striking Hamas wherever they are, but focusing most definitely in the areas in the heart of their operations in Gaza City. And in order to negate their operational capability, pursue their leaders and destroy their professional offensive capabilities such as drones and so on. With regard to the humanitarian situation, we are taking measures in order to evacuate people from the north to the south and I'm happy to report that there have been hundreds of thousands of people that have adhered to our suggestion that people go down. And, yes, as you're reporting about the situation in Rafah, I can't really comment on that because, you know, we are busy conducting our battle, our fight against the terrorist organization, while the diplomats are doing diplomacy in order to find and instruct. Of course, as the military, if we're instructed to hold, then we will. Currently we are conducting our strikes. We are determined to defeat Hamas. We are determined to destroy all of their capabilities and make sure they can never ever conduct and use the Gaza Strip as a staging ground to butcher babies in their bedrooms, Sara.",

From your advantage point, when he is here, do you have any sense of timing?

So, when you were reporting earlier about the need for bringing foodstuff and fuel, who can guarantee that it will actually reach anyone other than Hamas that will help them in their battle effort?

They have, you know -- they've been terrible to the people of Gaza. They've let them down miserably. And -- and this is just the eventuality of their making.When they declared war on Israel, they made a huge mistake. When Hamas declared war against us, they basically signed their death warrant. Our job is to secure the safe - and restore safety and security to the people of Israel. You know, there are some 1,000 -- over 1,300 people that were butchered at the instruction of the Hamas terrorist organization. So, indeed, these images of children on -- in Gaza. But also, you know, we are still -- there are children that have been abducted by Hamas and being held by them. They have no regard for human life. Israeli or Palestinian. And this is the tragedy of it. You know, this it - this government, the Hamas government, this terrorist government, they have - they have done nothing good for the people of Gaza and, unfortunately, in - in our efforts to secure the state of Israel, it is indeed the people of Gaza that are paying the price for their poor leadership, for the people -- for the Yahya Sinwar, and all of his cronies, the people beneath him, the people he empowered, the people he financed, the people he gave the order to go to south of Israel, to go to kibbutz Be'eri (ph), to go to Kfar Aza (ph), to go to - go to Rahem (ph), to go all of these people that he instructed them to go, him and his organization, he is going to pay a price and we are going to be rid of this organization.

Now, that is only one member that he has flipped so publicly now, but it is an indication that Jordan at least is winning some folks over.Now, one of the frustrations that has existed from members of the conference is that Jim Jordan had actually finished second last week, if you remember, against Steve Scalise. Then Scalise ended up dropped out after he couldn't get enough support in the conference. Jim Jordan put his name toward again. He won in conference. And there are some members who are frustrated that Jordan allies are going to be - going to be essentially rewarded if they support Jim Jordan on the floor. Now, we expect that Republican lawmaker are going to return to Washington, have a closed door meeting tonight at 6:30 p.m. and then they could go to the floor and vote as soon as tomorrow at noon on the speaker of the House. There is some feeling among Jordan allies that if you get out onto the floor that perhaps you can start to build pressure on members to support you once you're there. That, obviously, a strategy that Kevin McCarthy deployed back in January. It took him 15 rounds, but he eventually became the speaker of the House. So, huge questions remain, whether Jordan is going to be able to drum up the support he needs, John. But, obviously, this endorsement from Mike Rogers, significant.",
