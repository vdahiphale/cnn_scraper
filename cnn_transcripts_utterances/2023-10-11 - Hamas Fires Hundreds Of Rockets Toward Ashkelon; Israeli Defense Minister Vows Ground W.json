The death toll in Israel continues to surge with more than 1200, mostly civilians, killed, and close to a thousand Palestinians, again, mostly civilians, now dead in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry.Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have been unrelenting, with more than two thousand Hamas targets destroyed, according to the IDF, and with no timeline at this point when those airstrikes will end. Hamas fired another barrage of missiles and rockets at the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon on Tuesday, with three Hamas militants also dying in an exchange of gunfire with Israeli forces. Israel, preparing for the next round of retaliation, calling up more than three hundred thousand reservists and evacuating civilians from areas close to the Gaza border. Entire cities and communities have been evacuated to safety. Israel's defense minister toured the area where tanks and troops are now amassing. He says the offensive against Hamas may have started from the air but it will also come on the ground. Meantime, Israel says rockets launched from Syria in the north into territory, fell in open areas. Israel is also adding tens of thousands of troops to its northern border with Lebanon. In Washington, President Joe Biden confirmed at least 14 Americans were killed in the Hamas attacks. The White House says 20 or more Americans remain unaccounted for. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: This was an act of sheer evil. More than a thousand civilians, slaughtered. Not just killed, slaughtered. Stomach turning reports of babies being killed. Entire families slain. Young people, massacred. The brutality of Hamas, this blood thirstiness brings to mind the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And there have been more than 450 targets that Israel has hit in the last 24 hours, according to the IDF. We know that the death toll now, according to the Kan public broadcaster in Israel, is at least 1200. To put that into context, that's around about half the number of fatalities that Israel suffered in the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago in the Gaza strip.Since Israel launched airstrikes in response to this Hamas attack on Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning, more than nine hundred Palestinians have been killed. So, the death toll is rising, and of course, as we were seeing in Nic Robertson's report just there, that the sheer horror and brutality of this attack is becoming clearer by the day, with Yoav Gallant confirming that some of the victims from Hamas' attack were beheaded, talking about women, children, toddlers, elderly being brutally butchered by Hamas, in the words of the IDF, in an ISIS way of action. Everyone is now expecting some kind of ground invasion to take place. Israel will know that Hamas is not only expecting them to go in on the ground, but probably wanting Israel to go in on the ground. They will no doubt have booby trapped many buildings, there will be improvised explosive devices, and of course the very real risk that more Israelis -- Israeli soldiers of course in this case, as opposed to the one hundred to 150 people already being held by Hamas, the very real risk that soldiers could be captured as well as the real risk of their being killed as well. We know that from the US, from President Biden, that again, with another conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressing the US' unwavering support for Israel right now, also using the same terms describing Hamas as ISIS-like in the way that it has gone about its attack. And calling on the international community to rally around Israel as well, for all countries to condemn Hamas' attack on Israel. And the US also putting its money where its mouth is. We know that secretary of state Antony Blinken is on his way to Israel. We know that an aircraft carrier has been moved to the eastern Mediterranean, that the US has already started supplying Israel with additional ammunition and more interceptors for that iron dome rocket defense system, which of course has been shooting down many of these thousands of rockets that have been fired by Hamas from the Gaza strip into Israel since the early hours of Saturday morning, John.",

Well with hundreds who are dead, more than four thousand have been wounded in Gaza according to the Palestinian health ministry.These are some of the major strikes which have been carried out by the Israeli Defense Forces and Gaza. Israel says its aircraft struck more than 70 targets overnight. Palestinian officials say dozens of buildings, including residential homes, schools, medical institutions, have all been flattened, including parts of downtown Gaza. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BED WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Gaza city neighborhood once known as El Rimal, The Sands, reduced to ashes. Its residents retrieve what they can, which isn't much. Israel continues to pound this strip, targeting, it says, Hamas infrastructure. Residents, in shock, are asking why? [00:10:04] YAHYA AL-AHWAL, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): I got married this year, says Yahya Al-Ahwal. What did I do? What have we done? You destroyed an entire neighborhood. He says he never fired a rocket. WEDEMAN (voice-over): And this, one of the most densely populated patches of land on Earth. Bombs crashing into crowded neighborhoods rarely differentiate between fighter and civilian. The death toll rises by the hour. While Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with the wounded, including infants. Around 40 percent of the population of Gaza is under the age of 15, according to the CIA. The information ministry in Gaza reports that nearly 170 buildings have been destroyed and more than 12 thousand residences damaged. Tens of thousands have fled their homes, seeking refuge in UN schools, converted into shelters. An oven in this bakery in Gaza city has shut down, many of the shelves empty. Life here was already difficult, and now the future looks bleaker than ever. WAHIBA SIRSAWI, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): Gaza will take five years to raise its head after this, says Wahiba Sirsawi, and after five years, there will be two or three more wars. It's a catastrophe. WEDEMAN (voice-over): And amidst all this, somewhere in Gaza, only Hamas knows where, are more than one hundred Israeli captives, fates unknown. Tuesday afternoon, Israel struck Gaza's only port, used principally by fishermen. While at the same time, Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets towards Ashkelon. The abyss approaches.

Rather maybe the general framework of sending arms, or helping with guidance. It's clear that these -- the members of the so-called Axis of Resistance, moqavemat, are now much better coordinated. And the headquarters, the headquarters outside of Israel and Palestine, of both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the recent few months, relocated from Damascus, where they felt less safe from Israeli bombing, to the Dahia porters (ph) where the headquarters of Hezbollah is located, and taking shelter over there. Now when you have all those together with Iranian representatives, you can just imagine the coordination between them has accelerated.",
