The Manhattan district attorney moments ago said he's looking at more charges for the CEO murder suspect, as we learn what Luigi Mangione's mother told police about her missing son. Mangione's attorney will be OUTFRONT. Plus, Ted Kaczynski's brother has a message for the CEO murder suspect who repeatedly praised the Unabomber. This is an OUTFRONT exclusive. And new details tonight about the relationship between Vladimir Putin and the failed dictator he's hiding in Russia. And what Bashar al- Assad's son was doing on the very day Aleppo fell. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with breaking news, more charges. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, says he's confident that the alleged killer, Luigi Mangione, will be extradited to New York and quickly, and that he could face more legal trouble, telling ABC News moments ago, and I quote the district attorney: As we learn more about motives and other things like that, there may be additional charges. It comes as troubling new details are emerging about the alleged CEO killer Luigi Mangione and the months leading up to the assassination in midtown Manhattan. Our John Miller this hour is reporting the suspect's mother told authorities that she last spoke to her son on July 1st. So July 1st, she speaks to him 140 days later. November 18th is when she reported him missing to the San Francisco Police Department. She told police at that time that his voicemail was full and she was not able to leave a message. So 140 days from the conversation to the missing report, and then 16 days after that is when police say Mangione is there on that camera outside a midtown Manhattan Hilton stalking Brian Thompson and opening fire and assassinating him. This is investigators dig deeper into Mangione's past, the mystery deepening into how a valedictorian of a prestigious prep school in Baltimore ended up as the prime suspect in an assassination that has shocked the nation and the world. As high school graduate, Mangione, spoke about a common purpose, and he spoke about exploring the unknown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
