And so President Biden, today, is going to go on the ground to meet not only with survivors and victims' families, but also to tour some of the devastation that has been wrought on Maui.The president is going to be arriving in Maui later today where he will initially get a helicopter tour of the island to see some of the devastation. He will then land near Lahaina, where he will go and see that area that is one of the most devastated areas on the island firsthand to view some of the damage. He will meet with first responders and local responders to get a briefing on the situation, as well as on the federal response. And we will hear from the president directly. He is expected to deliver remarks during which he is going to announce that Bob Fenton, the regional administrator for that area, is going to be named the chief federal response coordinator for this effort. An effort to -- a designation that is intended to signal that this is going to be a long-term recovery process, and one for which the federal government will indeed be on scene. The president, in a statement, saying, quote, \"I will do everything in my power to help Maui recover and rebuild from this tragedy. And throughout our efforts we are focused on respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions.\" Now, the president could hear some criticism of the federal response. Some local residents have been saying that they felt the federal response was too slow. The president also faced criticism from Republicans for the nearly five days of silence on this matter while he was at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home. But, most importantly, Victor, today will be an opportunity for the president to display that signature empathy, that while it may have been missing for a handful of days last week, it has been a hallmark of his political life and of his presidency as well. Certainly, a moment for him to present that front today.",

Millions of -- millions of become- to-back urgent emergency alerts were then sent out to residents across southern California. What are officials doing?

For those of you who are no familiar with the L.A. region, we have a lot of man-made rivers that are made of concrete. And we have a lot of unhoused people who end up residing along these locations. So, when it starts to flood, if you're, again, not familiar with the area, when the water starts rushing through, it becomes very dangerous, and we consistently, whether it's us or our fire department, pull people out of the rivers.So, what we did as soon as -- part of our preparation efforts, was to go out with our homeless outreach teams and then other county department personnel to engage, warn our community members there, things like putting out public address announcements with our helicopters, really trying to get people to safe ground. And then working with other partners to find them shelter for the next several days. And we have done that. I believe we made close to 200 contacts. And many of those people were offered services and shelter, at least through the duration of this significant storm.",

This is obviously \"The Des Moines Register\" poll, which is the marquis poll in that state. Look at this, he's got an over 20-point advantage over Ron DeSantis, his nearest challenger. This is the largest lead in an Iowa GOP caucus poll at this point since George W. Bush in 2000. Hillary Clinton, on the Democratic side, remember she had that huge lead. It had already shrunk by this point. So, the fact that Trump is up by over 20 points really gives you an understanding of how large his lead is in the state of Iowa.And I think this gives you an understanding of just how strong the Trump base is. Mind is made up about the top choice for the GOP nominee. Look at this, 66 percent of Trump voters say their mind is made up. That is significantly larger than the overall likely caucus goers at just 40 percent. And significantly larger than Ron DeSantis supporters who just 31 percent say their mind is made up about their top choice for the GOP nominee.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, nationally, Trump's lead is even larger. So, these are three polls that were out over the last week. Look at these leads for Donald Trump. He's at 62 percent in the CBS News/YouGov poll, 57 percent in Quinnipiac University, 53 percent in the Fox News poll.Look at where DeSantis is in all these polls. Look how far back he is. He doesn't crack 20 percent in any of them. So, in Iowa, you have that 20 plus point lead for Donald Trump. That's actually smaller than the lead we see nationally where we see these leads of 35, 40, near 50 points in this particular case. Of course, the primary is one thing. If Trump wins the primary can he go on and win the general election? And we've had three polls that have come out over the last week here. And I want you to take a look at how close this race is at this particular point. Granted the general election is over a year away. The largest lead for Joe Biden is just three points, within the margin of error. No clear leader. Look at these, one point. One point. If you go back where we were at this point four years ago, Joe Biden's lead was high single digits to low double digits. This is significantly closer than where we were four years ago. So, this idea that Donald Trump can't win the general election, I want you to lose that idea. This race is very, very close and Donald Trump is polling better right now than basically at any point during the entire 2020 cycle.",
