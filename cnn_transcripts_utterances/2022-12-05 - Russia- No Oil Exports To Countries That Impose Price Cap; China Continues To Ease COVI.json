England's World Cup win puts them in the final eight but a Chunnel challenge with the French are weighed. In business news, the West hoping Russian or price caps will carry some weight. And the U.S. jobs market strength while that's no debate, unemployment gains are far from sedate. Even as wage hikes continue to agitate at least some people on Wall Street. Let's take a look U.S. stocks set for a softer, open futures that far from all neat while the rhyming continues. But we're done for now as Investors await the challenges and of course assess the challenges posed by energy and wage inflation. Europe, as you can see also under pressure though the U.K. the FTSE 100. They're bucking the trend even with all this year's volatility in the United States. The DOW coming into today's session down just 5 percent now for the year look at that rebound the recent recovery driven by hopes that the Fed will slow the pace of rate hikes and allow some time to evaluate what's already in the system in Asia in the meantime COVID relaxation causing exhalation. Hong Kong shares finishing today's session up by more than 4.5 percent. Analysts at Morgan Stanley also going overweight in China they see a clear path now towards reopening even if it takes some time. The HANG SENG, in fact rising 12 percent over the past week has widespread citizen protests in China, triggering an easing of some lockdown restrictions across some of the major cities oil also responding to those Chinese reopening hopes. Fewer lock downs in the world's second largest economy surely will lead to more demand for oil even as OPEC Plus moves to keep their production targets steady uncertainty. Of course surrounding the West's newly implemented $60 a barrel price cap on Russian oil exports also, I think lending some support to prices here. The EU, the G7 and Australia hope the cap will have Russia's ability to fund the war in Ukraine. But the program of course could to backfire and push prices even higher. Adding to the already severe global inflationary crisis we will discuss throughout the show and it's also where we begin today's show. Clare Sebastian joins us now to unravel this oil situation and unravel indeed it is. Just explain Clare, what's going on because we've got three things the decision by OPEC to stamp out with their current plans. We've got the oil embargo or sanctions on seaborne or kicking into play and of course, that's $60 price cap so separate things but not mutually exclusive. Explain the impact.",

I think one of the critical implications of this is the sort of external factors in terms of the services to this oil industry to the insurance that's provided, because part of this is, if you don't adhere to that $60 price cap, then perhaps that means it negates any provision of those kinds of services and insurance, which for any buyer is a huge deal wherever you are in the world.",

Essentially, it's not really a price cap; it's mainly thefact that if you do you can buy Russian oil over the $60 mark. If you want but you will not be able to access G7 or EU insurance or financial services or trade services any of those kinds of services that go into shipping crude oil. And of course, the EU and the G7 do have a stranglehold on that market. So that is why they are able to do this. It comes with a lot of reporting requirements. You have to keep documentation, but according to experts that I was speaking to there isn't actually any sort of on the ground enforcement along the way. They're hoping that the penalty of a temporary ban for any ship that's found to be in violation of the sanction on accessing those services for I think 90 days, that will be enough of a deterrent stop people going against it. But there are potential loopholes, one of which is that there are reports that Russia has been amassing a sort of shadow fleet of old oil tankers to try to do its own shipping services to get around this Julia.",

And then after those air raid sirens reports started coming in have dozens of Russian missiles being fired, headed in this direction and then heading hitting locations potentially across Ukraine. And so we came down to this underground. I say bomb shelter; it's a reinforced concrete area adjacent to the underground parking garage. So it's not necessarily specifically just the bomb shelter, but you can see they've set it up. There's Wi Fi, there's tables, and there's everything that you need to continue to operate into broadcast safely. As we wait for an all clear, which has not arrived we don't know if there are going to be multiple waves.

We don't really see into decision making in the Chinese government. But if you look at the chronology here that basically two weekends ago, you had protests spread out almost simultaneously across the country. And then in a matter of days, the Chinese government has gone from what Xi Jinping was saying at the end of October at the Communist Party Congress. He was saying that you needed to have tenacious pursuit of the zero COVID strategy to just a couple of days ago, a Vice Premier saying that China's pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission, and that one measure that you no longer have to get a negative PCR test for COVID. To ride on public transport in more than 20 cities around the country that is substantial. And it is something that is giving some kind of good spirits to some people in China that said there are still a number of restrictions for travelling between provinces, for example. You can travel out of Shanghai, but if you come back in you have to quarantine yourself at home. You still have testing, for example, in Beijing; it still requires a COVID test every 48 hours to go to shopping malls or to office buildings. And that testing has gotten more difficult because abruptly the authorities removed many of the testing points. That means there's more demand at fewer points and longer lines. And this is part of the daily routine that Chinese all over the country have had to live with. But again, there are some signs of improvement and given the pressure that Chinese people have been living under that Chinese businesses have been struggling to function in schools every side of society that is caused for at least a chance to breathe and exhale.",

      "sentences": "I mean, first Julia, we have to start with understanding we don't know exactly what we're seeing, right? This isthe OPEC nature of the Iranian government where press freedoms are limited, where international journalists are not getting access to those demonstrations on the ground that makes these conflicting reports so murky, so confusing. Let's start by breaking down exactly what the attorney general of Iran said over the last few days. I'll start with most controversial one these reports that Iran's morality Police might have been shut down or abolished. This was an off the cuff remark by the attorney general, in response to a question from a reporter who said where is the morality Police? And he was asked that question because by and large, those on the ground say they have not seen those patrols taking place during the course of the last three months, during the course of these demonstrations. Now, state media has pushed back on these comments made clear that the morality Police actually fall under the purview of the Interior Ministry. So the attorney general would have no power in that case. So put all of that aside, but what is important here is that hijab law being reviewed. Of course, one of the major demands of these demonstrations, which started after the death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini in the custody of morality Police, allegedly for not wearing her headscarf properly. One of the major demands is that the hijab law be scrapped. Now, it is under review by the judiciary and the parliament. That review could take about 2 weeks' time, but it's not clear Julia if this could be a tightening of restrictions or you loosening of restrictions. And to your question as to whether or not this satisfies protesters. Well, this movement has going to get much bigger than where it originally started. Now many people taking to the streets want to see the entire Islamic system of Iran dismantled. In fact, I think that the hijab law would do very little to slow the protests on the ground. But it does reveal to us all this back and forth Julia where we're trying to read between the lines, trying to figure out what these conflicting reports mean. What it really reveals to us is an Iranian government that is struggling to contain a huge movement against it. That's really shaking the core of the authorities in Tehran. Again, three months go now people still continuing to come out to the street despite in very tough crackdown. That has left hundreds of people killed, according to rights groups thousands arrested and yet no letting up Julia.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at global oil prices climbing after OPEC and its key allies including Russia agreed to maintainproduction cuts which could go on until at least the end of next year. And today the European Union's ban on Russian seaborne oil comes into effect covering around two thirds of Russian imports to the European Union. At the same time, the EU, Australia and the G7 nations have agreed to impose a price cap of $60 a barrel on Russian oil shipped. Two nations not adhering to the embargo the idea is to keep all flowing around the world keep prices under control while restricting revenues received by Russia. Russia in the meantime has threatened not to supply nations that end up complying with those restrictions. And a spokesperson for the Kremlin has said Moscow won't recognize price caps on oil exports. Helima Croft is managing director and Global Head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Helima, I'm so glad you're here because that was my best effort at actually simplifying this. And I realized for most of our audience out there that probably scratching their heads and going what on earth is going on here? Can you please explain? I think for most people they understand what the point of the embargo is. And we restrict revenues that Russia receives for energy oil in this case, but then the price cap confusing. HELIMA CROFT, GLOBAL HEAD OF COMMODITY STRATEGY, and RBC CAPITAL MARKETS: So the price cap is essentially a means to keep Russian oil on the market because the EU six packets of sanctions, you mentioned the seaborne oil embargo into Europe also contained a ban provision of services, shipping, insurance, brokering to move Russian barrels two third countries. And officials in this town, Washington concluded that if those sanctions came into effect, you could lose millions of barrels of Russian oil from the market. So the price cap was devised as a way to allow Western service providers to continue to move Russian barrels, but at a cap $60. So essentially saying that Russia cannot profit extraordinarily from any rise in prices now $60 some have said is too high a cap Ukrainians have come out and said that is way too high they were pushing for $30. And so the question is, is it really going to dent Russian revenue? But certainly officials are hoping that it will keep Russian oil on the market. So the big question is, will Russia play along? Will they make good on their threats to withhold oil from consumers that pay at the cap or seek to pay below? That is a big uncertainty in the market right now.",

And we saw, so the price suppression, at least in Russian terms already. What's the danger here, perhaps that in the same way, as you describe, in this sort of initial scramble, where everyone works out how this is going to work? And particularly in terms of services and insurance, the provision of insurance services, everybody says, look, I didn't know what I'm doing here?

And if we weren't seeing what we were with the war and the embargo, and now the price caps would have been reasonable based on the economic outlook. And obviously, perhaps China relaxing, changes that even overnight, to be reducing supply further, because they were heavily criticized for what they did, what a couple of months ago.

It was a pretty, you know, short lived price rally. And so from the standpoint of Washington, I think they look at where retail gasoline prices are at 340 a gallon. And they're feeling pretty good about the sort of gasoline picture at this moment. But again, everyone's going to be paying attention to what happens in the coming weeks.

They're number one in their space, Marriott is numberone hotel company nationwide, number one in pet insurance. And they really see us as a platform with our 25 million customers. With Marriott it's starting with their homes and villas program and 80,000 properties that you now know our pets - were pet friendly. And we can actually provide the bowls, the beds et cetera before you go on their trip, which is quite special. When I come to New York, the hotel puts out bowls and beds for me and it makes me feel at home. And it made my Yummy feel at home as well. And with insurance similarly, my dog Yummy was a double cancer survivor each time that was a 20 or $30,000 bill. And that can be hard on a lot of folks and sometimes you maybe say I can't afford that. And what pet insurance allows you to do is make sure you are taking the best care of the pet. And for Petco it also provides us with ability to take those nationwide customers and make them Petco vet customers make Petco grooming customers or merchandise customers. So the dogs or cats get better taken care of and nationwide, be is able to bring them insurance. So it's really powerful for both parties.",
