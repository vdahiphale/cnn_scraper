A man who, as you've heard right there, has promoted conspiracy theories and other misinformation about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.With us now, old friends, Emergency Physician Dr. Leana Wen and Dr. Ashish Jha, Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Dr. Jha, I just want to start with you. You say the Robert Kennedy pick is an extraordinarily bad choice. Why? DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes, good morning, John. Thanks for having me here. A couple of things. First of all, this is a very big job. He's going to oversee the entire health agency of the United States. He's going to oversee Medicare and insurance that seniors have. He's going to oversee Medicaid that covers kids. Obviously, CDC, FDA, all of it. The second point here, the reason why he's a bad choice for it is, look, there is an approach we use to making policy decisions. It's not perfect, but we rely on scientific evidence, rigorous analysis. And as you heard from that clip right there, this is a man who sits and peddles some conspiracy theories, says stuff that is flatly not true. COVID vaccine -- I'm sorry, the COVID virus, the Jewish people were immune to it. How about to the 12,000 Israeli people who died from COVID? He just pedals in nonsense and it's not useful. And I really worry that if he brings those ideas to HHS, he's going to do an enormous amount of damage.",

LEANA WEN, EMERGENCY PHYSICIANIt's exactly as Dr. Jha mentioned with the conspiracy theories. I mean, we're talking about someone who is one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists over the last 20 years, who is globally renowned for being an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. And there are real problems, of course, with promoting falsehoods that could end up in people's -- people -- people dying. But I think it speaks to a broader point that we want, in charge of scientific agencies, someone who at least understands science and believes in science. But in this case, this would be somebody who has views. He questions things, which is fine. But you have to be able to believe in the scientific process that might disprove some of your views. And you have to accept those changes. And RFK Jr. has shown that he is unable to accept when his opinions, his views are debunked. And that's extremely dangerous and should be disqualifying for someone who is going to be overseeing scientists.",

The issues that I think there is broad agreement with Kennedy on with the scientific community would include the fact that we have many chronic diseases, including childhood obesity that we need to address.I also don't think it's wrong to address and challenge scientific dogma, including the issue of fluoridation of water, which I think there is real disagreement within the scientific community about fluoridation policy. But the problem still goes back to, do you believe the science at the end of the day? Are you able to say there have been dozens of studies published on a particular area that very clearly show, for example, that vaccines do not cause autism? Can that then change your own longstanding view? And if your answer is no, because I'm an activist, nothing will change my view. And that's the part that's disqualifying.",

The legislation would reinterpret New Zealand's founding treaty with its indigenous people who make up about 20% of the population.

The plane was forced to make a U-turn after five hours into the flight and hitting the severe turbulence you saw just there.
