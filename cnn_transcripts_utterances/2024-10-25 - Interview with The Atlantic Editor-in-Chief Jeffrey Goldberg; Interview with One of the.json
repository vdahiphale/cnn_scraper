But of course, you have people now questioning the timing of John Kelly going -- coming forward with this, given that these instances happened several years ago, now that we are just on the cusp of election here, just several days away. You spoke with John Kelly, The New York Times also has audio released from an interview with John Kelly, where he said that in his view, Trump did meet the definition of a fascist. Why do you think he is choosing now to speak out finally about this and his concerns? Was it the fact that just a few days ago, we heard a new line, a new threat from Donald Trump, saying that he wants to go after the enemies within, his political opponents here in the United States?",

What -- the only thing that's surprising is that some of these former Trump officials, especially people affiliated with the military, haven't said -- haven't spoken publicly before. They say that the reason they don't do that -- I mean, I think there's some nervousness about it, generally for their own security and their families and so on. But the reason that they don't do it generally is because they don't think that the military, in the best of all possible worlds, should be politicized. But I don't think there's anything nefarious here, like everybody else in the country, he has an opinion about Donald Trump and he's sharing his opinions. And I think there are a lot of people who worked for Donald Trump the first time around, and I include in this category Rex Tillerson, and Kelly, and Jim Mattis, and H. R. McMaster, and National Security Adviser John Bolton, another of his national security advisers, Mark Esper, secretary of defense. I think they can't quite believe that Donald Trump is on the cusp of becoming president again. They thought that after January 6th in particular, that OK, that America would have moved beyond this man and his obvious threats to what we would consider to be the traditional constitutional order. So, I think they're just reacting the way reacting the way they think would help educate certain, you know, swing voters about what they consider to be the nature of Donald Trump.",

One of the two candidates, one of the two major party candidates in this race tried to overthrow the government. And the other one didn't. I mean, it's not that complicated. Donald Trump, for the first time in the history of the American presidency, did not -- only did not accept the outcome of a legitimate election, tried to foment his followers to physically prevent and physically attack his own vice president from certifying his own the election. I mean, this wasn't that long ago. So, if I look at this race, I see there's somebody who fomented an attack on the Capitol and on the constitution and then there's someone who's running who didn't. So, if you're asking the question, who's a fascist or who's not?

In September, DonaldTrump was unrepentant over his past call for the death penalty for the so- called Central Park Five, the teenagers who were wrongfully convicted over the rape and assault of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989. Trump said the five pled guilty and badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately, despite the fact that after being coerced into falsely confessing, the five pled not guilty and the victim was not killed. The five men were eventually exonerated and released from prison and this week, have filed a lawsuit over Trump's comments, calling them false and defamatory. Trump's spokesperson says that it's just another frivolous election interference lawsuit. Among the five is Yusef Salaam, who is now a New York City council member.

So, they -- it was a very clever move on their part, and it was a Hail Mary, but it worked. And so, these Texas lawmakers are absolute heroes. They saved a man's life last Thursday night.

But if you wanted to do it, if you want to have a truly fair capital punished system there's a way to design one that ensures that all the trials are fair. The Robertson case in Texas is a perfect example of a trial that was grossly unfair. He never had a chance, OK, but you can provide for fair trials. And as Americans, we always still -- we at least pay lip service to the notion of fair trials. When I was a young lawyer, I always thought we had a fair trial. I lost most of my trials. But I was -- you know, I was fighting for something and fighting for a fair trial. And if we could ensure fair trials, we would not see so many wrongful convictions.

And while the while the police were actually at the crime scene gathering evidence and doing the proper job with, you know, the technicians and all that, the crime scene investigators, while they were doing their work in the apartment for hours, they stayed there for hours, and they did a great job and they decided right then it was -- there was a soul perpetrator, only one person did this, there was semen, there was blood, there was, you know, a lot of crime scene evidence. While they were doing that, the detectives outside the apartment were already screwing up the case. They zeroed in on a neighbor, another sailor who they thought was acting suspicious, and they thought maybe he should be the killer. So, they asked him to come down to the police station for interrogation. They kept him about 15 hours and verbally -- and they broke him down. And he finally gave this incredible confession that matched with none of the physical evidence. Classic case of a false confession. That was just the beginning. They went on and on and on. And when the DNA came back from the original -- from the perpetrator, they ignored that. At one time -- by the time they finally caught the real killer, there were seven U.S. sailors locked up, charged with capital murder, all of whom had been excluded by DNA, none of whom had criminal records other than one DUI charge.

He said, I would have confessed to killing my mother just to get out of the room. It was so horrible. And that's what these police do, not many, but some police. They know how to verbally break down suspects over a long period of time. All in one night, all without the benefit of the video camera being on, they break them down and they use all these dirty tricks. They'll say, yes, your two buddies, your two co-defendants have already confessed and they're blaming you, which is no lie. Cops can lie at will. They could lie excessively.

And that's why we have so many innocent people in prison. There's been this blood of bad science in our courtrooms.
