We have former Senate Candidate Joe Pinion, Paula Reid, CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent, Natasha Alford, Host of TheGrio Weekly, and Mosheh Oinounou, Host of the Mo News Podcast. But let's begin with the E. Jean Carroll case. The trial started today in New York, where attorneys laid out their case that Donald Trump raped Carroll in a department store dressing room in the spring of 1996. The judge is allowing Carroll to call two other women as witnesses to show Trump's pattern of alleged sexual assault. Carroll's attorney says in court today, quote, three women, one clear pattern, pounce, kiss, grab, grope, don't wait. When you're a star, you can do anything you want, and when they speak up about what happened, attack, humiliate them, call them liars, and call them too ugly to assault, end quote. Trump's attorney fired back saying, quote, she is abusing the system by advancing a false claim of rape for money, for political reasons, and for status. And in doing so, she is really minimizing the true rape victims. Okay, let's get to our panel. Paula, great to have you here with us tonight. So, E. Jean Carroll is expected to testify tomorrow. Is Donald Trump expected to testify or be in the courtroom?",

They are extremely concerned about any other issues that could come up in any kind of testimony. So, they do not want him there.I mean, look, even the former attorney general, Bill Barr, said, look, there is no need for him to testify this case. And so, I, at this point, do not expect to see him testify. And because this is a civil case, he's not required to really be there at all.",

I think ask any person who's ever been accused of rape or had to suffer the indignity of sexual assault, I would beg to differ.So, certainly, he's not going to come out stronger because of this. We've heard here some of the facts. This is going to be adjudicated in the court. It's a civil case. The president is unlikely to show up. But I do think, again, some of the themes that we will hear, that it is -- was it the fall of 1995, was it the spring of 1996, the allegations, they are quite graphic, they are horrifying, they shocked the conscience. And as such, people would wonder the lack of specificity around the dates. So, I, think again, all being told, it's a sad day for the country in many ways, as it relates to the fact that time and time again, you have so many women, President Trump aside, who feel as if years after the fact they still can't get justice for what they think has, or what they know has happened to them.",

They're going to try to make up for the lack of specificity in her case, in terms of her memory with a, this is the way the former president conducts himself. And we have several women who can speak to that. And so it remains to be seen what happens there. And, of course, this is a civil case, so this is preponderance of some of the evidence, right?

The fact that Donald Trump, there is a certain indignity of saying, I would never find that woman attractive enough to sleep with her. It is both insulting but it's kind of the way that predators can speak, right, to try to sort of downplay something that they've done, when, in reality, that is not what rape is about. It's not about necessarily being attracted. It is about being power. It is about overtaking. It is about sort of the cruelness of the act. So, again, I think this is bigger than Donald Trump.

But there is no such thing as, quote/unquote, a perfect victim, anymore than there is a perfect predator, right?We've seen whether we're talking about murder cases and domestic violence, whether we are talking about people who have been sexually assaulted, we have seen time and time again that the perfect victim turns out to be lying. We've seen that the problematic victim tends to be the one who's telling the truth. So, in the end, this is going to be heard in the court of law, jurors are going to make a decision. And I think, again, it might come to the president having to testify because if the testimony is so damaging, I think, on a multitude of levels, he may have to go in there and say, I did not do this, here is what happened.

The main thing was the main thing for Joe Biden.That January 6th happened, that anyone who is opposed to our agenda is opposed to your freedom, that they're going to talk about abortion, they're going to talk effectively about that kind of bellwether red meat stuff, for not just Democrats, but also those independents who lean left, particularly in light of President Trump. So, that is clearly what they were going to talk about. I think what's striking and what Republicans probably should be harping on is what was not in that video. We weren't talking about the claim that we have the greatest jobs president in the history of this country, which I think is because they recognize that that message is ringing hollow for a lot of Americans who are struggling on a day-to-day basis. The half million Americans who are at least 60 days behind on their car payments, those types of undeniable realities that what are the politicians, and to Frank's, point the pundits, on to acknowledge it or not.

If you're, you know, trying to eventually get independents and trying to get those people motivated in the middle, you're going to need a different message, because you'll need to speak to their concerns and their fears.

That property was sold to Brian Duffy, the CEO of prominent law firm Greenberg Traurig. But Gorsuch did not disclose the buyer. CNN found that lawyers for that firm have appeared in numerous cases before the Supreme Court while Gorsuch was on the bench. Then there's Justice Clarence Thomas. He's under fire again because records show that Thomas failed to recuse himself from a 2004 appeal that was tied to the family of that mega donor, that Republican mega donor, his good friend Harlan Crow. Of course, that's the same GOP mega donor that Thomas sold his childhood home to. He also accepted lavish gifts and very fancy vacations for more than 20 years without disclosing them. We have a lot to discuss here and my panel is back. Mosheh, that just doesn't feel right what they're doing, the fact that they are having these business deals.
