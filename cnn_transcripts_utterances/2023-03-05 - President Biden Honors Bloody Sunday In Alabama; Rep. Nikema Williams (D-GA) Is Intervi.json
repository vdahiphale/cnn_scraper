At any moment, President Biden will lead a crowd across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. We have some live pictures to show you right now in just a few moments.This is the site 58 years ago of Bloody Sunday, peaceful demonstrators were simply calling for equal voting rights for black Americans when white deputies and state troopers violently turned on them. It horrified much of the nation and became a seminal moment in the civil rights movement. As you can see right now, there you see President Biden joining hands with civil rights leaders, leading members of Congress. I think one of the House Democratic Leaders, James Clyburn, is there as well as other civil rights leaders. They're going to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge here in just a few moments and we're going to watch that live here on CNN as its unfolding. One thing we should note to our viewers is that the satellite images coming out of Selma have been a little spotty at times, but there you see it right now as the shot pulls out, the president linking hands with civil rights leaders and other African-American leaders as they prepare to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which is a civil rights landmark in this country. Let me go to CNN's Arlette Saenz, our White House correspondent who is on the scene there in Selma, Alabama. Arlette, we had a little trouble linking up with you earlier. I hope you're there now.",

And just a few moment -- and there's President Obama when he did it, holding hands with John Lewis and Michelle Obama so many -- back in 2015 when Barack Obama was president of the United States. That was just an incredible moment.And we see President Biden doing it today, Arlette. A vice president that many thought would not become president is walking that same walk that President Obama did eight years ago. Arlette, your thoughts as we're watching this.

You know, you're also seeing some folks there who are going across this bridge in a wheelchair or using a walker or holding on to a family member who might be a little bit stronger in terms of getting across this bridge.And it's a reminder that some of the figures of the American civil rights movement, they are heading into their golden years. And so, to see them appear there with President Biden crossing this bridge I think is a very stirring image and a thing to think about as well. It kind of reminds me a little bit of when I've been to Normandy a couple of times and you see members of the greatest generation, World War II veterans there. And as they, you know, age into their golden years, it's poignant, it's something to behold and it's something to think about and reflect upon. The same is here with the Edmund Pettus Bridge. These are major figures of the American civil rights movement. John Lewis is not there today, but if it weren't for the sacrifices they made, this country just wouldn't be where it is right now.",

But right in front of me where I'm speaking, there are several thousand who gathered here over the course of the day to hear the president's words, but also to commemorate that moment from Bloody Sunday 58 years ago.You know, I was here in 2020 when the late Congressman John Lewis made his final appearance here on Bloody Sunday. He had surprised the crowd driving up in his car to the very peak of the bridge. And it was an electric feeling when people saw and realized that he was here trying to urge people to keep up the fight for the right to vote. And so, this is a historic day. It's a sad day when you think of the brutality that played out here. But for so many, they are holding on to what it was able to spur, the fact that it was able to, you know, serve as a significant moment in the civil rights movement, that it did spur voting rights legislation to get passed. And so, for the president here, he is able to link up with these people, many who have been fighting for the right to vote for decades now, trying to have the symbolic gesture, a powerful gesture as they are taking those very same steps that so many activists took 58 years ago.",

And it's just such a powerful reminder. You know, there's so much cynicism and people are just very sad about the state of affairs in this country right now.And to think that, you know, people like John Lewis were beaten just for trying to cross a bridge to advance civil rights in this country. And you think we have things -- things are tough right now, imagine going through something like that in your youth, and then overcoming that and becoming a civil rights icon and holding hands with the first African American president walking across the bridge back in 2015.

I remember being with him in Birmingham, Alabama in 2019 when he delivered a sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church, which was the site of that bombing.You've seen him repeatedly go into African American church trying to really draw on the history of the civil rights movement. Just in January, he was at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where he delivered a sermon at the same church where Martin Luther King, Jr. served as pastor. So, for President Biden, he has shown this repeated commitment trying to highlight these points of history that have been so important for the country, but also particularly for black voters as well.",

And you know, actually, the last time that he was here in 2020 was the morning after the South Carolina primary, which helped catapult him to securing the nomination, in part with the support of Congressman Jim Clyburn. So, he has consistently tried to come and show up for these big moments commemorating Bloody Sunday, commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr.But he has also acknowledged that there is still so much more work that he wants to get done. Of course, voting rights, that was a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign, promising that, if he was in office, that they could get more protections for voting rights put in place. But so far, we have really seen that flounder up on Capitol Hill, first when the Democrats controlled both the House and Senate, really stymied in part by the filibuster. And then now they're going to be facing another hurdle as Republicans are now control -- in control of the House. So, there has been some frustration amongst activists that not more has been done. But the president has continually over the course of the past year tried to put the spotlight on the need for voting rights while also saying that he knows that more work needs to be done. You know, today he used that phrase that he started using in the State of the Union when he said we need to finish the job, pointing to a host of issues where I think voting rights is one of those issues that he would like to see action on. It's just unclear if there really is a reliable path with the current makeup of the House and the Senate and the filibuster in place.",

But at the same time the president made it very clear in his remarks that he sees a connection between the civil rights movement of the 1960s and what he describes as the battle for the soul of America and the preservation of American democracy.I mean, he was -- I think he made that direct connection during his remarks just about an hour ago, a little less than an hour ago when he was saying that the mission that was started then continues today. And that has been a centerpiece of how he became president of the United States. I mean, he made that a focal point of his campaign. He continues to talk about it now, not just domestically but on the world's stage. This is very much part of the Biden message. All right, Arlette Saenz there for us. And I think if we can just listen in for just a few moments, I believe they might be saying a prayer. If we can just listen to that for a few moments. (BEGIN VIDEO) REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): -- a black congresswoman, the souls who braved (ph) these foot soldiers never meant to be yet you made her so. Lord and his (inaudible) once would not allow a little black girl to ever dream of higher office. Lord, bless and heal Reverend Jesse Jackson from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. And Lord, bless the most powerful elected official in the world, the president of the United States. Lord, we are thankful to witness the truth in your word, the truth that the government would be on your shoulders. The government is indeed upon the shoulders of those who suffered like Christ himself. (END VIDEO)",

And I think the other thing that is worth mentioning here is that the president is making these remarks today, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge at a time when we're seeing anti-Semitism on the rise in this country. We're seeing hate groups, neo-Nazi groups, feeling emboldened in this country. It is something that the FBI has specifically said remains a threat to domestic tranquility here in the United States.And that is something that the Biden administration has had to grapple with as well. So even though this image that our viewers at home are looking at right now, for our viewers who are just tuning in, President Biden has just crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge with civil rights leaders there in Selma, Alabama to mark the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. I think President Biden himself would acknowledge that right now is an incredibly -- it is an incredibly polarizing time in the United States when it comes to some of these issues. He has had to grapple with this as president, as did his partner in the White House during the Obama/Biden administration. President Obama also had to deal with these issues. And Arlette, President Biden knows he's going to have to deal with that moving forward as well.",

And he really has said that people need to shine a light on some of these issues, hate-filled issues that are playing out across the country and that if you don't speak up, that that is essentially being complicit with what is happening.And so, part of what the president has tried to do with speeches like this is give voice to some of the frustrations that he has seen and really heard from from people across the country, and particularly today, it was focusing on voting rights and also some of the issues that so many black voters are facing across the country. I think that these are all common refrains that we hear President Biden turn to over and over again against the back drop of Bloody Sunday, of that march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and of course, holds a new and important significance as well.",

I will also note, one thing that we didn't get to touch on is that Selma was devastated by a tornado back in January. As we drove through the city, you can see the businesses and homes which have still -- appear to have been ripped through, still cleaning up some of the debris that impacted this area.The president and the city's mayor talked about the importance of the community coming together to try to recover in the wake of those tornadoes. So, the president is also coming here after that devastating moment. Now, he's going to be heading back to Washington, D.C. where he has a busy week ahead. Tomorrow, he's actually speaking to the International Association of the Firefighters -- I apologize if I didn't get that exact phrase right. But this is a group actually when he was running in 2020 that was really kind of pivotal for him as he got ready to launch his bid. It was kind of one of the big political moments for Joe Biden heading into that 2020 campaign, of course, trying to go and rally the support of union workers. And so, it will be an interesting moment to watch tomorrow, especially if you're trying to read any tea leaves about 2024.

I have a 7-year-old son who marched across the bridge with me, met the president today. But it also means a lot to have the president of the United States, the sitting president, here in Selma marching across the bridge, with not just elected officials, not in an election year, but as foot soldiers of the movement and uplifting all of the work that we continue to fight for in this country, for free and fair access to the ballot.",

And joining me now is Republican strategist Doug Heye. Some pretty stark contrast this weekend, Doug, between what took place over there at National Harbor and what is taking place in Selma, Alabama. But let me ask you your thoughts on last night and what we heard from the former president because he's in a position right now where he obviously won this very unscientific straw poll, but all of the other very scientific polls are indicating right now that he is the clear front-runner.

Remember, there was the matinee (ph) debate, and then the adult table versus the kid's table.And so, he recognizes that. And part of this is how the Republican national committee structures its primary process. So, if you start with winner-take-all states which the RNC did last time -- let's see if they do that this time -- it means that if you're a candidate who gets 2 percent or 6 percent, you're not getting any delegates. You're potentially taking some away.

Congressman Maxwell Frost, a Democrat who represents a district in Florida that knows all about this. He joins us next. We'll be talking to him in just a few moments. Stay with us. You're live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:45:00] ACOSTA: ACOSTA: More than 40 million people with federal student loans will have to wait several months to find out if they're going to have any of the debt forgiven. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last week on two cases challenging President Biden's plan to eliminate up to $20,000 in student debt for some borrowers. The justices aren't expected to rule until June or July, and Florida democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost joins us now. Congressman, I know you've been pushing for student loan forgiveness. What happens if the Supreme Court rules that the Biden administration's proposal is unconstitutional? What do you do next? REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): Well, the fight isn't over then. You know, what we're saying is no matter what the verdict is, the fight isn't over. There are still more actions that the administration can take. It might take some creativity, hopefully not much, in ensuring that the administration can use their executive powers and we can do our job in the legislative branch to ensure that this can be done. It is constitutional for the government to forgive student debt for not just students -- a lot of times when we think about this problem, we think about this issue we're just thinking about young people. It's young people, but it's a ton of older folks. It's seniors, it's people with working -- it's people with families, working class people who have shackles right now, economic shackles because they have this crushing student debt.",

Comer went on to say claimed that he didn't say that.But the White House slammed Comer for those comments. What is your response to the chairman, and how do you expect to get things done on the House Oversight Committee when it appears the chairman is pretty determined to really investigate the Biden family as much as possible?",

He said, look at the Judiciary Committee, look at Oversight, we're setting ourselves up, were his words, for 2024. Setting ourselves up in terms of messaging. So, in terms of getting things done on that committee, not much is going to get done on that committee to be honest. They are more interested in talking about Hunter Biden's laptop, the disgraceful comments from Chair Comer relating to the president's late son. It's just disgraceful, right.They spent two years during the midterms talking about inflation and education and all these issues, hitting Democrats, hitting the president, and now that they have the house narrowly, they're not talking about it at all. They're not talking about Housing. They're not talking about lowering costs for working families. They want to spend our time talking about Hunter Biden's laptop and made-up fantasies of an open border. And if you look at this Oversight Committee, we are rebutting those, you know, what they're saying and we're really shooting down those comments' day by day because they're not true. It's a waste of time and we really need to focus on what's going to help working families and the growing class of what we call the working poor.",

He's acting on scapegoating vulnerable communities due to his failures. He's not talking about how we're going to increase the amount of money per student in classes. He's not talking about ensuring that we raise teacher pay, that we ensure that parents do have a say in the way that their students are being educated outside of this bigotry that he has.He's talking about targeting queer students, targeting LGBTQ+ kids. It's not just the broader community. He's going for the kids. A piece of legislation that was just introduced pretty much would allow the state to seize, to kidnap trans children if they feel like they're at risk of gender-affirming care, and a lot of times, lifesaving health care as well. This is what we're up against in Florida right now. And it's hard to keep track of because it seems like there's a new victim. There's a new bill every day. But we have to call it for what it is. He is abusing his power and using the state to target political opponents and political enemies. And there's a word for that, and it's fascism. And we have to be honest about it. It's just a problem for Florida now, sure. But in a few years, it could be a problem for the nation. We need everybody to pay attention and talk about it, how he's targeting trans folks, targeting not just black history but black people in general, which is American history, and targeting marginalized communities across this entire state. And here's the sad, sad part, Jim. He's doing it because it's polling high for him in the Republican Party. And I think that says a lot about the state of that party right now. ACOSTA: And let me ask you this. You're the first, I mean, it's been noted many times. You're the first-generation Z congressman. I think the last time we spoke about this, I said, you know, I was doing other things when I was 25 and 26 years old, but here you are, a member of Congress. Let me ask you this. I mean, are you going to back President Biden for a second term? Would you like to see younger challengers out there? What do you think?",

But to be clear, I'm not one of these people that say, you know, wipe everybody out and just have young people at the table. We need a representative body, and young people, Gen Z and millennials make up a third of this country. We're nowhere near a third of the electorate.As far as President Biden is concerned, if he decides to run, I am going to back the president. You know, he's been one of the most pro- union presidents we've seen and I believe the most progressive president we've seen in modern history and I want to continue on that track of the amazing bills that Congress passed and the president signed last session. And so, we'll see what his decision is, but either way, I'm saying generally about politics, state and local politics, a lot of times we focus on the national. We need younger, good progressive legislators all across this country. The battles going on in Florida right now wouldn't be as big of a deal if we had more state legislators up there who actually gave a damn about people's lives. So, we need to pay attention to the full picture holistically here and not just the presidency, which is incredibly important, and I'm backing the president. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done on the ground level to build power across this country to protect our freedoms, our liberty, and our rights.",
