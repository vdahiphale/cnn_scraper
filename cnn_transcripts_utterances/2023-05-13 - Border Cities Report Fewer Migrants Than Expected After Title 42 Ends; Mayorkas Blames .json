But the rain, look at this map, this is just in the last 24 hours of all the rain. You can see some of these areas, specifically Del Rio down to Laredo area, and then also South Texas, you're talking about two to four inches that has already fallen. Now, we're expecting more today, which is why you have those flood watches in effect, because it's the compounding nature of this. Rain from yesterday. More rain today. More rain the next day. When you look at the total amount of all of that rain, it's going to lead to pretty tremendous, tremendously high amounts. You also have the potential for severe storms not just along the border, but really up to the eastern portion of the state of Texas, also areas of Oklahoma and western portions of Arkansas and Louisiana. The main threats here are going to be damaging winds and the potential for some large hail. But again, a lot of lightning with these storms and its multiple rounds -- that's going to be the thing. Even if you get some morning thunderstorms, it doesn't mean that you're not going to have some in the afternoon or a yet again in the evening. So, you've got several rounds of the showers and thunderstorms. A lot of them pop up in nature. So, it's really hard to determine exactly where they'll pop up.

And that people can go into those or actually make a virtual appointment, even see what options they have.

That is exactly the opposite of what Federal Reserve officials want to see as they try to push inflation back down to healthy levels. Now in high inflation, of course, is a big reason why consumers are not happy right now. Consumers' sentiment plunged to record lows last June, as gasoline prices spiked above $5.00 a gallon nationally. Now, as gas prices dropped, sentiment did improve but not by much. And consumer sentiment remains well below pre-COVID levels. Even though inflation has cooled off, recession fears, of course, persist and there have been new problems that have emerged along the way, including the banking crisis, and more recently, the standoff in Washington over the debt ceiling. In fact, the University of Michigan blamed the latest drop in consumer confidence, in part, on the debt ceiling uncertainty.

He also said defaulting on the U.S. debt would be potentially catastrophic.So, here is what happens if there is a default. First, it would almost immediately trigger a recession. The U.S. stock market would likely tumble, unemployment would jump, 401(Ks) could plummet, borrowing cost would increase -- that's on top of increased cost Americans are already facing from the Federal Reserve rate hikes. Social Security payments to about 66 million Americans could be delayed. Medicare payments to hospitals, to doctors, health insurance plans could all be affected. Millions of federal civil workers, civilian workers and active-duty military members could see their paychecks delayed. The United States has never defaulted on its debt. And it's unlikely to do that now, in part because the stakes are enormous. [07:25:37]",

MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Victor, Amara, these guidelines had really been in place since the earliest days of the HIV epidemic to try to avoid the HIV virus being spread through the blood supply. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIRRELL (voice over): But what is changing now is that for the first time in 40 years, the FDA has solidified these recommendations to make the risk screening to be the same for everybody, based on individual risk factors, regardless of sexual orientation, sex, or gender. And this really brings the United States in line with other countries like the U.K., and Canada. Now, this is something that had started way back in 1985, when the FDA had put a lifetime ban in place for men who have sex with men donating blood because of those concerns. So, that was in place really until 2015 when they said they can donate, but only after a period of absence of a year. Now, they shorten that during the pandemic, when there was a crisis in the blood supply in 2020. And now, of course, are changing the recommendations so that they will be the same for everybody. This is something that a lot of organizations like the American Medical Association have been calling for, for some time, and they lauded this move this week from the FDA. Organizations like GLAAD, also came out in favor of it, calling it, \"The beginning of the end of a dark and discriminatory past rooted in fear and homophobia.\" Now, GLAAD also pointed out that there are still limitations that they see with this, specifically the exclusion of users of prep, the antiviral drug to prevent HIV infection. They call that, \"continuing to erect barriers to LGBTQ blood donors.\" And now, of course, there is a hope that this could contribute to the number of people who will be donating blood. According to the American Red Cross, just three percent of age eligible donors in the United States donate blood yearly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
