      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right. New developments as the world reacts to a blistering U.S. air assault in the Middle East. Russia is now calling for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting over those strikes. The U.S. says it hit 85 targets linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Quds Force and affiliated militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks are in retaliation to a drone attack in Jordan, which killed three American soldiers on Sunday. Iraq claims these latest explosions killed 16 people including civilians, but the response is far from over. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is vowing that these bombings are only the beginning. Iran says the U.S. has made a strategic mistake while Iraq and Syria say the U.S. actions could inflame more conflict in the region. CNN has teams around the globe covering all of these developments. First, let's go to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez as she's in Los Angeles where President Biden will be traveling later on today. Priscilla, what more is the White House saying about this latest round of strikes?",

      "sentences": "Well, they're essentially saying that it isn't over yet. That there will -- this is a first of a series of strikes that are expected after those three U.S. service members were killed in Jordan.And President Biden was pretty direct about that, in his statement Friday afternoon, saying the following, \"Our response began today, it will continue at times and places of our choosing. The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this, if you harm an American, we will respond.\" Of course, we saw those 85 targets hit in Iraq and Syria over the course of a 30 minutes span on Friday afternoon. And Sources tell CNN that President Biden came to the decision on how to respond on Monday. Now, there were a few days in between, of course, before these strikes happen, and that was partially due because of the weather. They wanted to have clear skies so that there were no unintended casualties, and they could determine their targets. Now, senior U.S. officials don't believe that this will all -- will block our or end all of the attacks by Iranian proxies. But the hope here is that it does diminish their capabilities. And that's really the delicate balance that President Biden has had to navigate in responding here and being forceful enough, especially when American service members were killed and trying to deter any additional strikes, and also try to diminish the capabilities of these Iranian proxies, but also not get pulled into a wider regional conflict. That is something that the Biden administration has been very deliberate and careful about in trying to avoid any escalation in the region. Notably, the president -- the U.S. did not strike in Iran. That was unlikely going into the strikes. But it just goes to speak again, that the U.S. is trying to be careful here, as tensions are on -- as the countries, as the region is on edge.",

But they notably left out of that statement, Syria. Now, in the past during the war against ISIS. Jordanian warplanes did hit ISIS targets in Syria. So, there is a precedent for this. But it's also it's a question of what do American officials say when they said the Jordan participated? Did warplanes of Jordan participate? Or were they simply providing intelligence or logistical support? It's unclear. And it's also a very sensitive subject here because although Jordan is a close ally of the United States, many Jordanians are very, very angry at the U.S. for its continued diplomatic and military support for Israel and its war in Gaza. So, it's walking a fine line. And I think that might explain why the statements coming out of the Jordanians are rather ambiguous to say the least. Fredricka?",

So, these are perhaps normal operations for this U.S. carrier group that's deployed in the area, trying to prevent the Houthis from targeting navigation in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aden.

We'll continue to conduct these strikes, I'm sure in the weeks ahead. But, in the end, the Iranians may choose to accept the message from the mailman and to some degree to deescalate. But it's only a matter of time, before they re-up, rearm, and continue to work against American influence and interest in the Middle East. Iran wants the United States out of Syria and Iraq. And they are prepared to fight Israel and the U.S. to the last Houthi, to the last member Hezbollah, and certainly to the last pro-Iranian, Iraqi, and Syrian. So, this is a problem, I'm afraid without a solution. At the same time, we have to impose some costs and accountability on killing Americans with impunity. And we also have to toughen up our own defenses, to make -- at least to raise the odds, Fred, that when they strike, Americans will not be killed.",

We do not have a major confrontation with Israel and Hezbollah.We do not have direct strikes by Israel and the United States against Iran. We don't have Iranian use of ballistic missiles against the Gulf, against American forces in the Middle East and against the Israelis. That would be something that the Middle East has never experienced, and we want to avoid it. I suspect that won't be the first time I was wrong in terms of Middle East analysis, but I suspect that we will be able to remain below the escalatory threshold and for the simple reason for it is that the Islamic Republic of Iran does not want a major confrontation right now, either with the United States and with Israel. And certainly, the Biden administration with so many other balls to juggle, including Ukraine, maybe an ambitious new effort to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and to produce something for the Palestinians to negotiate a hostage for prisoner release, to calm down and eventually end the war in Gaza. There are a lot of other equities out there and I think the administration is right to try to, you know, try to navigate the fine line between risk aversion on one hand, and risk readiness on the other.

And that is in large part due to its sizable black population. So, South Carolina Democrats, about 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats are black voters. And when you speak to them, as we have all week, the reviews are really mixed. You have some people with deep economic anxieties, who have routinely supported Democrats. And they feel like their lives aren't materially getting any better. And so, they are sort of sick and tired. But then, you have others who are really excited about President Biden. They still give him a lot of credibility for being former President Barack Obama's vice president. And they say that they are enthusiastic to vote today. And, of course, will be voting in the general election. And then, lastly, Fred, you have more pragmatic voters. So, people who are really concerned about President Trump returning to the White House and say that they sort of view this as not being so concerned about the next four or eight years, but about the condition of the country in the long term. Another man that I spoke to, he voted for Trump in 2016. And 2020. Of it says that he believes that the former president won't follow the Constitution and is now supporting President Biden. So, no doubt those that is what Democrats like to hear. Even President Biden framing this contest himself this morning, as more than a campaign, he described it as a mission.

And if you look at the 2,000 -- sorry, I'm forgetting my math. But the 2016 general election with Hillary Clinton versus Trump, Hillary Clinton in Michigan, for example. She won the Detroit area, Wayne County where Detroit is located, she won that area by a wide margin, like all Democrats do.

So you know, in your view -- you know, you have visited the town several times since the derailment. How would you rate the situation there? ANDREW WHELTON, ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, PURDUE UNIVERSITY: Well, what you just saw is real experiences from real people. These individuals did, you know, experience these chemical exposures. Today, East Palestine is a lot different. A lot of progress has been made. But what really hasn't been addressed is the long-term health impacts associated with these exposures and there's simply too many unanswered questions.",

You'll remember thieves stole a Jackie Robinson statue from a youth league ballfield in Wichita, Kansas, by cutting it down at the ankles, leaving only the feet.This week, the destroyed statue was found, burned in a nearby Kansas park. And now, thanks to more than $190,000 in GoFundMe donations and contributions from all 30 MLB teams, the statue will be restored, crafted from the original mold. Here to discuss is Wichita City Councilman Brandon Johnson. Brandon, great to see you. Last week, you told me how the statue represented hope, and the theft of it still didn't rob you and the community of hope. What does this show, this show of generosity after the heart ache of it being stolen and destroyed? What's the message now sent? And how is that helping to heal so many who felt so wounded from this? BRANDON JOHNSON, (D), WICHITA, KANSAS, CITY COUNCILMAN: Thank you for having me. The generosity of the community both in Kansas and outside of Kansas has been amazing. The coverage has been amazing. We're so grateful for that. It's great to see that the money has been raised and the statue can be there and that hope was truly worth it. Folks really believe and now they see it can happen. We're excited to be able to have enough funds to get that statue back. We've been in talks with League 42 as well to see how we can secure it better than we have before.",
