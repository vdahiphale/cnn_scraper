And maybe he is feeling that on the inside, but the political thing to do for most normal politicians -- and this has happened throughout history -- in a time like this would be to be more apologetic, to have less bravado, to be more contrite. And because this is Donald Trump, who has made an entire lifetime, not just in politics, but in business before that, out of doing the opposite, out of leaning into his problems, we are seeing something very different. To say that that is not normal, never mind the whole notion of an indictment and an arrest of a former president isn't normal, is important context to keep in mind.",

They look at what is right in front of them, not what is coming around the corner. And in this case, this Manhattan district attorney case against Trump is really just the beginning of this story. And when we think about the historical impact of it all, I -- from my perspective, I think that we cannot divorce this from the big picture here, which is that Trump, yes, the first American president to be indicted,the first American president to actually face charges. But he would also be the first American president to face the prospect of many other charges as well. And that is really what the long-term issue is for the Trump campaign. And putting out merch might get them likes on Twitter, but it doesn't help them deal with that broader problem with the American people.",

And, I mean, think about -- gosh, think about this. President Trump is joining some of the most incredible people in history being arrested today. Nelson Mandela was arrested, served time in prison.

I will leave the common sense of the American people to deal with that one. I will keep my mouth shut on that one.But the idea Marjorie Taylor Greene says, let's protest in favor of Donald Trump in Manhattan outside this courthouse. She showed up. She stayed for 10 minutes and she left. She got the pictures she needs for her social media and to be on FOX and Newsmax and OAN, and then she left. Why would she stay there for the day with the real people who may be out there for whatever reason supporting Donald Trump? And they have every right to do so. But back to the earlier conversation here, look, Jason Miller, Boris Epshteyn -- Donald Trump, he is presumed innocent, and he deserves that from everybody here, everybody. That is the rule of law that he constantly ignores. But that is the bedrock of our society. But Jason Miller, Boris Epshteyn, this is a liar surrounded by liars. Sorry, but that's what we have seen. If you judge a man by the company he keeps, he is surrounded by liars. And they have repeatedly lied. You can't lie in court. You can't lie in court. He enters a new phase today, where the prosecutors -- has a very high bar. This prosecutor is indicting a former president of the United States. He better damn well prove it when they release that indictment today. But, in court, you can't lie. You can lie in politics. You can lie on cable television.

And he can go through today. It's the only thing he has to deal with. He's orchestrating and kind of stage-managing this whole event. That is going to become overwhelming when he may be facing indictment in federal court in D.C., maybe facing indictment in state court in Georgia. The legal team will keep growing. The demands on his time to review evidence, to prepare for testimony, to moderate his statements, which could be conflicting and cause him all sorts of problems in different venues, this is not a trifling matter, and it could very easily overtake him as the months and years go on.",

If we just take this one particular case, which we still need to see what the actual charges are, there's going to be a motions practice. He's going to make motions to dismiss the case, which I think will have some credible arguments in them, depending on how they actually charge the case and whether there's felonies and underlying crimes that are implicated in the actual case. He's going to make motions there. That motions practice can continue. And so all of these things are going to be running concurrently at the same time. And even though, as a practical matter, we think, oh, well, the other prosecutors are probably watching this case and paying attention, actually, I tend to think that each of these investigations is being conducted independently.

Nobody can get him to do that. But one thing also is about his connection to the litigious nature of what's going on here. He has -- during his time in business, particularly in New York, for decades, he has become incredibly familiar with the legal system, because he has tried to use it to his benefit, and he has been on the defendant's side of it.

It's just an incredible scene out here, Anderson. There are hundreds and hundreds of cameras just pointed at that door where they expect the former president to walk in, trying to get that shot of him walking into this building.
