The Battle of Normandy would continue for months, the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany. On this day, war is once again raging in Europe with Ukraine in a fight for its very survival now into the third year against Russia. And against that backdrop, world leaders are gathering in France to mark the anniversary of D-Day, with one notable exception. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited, but the German Chancellor was.U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to meet shortly with veterans and their families during a visit to the American Cemetery. French President Emmanuel Macron paid his respects earlier to civilians killed in bombardments during the war. He plans to host to state dinner for President Biden later this week. Veterans who fought in Normandy, many nearing 100-years-old, have been arriving in France over the past few days, receiving a hero's welcome at Charles de Gaulle Airport. Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla paid tribute to veterans at a ceremony in Portsmouth in England on Wednesday. King Charles praised the bravery of those who fought against tyranny.

It's not clear how many of these 10 people who are injured are civilians versus military. But, this is a significant attack carried out by Hezbollah, one that interestingly did not set off those sirens in northern Israel, which typically sound when Hezbollah fires rockets or drones. But, this is the latest in what has been really an uptick in terms of the size and scale of attacks, both from Hezbollah directed at northern Israel, but also in terms of Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon over the course of the last week or so.We've been witnessing this kind of slow simmering conflict for the last eight months, cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah. But, they have yet to unleash a full-blown war between the two sides. But, there is no question that now, especially in light of these wild fires that we've seen in northern Israel over the course of the last couple of days as a result of that rocket fire from Lebanon, that there is renewed attention on the security situation in northern Israel, renewed attention on the fact that more than 60,000 Israelis in north have been displaced from their homes as a result of this conflict. And now the question is, what can be done to restore that sense of security? The Israeli Prime Minister was in northern Israel, and he vowed that Israel is quote \"prepared for intense action in the north\", vowing that one way or another security will be restored in northern Israel. And what he is talking about there, obviously, is either diplomatic means or he's talking about military action. And it's clear that the clock is ticking. It's just not clear what exactly could potentially trigger that all-out war between the two sides. There is a sense, though, that if these ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations succeed, if Hamas agrees to this latest Israeli proposal on the table, you can see a weeks-long ceasefire in Gaza, one that in addition to providing a much needed respite in Gaza could also provide a diplomatic opening for some kind of resolution between Israel and Hezbollah.
