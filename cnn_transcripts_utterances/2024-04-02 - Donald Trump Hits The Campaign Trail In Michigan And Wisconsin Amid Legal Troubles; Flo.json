Wade has shaped and reshaped the political landscape. This week, the Florida Supreme Court handed down two rulings. One lets the state's law banning abortion at six weeks go into effect next month. The other will allow voters to weigh in directly on the issue this fall by voting on a constitutional amendment that would protect abortion access. Let's get you to Florida with CNN's Carlos Suarez. Carlos, what's in this ballot measure, for starters?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Brianna, so that ballot amendment could, and that's a big question, it could expand access to reproductive care come November. It's going to need more than a majority of the support. We're talking about 60 percent of voters would need to approve it. Right now, abortion providers tell me that their focus is on this six-week ban, which takes effect in 30 days. Planned Parenthood of South Florida told us that they are making more appointments available to women and that they're working with out of state providers once this ban kicks in. Florida is about to join several other states across the South that severely restrict, if not ban, abortions.About 84,000 women last year received reproductive services in Florida, with a number of women coming to Florida from states with some of these restrictions. Now, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Javier Becerra, he was in South Florida for an event on reproductive health care, and he talked about this ruling in the context of Dobbs, as well as IVF care in Alabama and medication abortion services. He said in part, quote, no women in America should live in medical apartheid. Now it has become clear that Roe V Wade was more than just about abortion. It should now be clear that Dobbs was more than just abortion. As for this ballot amendment, the Florida Supreme Court approved the wording of this constitutional ballot amendment that would protect the right to an abortion in Florida. Now this ballot again, would prohibit any type of restriction when it comes to abortion at the point before viability, which is around the 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. But again, Brianna, 60 percent of voters in Florida would have to sign off on this ballot amendment in order for it to approve- to be approved, rather. So you can expect that both of these rulings, no doubt, will play out politically. come November, considering that Democrats, they expect to campaign on this issue in hopes of putting Florida in play.",

But when it comes to this ballot amendment, some officials have said they are going to campaign against this. One of the top officials here, the state speaker of the House, said they plan to turn out an effort against this ballot amendment. So it puts Republicans in a bit of a tough spot going into November, considering some of the polling on this issue when it comes to support for some of these reproductive rights.",

I appreciate your focus. I do want to ask you about amendment. Okay. Okay. I want to ask you about amendment four. So the state Supreme Court made this decision allowing the ban to move forward, but they also approved the wording of this proposed constitutional amendment that will appear on November's ballot. And if voters approve it, it would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. You do need the support of at least 60% of voters in the Sunshine State for it to pass.

And that is a measure that passed easily with over 60%. In fact, it got more votes in favor of it than anybody else did on the ballot, more even than Ron DeSantis or any other candidate. So, you know, I think that we have to remember that Floridians know how to do this. Floridians value their freedom. And they will show up at the ballot this November to protect that.",

That question of viability, there are a lot of different ways that that could be interpreted. Polls show that that's where the core of the abortion debate is, right?

These are personal medical decisions. So freedom is an American value. It's true. But Floridians in particular value their freedom. We actually have a right to privacy that is enshrined in our constitution, our state constitution. Now we know what the Florida Supreme Court just did and kind of brushed that aside and I think put maybe their personal opinions ahead of actually what the law would command them to do.But Floridians value freedom. And so that's really the question for voters. Do we think that politicians should be looking over the shoulders of women while they are in the exam room? Or do we think that these immensely personal decisions should be left between women, their family and their doctors? And I think most Floridians would agree with me. It's the latter. We need to keep government out. We need to leave this to science, we need to leave this to women and we need to leave this to the professionals who are the doctors.",

The White House now thinks that having this on the ballot makes the Sunshine State winnable for them. Yet you did allude to Governor DeSantis in the last election in the midterms. He led the effort on these abortion restrictions and he won reelection by nearly 20 percentage points. That was about a year and a half ago. Do you agree with the White House that Florida is winnable for Democrats?",

We are a MAGA captured state, but we're not a red state. So there's something that's happened, though, since the 2022 election, which is that Florida is facing one of the worst affordability crises in the country. We have the highest property insurance rates in the country. And this is after the Republicans gave a $3 billion bailout to the insurance industry but provided no relief for homeowners.So people are mad and they're feeling it in a way that they weren't in 2022. Florida is simply becoming too expensive for many Floridians. So when you take that issue and couple it with the issue of abortion, which may have been intimated on the ballot in 2022, but it wasn't there expressly. Now we actually have a window. Now there's actually some daylight, I think, where we can, as Democrats and people really who care about this issue, you don't have to be a Democrat to care about this issue. I should be thoughtful as I talk about that. People who care about these personal freedoms can make their voices heard at the ballot. And I think that is what's going to make the difference in 2024.",

With us now is the co-founder of Gaza Medic Voices, Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan. She's also a paediatric intensive care doctor with Doctors Without Borders. And Tanya, just to put this into perspective, Al-Shifa had 750 beds. There were 26 operating rooms. They served 250,000 people annually, according to the hospital director. Can you tell us any specifics that you know about the condition of the hospital after the siege? And what this is going to mean to the people of Gaza?DR. TANYA HAJ-HASSAN, CO-FOUNDER, GAZA MEDIC VOICES: Yeah, thank you. And I don't know far beyond what I think everybody accessing media and social media know at this moment because communications are so difficult in the north because international journalists were long, essentially removed from the majority of the Gaza Strip as part of a strategy. And these are all atrocities that are being committed in the dark that local journalists have been targeted the same way health care workers have been targeted. So unfortunately, what is coming out of Al-Shifa hospital at the moment is apocalyptic. You know, photos and videos of an institution that I visited, that I loved, that was really a source of pride for Gazans. It was a very well-functioning, large quaternary hospital that provided  the majority of sub-specialty services for the Gaza Strip and the Gaza's largest trauma center as well. It's also over 70 years old, was built during the British mandate. And it translates, Al-Shifa means healing or to heal. So it's the house of healing. And it was exactly that. One of my colleagues described it as the beating heart of Gaza's health care system. And to see it now in ruins, burned, bombed, and that's just the infrastructure. The photos and footage and testimonies coming out of people cuffed and their hands and legs bound, people dismembered, rolled over by bulldozers, and all the atrocities committed in the hospital, including point blank executions of tens of people, if not more. I've seen numbers as high as 300 people in the hospital, it's apocalyptic. I keep trying to wake myself up from this nightmare because we have been screaming. And when I say we, it's myself, it's all the humanitarians that have been going in and out of the Gaza Strip, organizations speaking on behalf of their entire organization. Organizations with decades of experience in humanitarian medicine in war zone. We have all been shouting since week one, this is, this is beyond anything we've seen elsewhere.
