      "sentences": "That's right, John. Christopher Clark is Hunter's attorney, who he's been dealing with this case now for several years, and he just issued a statement that describes the outlines of what we've been talking about.What he says is the -- with the announcement agreements between my client, Hunter Biden, and the United States Attorney's Office for the district of Delaware, it is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter Biden is resolved. That is the key sentence right there. It is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter is resolved. Hunter will take responsibility for instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due -- due to a plea agreement. The firearm charge will be subject to a pretrial diversion agreement and will not be subject to the plea agreement but will also be filed by the government. Here is also what he says about Hunter. He says, I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward. Of course, again, the key operative parts of that statement are that at least in their discussions with prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office. Again, this is U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who was by appointed by Donald Trump, kept on in this job to oversee this investigation. This deal that resolves this investigation, according to Hunter Biden's attorneys, they believe this resolves everything. And, really, that is an important part of this plea agreement, because this investigation, as we have talked about spanning five years, three attorneys general have looked at a lot of issues, including Hunter Biden's dealings in Ukraine, his work with a Chinese energy company, things that Republicans are not ready to let go of. They believe that there is more investigation to be done. So, even Hunter Biden's attorneys believe that this investigation is over, at least a criminal investigation with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware, they may face a lot more questions from House Republicans who are not quite done with this yet.

There is one place that I feel will not share that sentiment. It may be among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Let's go there right now, our Manu Raju standing by. Manu, what are you hearing up there?

      "sentences": "Most certainly not. I mean, we have not heard any official reaction from the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, or any of the key chairmen of the House committees who have been investigating Hunter Biden and some of his overseas business dealings.But we are hearing some reaction from some members of the rank and file who have been quick to issue tweets criticizing this plea deal and criticizing the Justice Department. So, Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, called it a cover-up. This is a word from Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is a member of that far right House Freedom Caucus, someone who is a close ally of the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, said that it's simply made to -- called it a, quote, stunt and called the Justice Department pathetic. And then Congressman Bob Good, another member of that Freedom Caucus, the outspoken group on the right, also criticizing this as well. What you can expect from House Republicans in the weeks ahead is try to essentially investigate the investigators, try to figure out why this U.S. attorney did not pursue the number -- or did not file charges or -- and how he handled those questions about Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings that did not lead to any federal charges here. There is -- expect to be a lot of criticism, even though this is an attorney that is a holdover from the Trump administration. Still not -- the Republicans are indicating this is all part of their narrative, that Democrats somehow get a pass and Republicans do not. We'll see if the facts bear any of that out, but that is their political argument going forward. So, expect to hear the speaker of the House to repeat a lot of these arguments. Expect to hear some of the chairman of the key committees like the House Oversight Committee, the House Judiciary Committee also indicating the same. So, you're right, this plea deal reached, the Hunter Biden team said after a result of an exhaustive investigation leading to this plea deal not going to be much satisfaction here on Capitol Hill among House Republicans who have made this a central investigation looking into Hunter Biden as well as any ties to the president and expected that to be the focus in the weeks ahead.

      "speaker": "KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Yes. So, our understanding, according to sources, is that the U.S. Attorney's Office here has agreed as part of this plea agreement to recommend to the judge that Hunter Biden serve no prison time, that he be put on probation for a set period of time. One source saying that that is about 24 months, and we haven't seen those details yet.The court filings indicate that additional materials, including this plea agreement, will be filed before the court appearance whenever that is set. But that is what we've learned, that he will not face any jail time, any prison time as a result of pleading guilty to those two tax related misdemeanors. And it's already drawing a reaction from former President Trump, who is posting that this deal equates to, quote, a mere traffic ticket and something certainly as Manu was referencing, is something that the Republicans on the Hill are going to continue to focus on and as they continue to look at DOJ's handling of this investigation. But we are also waiting to see when the judge will set a date for Hunter Biden to appear for his arraignment, where he will enter that guilty plea and be told to allocate, to say what he did and what went wrong. And as the lawyer statement that Evan had read earlier indicates, they're positioning this as he's trying to take accountability for the crimes that he committed when he was an addict, which he has been very public about. So, this is part of that step in that process. But he will be coming to court soon to enter this guilty plea. And then on this gun possession charge, that is a diversion in which that will be a charge that is essentially dropped if he meets certain conditions for that same period of time. Kate?",

      "speaker": "ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST",
      "sentences": "Right. So, probation, first and foremost, means no prison, as long as you comply with all the conditions. There will be a specific set of conditions put on this probation. They can vary case to case, but, typically, first of all, no further crimes. If you do commit a crime while you're on probation, the penalty will be even higher.Typically, in a case like this, a condition will include drug treatment. Regular drug testing could be weekly, daily, monthly. Typically, you'll have to report into your pretrial officer or your probation officer every day, every week. It varies based on the individual. And I do think there's another important point to be made here about the timing and the sort of politics about this. I have said before, the fact that this took five years is outrageous and inexplicable dating back to 2018. But when we think about the nature of the charges here, let's remember, for at least two full years, 2018 through the end of 2020, this was being handled by Donald Trump's administration under A.G. Jeff Sessions and then Bill Barr. And if there was heavier charges to be brought, they had two years, probably two-plus years to do that. The other thing is, in trying to assess whether these charges are light or heavy, nobody really is in position to know that, except for very few people at DOJ and perhaps Hunter Biden's team, because we don't know what the universe of facts were that DOJ was dealing with. So, we know what we know, which is that this is a tax misdemeanor and a firearms charge, that could be diverted. But I think it's premature for anybody to be declaring win-loss, heavy-light, fair-unfair, traffic ticket, yes.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's important to emphasize that even though we were told by our sources, Kara and I both told that the Justice Department will recommend probation, it is ultimately up to the judge in this case to approve, accept that recommendation or go in a different direction. And I'm told there is at least some possibility that the judge could choose to do something slightly different.Now, it's also important to note that diversion here, which is how they're going to take care of the gun charge, that is something that's incredibly common at the state and local level to deal with DUIs, mental health issues, drug charges. It is, of course, less common at the federal level. So, it will be really interesting to see the requirements that Hunter Biden has in order to get that other gun charge dropped. Now, we know in terms of the timing here, I think that's also interesting. Elie was just talking about that in terms of the length of the investigation, how it has yielded arguably a few rather minor charges, right? These are not felonies, these are tax related charges, one related to lying on a form to purchase a gun. But this investigation has been going on for years. But this plea deal comes about ten days after former President Trump was indicted by Special Counsel Jack Smith. As we know, the Justice Department has been under considerable scrutiny for its handling of multiple politically-charged investigations, both the investigations into former President Trump, the special counsel investigation to President Biden and also this longstanding investigation into Hunter Biden. They're all being handled by independent people, the two special counsels and then this case, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney. But it does appear that the timing here, right, so close to the Trump indictment, may not be coincidental. We don't know all the facts behind the scenes, but we've seen in our reporting over the past few weeks, there have definitely been ramped up efforts to draw this particular case to a conclusion. So, it will be interesting to see if the attorney general or anyone else is willing to weigh in on this and in any way suggest that, look, we apply the law regardless of political. Look, Trump, Hunter Biden, they've all been charged with different crime, one pleading guilty, different cases, obviously with very different scope. But I don't think it's a coincidence that the Hunter Biden case is being resolved so close to the indictment of former President Trump.",

And one thing that I think is going to be interesting is will DOJ say anything about this case beyond the sort of standard boilerplate? I doubt it could be coincidence, but it also could be that they're trying to make a statement here, that we treat every case straight down the middle. Whether that's true or not, I will leave up to the political pundits.",

It's why, despite the apparent resolution of the legal federal investigation, as you've been hearing from Manu, House Republicans are going to keep this up. They've decided to go all in on this as a way to keep the Republican base enthusiastic.This feeds into that whole larger narrative, John, about the Justice Department in this country and whether or not it is doing its job equally for everyone, whether or not the system is rigged. Donald Trump, in his response to this, has already used this as an example that, indeed, the system is broken. So, this whole thing feeds into that. Now, the reality is Hunter Biden, if indeed his lawyer is right, and this resolves all the matters, you've heard about Hunter Biden related to his laptop or looking into his father having influence on him or the Ukraine energy company, Burisma, or China, all of that seems to be aside here. He looks like the deal is going to avoid prison time and that it's pretty small bore here in terms of what he's pleading, too. The legal resolves this in some way for the Biden family.

I agree with David that this just heightens and accentuates what Republicans believe that they can do on the raw politics of this, because this is not happening in a vacuum. This is happening up against what we saw last week with the former president. They could not be more different for reasons that we don't have, even with the 24 hours news network to explain. But they are very, very different.What is the same is that the Republican response, the Republican -- those who feel the need to or the desire to defend Donald Trump are making the same arguments that they are making against Hunter Biden, which is allegations that the DOJ is that there are two tiers of justice and that one is for Democrats, the other is Republicans. We can't say this enough. There is no evidence to prove that at all, that we need to also point out that the U.S. attorney in Delaware is a Trump-appointee intentionally kept by Joe Biden to try to take away the appearance of any political influence by the Biden White House. But that doesn't stop the politics of this, particularly when you are talking about a conservative media ecosystem through which many of these Republicans on Capitol Hill, who Manu was talking about and getting statements from, are going right out into that ecosystem.
