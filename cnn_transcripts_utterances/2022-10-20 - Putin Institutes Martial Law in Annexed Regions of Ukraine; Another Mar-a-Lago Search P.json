      "sentences": "Hello. Great to have you with us. I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.And we're following several major stories unfolding this hour. President Biden is campaigning in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where a critical Senate race is getting tighter and tighter. The president hopes to boost Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman first at a fund-raiser, and then, minutes from now, talking infrastructure next to a bridge that collapsed earlier this year. Meantime, a political shakeup with America's closest ally, British Prime Minister Liz Truss announcing her resignation after just 44 days in office. She will now become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, and triggering a power struggle in a country wrestling with a deeply troubled economy. And will there be another Mar-a-Lago search? Sources tell CNN former President Trump may go along with a supervised search of his Florida property. The FBI already seized 22,000 pages of documents during its August search. But the Justice Department has made clear that more government records remain missing. We will get to those details in a moment. Let's begin with CNN's Phil Mattingly at the White House and what President Biden is up to in these final two-plus weeks before the midterms. Phil, what can we expect in Pennsylvania today?",

      "sentences": "The president to talk about infrastructure.And that might seem a little bit odd just less than three weeks out from a midterm election where you're trying to energize voters. I'm not taking anything away from those who love infrastructure, but it really underscores how the president and his team are trying to thread the needle in -- at this moment for the most endangered candidates or for their front-line candidates, and also some of the restrictions they're facing, given the president's own popularity in this country. What the president will be doing, as you noted, he will be speaking in front of a bridge that actually collapsed when he was on his way to Pennsylvania in January of this year. That bridge is now on pace to be rebuilt and up and running by the end of this year, in part because of what the infrastructure law the president signed gave space for Pennsylvania local officials to be able to move money and speed that process up. At that event, he will be joined, as you noted, by Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, among many others, who is the Democratic Senate candidate. It's an official event. It's not a campaign rally. There's not going to be thousands of people and blaring music necessarily. John Fetterman is even in a suit, at least what we saw when he greeted the president on his arrival. And this underscores what the White House has been trying to do here. Have small official events, where you kind of lay out what the president has delivered on, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's on several other major legislative achievements, have a critical campaign -- Democrat campaigning with the president and then, later, raise money. And I think it's that latter part that you noted he will be doing in Philadelphia. Fetterman will ride on Air Force One with the president to Philadelphia, and those fund-raisers have been critical. The president has raised tens of millions of dollars for Democratic candidates. While his approval may not be soaring, the campaign rallies may not be numerous, he's certainly showing up. And he says he's going to do it more. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The problem now is, there's a lot of trust that's lost between him and the government. There's a lot of dragging of heels, a false statement that was made by his attorneys, suspicion, as you mentioned a moment ago, that other documents are still out there. So I really have trouble believing that that -- that this step alone would satisfy the Justice Department.

Eastman keeps trying to keep certain e-mails private, claiming attorney-client privilege. But, here, the judge is saying that doesn't apply when there's a crime involved.

He knew they were false.

So I think it's possible. I think that a lot more would happen on the January 6 front.

I think the Trump team has to be very, very concerned that a criminal investigation on some of the same facts that the January 6 Committee looked into is afoot.

      "sentences": "I'm sure that is the question that the prime minister will be asking herself tonight. How did it all unravel so quickly?One of the issues that she faced from the outset, Ana, is the fact that she barely had a mandate. This was not a prime minister who entered Downing Street victorious after a general election. She was ushered in by a tiny fraction of the electorate, just the Conservative Party members, who are not representative. Then she went further and faster than she promised she would on economic policies in the leadership campaign, which led to public fury. They felt the prime minister was being unfair and unjust when she suggested she would cut the top rate of tax for the richest in this country, and also remove the cap for bankers' bonuses, while Britain is grappling with a cost of living crisis, people are struggling to pay their heating bills and their grocery bills. So this all combined to make it a very difficult situation for a prime minister who hasn't shown that she's got an ability to communicate clearly, to garner the loyalty and support of those around her, and to set out a clear path. So then, when her own lawmakers started speaking out against her in increasing rapidity, adding to that, she had the resignation of the home secretary, who took the opportunity to criticize the prime minister as she left, it made her fragile platform and position ever weaker. Then, today, important figures within the party went to the prime minister at 10 Downing Street and we understand made the case to her that simply her position is no longer tenable. But this is an abject humiliation for Truss and also doesn't keep Britain in a particularly good light. And a good example of that and something which has come to symbolize it is this meme that's doing the rounds on the Internet of a lettuce. It's a livestream of a lettuce from Tesco, one of the supermarkets in this country, which was inspired by a remark in \"The Economist\" that Liz Truss' premiership probably has the shelf life of a lettuce, or thereabouts. Now, this lettuce was decaying on a webcam, people asking whether or not it would survive longer than Liz Truss' premiership. And today, as we know, Ana, the lettuce won out...",

And you saw Medvedev taunting Liz Truss. She had been, as her predecessor, Boris Johnson, had been, a very staunch partner and advocate for aid to Ukraine. And Britain had been working very closely with the United States on that. I don't think there's any sense that that policy is going to change right now. But, of course, the internal economic crisis generated by, in part, Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the spike in global energy prices, that's one big reason for the economic and political chaos inside the U.K. right now. It's certainly a warning sign for President Biden and other Western leaders who are facing similar, if not quite as high levels of inflation and skyrocketing energy prices.",

Some of the kind of very pro-Johnson faction within the Tory Party are already going public with that. You see this happening in other countries around the world, where you have, in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu trying to make a comeback. We may have Donald Trump trying to make a comeback here in the United States within weeks after the midterm elections. And so I think it's a moment really of gridlock and instability across the West, broadly speaking, and certainly Britain put itself on this very difficult trajectory.
