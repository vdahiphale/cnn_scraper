But it could've been worse here. And there were some concerns last month that inflation was heating up. But it appears at least, this latest reading, that it is peaking and a big share of that inflation is shelter inflation; gas prices are down year over year and food prices are cooling. So essentially I think decade the bottom line is that it gives the Feds some space to be a little more cautious about raising interest rates when it next meets on March 22nd. And cautious why? Because we have a banking sector that has shown signs of weakness, of strain. Three banks over the past week have folded and two of them were crypto focus lenders, one of them was the big Silicon Valley Bank that really was the oxygen for start-ups and venture capital. The U.S. government coming with a historic rescue of depositors, allowing two of those banks to fail, getting rid of the management and the shareholders will get nothing. But the depositors made whole to keep the economy, that part of the economy, still moving. So a really remarkable set of events.

This morning there was a loud thud in this part of the country, an explosion, a blast is what the Ukrainian police are now calling a Russian Kh-58 cruise missile that slammed into the eastern city of Kramatorsk, a city that has been the target of repeated long-range Russian missiles and rockets. And in this case it slammed into the side of a three or four story apartment building, killing at least one person and wounding at least three more. The damage there, it shattered gas in the neighboring apartment blocks, in the courtyard there; shattered glass in a kindergarten, number 49, which was also in the same kind of square. Fortunately there were no children there, Becky, because the school director told me that children have not been going to that kindergarten for some six months, they've all been evacuated. I think part of what was so striking, witnessing how locals were dealing with the destruction in the aftermath was very stoically. There were no tears, there were no complaints. These were people whose apartments were potentially destroyed. Senior citizens were sweeping up shattered glass, sweeping up debris, perhaps taking away belongings if that home was no longer livable at this point and simply getting on with, it recognizing that this is one of the realities of life in this part of Eastern Ukraine.

It presumably will be a target again.
