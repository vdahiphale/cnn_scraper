They did call these strikes, \"precise strikes\" on military targets in Iran and Israeli officials tonight are taking pains to emphasize that there were no energy targets neither nuclear nor oil targets that were hit in these Israeli strikes tonight.We don't have a ton of more detail about exactly what the nature of these targets are. But Iranian state media is indeed reporting that there were explosions in the Iranian capital of Tehran. The Israeli military says that it has every right and duty to respond to what it describes as continuous Iranian attacks by itself, as well as its proxies. Of course, this is primarily retaliation for that barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles that Iran fired at the beginning of this month and over the course of the last three-and-a-half weeks, there has been mounting anticipation about exactly how Israel will respond as they initially did consider striking those nuclear and oil targets, but appeared to have been talked off of that ledge by the United States, which very much wanted to see a much more limited response. The question now, of course becomes, how Iran will respond and how quickly they will do so.",

And there has been very close cooperation between Israel and the united states in the lead up to this strike, not only with those consultations, of course, between us and Israeli officials. President Biden getting on the phone with the Israeli prime minister directly in recent weeks. But also, of course, it's important to note that the United States at the beginning of last week deployed the THAAD air defense system to Israel, presumably in anticipation of potential Iranian retaliation for the strike that we are indeed seeing tonight and to try and deter a future Iranian response. We had heard reports before that Iran might, might respond very quickly to an Israeli strike. But it is not clear yet how quickly that will actually happen. And of course the question is, will Iran now look to de-escalate or will we look at another escalatory cycle of retaliation that could of course plunge Iran and Israel more directly into an all-out war.",

Her most recent and most reckless in vocations of the darkest evil of the 20th century seemed to dare it to boil over. The vice president's words more closely resemble those of President Trump's second would-be assassin than her own earlier appeal to civility.\" Now, they are referring to the fact that Harris called the former president of fascist during our CNN townhall with her when she only did after two top generals who once served the former president said the very same thing. The former president's former chief-of-staff, John Kelly, told \"The New York Times\" this week, \"He certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.\" And the former president's Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley told Bob Woodward that Trump is \" fascist to the core.\" What McConnell and Johnson did not mention though, they are certainly aware of it, is that for quite a while Mr. Trump has been using the term fascist against Harris and a lot of others he doesn't like.

She doesn't think she's going to win the state, but if we win and pick up that Senate seat, which was a long stretch, but now I think the race is almost tied could really bode well for Democrats. But also she's going to Texas. She has Beyonce, this is how campaigns work. The ripple effect that her appearance in Texas will have will go into battleground states, will go into states that also governor's races and Senate races and House races. So, she's going to be in Texas, in an area where traditionally Democrats don't do extremely well. But her message will go across the country and she said it herself. Texas is ground zero for the abortion law. People have lost their lives. They want to prosecute doctors. They want to prosecute citizens who just help women have bodily autonomy. So taking the fight to where it really started is super important. And I think it will go and make be a national message that can have ripple effect. Plus, she has the Queen Bey.

They're calling it an exercise of self-defense in response to those Iranian strikes, the 180 ballistic missiles back on October 1st. For the past three weeks, Anderson, there has been a huge amount of worry in this town about how Israel would retaliate any considerable amount of pressure from Washington on Israel to do it in a rather limited and calibrated way so that this doesn't further escalate. We know what that has meant, it is a specific pressure from the president on the record saying that he wished that Iran would not go after nuclear or oil targets, and it does appear that right now, Israel, at least for now, is going after these military targets. So were trying to figure out what those are. They could be barracks, they could be training facilities, they could be command and control centers. Anything that has to do with Iran's missile system. But does it stop there? You could also see a scenario in which Israel would use cyber capabilities or special forces capabilities as well.   I think, Anderson, one thing that we need to take into consideration is, \"Is this the kind of strike that Iran is going to absorb and say, okay, essentially, now were even.\" Or, are they going to feel really threatened by what Israel is doing tonight? And respond perhaps very quickly. That is a major fear, but, Anderson, this does feel like we're kind of at the beginning of this retaliatory response, unclear how long it may last.",

Christiane, I mean, the last time there were retaliatory strikes against Iran by Israel. Their words largely symbolic sort of message sending. They were also in response to the Iranian attack on Israel. What do you make of what we have seen thus far or heard thus far from Israel's military?   CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, to put it all in perspective and context, it appears that the last time it was sort of a standoff missile attack that hit perhaps a radar station somewhere around Esfahan. This appears to be actual aircraft according to the IDF and according to the United States, actually, in some way, dropping bombs or missiles on Iran directly from their own planes. And so, this would be a very first to put this into context -- very first time that this kind of engagement has actually happened. Iran has been preparing for this ever since its 200 missiles, ballistic missile barrage against Israel back in early October. And the question has always been from the Iranian perspective, if you look at the reporting, if you hear what the Iranian officials have been saying is, how big will it be and what are our options? Should we respond at all if it's more symbolic or more something we can absorb and we expect as a retaliation from Israel or is it something much bigger, much wider, targeted at the regime, targeted as you've been discussing, the crucial oil infrastructure, or indeed the nuclear infrastructure. And then what would they be potentially they think themselves forced to respond to? So I do think it's going to be important to see the scale of what Israel is doing. And then to see whether Iran decides that it has to respond. Potentially in any event, it might respond according to sources, somewhat, but in a way that all sides understand that this is happening. This has happened, it's been in response to all these kinetic activities over the last several months and now, they need to draw a hold under it. The bottom line, is that all of this now is about deterrence. All of it, whether it was Israel striking Syria first and then that killed Iranian officials. Remember that building in Damascus, that was in April then Iran responded. And then again, Israel killing Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas inside Iran. It is not admitted that but everybody believes that that is what Israel did or rather Israel did do that. Iran then sending more missiles back included killing of its ally and proxy Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah. So, all of this is just so much strike, counterstrike, an attempt to establish deterrence and attempt to potentially certainly from Iran's perspective, they don't want to see it spin out of control. The bottom line is Israel is the dominant military force in the region and Iran, while its the dominant, let's say, regional force, it has got not at all the wherewithal to challenge Israel. And it sees, Iran, its allies have been decimated in that region, whether it's Hamas or whether it's Hezbollah, et cetera. And from reporting outside of Iran, it doesn't look including from officials like it wants to get into a massive much bigger war with Israel.",

I mean, I haven't seen a map and I haven't seen the trajectory, but it meant that they would potentially have to fly over several Arab nations, whatever the countries are that stand between Israel and Iran. It would have to get permission. And Iran has been on a, you know, a diplomatic offensive over the last several weeks, trying to make sure that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf countries, in their words, state neutral. It was saying that, you know, anybody who appeared to be not just taking part, but allowing this strike would be considered a legitimate target.",
