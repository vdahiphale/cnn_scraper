And we begin this hour, 100 days from Election 2024, and a presidential race that has been completely altered in the last week. In the seven days since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, she has moved at lightning speed to unite and energize the Democratic Party. Today, the Harris campaign announced that she has already raised a staggering $200 million and signed up 170,000 new volunteers in the past week. She has also made gains with voters as several polls show her tightening the race with Trump. Both candidates have spent the weekend on the campaign trail. Donald Trump trying out new lines of attack and trying to define his rival. Harris, highlighting her record and calling out her opponent's, quote, \"wild lies\". We've got team coverage of the presidential race. Let's begin with CNN's Julia Benbrook at the White House. Julia, good to see you today. So what can you tell us about the Harris campaign strategy for these final 100 days?",

And of that 66 percent of those donations came from first-time donors. They also are highlighting organizing efforts, 170,000 new volunteers. And they said that they've had over 2,000 events in battleground states just this weekend. There's also a lot of talk about her trying to meet different generations and appeal to groups like Gen Z. She recently joined TikTok and has gained millions of followers on that. She's gained a lot of followers on that. Now this is all happening as former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris try to decide how to speak about each other on the campaign trail. And during recent events Trump has called Harris \"evil\". He's made fun of her laugh and he's also gone as far as to say that the American dream is dead if Harris wins the election in November. She has then turned around and responded to those comments at a rally on Saturday. She called them \"wild lies\" and then went on to say that their quote, \"plain weird\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He went after her and said she was more radically liberal than President Joe Biden. He argued that she is way worse than he is. And he also tried to focus a lot of his attacks on her positions when it comes to immigration, crime, inflation -- all areas where I know that the Trump campaign is urging Donald Trump to focus on because those are the types of policies they believe he polls better on than Democrats. Now, another very notable moment during that rally last night was he actually noted that some people have argued to him perhaps they thought he would be nicer in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on his life earlier this month. He said actually, I might be worse, and joking there. But then he continued to lob more criticisms at Harris. Take a listen to what he said.

They've spent millions of dollars on modeling data, advertising, all to go after Joe Biden.

Israel is warning Hezbollah will pay the price for the attack. Israeli war planes have already struck the Iran-backed group deep inside Lebanon. The incident is fueling fears of an all-out war on Israel's northern border. It all comes as CIA director Bill Burns is in Rome for a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks. We've got full coverage for you. Jeremy Diamond is in the Golan Heights, Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon, and Barbie Nadeau is in Rome. Jeremy, Let's go to you first.

At this hour, as all of this is happening, the Israeli prime minister is currently sitting down with his security cabinet to discuss what Israel's response will be. And while it is not yet clear exactly how Israel will respond, multiple Israeli officials from the prime minister on down have made very clear that there will be a forceful response to this attack which they have described as the deadliest attack on civilians in Israel or in Israeli-controlled territory like the Golan Heights since October 7th. And therefore, there will be a response. The question is how forceful will that response be? And to what extent will that escalate this long-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah? There have been fears for months now that an incident like this one -- one in which many civilians were killed, perhaps even many children, as sadly happened in this incident, could perhaps trigger that escalation that could lead to all-out war. So right now, this is a community that is not only waiting to see how the Israeli government will respond to this attack, but it's also one, of course, that is very much still in mourning, very much devastated by this attack that left 12 children ripped from this world, Fred.",

Now, Hezbollah today has claimed only two strikes on Israeli targets. According to the Lebanese National News Agency, there were six separate Israeli strikes or bombardments within Lebanese territory. So not necessarily outside of the normal range of action that happens normally on a daily basis along the border between the two countries. Now, because of the rising tensions, Middle East Airlines, the Lebanese national carrier, has delayed several flights that were supposed to fly into Beirut this evening until tomorrow morning. And the United States embassy, which is north of Beirut, has strongly urged Americans to reconsider any travel plans to Beirut. Now, I flew into Beirut today and I can tell you that the airport was crammed with people not leaving, but rather arriving many of them American passport holders.

And what I'm being told is at that the center of the fire is still very aggressive. It's still in very steep terrain and it's very difficult for these firefighters to get to those areas. So you add the high temperatures, the wind, the lower humidity, and that's why this fire exploded over the last couple of days. Finally today, just some progress from those firefighters. Now, in the area where I am now, we believe the fire came down this hill and made its way into some of the communities, some of the area where I am right now. And I'm going to show you because there is an update on the number of structures destroyed. We were told by CalFire that the number went down to 66 structures. And what they say is they now have more people to be on the ground. They are assessment teams that are going house by house to check and to see exactly what this fire did. The number of resources has dramatically increase. They now have almost 4,000 people on the ground that more than essentially doubled over the last couple of days. And so that also has helped directly address the flames. And what I was told to what is that they were able to have a more direct impact on those flames. What I was also told today is that the county, Butte County is a priority for firefighters because they lived through that 2018 fire, the deadliest fire in California history. And so anecdotally, from just talking to people, what I've also heard is that people appear to have taken those warnings seriously in terms of evacuations and in terms of packing up and being ready to go.

And that's not the only fire. I mean, you take a look at this map. We have over 90 active wildfires in nearly a dozen western states. So there's a lot of them going on. But yes, the focus really becomes around the Park Fire simply because of how quickly it spread. We know that it has burned over 350,000 acres so far just since late Wednesday. To put that in perspective, that's burning about 50 to 60 football fields on average, every single minute since it started. One of the concerns today, these pink areas here where you still have some of those lower humidity levels and some gusty winds up around 30 to 35 miles per hour. That can take any existing fires and spread those embers very, very quickly. It's not just spreading fires, it's also spreading the smoke. So you have all of these air quality alerts out here. This is a concern for any folks that have maybe respiratory problems or illnesses. This smoke is expected to be incredibly thick, especially not just today, but through Monday as well.

This is why she needs to be ruthlessly pragmatic and select somebody like Josh Shapiro who can help her win Pennsylvania.

So neighbors in a Washington state community got quite the surprise from the sky, a hot air balloon made an unexpected landing near homes on a lake community just outside of Tacoma. Eight people were on board, some celebrating their 21st birthdays.Well, during the trip, strong winds blew them off course, forcing the balloons pilot to land in what he deemed a safe area. Wow, take a look at that. That's crazy. At one point, the balloon was hovering just ten feet above the homes neighbors help guide the balloon from the ground to an open street there so that thankfully they could land very safely and no one was hurt. But what a picture. All right. Superstar Simone Biles is once again proving why she is considered one of the greatest gymnast of all time, fighting through an apparent leg injury during today's Olympic competitions in Paris, and still managing to earn a top score. Should anybody be surprised? So the U.S. women's gymnastics team is the most racially diverse in the team's history as well. CNN's Coy Wire is joining us now from Paris. I mean, she's phenomenal and so is that entire team. COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, the Simone Biles comeback tour underway. That arena was packed, Fred. You had Tom Cruise, John legend, Ariana Grande there. But during warm-ups, Simone injures herself. She's limping. The arena goes quiet but the GOAT rises up. Tapes her ankle, rallies, and dominates. Her coach told us it's a lingering calf injury, but Biles put on this gutsy, iconic performance. And as you mentioned the diversity of this team. She says that she's been inspired by those who it came before. There weren't many gymnast that looked like her growing up. Now, she is inspiring the next generation. Four of the five team USA gymnast are women of color. It's their most diverse team in history. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SIMONE BILES, U.S. WOMEN'S GYMNAST SUPERSTAR:  I know what it's like being the only Black girl on the team and not having a role model.
