It's what she said she was asking herself amid the chaos at the Nova Music Festival in Israel on October 7th. And she was a lucky one. She was able to hide from Hamas terrorists as they raped and slaughtered scores of people, people attending the festival to listen to music and to promote peace.More than 200 civilians were taken hostage that day, including women brought into Gaza and sexually assaulted. Today, Vice President Harris is holding a White House event highlighting how Hamas uses sexual violence as a weapon of war. There will be a screening of \"Screams Before Silence,\" a documentary produced by Sheryl Sandberg, that includes first-hand accounts from former hostages like Amit Soussana. I must warn you that Amit's story is disturbing, but important to hear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that Sheryl Sandberg documented those horrific stories so that the world could bear witness, ice out denialism, and yet denialism still exists. How do you combat that? REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): Well, Dana, thanks for shining a spotlight on this. The primary way that we combat it is by doing exactly what you and I are doing here, and that's making sure that we can shine a bright spotlight on the sexual and gender-based violence that Hamas perpetrated on its victims on October 7th. And that very likely, we know, are continuing to perpetrate that sexual violence. And Sheryl Sandberg's film is searing but I'm really proud of the vice president and the second gentleman for using the White House's platform to make sure that the world knows that Hamas used sexual violence and continues to use it as a weapon of war is violating women, Israeli women. And I hosted a forum with the second gentleman on Capitol Hill a few months ago, and the Israeli police came and showed us videos that were taken by Hamas terrorists themselves, engaging in the kind of sexual violence that Sheryl's film shows, cutting off the breasts while raping their victims. And firsthand accounts from first responders as well as others and Israelis who were hiding from Hamas terrorists.",

He also cited data showing almost half of kids say that using social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. And so, putting a warning label like this on social media would require an act of Congress, but he's not only calling for legislators to stop there with that warning. He also wants to see increased regulation of these companies, including by trying to stop harassment of kids on these platforms to prevent the platforms from collecting sensitive data from children, restrict the use of features like autoplay and require sharing data on health effects with the public if the companies collect these so that they can be independently audited by scientists, Dana.",
