      "sentences": "Yes, Sarah. Despite the fact that Donald Trump has clashed with unions in the past, despite the fact that union leaders have slammed his administration for being largely much more pro-business, anti-union or at least anti-labor, he believes that there are voters that he can woo away, and that it's working class voters, union members, from Joe Biden, even though Joe Biden has made supporting unions an economic cornerstone of his policies.Now, the reason for that is threefold. One, they talk about 2016 when they were able to get a record number of these working class voters, union members to vote for Donald Trump. They want to go back to that. They want to make those same pitches. They also point to the fact that they believe that there are cracks in the system right now. Yes, UAW did endorse Biden back in 2020, but they haven't endorsed yet, as Arlette just mentioned. So, they believe that because of that, there are some cracks there. They also point to the fact that they believe that they can drive a wedge between leadership in these unions and the rank and file members. And that is why they're going to be slamming certain policies of Joe Biden's because there is a belief there that these electric vehicles, this call to have an electric fleet of American cars, is something that auto workers don't want and will cost them jobs. And that's what they are really going to focus on. I'm also told that they're going to focus on the economy, talking about inflation, talking about Trump's record when it comes to the economy and interest rates as well. Now, whether or not this is going to play out, whether or not he's able to get the same numbers as 2016, that just still remains to be seen. Because the difference between now and 2016 is Trump has his own record in his own administration. But that is what he's going to portray. He is going to say that he is pro-worker and pro-job and then try to contrast himself with President Biden saying that he is not and that those policies will actually take away those jobs.",

And that's going to be the question. And then, ultimately, as Manu just pointed out, the speaker is going to have to decide, does he want to side with the folks who, as he said, want to burn the place down or with common sense, reasonable bipartisan solutions. We put forward the Problem Solvers Caucus, with the 64 members, half Democrat and half Republican, a very reasonable bipartisan proposal last week.

But just make sure before the government shuts down that we pass a continuing resolution, whether it's the Senate's, whether it's the bipartisan proposal, the Problem Solvers Caucus has put forward, whatever it is, the key is avoiding a government shutdown and the impact that would have, huge impact, as we've seen it would have on our economy, military and families.",

It helps -- it makes everyone like China, the government of China, very happy to see that we're a mess. Moody's said that they will down, you know, potentially downgrade us.So, it has a huge impact on the economy, and potentially if Donald Trump gets his way. So, that is not the answer, shutting the government down. What we need to do is sit at the table, as we have, and actually solve the problem for the country.

But we're going to have to address it in 45 days. But it will avoid a shutdown, which we know will cost our country a fortune, right?So, I think if that's what we get, then we should put it up. If that's not the answer, we could put the problem solvers over solution up. But the ultimate goal has to be to stop a government shutdown and stop the folks who, as Kevin McCarthy said, want to burn the place down. And that is not who we should be listening to, the ultra right wing, who just wants to literally stop everything and stop progress.
