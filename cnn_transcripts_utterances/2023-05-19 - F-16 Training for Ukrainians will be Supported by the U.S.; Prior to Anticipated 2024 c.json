I mean, what's he going to say, I'm one of a thousand candidates who might run the Republican primary and we all have an equal shot, then no.You know, as a story I wrote said, he looks at Iowa as a make-or-break state out of necessity. Donald Trump is so far ahead in the primary, so far ahead in the polling that it would be catastrophic in DeSantis' own view, in the view of his team, in the Trump's teams, in the view of all other campaigns and consultants who know what they're talking about to lose Iowa, because what happens then? Well, if Trump wins Iowa where he's always already well ahead, the next state is New Hampshire. And if Trump wins that, where he's already well ahead, what's to stop him from losing in Nevada and then South Carolina and having a cascade. So, for DeSantis -- and really all the other candidates in the primary, Iowa is the place where they need to stop Trump instantly. That's how they feel, this is not my opinion, that just the facts as they see them and that's what the polling is currently showing. So, for DeSantis, he's got to make this pitch, hey, I'm the most electable. But there's a problem with that pitch with a lot of Republican voters. When you talk to a lot of them, especially conservative ones who are part of the base that DeSantis is going for, they think, hey, that establishment has always told us who to vote for. They've always used the electability argument. They told us to get behind John McCain, and he lost. And they told us to get behind Mitt Romney, and he lost. Now, this is their view. And they told us not to get behind Donald Trump, and he won. So, in the minds of Republicans, this isn't really a very persuasive argument. CNN's own polling last month showed that what Republicans are looking for is someone who shares their values and understands them. Not relatively speaking, someone who is considered the most electable. There's a reason for that deep suspicious.",

Like, is he running to the right, the most strategy and the like? If you do look at the research and you talk to voters, they do see Ron DeSantis, and understandably so, is very conservative. Yes, on abortion, on guns, on LGBTQ rights, on these various issues, some would call them culture war issues. DeSantis has a sterling record in the view of very conservative voters and the view of progressive voters is pretty horrible. So, he is making that part of his pitch.But as a Republican primary, you don't get elected to the Republican primary by being a moderate, at least not right now and certainly don't by being a progressive. If you want to win in a Republican primary, you have to be, in their terms, pro-choice, in their terms, pro-guns. And the way they see it, what they call pro-family, and as other people would say, anti-LGBTQ rights. So, that is where the base of the party is currently, and we'll see how that plays out over the next few months.",
