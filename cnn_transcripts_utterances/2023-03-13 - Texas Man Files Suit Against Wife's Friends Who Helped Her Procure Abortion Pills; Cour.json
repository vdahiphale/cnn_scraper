And basically, this comes down to who is civilly liable for an abortion.So, here is how the law is set up. It's set up in such a way that people are liable if they perform or induce an abortion in violation of SB8. Knowingly engage in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion. Intends to engage in the conduct described by SB8. And interestingly the mother here is not named in the lawsuit because she's actually excluded by the TEXAS Senate Bill 8. But the penalty here is pretty significant, it is damages not less than $10,000, in this case, Marcus Silva, is seeking $1 million in damages, Jim and Erica. A very much case to watch.",

Here's the thing, the call was not publicly noted on the case's docket nor did the judge issue a publicly order announcing Wednesday's hearing. \"The Post\" says, the judge the lawyers on that call, he wanted to limit disruptions and potential protest at the proceeding and asked them not to publicize it.

Look, Erica, there might have been a reason for any defendant, not just Trump to go in and talk to a grand jury prior to charges coming out.

You have to prove that the defendant intended to commit the crime.Well, someone who might be charged with a crime could go to the grand jury and say, look, I acknowledged that I committed these acts but these are the reason why. This was my intent at the time. And maybe he could get himself out of getting charge. Now, going in there would have been fraught with peril for the former president because he couldn't control what he was being asked. And he would have -- he could have been prosecuted on anything he said in there. So, you know, it's probably a wise decision to not go in, but at the end of the day, it doesn't change anything.

Police though say that it's necessary for them to help with their training here in the City of Atlanta and beyond.This tension between the activists and law enforcement here in the city has really grown beyond what has been dubbed Cop City.

During this press conference, the family of Teran also -- they said that they were frustrated with the charges of those who were arrested last week during confrontation with the police. 23 individuals charged with domestic terrorism, only one of them has been released on bond. That individual was a staff attorney for the SPLC who was on sight acting as a legal observer. Other 22 individuals though are still in custody being charged with domestic terrorism. The family of Teran going on to say that these are trumped up charges and that there is nothing to indicate that those who are currently held in custody committed any acts of violence against police.
