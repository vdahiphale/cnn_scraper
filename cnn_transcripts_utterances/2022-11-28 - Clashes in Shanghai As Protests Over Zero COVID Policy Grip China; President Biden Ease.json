But it's even more extraordinary to hear demands from some of the protesters really starting on Saturday night in Shanghai.Because up to that point, even the most vehement opponents of the zero COVID policy have been dancing around the issue of who is to blame for this growing fiasco with most still pointing a finger at local enforcement, but those protesters in Shanghai really directly targeting the ruling communist party and its top leader Xi Jinping, basically saying, the system is the problem here. And that obviously something not tolerated in this country, which may explain why they received some of the harshest treatment in the hands of police authorities, because among the biggest fears of the government, of course, is this kind of message inspiring others across the country. But that's exactly what we have seen since with protesters in other cities, including here in Beijing, not only shouting slogans like no to COVID tests and yes to freedom, but also things like no to dictatorship, yes to votes. And it's very notable that many of the protesters have been young people, including students on college campuses across the country. Because remember, for many of them, they have lived their entire college life in the past three years under some forms of lockdown. And they're also among the hardest-hit groups because of this impact of zero COVID on the economic slowdown, and with youth unemployment really skyrocketing. So really, this is a group of people that's feeling increasing that sense of hopelessness and that obviously makes them more likely to take to the streets and have their voices heard through protests, Christine.",

I'm not sure what that accomplishes, but it's sort of just an act of control.So I think there's no way Xi is going to allow this to take root. And once you see the blank sheets of paper, then you realize that the protest is about more than just COVID and COVID restrictions, it's about censorship. So, I think that's the first thing you see him do. I do suspect that you're going to see them loosen up a little bit on the restrictions in part because they need to do it for commercial reasons, in part because they look in their own neighborhood, and they see that Japan and South Korea, which had very strict rules have also managed to lift them and don't seem to be having big resurgences.",

We've been out here over this past weekend in large malls and also in the general public.And certainly, it seems as though there were a lot of people out, there weren't a lot of people spending and most of the shops were still open. In fact, there were some places where you could barely move because there were so many people out. There's Black Friday sales that were going on late last week and over the weekend as well. So certainly, it does seem as though people are still going out and do still have some spending power, Christine. But of course, we also always do have to caveat that. Moscow certainly is not the rest of Russia. And there are definitely some regions in this country that are suffering more than others. And of course, also here in this region, there are a lot of people who have lost their jobs and whose spending power has drastically decreased as well, because this country also, like so many others, is suffering from massive inflation as a result also of the sanctions. Now, if you're out here in Moscow, the civilian economy does not seem to be disproportionately suffering, and certainly, doesn't seem to be crippled. However, the war economy certainly is a different picture, it seems to be a different picture. You're talking about the budgets needed for what Russia calls its special military operation with Jim O'Brien that he was talking about. And then also, the Russians certainly do seem to be having some problems getting their hands on sophisticated technology to manufacture and replace some of those modern weapons that they need on the battlefield as well. You're talking about things like computer chips and other parts as well that the Russians would need. And you know, we've heard some of the reports that the Russians buying drones in Iran, looking for ballistic missiles from Iran as well and looking elsewhere to try and replenish some of the weapons that they need. So, as far as the civilian economy is concerned, I would say that most people have not felt the full brunt of sanctions yet. The combat economy certainly is one that is very different. But what we're hearing from Russian officials, and I think this is something that in that interview became very clear as well, they do seem to be switching with the actual goals of the special military operation are. However, the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out just a couple of days ago, and once again said that he believes that Russia's efforts in Ukraine will be brought to a successful end. So it certainly does not seem as though the Kremlin seems at this point in time to be changing course, Christine.",
