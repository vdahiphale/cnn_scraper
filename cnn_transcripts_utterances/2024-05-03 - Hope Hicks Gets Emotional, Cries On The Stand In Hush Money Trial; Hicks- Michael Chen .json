Hope Hicks taking jurors inside Trump world as the Stormy Daniels story broke and describing how Trump feared allegations of sexual misconduct would hurt his 2016 presidential campaign. Hicks tearing up at one point as she faced cross examination with her former boss only a few feet away. We'll take you inside the courtroom for all the key moments of the former president's historic criminal trial.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in the Situation Room, The Trump Trial Today. Let's get right to the breaking news on Hope Hicks testimony in the Trump hush money trial, the new revelations, the raw motion and how it all may impact the jurors deciding the former president's fate. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is outside the courthouse in New York for us. Paula, so what prompted Hope Hicks to get so emotional on the stand? And what was the line of questioning then?",

      "sentences": "Wolf, that was certainly the most dramatic moment that we've had in this trial so far. Now, shortly before she broke down on the stand, she answered some questions that could be really critical to the prosecution's case. For example, she admitted that, in fact, Trump had acknowledged the payment was made at one point and also that Cohen had made it out of, quote, \"loyalty.\" Wolf, that's incredibly significant because not only is Trump acknowledging his awareness that this payment was made, but also that Cohen made it, which undercuts the defense's argument that this was indeed some sort of retainer for general legal services. And then she talked about the fact that this was done for the election and that Trump appreciated that this story was suppressed ahead of the election.So, this was an incredibly significant moment throughout the course of this trial. That's part of why I think we saw that emotional response.",

In the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, she described it, quote, \"as being very damaging.\" In fact, she said it was a full blown crisis, something that I think there is consensus about with other top advisors in the 2016 campaign. So it's significant that she testified on the stand about just what a big deal that was because, of course, we know that after that tape is revealed, then Stormy Daniels and her attorney Keith Davidson, they approach the Trump world about getting that hush money payment.",

He sat there, he paid attention. He'd whisper to his lawyers. They'd pass each other notes or information.He seemed like he was really paying attention and careful. And the jury also seemed like they were very thoughtful and really just looking at what was happening. So, it felt like any other criminal trial at 100 Center Street that I've seen hundreds of.

This is very unique and important, obviously, because she is the first Trump campaign insider. But also, you know, you can see what the prosecution is kind of doing here. We've heard from David Pecker about his perspective on the relationship between the hush money scheme and the campaign and from the National Enquirer, we heard from Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Keith Davidson, about his perspective.

But from the defense point of view, she also made the case that he was concerned about Melania and that this was personal. And so on the one hand she said, well, this was all about the campaign, which, you know, and on the other hand, she said, well, this was personal, which is exactly what the defense wants to say.

So it's something that defense attorneys could potentially seize on. She had a lot of other negative things to say about Michael Cohen, suggesting, you know, when Trump said that Cohen paid the hush money out of loyalty, she said she didn't consider himself a very -- consider him a very selfless or charitable person. I mean, a lot of the other witnesses have had unpleasant, unkind, unflattering things to say about Michael Cohen.

You know, the president liked her, the staff liked her, and she did what she had to do. She answered the questions truthfully. But I think at the end of the day, as the sketch artist said, you heard a sketch artist say, she humanized Trump to a bit today.

You worked closely with her. What was going through your mind today while following her testimony? OLIVIA TROYE, FMR. DHS ADVISER TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: You know, I kept thinking about how hard today must have been for her. To be honest, I mean, look, David's right. She worked with a lot of us on the staff. I worked closely with her especially in 2020 during COVID. Many of us sought her counsel at times because she really understood Trump's mentality and his thinking. She was very trusted. I know at times my own former boss, Mike Pence, sought her counsel. And she was kind of the person in the room that Trump would turn to in meetings and bypass everyone else and say, Hope, what do you think? And so, you know, when they talked about her being teary eyed, I think that was the culmination probably of her thinking of everything that she has lived and been through and just trying to balance, like, the moral dilemma right there, right? Yes. I mean, she's trying to tell the truth. She's trying to just be factual about what she knows. But she's also part of this circle and trying to figure out how do you protect someone that possibly care about in a family that you really have worked closely with it? And I'll say this, I don't -- I never saw Hope Hicks as a political ideologue, per se. I didn't see her as this, you know, of a Stephen Miller type or anybody related to that circle. I just saw her as someone who was close to Jared and Ivanka and Trump and was just there to work with them, help them in moments of crisis.

And I think her job was just to follow his marching orders and she would execute at his direction. And so I think, you know, when it comes to that, I think this is a relationship between them that lasted, you know, several years. And when she left, I, you know, it was very clear that he, you know, there was reporting on that where he didn't want to let her go. He wanted her back in his orbit because that is the one confidant that he had in a circle that he trusted.And, you know, it was hard to penetrate that circle. And I think towards the end, as you know, there were a lot of defections that happened. And I think Trump became very weary of those people. And so I think that was the beginning of the campaign. So I can only imagine, like, if she was his trusted confidant and the right hand person, that tells you just how credible her testimony is and her insights today about what happened. And I -- look, I think I've heard others say this. I think it served both sides of the case today.",

This is about how these documents were filed. Is he involved at that granular level, filing this, you know, report with the New York state, was he that involved?

And I think he's using these most recent statements to back out of it, to basically say, I'm not going to testify, not because I don't have the courage to do it or I've changed my mind, but the judge won't let me. So I think that's another purpose for his saying that.Now, with regard to the four violations before the judge, I believe the judge will, may not find a violation. He's talking about Michael Cohen. Why? The judge issued the gag order to keep Donald Trump from intimidating witnesses. That's part -- one of the reasons. Well, Michael Cohen has been intimidated because Trump even retaliated against him. His people did, and had him put back in jail for putting out publishing a book. So if the purpose is not being served, that is Michael Cohen is just responding back. There appears to be not that intimidation, he might find there's not a violation of the gag order with regard to Michael Cohen going forward. With the others, particularly with the jury, I think the judge will find violations. And if that were to happen, we know the options. The options are $1,000 fine for each violation or go to jail. In my view, the judge will probably impose the fine again. And the judge has already lamented the fact that he can't increase the fines because the statute in New York is such that he can't do that.",

So I think going forward, absolutely the judge is looking at that. And I don't believe if the judge does this, and I hope actually if there's another violation, it's the only thing the judge can do, it's not going to disrupt the trial. If the judge says, I'm going to sentence you to jail, but I'm going to impose it at the conclusion of the trial so there won't be any disruption, but Trump will have this hanging over his head for the duration of the trial.",

That's a possibility, but I think the judge won't because that's the time that Trump spends campaigning and the judge is trying to, I guess, balance these, you know, his own, Trump's own First Amendment rights. So it could be disruptive. That's why I think he won't do it right during the day when there's trial.

One is that no constitutional right is absolute or unqualified and particularly with regard to the First Amendment, freedom of speech. Whether you're a university, a city, a town or a village, or as your last segment alluded to regarding gag orders, someone has to be in a position to regulate time, place and manner for the exercise of free speech.The other overriding principle here, Wolf, is that a university president and the trustees as well have an overriding responsibility to the safety and welfare of all students and the university itself. You know, when you're 18 or 19, it is still the case that parents expect universities and colleges to keep their kids safe when they send them off to school. And as Dr. Shafik alluded to, things escalated earlier this week to criminal vandalism occupying Hamilton Hall. And that left us with no choice. We brought in the police at our request.
