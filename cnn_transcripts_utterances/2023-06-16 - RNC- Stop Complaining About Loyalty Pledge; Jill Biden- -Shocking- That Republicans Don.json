And at the same time, let's just all go into our brains here, maybe go back 10 years ago and say we're having a conversation about a party that is thinking it's OK to nominate a candidate who's indicted and might be criminally charged as the nominee, and that this is an actual debate, whether this is a good idea or a bad idea. I think we would all have agreed, don't put the name Trump here. Just say, do you think that a party should nominate a candidate for president who has been indicted?

She's been traveling across the country this past week, participating in fundraisers where she has really talked about how her husband offers a contrast to the administration that preceded him.She describes her husband as providing stable, steady leadership and then has been referring to, quote, the corruption and chaos of the previous administration. She also, notably, has really been the only White House official to weigh in in any manner regarding the indictment of former President Trump. At a fundraiser earlier in the week, she said that she was shocked that many Republicans continue to support the president, saying they don't care about the indictment. Now, all of these comments came in fundraisers, which are off camera. So these words don't exactly carry the same punch as they might if she was saying it in a big speech on camera. But it does show the type of messaging that she could relay heading into this election over the course of the next few years. She, of course, has been a fierce defender of her husband and believes that he does provide a very stark contrast with the former president. Now, these next two weeks will be critical for the campaign, as they're really trying to ramp up their fundraising efforts. They're hoping to post high numbers as the fundraising quarter is set to end at the end of the month. And a little bit later today, both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will hold separate fundraisers. So we'll see how they intend to make that contrast with the former president, their first fundraisers since the indictment.",

But we do have reporting on exactly what the First Lady said on Monday. She said, quote, \"Like I just saw, when I was on my plane, it said 61 percent of Republicans were going to vote, they would vote for Trump. They don't care about the indictment. So that's a little shocking, I think\". And just for context, again, what Arlette said is key at the White House. The president and other political advisers have said, don't go there.
