We are learning the sprawling election interference case that brought indictments for Donald Trump and 18 others could actually have been even more sprawling. The special purpose grand jury underpinning that case initially recommended charging some 39 people. A reminder that panel did not have authority to indict. It could hear evidence, interview witnesses and offer recommendations.Among those recommendations were charges for three current and former Republican senators. South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, Georgia's two former senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Of course, they were not indicted in the end. The report does not show us how the D.A. decided which people ultimately made the cuts, as it were. CNN's Paula Reid is here. So, Paula, the D.A. does not have to indict all that a grand jury recommends to indict. By the way, some that were split votes, in effect, from the grand jurors. Others were close to unanimous, if not quite unanimous here. There's a lot to indict. But, but but  -- what were the main headlines we came away with?",

They are not binding on the district attorney, but we know who was ultimately charged in this case. And so, after looking at the recommendations, we can see she passed on indicting 21 people. And there's two groups that are really raising some eyebrows. The first are those lawmakers you mentioned, Senator Lindsey Graham and the former senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.We don't know why she declined to indict them. But if you look at the votes, it's clear they did not have unanimous support from the members of the special grand jury. And look, Jim, if you can't get a significant support in a grand jury room, it's going to be much tougher when you move to an actual courtroom. That was likely part of her calculus. The other group is, of course, the Trump advisers who were recommended, Boris Epshteyn, Mike Flynn and Cleta Mitchell. If you look at the math there, it seems similar. The votes, the vote breakdown is very similar to many people who were charged like former President Trump and Rudy Giuliani. So, at this point, it's not clear why she declined to charge them. But that's going to be something we're really going to be watching during this trial. Are they incredibly significant witnesses? Have they provided something else that would have prompted her not to move forward with charges? I also want to note that CNN was one of the media outlets that pushed to make this report public.",

So there have been some responses, including from Senator Lindsey Graham. What did he have to say? That's right. When it comes to Lindsey Graham, what the grand jury was looking at there were these conversations among things with the conversations that he had with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Raffensperger has subsequently said in interviews that these made him uncomfortable, that he believed that the senator was possibly encouraging him to disenfranchise voters when he was asking him to look for fraud. Let's take a listen to what Graham has said in response to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Looking at the three senators in the report, the special grand jury was pretty divided on whether to recommend charges for them or not.  In fact, there is one footnote from a juror that thought some of them were simply pandering to their political base and not engaging in a criminal conspiracy.

There's some legal issues here, Boris.There's First Amendment political speech issues that arise with elected lawmakers or speech or debate clause issues that come up that they could have had defences on. So, it's a trickier case than with a lot of these other folks. And I think that's at least part of the reason why Fannie Willis and her team decided not to charge the three ultimately.",

And I do think we will see during the course of all of these trials, a lot of statements by President Trump being read into the record to make the prosecutor's  case. And I think his response to all of that evidence is going to be, hey, you know, I'm just a politician kind of saying what I need to say.So, I do think that kind of argument will rear its head in different ways. But it's not really a defence. I mean, if you have proof that someone was subverting the election results in a criminal way, it's not a defence to say, hey, you know, I was also just pandering to my base.

But what prosecutors have to do is different. You know, they have to, knowing the law, being lawyers, they have to walk through each defendant and each charge and say, do we have enough in connection with this person? When you look at the elements of this statute to charge. And so, they can't really rely on what the grand jurors think about that.They, of course, you know, are taking into account the investigation that the grand jury put forward, but they're the ones that have to make those decisions. So, I don't think they were overly concerned with the vote counts, except in one instance, it is a good barometer. If you're a prosecutor, if you're in the grand jury and you barely eke out the number of grand jurors that you need in a regular grand jury, a charging grand jury, not a special grand jury, that is a trouble sign for you at trial, right? If you can barely get the grand jury, you're going to have trouble with the actual jury that has to find unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt. So, in that sense, they may have looked at it, but not in the sense of can we charge this person? How strong is the evidence?",

The United Autoworkers Union says their demands against Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis have not been met, while calling GM's latest proposal insulting. General Motors offered higher starting wages, more paid time off, and a 10% raise for most workers. But GM's head of global manufacturing called it a solid offer, though the union says it is not. And next week's strike deadline still stands.Now, here is some of what the UAW is demanding. A 40% pay raise over the course of a four-year contract, restoring cost of living increases, and restoring traditional pension plans for all workers. Remember, the last strike against GM in 2019 cost the company $2.9 billion over the course of six weeks. A strike against all big three U.S. automakers has never happened before, and it could mean losses of $5 billion in just 10 days. Let's discuss now with Robert Reich.

Now, I would say the Biden White House should stay away from this one. It could be very costly, but both sides know exactly what they are getting into.

This is as close to a Goldilocks economy as I have seen in my many years of providing economic analysis and advice. But beyond that, obviously, if you have a prolonged strike that costs five billion dollars or more in just 10 days, in terms of not only the workers and manufacturers, but also suppliers and consumers, it could have a negative effect. The political fallout could be negative, obviously, but the economic fallout would be much more serious.",

You've got these these extraordinary, --extraordinary achievements, not only the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act with huge solar and wind and non-carbon-based initiatives that are going to be very, very helpful in terms of fighting climate change, which we're all suffering from and all dealing with.And at the same time, we're we've avoided a recession and brought inflation way down. I think there's a lot to cheer about. And so, I, you know, I can't advise the Biden administration, obviously, on exactly what to say or how to say it.
