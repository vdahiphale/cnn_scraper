I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Today in Italy, G7 leaders have agreed to loan Kyiv about $50 billion dollars backed by the profits from Russia's frozen investments. It's been a banner week for the summit host, Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Fresh off a big win in the European elections, the far-right leader has welcomed her G7 peers to Puglia. But that's not all. Meloni has also invited a slew of other power players, like Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, and South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa. An emboldened Meloni stands in stark contrast to her counterparts, like France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz who are on very shaky ground after their parties took a beating from the far-right this weekend. Nonetheless, there are important issues to hash out, and top of the agenda is of course Ukraine and Gaza I'm joined by Nathalie Tocci, political scientist and former adviser to the E.U.'s foreign policy chief, along with Thierry Arnaud, senior international correspondent for the French channel BFMTV Welcome to both of you. Thanks for being with us. Nathalie, can I start with you first? Because in Italy, at the G7, they actually did agree to make this loan to Kyiv based on Russian frozen assets. Now, Russia is furious. It says there'll be painful retaliatory measures. How significant is this moment for Ukraine, Nathalie?",

It was actually the European countries that had been resisting. And essentially, the reason why it's mainly the Europeans that have been caving in the sense of, you know, contributing to providing the guarantee to the guarantee. Because of course, the big question really is, you know, what if the guarantee that is provided by those Russian assets were to somehow no longer be available, for instance, because of a \"peace agreement,\" then who would actually, you know, guarantee that guarantee? And for a long time, there was, you know, haggling over this point. It seems to me that it's mainly been the Europeans that have been backtracking on some of their resistance. And I actually think that the reason why this is happening is because of a growing fear that if the agreement is not reached now, then it could be a lot harder to reach in a few months' time, especially if the elections in the United States were to see a return of Donald Trump to the White House. So, in a sense, you know, cash in whatever agreement you can get in now, because the future may actually be far more troubled. So, I think, you know, although, of course, it's an extremely positive development that this agreement has been reached, and as I said, it has been in the pipeline, really, for quite perhaps for a little bit too long, it's been, you know, long -- a long time in the making, but the reason why it actually ended up in this final squeeze is because of a fear that in future things could get far nastier.",

And as much as they have disapproved the president's latest moves, for example, providing fighter jets to Ukraine, as is promised to do and training the pilots as well, obviously, by the end of the year, he has also talked about deploying French military instructors in Ukraine. The way he would like to do it would be as part of a European coalition. But on those two specific aspects obviously, neither Marine Le Pen or Jordan Bardella would approve of that and would sign off on it.

I actually, though, think that this narrative is overblown. Firstly, I think that Italy is presiding this G7 in extremely complicated times. It's actually a G7 that with the exception of this one agreement on the Russian frozen assets actually has no real deliverables, and it has no real deliverables precisely because, in general, the situation within the west has weakened really quite substantially. When it comes to Meloni herself, I also think that although over the last few months, and it's not just with the election, it's really been, you know, a narrative building up over the neck -- over the last few months of, you know, Meloni being the queen maker in Europe and what is her position vis-a-vis Ursula von der Leyen. We may be reaching the end of that story. And what I mean by this is that there comes a point where you kind of need to make a choice, right? And there's only so long that you can play this Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde game, which has been going on for the last year and a half, frankly speaking, of being very hardline domestically and appearing to be rather malleable on foreign policy issues. There will come a point, and especially when it comes to the decisions concerning the future cohort of European leaders, that Meloni will have to choose whether to actually make the definitive moods towards -- move towards moderation and essentially end up being, given the electoral results at European level, the small fish still the small fish in a big pond or actually return to what probably her real beliefs on and \"values\" are and move to the right, especially looking ahead at what may be happening in France soon.",

It's quite different to vote for a parliament which is going to hand over power to Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. And in his opinion, the French are not ready to go that far yet. It's a bet that governing parties have been making for the past 20 years.

But, you know, there are people like him who think that they want to run the country and want to have a seat in the government, and the only way to do this now is to align with, with Marine Le Pen. You know, when you look at these results of the European election, they're really spectacular because, you know, the Rassemblement National Party came ahead in 93 percent of French cities, of all French cities, big and small. If you look at all the social classes, if you look at all the age groups, she's ahead almost everywhere now, where -- even where she used to be traditionally quite weak.

Now, that that plan is, in theory, there, and, of course, it has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, what the G7 will do is, I presume, sign up to that very plan. But in a sense, we're in this odd situation in which there is a plan that presumably is Israel's plan. Hamas has kind of conditionally accepted it so long as there are certain clarifications made. But Israel itself doesn't actually seem to be committed to, presumably, what its own plan is. And so, in a sense, it -- we're back to a pre-7th of October situation, in which diplomacy on the \"Middle East peace process,\" for years, in fact, for decades, it became, in a sense, an excuse for things on the ground to deteriorate even further. And so, I fear that we're getting into this situation now once again, but, of course, in a far more dramatic and in humanitarian terms, catastrophic situation in which, in a sense, leaders can all be happy, there's a plan and we all sign up to it, but then nothing really happens, right, and no one really actually makes Israel comply to what presumably its own plan is.",

This G7 is somewhat different, Meloni has invited a whole slew of people from, you know, powerful presidents from Latin America, India, you know, prime minister, South Africa, et cetera.

So, I think it's essential that they try, because on the other side of the equation, you have obviously China together with Russia pushing extremely hard to convince them to align their world views to that of Beijing and Moscow. So, there has to be an argument. There has to be, beyond this invitation, you know, a worldview presented to these leaders that makes sense to them as well. So, I think it's very important that they are invited. It's very important that it's discussed the -- this very difficult world situation with those western leaders specifically.

LOUIS-DREYFUS:  Yes, exactly. That's what I do. That's my maternal instinct coming out. I fight death to death. And when that doesn't work, I consume him.",

And when you have suffered terribly, you're incentivized to say that, you know, something you heard about that you actually witnessed it.

I didn't know if they were true. I made one trip to the Chad-Sudan border where I was able to interview refugees who described what had happened, who described villages being destroyed, bodies thrown into wells, so those villages would become uninhabitable, you know, met a four-year-old girl who carried her baby sister eight days to get there after her parents had been killed.

And I think then the U.S. became complicit in that brutality in Gaza because President Biden was too slow to use the leverage that we had, which was essentially protecting Israel and the U.N. and shipping offensive weapons to Israel. So, you know, there's no doubt about the horror of October 7th, but I think there's also no doubt about the horror of what followed.

And I had -- just rushes to embrace its leader, and I think that has made him too slow and using the leverage that we have, such as the flow of weapons to pressure Israel to do what he's asked it to do from the beginning. So, you know, Biden was, I think, very good right from his first trip to Israel to call on Israel, to show restraint to remind Israel that the U.S. made mistakes after 9/11 in ways that did not advance their own security. But when Netanyahu rebuffed him and ignored him, then at that point, I think Biden was way too slow to create consequences and to use that leverage.
