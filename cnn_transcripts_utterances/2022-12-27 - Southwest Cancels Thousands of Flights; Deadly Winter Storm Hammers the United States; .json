Thousands of flights have been canceled across the U.S. after the monster arctic storm that pummeled much of the country over the holiday.And for Southwest Airlines in particular, it is an utter catastrophe. Right now, the flight tracking website FlightAware shows more than 2,700 total cancellations in the U.S. on Tuesday, and of those, more than 90% are Southwest flights. The company says that it has been forced to scale back its flight schedule to get operations back on track and get crews in the right places. Southwest CEO says that it is the largest scale event he has ever seen. Meantime, passengers are stranded at airports, struggling to get answers on when they will be able to reach their destinations. We've seen incredibly long lines at airline counters and tons of luggage piling up at baggage claims. Southwest has said that these cancellations and delays could go on for several more days, meaning it may be weekend before many passengers can even rebook. Here is more from a Southwest spokesperson.

So, I'm sure that this really hurts them hard.But we have to look at the last worst day of cancellations in 2022, the day that broke the record, until last Friday for 2022, February 3rd. Not a holiday. A lot of people don't remember. But the airlines canceled because of a weather event. They knew a major ice storm is coming across the U.S. Airports like Dallas-Forth was shut down. Airlines canceled thousands of flights preemptively. And what happened is that people didn't get stranded. The problem with what has happened now is we also knew again that a horrific weather event was coming and it was going to be almost nationwide. But the airlines didn't really cut too many flights. Southwest cut a few, some airlines had a few cancellations, but they tried to maintain those holiday schedules for the obvious reason. But the one thing passengers won't forgive you is if you don't get them where they want to be. So, that kind of hit them. They also have a point-to-point network. They're not hub and spoke like America and Delta. They are more of a short haul, short medium haul. And that means basically that when those pilots leave on a given day like for Minneapolis, they go to Midway, to Kansas City, down to Houston, to Dallas, to Phoenix, switch crews, and then they are off to like Ontario for the night. The issue with that is that it is very difficult once those crews, once those planes get out of position to rejuggle the whole system. It's a little but easier in a point and spoke, and that's a different system than how Southwest operates.",

Putin has given this region a lot of attention over the past year. He has visited all five of the central Asian countries, present at this meeting since the start of the war in Ukraine, and hasn't really done much traveling since the start of the war in Ukraine. He was pretty careful about leaving the country after COVID. That is significant. Talks are about economic ties between the two countries. Putin said trade is up some 6% since between January and October this year compared to last year. And security as well. He admitted that there have been challenges in terms of security on the world stage, explicit mention of Ukraine. He did also admit there what he called disagreements between the countries that are a part of this grouping. I think the most significant of which is the clashes that broke out in September between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Russia is presenting itself as the sort of broker, the peacekeeper, the central member of this group. That is why you see Putin standing in the middle of that photo.
