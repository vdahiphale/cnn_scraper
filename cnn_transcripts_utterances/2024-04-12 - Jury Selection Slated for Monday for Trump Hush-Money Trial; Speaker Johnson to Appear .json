The DOJ, the White House have no involvement here.But Trump is likely to keep making that claim, as we know he does, when he holds a rally tomorrow in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania. Our panel's here: Republican strategist Sarah Longwell; former Obama White House senior policy adviser, Ashley Allison; and Isaac Arnsdorf, who's national political reporter for \"The Washington Post.\" Sarah Longwell, let me start with you. You talk to voters all of the time. What do you hear from them about what we're about to see unfold here?",

They can't really tell all of the cases apart.That being said, as they come into singular focus as he goes into trial, I've never liked this one going first. Because just the word \"porn star,\" which you're going to hear over and over again, is just the kind of thing that makes people laugh it off as not serious, even though this is about, you know, corporate checks being passed and trying to hide things before an election so it didn't get out. Even though that's what it's about, like, it's -- the voters are going to interpret this one more, I think -- a little bit more through Trump's frame, as this is them trying to get me on something silly, than they would something like the January 6 case or the documents case, where, when they are taken singularly, seem more serious to voters than this one does.",

ISAAC ARNSDORF, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, it's an intentional collision from Trump's perspective. I mean, I was there for the hearing a few weeks ago that -- that set this date. And every time Trump went, in and every time he went out of the courtroom, cameras. You know, he -- the campaign is, for all intents and purposes, for the next six weeks or however long this takes, going to be in that hallway between the office where he meets with his lawyers and the courtroom where he's going to go into 40 Wall Street and holding press conferences.
