There needs to be some kind of a ceasefire. There needs to be a plan for the post-war in a sense to make the case that Prime Minister Netanyahu is leading them down a bad path.

We respect the president. I think that he is a great president and a great friend. I know him personally for many years. I've worked with him in different capacities, obviously, and I never doubted his complete, deep commitment for the state of Israel, for its security, for its future, and for the well-being of our people.So if he comes and speaks, it will be a great day. But I want to take it one step further. I think that on top of making these direct appeal to the Israeli people in the Knesset, he should sit in a closed room with Netanyahu and he should explain to Netanyahu what needs to be explained so that Netanyahu will understand. And I know, I know for sure that if Biden will make this direct appeal to the Israeli people and will take it one step further, either private talk with the prime minister and explaining what needs to be explained so that he will understand, he will not lose one Jewish vote, one bit of support of the Jewish people in America, on the country. He will gain more. And he will also gain all those who doubt about how important his position is to the American interests, including all the liberals of his party. So it's a win-win move.

I was hell-bent and determined not to let anyone talk me into going back into harness again with songwriting and I met this guy through a mutual friend, and we talked and I didn't realize how much he knew about songwriting and producing and records and all of that. And I was impressed with this guy. He was very kind of relentless about trying to get me to think about writing, recording, singing. So after about a year and a half of bouncing around ideas I heard an idea that he had called \"Turn the Lights Back On,\" which was very reflective of my own life at the time. It addressed my issues with my muse, with my songwriting. So I added a few notes here and there, and I modified a few things, but I recognize this song as being something I could have written on my own.",

OK? You -- these algorithms -- deep learning algorithms learn all this information and start to create a model. The model goes in an oven. And machine learning means it learns through experience.
