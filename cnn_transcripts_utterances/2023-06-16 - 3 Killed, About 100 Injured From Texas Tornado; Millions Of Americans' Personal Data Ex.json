This morning, it was eerily quiet. Now we are seeing construction crews, cleanup crews, residents coming back. If look behind me, that's Main Street. That mangled mass of metal, the red and white structure, was a cell phone tower. I believe we have the photos comparing the image of what it used to look like before this tornado hit, nearly twice the size. It looks like it was snapped in half by a child, but it's not. This is a facility. The power is still out. A lot of people are injured, dozens of people are injured. And people are left homeless trying to pick up the pieces from this devastating aftermath.",

We still don't know the full extent of this cyberattack, which has affected hundreds of companies across the U.S., federal agencies, major universities, including Johns Hopkins and Georgia's state-wide university system, and companies around the world.And what we are told by federal officials is that it doesn't appear right now like these hackers have been able to take anything from U.S. government agencies that is significant. But they're still investigating here. So, what seems to have happened, just to take a step back, is that there is a file transfer software that many, many companies and entities in the U.S. and around the world use to transfer files. And what happened was hackers actually found a vulnerability in that software. So, that allowed them to kind of burrow in and take advantage and hack all of these different entities and companies. In terms of who's responsible, we're told that it is a Russian cybercriminal group, which specializes in ransomware. They are apparently trying to extort their victims. They have posted on their Web site that they have demanded money and they have continued when they've not gotten that money to post more victims and threaten them. And, you know, it's unclear whether that is the extent of it because now that this software vulnerability is out there, other criminal hackers can also take advantage of it. That's what U.S. officials say. So, still trying to figure out really the scope of this. The Department of Energy so far is the only federal agency that's come out and said we were targeted in this. But at the same time, you know, the Russian cyber criminals, they have said, interestingly on their Web site, we don't want federal government data. We've erased it all. Don't bother contacting us. It seems like they're only focusing on the private sector -- Brianna?",

He becomes the first cabinet official under the Biden administration to travel to China and the first U.S. cabinet member to do so since 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic.Remember, Blinken was originally set to travel to China in early February, but he postponed his trip because of that Chinese spy balloon that violated U.S. airspace before it was eventually shot down. Now, the State Department says that Blinken is going to raise some serious concerns about China's role in the fentanyl crisis, in the war in Ukraine, and a major sticking point between the two nations, the issue of Taiwan. An especially heated topic when you consider that there have been not one, but two, military-related incident in recent weeks around the hotly contested South China Sea. The latest incident happening just earlier this month while the U.S. was conducting a joint military exercise with Canada. This video shows a Chinese warship cutting dangerously close to a U.S. Navy destroyer. The ships coming within 150 yards of each other. The U.S. says the Chinese were acting recklessly, while China is blaming the United States. You see how close the two were right there. And in the air over the South China Sea last month, a Chinese fighter jet cutting directly in front of a U.S. joint reconnaissance aircraft, forcing it to fly through the aircraft's wake turbulence. In this video, released by the U.S. military, you can see how the turbulence affects the flight, with the cockpit visually shaking, this disrupting the aircraft. Obviously dangerous, dangerous moments that could lead to potential escalation. Brianna?",

He is a CNN political and national security analyst and a White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" We're also joined by CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Army General James \"Spider\" Marks. David, last month, in Japan, we heard from President Biden. He was predicting a thaw in these fraught U.S./China relations. Are we seeing that yet? Is that the goal here? And is that possible at this point? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, that's certainly the goal. The effort is to try to rebuild some sort of sense of communication. As Spider will tell you, the military to military communications have been non-existent here. The diplomatic communications have been pretty well frozen, in part, because of the spy balloon. But, in part, because it's just a fundamental disagreement about what the future of the relationship would look like. With the U.S. saying, look, we can compete in a whole number of ranges, technology, trade, even some security issues, but there are areas where we can go cooperate. And the Chinese saying, you can't really have a bifurcated kind of relationship like that.",

JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's really troubling. It's really troubling. Look, we have scar tissue that's been acquired over the years, where if there's an incident, if there's a challenge at the very highest levels, there will be open, there will be very honest and calm communications. As David indicated those don't exist anymore. And that's the biggest concern. I mean, you can mix into this the conventional challenges that we see across the services, like we just saw these incidents that occur. Then you can escalate those up to the nuclear side. And it's very, very troubling. You have to be able to have open and transparent coms. And we've got to be able to get around the fact that there are two sides to the coin.

And he's also said that it could be used if there's an existential threat to Russia. That's the line we always get from Russia. But you have Tony Blinken responding to this. So, let's listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: We'll continue to monitor the situation very closely and very carefully. We have no reason to adjust our own nuclear posture. We don't see any indications that Russia's preparing to use a nuclear weapon. The president said again this week that we remain committed to the defense of NATO, every inch of its territory.

In this particular case, it's a tactical nuclear weapon. In my mind, it's a distinction without a difference here. It's a nuke. And obviously our approach toward that is much more controlled. It comes from the commander-in-chief down to an engagement platform. What is happening in the Russian sense is that's delegated down to the theater commander, when he decides he wants to use it to solve a tactical problem. So, there is a difference here between what Putin's saying, existential threat, and a tactical commander on the ground saying, hey, we have to take out a particular target to improve my position. We're worlds apart, but at least we communicate. Again, we had those communications in place. We have to use them.",
