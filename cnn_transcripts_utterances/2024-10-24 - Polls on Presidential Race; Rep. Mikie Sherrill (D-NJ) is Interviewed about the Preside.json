We have almost, from our birth, been incredibly successful, not only with our idea a lot - ideology, our vision, but making this country more fair for everyone. We need to continue in that fight to make sure we create opportunity and innovation so all of our children have a great future, so our ideals are resonating across the world of democracy and freedom.And these are the things that are really bedrock principles of Americans. And when I hear this well of cynicism from the right, oh, it's baked in, people know he's a fascist and really they don't care, or they know he's spoken approvingly of Nazis and Hitler, but that's fine. Just ignore that. It's baked in. That is not who we are as a people. And so when you look at Harris and Walz, when they talk about the future, when they talk about what they envision for our children, when they talk about their constant fights for the American people, whether it's lowering grocery prices or lowering the cost of housing, or making sure the economy works for you, these are people who are putting the values of this country and the American people first, which is such a sharp contrast to Trump, who has shown every indication in the past - and I'm not just talking as president. I'm here in New Jersey. We've seen Trump for years operate in this area economically. He always puts himself first. You work with him. You always end up getting the wrong end of the stick.

And the experts we have talked to with just 12 days to go really say that this could pose major problems to a peaceful transfer of power.Now, the first deadline that they missed was September 1st. That is a deadline for the General Services Administration to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Trump campaign that really lays out their access to things like office space, communications, secure email, and IT support. The second deadline was a memo with the White House that really gives him access to agencies, personnel, information sharing. So, the goal here really is so they can hit the ground running as soon as the election is decided. And the Harris team, meanwhile, has participated in all of these key deadlines. They have submitted their memoranda. And the nonpartisan experts we are talking to are warning that this could pose a major problem to a smooth transfer of power if they don't have the resources necessary to really hit the ground running. And Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin, he is the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, he said in a new letter to former President Trump and J.D. Vance, quote, \"that Trump is departing from the well-established norms of the federal government and demonstrating a spectacular disregard for the successful continuation of the essential institutions of American democratic government.\" Now, Raskin is also warning that this could, quote, \"threaten our national security.\" And that may sound dramatic, but it's really not hyperbole, because if you remember, back in 2000, as they were recounting those votes in Florida, neither Bush nor Gore were participating in a transition and the 911 Commission report found that that could have contributed to the September 11th terror attacks, Sara.",

And that threshold of how much lead dust is allowed to remain has been dropped to the lowest level detectable in a lab. So, that's the number that this new rule is really focusing on. And the history behind this, in 1978, the federal government banned lead paint in buildings, but there are still millions of homes and buildings out there that were constructed before that 1978 ban. And these buildings still contain lead-based paint today. The EPA estimates that there are about 31 million homes still containing lead- based paint and about 3.8 million of those are homes to young children who are especially vulnerable to lead exposure.
