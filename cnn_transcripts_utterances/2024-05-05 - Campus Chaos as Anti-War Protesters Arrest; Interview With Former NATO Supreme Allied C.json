Is this impinging on students' free speech or have protesters gone too far?I will be joined by an Egyptian and an Israeli scholar who teach together at Dartmouth to discuss that and much more. Then swarms of armed drones powered by artificial intelligence may indelibly alter the balance of power. Former NATO Supreme Allied commander James Stavridis tells me about this potentially frightening future. And since its birth, the CIA was a quintessential all boys' club. But all that changed thanks to women like my guest, Joanna Mendez, the agency's former chief of disguise. Hear from her about breaking the glass ceiling while winning the spy game. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They have a right to organize protests if so they wish, and they have to be able to do this freely without fear, without intimidation. And also, it is pretty radical and shocking for students to suddenly be confronted with, you know, state troopers and police on campus.Having said this, universities also have a right to protect free speech, to make sure that it happens peacefully, that it doesn't include incitement, that it doesn't intimidate other groups on campus, and that whatever disruption it causes and every protester to cause some kind of disruption that this disruption doesn't derail the main role of the university, which is education and learning. Now, there are cases where things are very clear as if you, I don't know, occupy a building and prevent people from accessing it for days on. But there are other situations where it's a fine line between, you know, are you annoying some students or are you intimidating them? Are you making them feel unsafe? Now those decisions have to be made by college leadership, and those are difficult decisions by definition. It is not that there is, you know, a laser line separating those things. But ultimately, the responsibility of the leadership is to make sure the university is open and that there is access for everybody to do what they are mainly there to do, which is learning.",

If you ask Israelis, do you want to Palestinian state on your border, they think, oh, the attack will come from Qalqilya on next time so no, we don't. But if the choice is a regional deal, normalization with the Saudis, economic growth, the opportunity to resolve the problem in the north the sense that America is with you as they were two weeks ago, the night that Iran fired these missiles.So that alliance no longer feels merely hypothetical. If that's the choice then, you know, forget the polling. There's a new opportunity here. And I think Blinken is trying very hard to emphasize this. That it's not -- do you want a Palestinian state or not? It's do you want this package that offers this kind of opportunity or do you want to go back to the status quo ante as Ezzedine said, and have to deal with all the blowback in the world for maintaining the occupation. It's going to be a culture war here as it has been in the past. And, you know, I'd like to think that reason will prevail.",
