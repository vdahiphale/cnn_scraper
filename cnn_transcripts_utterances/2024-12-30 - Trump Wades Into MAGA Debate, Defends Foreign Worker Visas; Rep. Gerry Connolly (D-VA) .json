Perhaps that is true.But if you look at what he did in his actual first term, they severely restricted these kinds of visas. So clearly, he has new voices in his ear. But the most important thing that this does is it goes to show you that there are going to be a lot of rifts in various policy proposals, particularly when it comes to something as difficult as immigration, something Donald Trump wants to handle on day one.

And lots of different categories to meet lots of different needs, from farm workers to H-1B skilled laborers. We're not graduating enough skilled workers in America. And there's a ready solution at hand, which is the H-1B one visa program. So I support the program. And the irony of somebody wanting to crack down on immigration has himself benefited from that program coming into the United States.

I've succeeded here in northern Virginia in building a Democratic majority by talking common-sense language that makes sense at the kitchen table, progressive ideas. But not lecturing, not elitist, not judgmental, but an invitation to join us in these policies and these programs. That works here. And I believe it can work across the country.

It will be a windy day in the plains with a fire threat and also a little bit of snow, like Omaha changing from rain over to snow. But the airport's doing really well. Clouds are very thin. Not muchrainfall over big airports. There's your Omaha rain at this point in time, but it does change over to snow overnight. Now this is the storm that will affect New York City around 10:00, 11:00 or 12:00 tomorrow night. Kind of a special time in New York City. And here it comes. I'm going to stop you right at 11:00. You see, the yellow could even be some orange in there. Could be thunder and lightning around Times Square. Otherwise, the coldest spot I can find for midnight tomorrow night, nine degrees in Minot. Temperatures should be fairly mild in New York. In fact, about as warm as we've been for a couple of years. The record highest we've ever been is 58. It will be 50. That's not bad. The coldest was one. At least we're nowhere near that. Now, fireworks in L.A., in the area will be a really bad idea tomorrow night, because we do have that fire weather there for even the San Gabriels and some of those cloudy areas, some of those windy areas through the canyons. Those are the areas that you really don't want to be setting any fires off at all. It will be rain and snow for the Pacific Northwest. Chicago, you get cold.
