One, there is no ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on the horizon, and Israel's prime minister sees the fog of war as essential to his own political survival. Tonight, the IDF offered the world a glimpse through the crosshairs. This is a jet providing a new view of its aerial campaign over Gaza. The bombs there are punctuation marks to the current reality on the ground, quote, this is a time for war.

The New York Times also reports that Netanyahu brushed aside repeated warnings that he would not be able to that his plan to remake the government and pursue an unpopular and controversial judicial reform plan was weakening his country's security.Now, it all came to a head when he outright skipped what The Times reported as a meeting with a senior general who was poised to deliver a warning about the threats based on classified intelligence. Now, that report from The Times prompted an outburst from Netanyahu, aimed at his nation's security leaders. He blamed the military for overlooking the Hamas threat. He did this at the very same time that that same military is prosecuting a war. Now, Netanyahu eventually did delete that post after public reprimands, we should say, and he coupled the deletion with a rarity, an admission that he was wrong. Now, this episode highlights that despite the show of unity after October 7th, Netanyahu's grip on power may very well be very fragile. And joining me now on the pressure that Netanyahu is facing now from the United States government is legendary journalist Carl Bernstein. He is the author of Chasing History, A Kid in the Newsroom. He famously covered previous Middle East wars. Carl, there has been a lot of change this weekend, the pace and the tempo of this war, but also the change in public opinion. What is your reporting telling you about how the White House is viewing all of this? What are they saying behind the scenes to their allies in Israel about this offensive in Gaza?",

And the idea that somehow we would undermine funding to fight the first land war in Europe initiated by a tyrant like Putin, who has destabilized the west, that we would somehow undermine this heroic struggle that we financed and it has stopped the Russians in their tracks.They're not going to necessarily win, the Ukrainians, but the idea that we were defund this struggle for democracy, it's preposterous and at the same time it's an indication of where Trump America lives today. And I think we need to look at it in terms not just of Ukraine, but in terms of democracy, autocracy, which I think represents -- we see represented in a lot of the Trump dogma. And we're seeing that dogma right now in Trump's comments about Ukraine funding, and now the new speaker. PHILLIP: The new speaker who his allies refer to as MAGA Mike Johnson.

A female Israeli soldier is now breathing free air after an IDF operation inside of Gaza to rescue her, and it succeeded. These other families, though, today are getting proof of life as well, courtesy of Hamas.Now, the terror group is releasing this video of three women believed to be hostages. I'm not going to show you that video. CNN isn't going to play the propaganda tool, frankly, but you can see the photos of the three women here. And the U.S. says that Israel is making a near impossible task more difficult. American officials now view the more kinetic by the hour bombing campaign as a complication in the desperate effort to bring these hostages home alive. Joining me now is one family member waiting word of her family member's fate. Maya Roman, his cousin, Yarden Roman-Gat, was taken captive by Hamas on October 7th after a daring escape, that attempt -- escape attempt that resulted in her capture, but her husband and her child both were able to get away miraculously. Maya, thank you so much for being here. This is such an incredible story when I heard about it. Can you just tell us a little bit about what happened to your cousin, Yarden?",

It just seems like what you hear isn't necessarily what's going on.And under these circumstances, I really don't know if a ground offensive is the thing that's going to help us bring them back or not. I really don't have enough information to judge. I feel like what's most important to us and the rest of the families is just to keep this issue of the hostages first and foremost. Before everything else, before all this talk about military incursion or what Netanyahu said, what we care about are the fact that there are over 200 hostages currently held there that we don't even have a proof of life of them. We don't know their condition. Today we heard that Shani Louk, one of the young women who were presumed to be kidnapped, taken from the party, her mother, Ricarda, was with us because they are German citizens as well as are we. We were on a trip in Berlin advocating for the hostages for a week. And today we learned that Shani was murdered and has been dead this whole time, and it's been devastating for us. So, this fact that we don't have any information and people just go on to talk about other things, that's what's worrying me the most.",

And we were very heartened by President Biden's comments when he came to Israel, and we hear those things here as well.You never know when the time comes to say these words are very nice, but what about actions, because we really don't know what actions are happening behind the scenes. So, we have faith that behind the scenes, everything truly is being done, and I do believe that. But I don't know how much further we're going to believe that, because it's been three weeks. In the beginning, Gili, Yarden's brother used to say that he hopes that when Yarden's birthday comes along, we will celebrate it together, and Yarden's birthday was almost a week ago when we were in Berlin. And we were singing Happy Birthday with 25,000 people at the Brandenburg Bridge at a rally to support the hostages. And it was very moving. But we can't help but notice that time keeps moving on, and she's still not here, and we still don't know what's going on with her.",

But a line has been crossed that when you actually describe how someone should be killed in a particular area, and it is so important to me, not just as the leader of this state, but also as a parent.We all remember dropping our kids off at college, and this is supposed to be a sanctuary for them, a safe place. And to learn about other people's views and ideas and to share and to learn and to emerge four years later as a different, more enriched person. And now they are trying to, these terrorists are trying to paralyze them and create fear in them. And so the state of New York already, before this, I announced our campus safety plans because we have seen an increase in anti-Semitism in particular, but we have no talents for any hate crimes, any hate speech, whether it's against Muslims or LGBTQ community or racist or sexist, you know, anti-Asian crimes, we are standing up strongly against that. But, now the increase in anti-Semitism and those cases has gone up dramatically. I have required every single college campus to have a hotline where incidences can be reported, but I said don't just let them report them. I want to make sure that there's campus police following up, and if necessary, outside police, then a district attorney. Because when a crime has been committed, as I believe has in this case, there must be prosecutions to be a deterrent and say, we're not tolerating this here in the state of New York. And, Governor, Jonathan Greenblatt of the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, he's calling this moment for the United States a category 5 hurricane of anti-Semitism coming from the left.

When we started before October 7th, the terrorist attack on Israel, we had seen an increase in anti-Semitism and hate crimes committed here in New York up about 300 percent. So, this was already on the rise. It's been festering. And now this has just been unleashed in a way that is just very un-American and it's definitely very much at odds with the values of New Yorkers. That's why I'm standing up strong saying, you'll find no safe harbor here in the state of New York if you're going to continue to terrorize individuals because of their religious beliefs or where they come from.

Also, a big Iowa poll from Ann Selzer showing not surprisingly, Donald Trump at the top, although he hasn't really moved much from where he's been, 42 -- 43 percent.But the surprise here is Nikki Haley gaining about 10 pounds -- not 10 pounds, 10 points in the last couple of months. That's huge compared to the other candidates who are going in the opposite direction. What is working for her in this race? And could some of it also be even the general racial argument that she's been making all along?",

And right now, Ron DeSantis, if his campaign has enough money to get him through to Iowa, he'll certainly stay there. Nikki Haley, on the other hand, has also been making a very effective pitch to donors that if you want to take out Trump, I'm the one to do it.
