This year Republican presidential candidates were invited to speak to and hear from black and brown voters in Iowa. The organizer says not one major candidate accepted not even the brown candidates. Today, are they ignoring minority communities or just acknowledging basic electoral math.Plus, a Palestinian American students said she's lost more than 100 members of our family to Israeli airstrikes. Other relatives, American citizen, she says are still trying to leave Gaza. She's here to share her story before speaking today at what organizers say will be the largest march for Gaza in the U.S. since the start of the war. And some migrant families in New York will have to move out of their temporary housing this week. I'll speak to the city council's immigration committee chair about why she says the mayor is causing harm to vulnerable people. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. The first voting of 2024 happens on Monday. So we will finally start to learn where Republican voters stand in this consequential election year. But not in a place that's representative of America. Iowa is around 90 percent White according to census data, so fine, it's no surprise that they're the majority of voters participating in the caucuses. But there are also black people in Iowa. There are Latinos in Iowa. I met some of them and talk with them. Here's a clip from when I traveled to Iowa for the last competitive Republican caucus in 2016. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STATE REP. AKO ABDUL-SAMAD (D-IA): We're in my precincts, which is the lowest voting turnout. It's not that we don't have the voters. There's they lack hope. They don't see hope so they don't come out to vote. And when you have individuals don't come out to vote, what happens with candidates? They focus on the areas that do. BLACKWELL (voice-over): They say there is one exception, Republican Senator Rand Paul. He spent more than an hour at platinum cuts barbershop talking about criminal justice reform. Blacks are just 3.4 percent of Iowa's population, but they filled 25.5 percent of the state's prison cells.",

There was supposed to be tonight a chance for Republican candidates to meet with the voters of color in an event organized by the brown and black forms of America. Well, it's been cancelled because none of the major GOP candidates committed to participating. In a statement on their website, the forum's organizers say that they weren't able to, quote, \"create the impactful and comprehensive form that they had envisioned. While we are disappointed to cancel this particular event, our commitment to amplifying the voices of all communities, especially those of color remains stronger than ever.\"Wayne Ford, the co-chair of that forum will join us in just a moment. But first organizers of a pro Palestine protest in DC. They say they're expecting the largest demonstration there since the start of the Israel Hamas war. They're calling this the March on Washington for Gaza, obviously invoking the 1963 march on Washington. This is MLK weekend. There's another March planned for Monday in New York. But there's more to this than the timing. We're seeing a tension and violence reaching other parts of the region now, and we saw South Africa this week, make its case against Israel to the top court of the United Nations with an accusation of genocide. Their demand is that the court order Israel to stop its bombardment of Gaza. Still no sign of any ceasefire soon. Joining me now is Yasmeen Elagha. She is in D.C. to speak at the March later today. Yasmeen, thank you for being with us when I read this number that you told our producers of how many of your family members had been killed in the airstrikes since the start of the war. Literally, it was a jaw drop. Explain how many family members you've lost. And tell us what you plan to tell the attendees at this March later today.",

One time, they experienced an airstrike right near Odessa (ph), another time, there was a shootout at the border. And keep in mind, my family have children as young as seven years old, 10 years old with them. And these kids are just experiencing this extreme level of violence right in front of their eyes.

They're all saying, you know, protest, and so we have a duty to listen to these voices, these Palestinian voices from the ground, analyze that and continue whether or not it has a tangible impact at this moment.We just saw that South Africa is, you know, taking Israel to court in the UN's highest court. And for Palestinians, that is huge. We have been overlooked as a community of color for decades. You know, it's almost a century of us being overlooked. And it mirrors the experience of communities of color in the United States being overlooked. And what my cousins are currently experiencing as American citizens of color, totally being overlooked by their government is, you know, it just tells the tale of what the United States government has done, you know, for centuries at this point has overlooked communities of color has overlooked Americans in need as long as they are people of color. So we're hoping that these protests and continue to do them will place pressure internationally, which will subsequently place pressure on the Biden administration and the U.S. government to act in the interest of its American citizens that it has a legal duty to protect.

The fear is that migrants could die in this cold.And New York City is struggling to find housing for more than 33,000 people who've arrived from Texas since August 2022.

The DPP, the Democratic Progressive Party is considered the Green Party, but this result is almost certainly going to have Beijing seeing red they absolutely hate this party. And for the last eight years, they have sent war planes and ships and spy balloons and drones and bellicose rhetoric and everything but the kitchen sink, they even launched a satellite over Taiwan, that's triggered in a nationwide emergency alert within the last few days leading up to this election, everything they could to let Taiwanese voters know that this is not the result that they want. The result that they have warned might actually be a choice between peace across the Taiwan Strait and war. Beijing was hoping that the two opposition parties that had a more China friendly platform, a platform that talked about recalibrating this ever deepening alliance with the U.S. and putting billions of dollars in arms sales, military cooperation training between Taiwanese and U.S. troops, visits by high profile U.S. lawmakers, including the most notable Nancy Pelosi's visit that triggered unprecedented military drills around Taiwan.

He came to the U.S. in 2008 on a medical visa and was eventually adopted by a family in Indiana. But his mother, Rebekah Hubley, said that documents they needed to allow him to stay were destroyed in the Haiti earthquake that was in 2010.It has been a struggle to get the paperwork in order, and he was facing the risk of being deported. But finally this week, just days before his 18th birthday, which is tomorrow, she got word that he would be granted citizenship. And we checked in with Rebecca and she sent us a video update on what this means for Jonas now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REBEKAH BROWN-HUBLEY, ADOPTED JONAS FROM HAITI: For him to be able to access his benefits now, that's his freedom. That's our freedom for him. That's our freedom as a family. I'll probably break open the bottle of champagne when his benefits start coming in, because to us that his citizenship opens this door for us to be able to help him like we should have been able to help -- we should have been helping him since 2010.
