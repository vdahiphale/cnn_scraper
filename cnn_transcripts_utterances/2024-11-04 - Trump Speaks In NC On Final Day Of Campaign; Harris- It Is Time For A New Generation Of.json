Do you know Mexico is our number one trading partner? Do you know what that costs? They make a fortune. They've taken over our country in a way since there's Biden, Harris people, they became our number one trading partner. And they're ripping us off left and right. It's ridiculous.

He repeats the same lies, the -- the same falsehoods over and over again. So it -- it makes your work a little easier.

There is zero evidence he's provided, none that any country, let alone countries all over the world are releasing criminals from their prisons to have them come here as migrants. He talked about the global prison population being down under Biden and Harris. I've spoken to a world expert on this. It's actually up under Biden and Harris.He spoke of these 13,000 immigrants with murder convictions he claims came in under Biden-Harris, actually that number is about people who came in over 40 years, including during his own administration. He talked about 21 million people coming over the border under Biden and Harris. The total number of so called encounters at the southern border is just over 10 million. And even if you add in so called gotaways, you don't get anywhere close to his figure. So it is the same immigration nonsense at rally after rally. And yes, it does make our life easier, but it's not good for the public discourse. ACOSTA: No, absolutely not. And -- and Daniel, what else stands out to you in terms of what he has said?

And I think tomorrow will be kind of cathartic for people to actually get through Election Day. And I feel actually that Harris is in a pretty strong position, even though the polls show it's tight.
