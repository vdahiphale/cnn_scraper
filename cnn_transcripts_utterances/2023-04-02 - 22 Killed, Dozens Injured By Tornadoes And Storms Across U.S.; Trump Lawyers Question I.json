Right now, pretty quiet like I mentioned, but that warm front begins to lift and we bring in the storm chances ahead of it and alongside the boundary.

That said there are still many things that they cannot do at this point. If you play enough with ChatGPT, you'll find it at some point giving very strange answers. Sometimes one answer that seemed very sensible. If you ask another question it reveals that it really doesn't understand what it just talked about.And in many ways, it's very strange to us. It doesn't reason like a human being, and yet it seems to be getting very powerful. And some of these techniques are also being used now to make scientific breakthroughs, like protein folding and there was a big scientific breakthrough based on very similar AI techniques. So in some ways, the systems really are more powerful than us. Some things we as human beings don't have very good intuitions about and these systems can learn about them.",

And yes it certainly was a scene that was very difficult to deal with for us at that time.And just to set the scene for our viewers a little bit. When we got there to that town of Kramatorsk, we were going there because the town had been hit right in the center with a giant Russian missile the night before. It was called an Iskander missile, which is a medium range missile that can actually carry nuclear warheads. If the Russians chose to do so. Obviously, in this case, it carried a conventional warhead, but it did level a residential building in that town. So when we got there in the center of town, there was a search and rescue operations still ongoing and we parked our vehicles. We went there to the scene where building got hit when all of a sudden as we were walking to the scene, I and the rest of us felt and heard a massive explosion right behind us. And I turned around and I saw a bunch of aluminum parts basically raining down from the sky, which I think were parts of the missile that had just impacted and so we could see a big plume of smoke. I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from where we were. And at that point in time, you know we do deal a lot, with getting shot at, with getting shelled also, but this was obviously something that was on a different scale. And so we all decided to go towards some sort of cellar or basement because that's the best protection that you have. And as we were doing that a second missile came in and hit there as well. So certainly was pretty brutal scene that we witnessed there again. Right in the center of that town, Amara.",

They witnessed stuff like that quite frequently.And so you also have to see how they feel about it and speak to them as well. So we did continue our work. We obviously stayed safe as we did that. But yes, of course it is something. Where afterwards. You do think about the fact that yes, it was a pretty close call today. And one of the things that you know, I want to say about the war in Ukraine, and I've been to Iraq to Libya to Syria and a lot of other war zones as well, Ukraine certainly is a lot more dangerous and the chance of getting hurt there is a lot higher than it is in a lot of other places because of indiscriminate fire like we saw there.
