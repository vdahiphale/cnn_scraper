      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.Cheer up, it's a new year, people. That is IMF head Kristalina Georgieva with good news. The world economy is stronger than you think. And she's joining me in a world exclusive. But world events could always intervene, like Israel's war in Gaza, where intense fighting continues. I'll speak to Nimrod Novik, former adviser to Prime Minister Shimon Peres, about that, and about Israel's Supreme Court striking down a key part of Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul. Plus, is trust in the media really that low? Michel Martin discusses with pollsters Jennifer Benz and Mariana Meza Hernandez. Welcome to the program, everyone, I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The IMF kicks off the new year with some good news on the global economy. And in a moment, my exclusive interview with the Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. But first she warns that any number of global crises could intervene, like Israel's war on Gaza, where no end is in sight. Tonight, Hamas confirms its deputy political leader has been killed in a blast in the Lebanese capital Beirut, fueling fears of an extended war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make yet another trip to the Middle East this week, as the United States and Israel are increasingly at odds over tactics. More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. This after Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis on October 7th. Israel now says it's pulling back some of its soldiers because of the toll on its own economy. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented ruling, Israel's Supreme Court has struck down a controversial judicial reform law. It's a victory for protesters who spent months on the streets before October 7th. So, the new year starts with precarious politics and no stated exit plan for this war. Nimrod Novik was a policy adviser to Prime Minister Shimon Peres and to the National Security Council. And he's now with the Israel Policy Forum. He's also a member of Commanders for Israel's Security. It's a nonpartisan group of defense experts that promotes separation for the Palestinians into two states. And he's joining me now from Tel Aviv. Nimrod Novick, welcome to the program. Can I ask you to react with your analysis as to what Hamas is saying and what a former Israeli official, Danny Danon, has claimed that Israel has assassinated the deputy political leader in Beirut, in fact?",

      "sentences": "Well, I would say two things. One, it's a very significantaccomplishment of Israeli intelligence and operational capabilities to do something like this at the heart of Beirut. I think that characterizing him by his formal position as deputy of the political wing doesn't really tell the full story of the man. He is a competitor for the true leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinar, who is now in Gaza and was in charge of creating terror cells and operations in the West Bank, out of his base in Beirut. So, it's a message to all Hamas operatives who were responsible for the atrocities of October 7th and others that Israel's long arm is going to get him.",

This is what he said. Let's just play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI MINISTER (through translator):  The situation on Israel's northern border demands change.

One rocket, one missile hits civilianpopulation and causes considerable casualties, and we are at full-fledged war. But as long as the parties are in control and are containing, Israel has a serious dilemma. Because of Hezbollah proximity to our northern population we have evacuated, in three months now, tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes, jobs, kindergarten, schools, what have you, and they're not going to go back watching Hezbollah tens of feet from their homes after the experience that we went through in October 7th in the south.

This time last year, predictions of widespread recessions for 2023 did not actually come true, including for the United States. Inflation and prices continue to come down.

We forgot what it is for inflation to go up, and suddenly it jumped. That has impacted the mood of people because for some, for the younger generation, they don't even know what is this thing, inflation. They didn't live through one. Secondly, interest rates went up again. For a long time, interest rates were very low, sometimes even in negative territory. And when you get the accustomed to borrowing cheap, then when interest rates jump, that is a shock. Of course, interest rates jumped to cure inflation. But for the ordinary people, these two things seem like problems, not like one is a problem, the other one is the solution. Only when the solution truly works people would feel more comfortable. Once they see interest rates going down -- first, inflation going down, interest rates are going down.

Consequences, there are certain things that are better produced, cheaper produced in one of these blocs, and the other bloc would have no access to them. So, we are all better off to find ways to reduce frictions, to concentrate on security concerns that are real and meaningful and not go willy-nilly in fragmenting the world economy.

In other words, Ukraine has earned the support of the world because it has been so responsible for how they manage their finances. How they collect taxes, they collect 36 percent of GDP in taxes. In that context, we have a program of about $16 billion from the IMF that mobilizes $122 billion support for Ukraine for four years. I discussed it with President Zelenskyy when he was in Washington a couple of weeks ago, urging him to continue on that very path, perform, demonstrate that Ukraine earns and deserves the support of its partners.

It's part of a larger phenomenon of declining trust in a lot of public institutions.

I think this tied to what Jenny was mentioning of trying to go into the details to really understand what people feel about themedia, but more importantly, their media or the type of media they personally consume, which might be different or can add some detail to what we're discussing here. And specifically, when we ask about their feelings on local media, what we find is that liberals, moderates, and conservatives alike, a majority of all three groups have a -- the majority say they have a high trust in local news or local press, which is probably something that you would not expect thinking about the divisions or the polarization narrative that we always listen about. Some of these groups tend to trust less the media versus some tend to trust the media more. But what we find is when you actually ask about local media, those differences are not as stark and you find some positives rather than negatives there.",

Gallup, for example,says that only 34 percent of Americans trust the news. But your group, NORC, found that something like 55 percent trust the news. And a different organization, Pew, found that it was like something like 61 percent. Can you can you help us understand why those numbers look so different?",

I think -- I mean, you get slightly different responses from all of these polling organizations, depending on exactly how you ask thequestion and the types of response options that you give people. You know, one thing that is consistent across all of these organizations who have put in the time to be able to track these measures over the years is that no matter sort of what the exact estimate is, everybody is showing this decline over time. And I think the one thing that we tried to get at in digging into these data a little bit more and trying to unpack is, you know, what do people really mean when they say that they don't have a great deal of confidence in the press, or that they only trust journalism a little bit, you know, depending on all of these different question wordings. And when you disentangle some things, you start to see that the levels of trust are maybe a little bit higher than you might expect. So, you know, for example, a lot of people consider the -- you know, the biggest function of journalism to deliver accurate facts to the public. And when you ask people, you know, how much confidence they have in the press and in journalism to be able to report the facts accurately, 55 percent say that they're pretty confident. So, sometimes these kind of big picture measures that are important and that we're all looking at overtime can mask some of the nuance in the data.",

We looked atGen Z, Millennials, and younger adults, and we actually asked a ton of questions of their news consumption and their opinion towards the press. And one of the key facts that we found is what you were mentioning is that actually those younger generations do pay for it for news and media, either by directly paying or donating to those sources, which may be more varied that we actually think when we think about traditional media. But there's still a sign of a lot of engagement when it comes to news with those younger audiences as that also points out the relevance of the press and media for them and how they still rely on them to get the news.",

And in some ways, you know, there is a little bit of a failure to communicate with our news consumers. And so, you know, one potential solution coming out of this work is thinking about the ways that we explain what we're doing in our journalism and, you know, these data showed that there are some fundamental misunderstandings about each other. You know, we have roughly half the public that, you know, told us that they weren't even really sure you know, what an op-ed was or what distinguishes an editorial from a regular news article. And one of their concerns about the media is that there's too much opinion and not enough fact, when they feel like they are reading the news. And so, you can start to see some potential pathways where if we're explaining what we're doing and what the purpose of a news piece might be to the public in the way that they can understand it, we can try and bridge some of those communication gaps.",

This decline in trust is not exclusive or -- to the press or to the media, but it's also something that's playing other institutions across the nation.
