The minute that he said, I'm surrendering on Thursday, he said, well, there we go. All the talk about the debate is going to be overlaid by Donald Trump. He's going to blot it all out. And I think the debate itself also gave us another example of how challenging it is to beat Donald Trump. When you look at that field of candidates and some of the polling that's come out since then, it's still a -- it may not be a split screen, but it's a split field. There's not one consensus non-Trump candidate. And so whether -- you could say Ramaswamy and DeSantis and Haley all helped themselves, but that's nothing but helpful for Donald Trump to have three people --",

Yes, it doesn't get the free media pickup it would because Donald Trump blots out the sun. There's no doubt that these candidates a day after who they're putting out how much they raised in the 24 hours after the debate, it may not be as much as they otherwise would have.

It's not Trump without the Trump. It's absolutely Trump, but just somebody who happens to be a lot younger than that. And Donald Trump is exactly right.

Thank you so much for coming on. It's been quite a week. I want to start with just that. We're closing out a week where a former president in your party arrested four times. Now, I'm sure you've heard, he has a mugshot. 18 of his co-defendants also arrested. It's pretty easy to kind of lose sight of the magnitude of the moment because we have had so much incoming when it pertains to news about Donald Trump legally. Did you ever expect in your lifetime we would see anything like this? REP. KEN BUCK (R), FREEDOM CAUCUS: I did not, Dana. Actually, my first trip to D.C. professionally was to work on the Iran-Contra affair. And it had everything to do with whether President Reagan had violated the Constitution and could be impeached. It had nothing to do with any criminal charges against President Reagan or anybody else. And so, ultimately, obviously, Colonel North and Admiral Poindexter and others were charged in that case. But it really is unique and something that most people didn't think we would get to in this country because we see it in third world countries. You see it in other countries.

Number one, those are suburban voters. That's Betsy Sarcone. She's in our voted group. And that was her mom you saw in the piece there. She watched the debate with her mom and dad. They did not like Vivek Ramaswamy. They found him abrasive. We have a son who watches the WWE. Think of Donald Trump as the WWE. Vivek Ramaswamy is the NXT. That's the minor leagues, if you will. Trump voters love him. They're not going to leave Trump to go to Vivek Ramaswamy, but they like him because he's different, because he's not a politician, because he repeats Trump's mega views.In the suburbs, though, he's toxic, just like Trump is in the suburbs. So when you talk to the suburban voters, we don't want Trump, we don't want Ramaswamy. We hope to come to a consensus around one person, one Trump alternative by January. But, Dana, that's the other big takeaway. The split over Ramaswamy is very much like the split over Trump in the party. But -- so you're saying you have all those candidates on stage. Will one emerge? There's no evidence of that yet, which is a win for Trump. Betsy Sarcone, when we went out there at the beginning of the month, she was leaning DeSantis. She loved Governor Haley in the debate the other night, and she, you know, that -- you know, she's not there yet. She wants to -- she's thinking, can she beat Trump, right? Can she be viable? Another suburban mom, Jocelyn Taylor, who lives a few miles away, they don't know each other. When we went out there, she was eh on DeSantis. In our piece, she was like, there's a lot of negative around him. She watched, especially the first answer when he said America is in decline, I will but the economy. Now she's leading DeSantis' way. So that's what we're trying to figure out in the months, four months plus to the Iowa caucuses. What sways people back and forth, and then where do they land? And the suburbs are growing so fast around Des Moines. There is a mathematical potential there for somebody, but it has to be one somebody, and right now it's not.",
