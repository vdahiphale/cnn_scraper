If they didn't ask for a loyalty pledge, the majority of the public would not perceive that there's actually a problem.RANDI KAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former Texas Rep Will Hurd has said he will not sign the Florida pledge, not because he won't support a Republican nominee, but because he won't support Donald Trump if he becomes the nominee. Chris Christie has said that this Florida pledge is useless. Also as far as Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis go, neither has said if they will sign the pledge, and neither of them have said that they will support the other if that person becomes the nominee. They've been sidestepping those questions. It's also worth noting that the Florida GOP seems to be taking its clues from the Republican National Committee who was also asked for a loyalty pledge for the primary debate. In fact, the Florida GOP told Politico that it's pledged basically mirrors language adopted by the Republican National Committee for that first debate. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida.

Even if they don't violate any specific law. And that is facing massive opposition in the streets. Organizers say if the boat is approved, will demonstrate on Tuesday, a day of resistance. It comes after tens of thousands of protesters rallied against the measure on Saturday for the 27th consecutive week.Police clashed with demonstrators in some areas and fired water cannons to clear major highway its in Tel Aviv.

And this happened on June 28th, according to a statement from the Marine Corps.I want to read part of that statement where they say: This command takes this matter and all allegations very seriously. The incident is under investigation and we will continue to cooperate with NCIS and appropriate authorities. Now the NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. They are in charge of this investigation but declined to comment on the investigation saying out of respect for the investigative process. Now, we did reach out to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and what they're saying is that the 14-year-old girl was reported missing by her grandmother on June 13th. The grandmother told authorities that she ran away on June 9th and said this was not the first time that she ran away but usually returned home quickly. So they entered her information into a number of missing persons databases, but she was found on June 28th by military police and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department says that detectives interviewed her. They were offered services and she was returned to her grandmother. Now again, it is the NCIS who is in charge of this investigation, so we will have to wait for their findings.
