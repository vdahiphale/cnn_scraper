COVID certainly contributed to this loneliness crisis, but it was a problem long before. As a result, the lesser participation in the community organizations that used to bring us together, rec leagues, churches, synagogues, et cetera, but also the impact of technology and social media has not always been positive. It's often diluted the quality of people's relationships, taking them from in person interactions to online interactions.Here a couple of simple things people can do is, one, draw boundaries around your use of technology, have some spaces in your day that are tech free, particularly your time in person with others, your time around meals, your time before you go to bed. But it's also important for us to proactively build time in our day to reach out to other people. I try to put 15 minutes aside each day to reach out to someone I care about. Sometimes it's just calling my mother. Sometimes it's just calling a friend to say, hey, I'm thinking about you. I want to know how you're doing. Those small moments matter.

How it can feel like this deep void that you feel ashamed about, and that you don't talk about because you feel like admitting you're lonely might be admitting that you're not likable or not lovable. And I want everyone to know that that is not the case.If you are struggling with loneliness, you are not the only one and you are not broken. What I had to do is recognize that. It took years for me to come to that realization. But it was my wife, Alice, you know, a few years ago, who helped me realize that, you know, I was struggling, in fact, with loneliness. Sometimes it's hard to see in yourself. And it was just a couple of friends, two good friends in particular, who made a commitment to check in on me regularly, who helped pull me out of that deep abyss of loneliness. And that's the last critical message to remember is that this is about quality of friendships, quality of interactions, not quantity. I know the age of social media has convinced us that we need thousands of followers and thousands of friends. We do not. It's -- we just need a few people in our life who see us for who we are, with whom we can be ourselves, and who can show up for us in a crisis. And hopefully we can do the same for them.",
