(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PROKUPECZ (voice over):  Long-awaited documents finally released. The first batch of sealed court filings pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public Wednesday. The documents stemmed from a civil defamation lawsuit brought in 2015 against Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Prominent figures including Prince Andrew and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump included in a 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, a former employee of Epstein. She says in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and, quote, he said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls. When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein's, she said she understood Epstein had, quote, dealings with Clinton. Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein and has denied any kind of criminal activity, but in 2019, he admits to having flown on Epstein's private plane, but knew nothing of the financier's, quote, terrible crimes. Sjoberg also recalled the time she was with Epstein on one of his planes and pilots said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffrey said, great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to -- I don't recall the name of the casino, but we'll go to the casino. She says in the deposition she never gave a massage to Trump.

Now, there hasn't been an admission of who carried out this strike, and it's not clear who carried it out, but according to that spokesperson, they say they believe that it was the U.S.-led international coalition. No comment from that side. At this point, they called it also an unjustified attack. But what we have seen in recent months, in fact, since those October 7th attacks by Hamas in Israel is a significant number of attacks by pro-militias -- pro-Iran militias against U.S. targets in both Iraq and also in Syria. And there has been a significant increase in those attacks. So, at this point, we are awaiting comment as to whether or not this was from the U.S.-led coalition.

When it comes to what happened in Iran yesterday, we did hear from senior administration officials that this sort of bears the markings of ISIS and not necessarily Israel, but they acknowledged that it is somewhat mysterious what happened there. But I think the greatest fear that you hear from administration officials is in the Red Sea, in these Houthi attacks on commercial and merchant vessels that are trying to pass through. And, certainly, yesterday, we did hear much stronger language from the administration releasing this joint statement along with 11 other countries, warning the Houthis to call for an immediate end to their attacks and warning that the Houthis would bear responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways. And what we heard from officials is that President Biden did task his team with coming up with an effort to bring in his allies, American allies, to try and put out a more forceful statement on the Houthis, because the U.S. has stopped short so far of directly targeting the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The options do exist on the table, and President Biden eventually will have a decision to make whether to take some sort of preemptive action against the rebel group, take out some of the drone and missile sites that are causing so much havoc and disrupting commerce in the Red Sea. So far, his effort has been focused on this maritime coalition of countries who are trying to beef up security through U.S. warships. But just last week, we did see the first direct engagement between the U.S. and Houthis when a U.S. helicopter shot and killed some of the boats. So, certainly, the tensions very much ratcheting up. One thing that an official did say yesterday was that this would be the last warning to the Houthis going forward. So, certainly, there are tensions very much ever present in that region. Phil? MATTINGLY:  Kevin Liptak, great reporting, thank you. Also this morning, a manhunt is underway for a gunman who shot and killed an imam outside of his mosque in Newark, New Jersey. Police say Imam Hassan Sharif was approached just before pre-dawn prayer and shot several times. He was rushed to the hospital. Officials do not know what motivated the shooting, but the evidence found so far does not point to bias. Members of Sharif's community are devastated. They say he was a, quote, beacon of leadership and excellence and a community advocate who protested against gun violence continuously.

There were two groups of migrants that crossed the river in the very areas where they were standing. It was a little bit strange because there have been so few border crossings in recent days here. However, in December, there were staggering numbers. According to Homeland Security estimates, there were more than 225,000 illegal crossings here along the U.S. southern border in the month of December, numbers that we haven't seen in more than 20 years. And because of that, these Republican lawmakers here on the ground really trying to ratchet up pressure, calling for a return to some of the Trump-era policies that they believe helped control illegal immigration here in the U.S. This is some of what they had to say yesterday afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  The solution is to go back to the policies that worked. The solution is our legislation. Or the solution is simply, I think, one sentence, no money can be used to process or release into the country any new migrants, to just say suspend it now. REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX):  How do we fix this? We end catch and release. How do we fix this? We deport people that are here illegally by the thousands, not by the dozens. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
