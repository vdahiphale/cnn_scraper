Russian strikes blanketing Ukraine from east to west, killing at least 31 as of this hour, injuring more than 150. Cruise missiles, drones, and bombers flooded Ukraine's air defenses in what Ukraine says is the worst attack since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly two years ago. Russia targeted Ukrainian air bases but also hit apartment buildings, a metro station, and a maternity hospital in Dnipro, a hospital official says windows were smashed, ceilings broken and while women and newborns were able to get to a bomb shelter in time, we are learning more about the dozens killed in these attacks across the country, including one of Ukraine's most celebrated basketball players. A Lviv official confirming Viktor Kobzystyi's death. The onslaught comes shortly after the U.S. sent its final military aid package to Ukraine, that is, of course, until Congress approves more. This caps of an incredibly tough year for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including a counteroffensive that failed to meet expectations, as Russia vows to continue fighting and turns it's heavily sanctioned economy into a brutal war machine. It's not just Ukrainians, though, on high alert tonight. Poland, a NATO country, noting a, quote, unidentified object crossed into its airspace and then disappeared.

He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped. In that statement, Biden went on to demand from Congress that they find some sort of compromise and passed the supplemental that includes approximately $60 billion in aid for Ukraine. And the issue is, Ukraine is not the question here. There is generally bipartisan support for Ukraine, certainly in the Senate, but also in the House. The issue is that Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson need to find a compromise on border security and immigration policy. And that remains the challenge. Negotiators have the network. They've made some progress, but not enough and they are not over the line yet, and that's what Biden is hoping for here. The challenge, Erica, lawmakers aren't in session right now, so having those conversations that can come as a direct result of something like this and the dynamics and seeing if this moves anyone simply not possible right now, not for sometime until we can see if this really had an effect, if it can move the needle on how -- on whether and how quickly the U.S. can pass aid that includes aid for Ukraine.",
