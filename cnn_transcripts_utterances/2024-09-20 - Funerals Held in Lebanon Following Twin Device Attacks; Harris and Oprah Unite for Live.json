What we saw in 2022 after the Supreme Court rescinded the nationwide right to abortion, is that Democrats expanded their margin in these places, even wider than they were under Joe Biden in 2020. And, given Donald Trump's strength of turning out blue-collar white voters, particularly in small, midsize communities, Harris is going to need huge margins in places like Oakland County, and particularly from women, the kind of women who are in that event tonight.

Here's the through line in the polling.Consistently, whether you're talking about national or battleground state polls, Kamala Harris, like Joe Biden, is basically matching Biden's support in 2020 among white voters when he won these states. She might be a couple points down among the blue-collar white voters, but she's usually a couple points up among the white-collar white voters, with the effect that in -- when it's all said and done, she's basically where Biden was in 2020 when he won places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. She's improved a lot since Biden left the race among black voters and Latino voters. But she's still not back all the way to where Democrats were in 2020. And you can look at that one of two ways. You can say she's still got work to do. You could also say that Trump's ability to stay in the race is dependent on him reaching a level of support among minority voters that we haven't seen for a Republican, really, since the civil rights era. And the other thing that's really running through these polls: the gender gap could be unprecedented. As we saw again tonight at this rally, she has the potential to significantly improve, I think, among both non-college and college white women. Probably not much more room to grow among black women.
