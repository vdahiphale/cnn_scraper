CNN's Max Foster joins us live from Windsor. Nic Robertson, he's in London. And Astead Herndon is back with us here in Washington, D.C. Nic, I want to start with you because the White House has been downplaying some uneasiness we've heard from allies about the decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine.

It does -- it is a little awkward in some ways, and I think we got a sense of that over the weekend, when Rishi Sunak put out that press release saying that, you know, the U.K. is a signatory and these are the reasons why, and this is what we're not going to do, and this is why we don't do it as part of that convention.His press spokesman this afternoon, after meeting with President Biden, said actually, Rishi Sunak, in the format of that tea in the gardens at the back of Number Ten here, did raise the issue, did say he put forward, as he is obliged to do, per the convention, to discourage the use of cluster munitions. So, it does seem that this did come up for a conversation. But I think the tag line to what the press secretary said at the end of that was they understand, the British understand that this was a tough decision for President Biden. So, I don't think this is going to break any bridges. There's certainly the obligation on the British prime minister to do this. He was always going to be questioned about it. It was one of the first questions to his press secretary following the meeting. And he raised it. So, I think, that does tell you, it's an issue, but not a massive one.",

Possibly some level of Ukraine, as well, because King Charles has voiced his sport for Ukraine in the conflict against Russia. But I think it will be kept very superficial. Much more detail on climate. And they've got this meeting with a group of philanthropists and finance experts, trying to deal with climate change in the developing world and emerging markets. So, they're going to brief Charles and President Biden on the conclusions of their meeting. So, they will have some suggestions for change. So, there could be something concrete that comes out of that. You can imagine one of the pioneers in climate change, King Charles, and the president of the United States, if they supported some changes there, that could be quite significant, actually.We're also going to probably get some images of King Charles showing President Biden some American artifacts from the royal collection. So, they're having quite an afternoon of it here in Windsor. And you've got that big, red carpet moment as well where President Biden was invited to inspect the Guard of Honor.

I mean when I was looking at those images from London and thinking about him going to Lithuania for this summit, I was thinking about how this experience gives Biden the kind of unique ability to thread a really tough needle on this issue. And you've had kind of universal praise from him from the Democrats and I think some Republicans who have acknowledged that this is kind of a role that maybe only Biden could do.And so I think as we head into the election, when age certainly, to your point, will be a concern, this is what the White House is going to try to pitch, that this is the positive of that age. That he has the experience and that he has been able to show that particularly on this issue. The question is whether voters are valuing that in the same type of way. You know, when we were talking to people about how they feel about Biden, there's no -- there wasn't dissatisfaction with his actions as president, it was a kind of implicit feeling, that they felt like he was supposed to be a bridge to a next generation and maybe that -- in running for re-election, that he's kind of breaking that promise, right? And so that has nothing to do with the facts or the substance of his actions. And I think that that's what you're really going to see as the tension for the next year. There's a real benefit to experiences they can specifically point to on something like Russia's war, but there's also going to be the question of whether voters are valuing that in the same way that the White House or diplomatic communities are who have given him kind of universal praise for the tough line that he's walked on this issue.",

For adults, the FDA usually says about 400 milligrams per day generally doesn't affect people.

So that's just to let people know about the situation, basically put out a warning and some information so that parents know about this. That is sort of a softer way of getting at the issue than actually taking any kind of enforcement action, which I'm hearing from experts is a much harder thing for the FDA to do here.
