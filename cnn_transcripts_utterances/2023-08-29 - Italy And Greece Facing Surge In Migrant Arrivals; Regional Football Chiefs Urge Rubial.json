They undertake treacherous journeys fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. This weekend, more than 4000 migrants arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa. A record for migrant arrivals by boat in a single weekend according to the Red Cross.And on Monday, two boats carrying migrants capsized. And you can hear their cries for help as rescuers throw them life preservers. Many of those on the boat were rescued but four children and one woman died in separate incidents. According to the U.N.'s refugee agency, more than 15,000 migrants have arrived in Greece this year. So, now let's go to CNN's Barbie Nadeau who has the latest developments on the migrant crisis in Italy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

More than 4000 people arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa in hundreds of small boats over the weekend. Among them pregnant women, babies and unaccompanied minors. It's the highest number of arrivals in a weekend this island has ever seen.More than 113,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat this year. That's more than the total number that arrived in all of 2022. There may be more migrant and refugee boats at sea, but there are fewer NGOs to rescue them. At the moment, the Italian government has sequestered three NGO ships for allegedly breaking a law set by Italy's right-wing government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni that mandates how many rescues a charity ship can carry out. Each of the sequestered ships will be docked for 20 days and fined up to 10,000 euro. 56 organizations have signed a petition against the government, accusing them of obstructing civilian search and rescue and warning that it will lead to more deaths. But the Italian government says without the rest of Europe helping they cannot manage the influx. ADOLFO URSO, ITALIAN MINISTER OF ENTERPRISE (through translator): Italy can't be left alone facing this extraordinary phenomenon. Italy is the gateway to Europe. Europe must intervene with us.",

But now days after FIFA provisionally suspended Rubiales from all football related activities at national and international levels, Spanish prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into a possible instance of \"sexual aggression.\" As protesters rallied in the streets, the Royal Spanish football federation called on Rubiales to resign after an emergency meeting desperate to steer away out of the crisis and prevent it from affecting Spain's vaunted football teams from playing in international games.In his hometown of Montreal, Rubiales' family rallied at church, his mother apparently on hunger strike to support her son. I think this massive lynching of an honest and loyal person is shameful, his cousin said. I know him perfectly well. And what he is going through is unfair. The incident has become more than a national scandal. It is now a rallying cry both for supporters of women's rights and for those who feel threatened by their demands. (END VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT: I think what's interesting about the statement that was put out by the Federation yesterday was a line where it said they had requested that EUFA, that the letter sent after Rubiales has refused to resign saying that Spain should be removed from European Championships and tournaments because the government was trying to Rubiales which would be -- which would mean that Spanish players wouldn't be playing in any European Games, which is really quite would have serious international repercussions. So, we're waiting to see how it will move forward, whether or not Rubiales would -- will resign. But I think one of the most important things here is that when he said he would not resign last week in that dramatic statement, there were a number of men who applauded him in that room. And it does seem based on the statement that came out from the Federation today that those men have now switched their support for him and are saying he should set stepped down as soon as possible, Rosemary.",

And this comes as the Kremlin tries to tamp down on Wagner's influence in the country and on foreign battlefields including Ukraine. Matthew Chance gives us the view from inside Russia.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Don't expect to see these scenes on Russian-state television. When it comes to the Wagner leader who challenged the Kremlin then died in a plane crash. There's a virtual media blackout on public grief. The Wagner supporters like Dimitri in Moscow are simply not being heard. Yevgeny Prigozhin is dead, he says. Just confirms that there are fewer and fewer of us. We really think about our country, our history and our goals. Prigozhin really showed everyone how it should be done he adds. Wagner did a great job, says Maria. And they are heroes of our country. But of course, everyone makes mistakes, she explains. But in Russia some mistakes can be fatal. The Kremlin is slammed as absolute lies. Allegations Prigozhin was killed for leading this abortive military uprising in June. But the fact his plane plunged to the ground two months after to the day has fueled suspicions. Many dank the official investigation would ever reveal state involvement. Already there were concerns at how quickly and carelessly. Evidence has been dragged from the crash scene. And when CNN visited Monday morning, it had already been flattened and cleared, just a small memorial to mark the spot. But the memory of the Wagner leader may not be so easily erased. All of us are angry at what happened, says this former military officer now running for political office in the Russian far east. We all considered Prigozhin our primary commander in the special military operation, he told crowds of mourners. Kremlin may not like it. But even in death, Russia's mercenary leader continues to strike a chord. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Because on one hand, obviously, she is trying to stabilize this economic relationship, trying to promote U.S. business interests. On the other hand, her agency, the commerce department, has been imposing a growing number of export controls, targeting China, especially in advanced computing and semiconductors. All of that greatly angering the Beijing leadership, including President Xi Jinping himself. So that's why Raimondo has been trying to tell Chinese officials that the export controls out of national security concerns account for only 1 percent of America's exports to China. So there's still a lot of room for growth and cooperation. But that kind of argument may not be very convincing to Chinese officials who simply don't believe there is much difference between derisking, as American officials have been emphasizing, and decoupling. But, of course, she is trying to focus on the positive. On Tuesday morning, she met up with the Chinese culture and tourism minister, obviously trying to revive a once booming sector of Chinese outbound travel to the United States. But, the one thing that is ironically helping her mission is the Chinese economy itself, facing its strongest headwinds in decades, with a myriad of problems. And that in the way has compelled Chinese officials to put on a more business friendly, investor friendly face. At least outwardly, allowing them to give their officials more wiggle room to work with Raimondo to stabilize this very important economic relationship, Rosemary.",
