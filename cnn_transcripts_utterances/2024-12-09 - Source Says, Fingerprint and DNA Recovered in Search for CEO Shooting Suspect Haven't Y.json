We begin this morning with the nationwide manhunt for a killer and we have a brand new development. Sources are telling CNN that DNA and a partial fingerprint so far have not matched anyone in law enforcement databases. The NYPD and FBI are searching for leads in last week's ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. These are the newest images of the suspect released by investigators. They come from a taxi just minutes after the deadly shooting on a Manhattan sidewalk. Police believe they found the gunman's backpack in Central Park. It contained monopoly money, but no weapon. And NYPD divers searched the lake in Central Park, did not find the handgun, nor have they located the bicycle he used to escape. Let's bring in CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. John, let's talk about your new reporting on the DNA and partial fingerprint. If there's no match in the database, what does that tell you? Is it because the suspect is so young that his DNA just might not be in any databases?",

They've extracted DNA from the phone, they've extracted DNA from a water bottle that they believe he left behind that they have him on video purchasing at a Starbucks, same with the power bar that they recovered. So, they have extracted DNA. It's been sent to the medical examiner's office, and preliminary results are not a match.However, there are more enhanced tests that can be done and we expect to hear more on that later this week. But as you know from past cases, assuming that it doesn't become a match in the national system, there are things that we've seen in other investigations where they take that DNA and they put it in some of the familial DNA databases, like 23andMe and others, and among those databases that are public, and see if it matches to family, relatives or others that may lead them to a suspect.",

Monopoly money in a bag that the killer would have presumed that police would find is probably him giving a sign of money as the driver and greed.The question that it begs, though, was all of this caution, with the masks and the hoods and trying not to show his face, concealing these things, is it because he just wanted to get away, or is it because he intends to strike again as he sends these messages?

Its brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, has fled to his longtime ally Russia, but even there, he can't escape the fallout. The rebel Syrian flag, take a look at this, was raised over the embassy in Moscow today. Syrians who lived under the fist of the Assad family's power and corruption for 50 years could be seen plundering the presidential office after it was abandoned. The U.S. says its troops in Syria are not in harm's way. The U.S. did hit multiple targets inside the country, though, to prevent extremists from grabbing certain areas.And let's get more on this dramatic upheaval in Syria. Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle joins us now. He co-chairs the Friends of a Free, Stable, and Democratic Syria Caucus in the House. Congressman, good to see you this morning. Just your thoughts on all of this and Bashar al-Assad fleeing to Moscow, do you think he's going to be brought to justice at some point? One would think that he's trying to avoid that by running off to Russia. REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA):  Well, it's good to be back with you, Jim. And I really have two thoughts after this extraordinary, only two-week period. The first is the hundreds, indeed over a thousand members of the Syrian diaspora who I've worked with for over a decade to see this moment achieved, many of whom have suffered tremendously in real atrocities at the hands of Assad and his family. My heart is with them in this moment and I share in their joy. My second thought, though, is that the work isn't over. And Syria's future is far from certain. So, the work needs to continue to make sure that we actually take advantage of this opportunity and truly build a free, stable, and democratic Syria and that a new Assad doesn't emerge.",

I have to tell you, for a long time, it was a pretty lonely group of us because this was the forgotten war in many ways. The half a million dead figure that is often cited in the media, that's from a U.N. report of about a decade ago. I mean, we were talking well into the millions who died in the Syrian -- what started out as a civil war, but really expanded beyond that.So, to go from what looked like a very difficult, if not impossible task, to then suddenly have Assad out within a couple weeks is truly breathtaking.",

And in Northeast Syria, ISIS has been defeated because of the SDF and the United States military. This speech and is actually welcome in the sense that he, number one, said no sectarianism anymore that Assad regime had, Christians and Muslims, Alawites and Sunnis all now have their country back. Number two, that Iran and Russia don't belong there, and that's a very true thing, and that makes the whole region much safer. And number three, is he himself has talked about, even in terms of HTS potentially dissolving, what's happening right now is governance.And if you look at Aleppo, which was liberated now, seven days ago, I was just on the phone with the bishop of Aleppo, who is the top Catholic in Syria, he said, Mouaz, we've never had this much electricity in the decades we've been under Assad. And we're decorating our neighborhoods for Christmas. When have we seen the Taliban or Isis or Al-Qaeda go in and have, you know, Christians not run away, but instead decorate for Christmas?

And Stephen Miller, who is Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff, has said that they're going to embark on a denaturalization program. So, I could be deported, my citizenship could be taken away, and my children could be deported because they have birthright citizenship.So, this is not what the country voted for. Let's be very clear. Americans voted for Trump because of groceries, because of lowering costs. He has not talked about that one bit. What this country did not vote for is to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants who do critical work for our economy, who have injected $7 trillion into our economy. And what Americans want is a solution to immigration. They want expanded legal pathways, and they do want more stronger, smart border security, which is exactly what Democrats are talking about. And Democrats have always been the ones willing to work with Republicans on a solution. And it's been Republicans that have always pulled the rug from under our feet.",
