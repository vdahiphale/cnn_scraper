Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley in New York and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Israel. Tonight, hopeful signs that aid could begin flowing into Gaza within hours. An Egyptian security official told CNN, the Rafah Border Crossing will open Friday morning. Volunteers and aid trucks are waiting along the Egyptian border. It comes after Israel agreed to let food, water, and medical supplies in from Egypt bowing to US and broader international pressure. The Rafah Crossing was in need of repair after being damaged in Israeli strikes. Now, the road to the Egyptian side is being prepared as dozens of trucks prepare to enter. Meanwhile, top Israeli officials have made comments indicating a ground offensive inside Gaza could now be imminent. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops they will soon see Gaza from the inside. Becky Anderson is in Tel Aviv for us tonight. Becky, let's focus in on that humanitarian aid convoy. I think Friday can't come soon enough. The question is, are those trucks safe when they cross the border if they indeed do so?",

Gaza, at least into the south. It's not clear those calls will be heeded with the Israeli military readying itself for the next phase of this war, and you've just reported what Gallant said earlier today. So, the safe delivery of humanitarian aid at least to those who have heeded these warnings to move south, to avoid this expected onslaught is an absolute priority. Now humanitarian groups say the aid set to enter Gaza on Friday is nowhere near enough. The WHO says people in Gaza must be allowed to have fuel for hospital generators, for power pumps, for hospital generators and ambulances. It hopes to see a hundred trucks of aid distributed every day, at least. President Biden when he described this deal that he had brokered when he left here yesterday said only that some 20 trucks would get in to start off with. Well, Sherif Abdelazim is the founder and chair of Resala Charity Association. He joins me now from Cairo, and as I understand it, sir, your organization has been collecting aid to send into Gaza.

Over here, what we're hearing is increasingly bellicose rhetoric from key officials, the Defense minister, the prime minister, as well as one of the top generals in the Israeli military. The clearest indication -- getting very clear indications from all three of them, that the next phase of this war is indeed going to involve a significant ground operation inside of Gaza, with the Israeli Defense minister saying effectively that the command is going to come for you to go into Gaza, as he spoke directly to IDF troops. Meanwhile, in Washington, President Biden is going to effectively continue to make his case and the American people for why the United States should continue to support Israel as it prepares for that ground invasion. But what the President is also going to be doing tonight is really trying to create, but also show the connective tissue between US support for Israel and its war against Hamas, as well as Ukraine in its war against Russia, and kind of trying to make an overarching thematic case for America's role in the world as President Biden sees it, and trying to tell Americans why these wars, why these conflicts should matter to them. And what that really means is why they should continue to send taxpayer dollars this way, and that is because President Biden is about to request over $100 billion from Congress for Ukraine aid for Israel's security assistance, as well as for several other matters, such as funding for the border in order to get political support from Republicans. But effectively, the president is going to be making the case to the American people directly so that Congress votes up that package and sends it to his desk, and so that much needed security assistance gets to both Ukraine, as well as Israel.",

She is an insider, she was with Donald Trump.

You make amends by coming clean and testifying. So perhaps that's a little touch by the DA there, it doesn't really matter much.

It's been yet another day where Hezbollah is making very, very targeted strikes, focusing on surveillance, communications and observation equipment on the Israeli side.

That's why a Palestinian rights group and a British legal organization have called on the U.K. to cut off arm sales to Israel. In a letter to the British trade secretary, they argue that Israel's actions have starkly demonstrated its flagrant disregard for international law, in clear violation of the prohibition on collective punishment, and the prohibition on starvation as a method of warfare. The U.K. is the second largest defense exporter in the world. Britain also makes 15 percent of the F-35 fighter jet that Israel is using to fight Hamas. But in the last decade, only a modest $627 million worth of arms export licenses were approved for Israel, U.K. is biggest defense recipient by far is Saudi Arabia. In 2020, the campaign against arms trade lost a court case challenging the government's approval of British arms exports to the kingdom with a long history of human rights abuses. That same campaign group now also backs cutting Israel off from British weapons.",

Now here in the United States, the war in Israel triggering tense debates on college campuses, an exchange of ideas, of course, nothing new to a university, nor a protests. But this conflict, however, has inflamed passions to the point where students and instructors are being disciplined and donors are threatening to withhold their support. Matt Egan is covering this story for us now from New York. Matt, just for an international audience, we should be clear that this is impacting some of the top universities in the country, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, which many people will, of course, recognize. And it comes down to concerns about anti-Semitism, the response from it, and some big donors around the country, not all Jewish to be clear, are threatening to withhold money.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely, Julia, I mean, tensions are definitely running high at some of these college campuses across thecountry. And again, as you mentioned, these are some Ivy League institutions. You know, there's often a debate over free speech at universities. But that debate has been turbocharged by a war that is very much still ongoing, and it's playing out in front of all of us on our television screens and our social media feeds. And so we have seen situation where there's been these student protests where some faculty have been punished university presidents, they're on the hot seat. And yes, some powerful donors are hitting schools where it hurts the most, their endowments. Now, the epicenter of this battle is at the University of Pennsylvania. And what's interesting is that the spark actually predates the attack by Hamas on Israel. The big controversy is over a Palestinian Literature Festival that took place on campus last month, and notably, university leaders, they were aware that some speakers at this event had a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. They went ahead anyway, hosted the event. And now we've seen some powerful donors either pulled back or threatened to pull back. In just the last few days, we've seen a billionaire Marc Rowan, the private equity executive. He has a cut off funding. So as former U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman, a hedge fund billionaire Cliff Asness, another billionaire, Ronald Lauder, he has threatened to do the same thing. Louder is the president of the World Jewish Congress. And he put out a statement where he said, quote, I have spent the past 40 years of my life fighting anti-Semitism around the world, and I never in my wildest imagination thought I would have to fight it at my University, my alma mater, and my family's alma mater. And a former Penn trustee quit in protest. He told me that he thinks that the University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill, needs to step down. He warned that donors are going to continue to pull their funding. Now for their part, the University of Pennsylvania, they have put out statements. They said that the university quote did not and emphatically does not endorse those speakers or their views. And the university has said that they're horrified by and condemn Hamas's attack on Israel. Julia, this debate over free speech and the need to call out hate is going to just continue as this war continues to play out.",

And it, you know, it's hard to see how universities can have a university presidents can survive a situation where they're losing support from very powerful donors. I mean, that is a problem for sure. But Julia, you also raise an interesting point over how much say some of these very wealthy donors should have over what happens at these schools. And at Harvard, we've seen a similar situation play out where after the attacks on Israel, there was this anti-Israel student letter that was put out. And that letter blamed Israel solely for the attacks by Hamas. And understandably, that created a backlash amongst some wealthy donors who were outraged not just by the letter, but by the university's response to the letter. So we had billionaire Bill Ackman come out and calling for naming and shaming some of these students, even though some of them had distanced themselves from this letter. And as you mentioned, that creates real safety issues as well. So Julia, no easy answers here. This debate will continue to rage on college campuses across the country.",
