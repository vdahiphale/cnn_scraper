That proposal that Israel set has terms that are far from meeting its demands. Well, talks are set to resume today in Cairo with mediators from Qatar, Israel and the U.S. included, and that includes CIA Director Bill Burns, looking to solidify a deal. Egypt, right now, of course, in two -- sort of squarely in two files. It is right on that crucial border where more than 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering, and it is underscoring how the talks that it is hosting in Cairo right now are directly related to what we are seeing on the ground in Rafah.The Foreign Ministry said and I quote, \"Egypt called on the Israeli side to exercise the utmost levels of restraint, and to stay away from a policy of brinkmanship that has long-term impact, and that would threaten the fate of the strenuous efforts made to reach a sustainable truce inside the Gaza Strip.\" Well, Egypt, of course, not the only country in the region calling on Israel to halt a looming offensive. Jordan's Foreign Minister, not mincing his words, tweeting earlier and I quote, \"Instead of giving negotiations on hostage release and ceasefire a chance, Israeli government occupied Rafah crossing and closed it to humanitarian aid to starve Gazans. Its attack on Rafah threatens another massacre. The Security Council must act firmly and immediately. Netanyahu must face real consequence.\" Well, Ayman Safadi, Jordan's Foreign Minister, joins me now live from Washington. And Foreign Minister, myself and certainly many others around this region where I am went to sleep last night hoping that there was finally some moves to secure a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, only to wake up to Israeli troops on the ground in Rafah occupying that crucial border crossing. I just want to get your reaction to the images that we are seeing out of Rafah today. And just to let our viewers know you are, as we speak, in Washington.",

The whole world is saying the Rafah operation shouldn't have happened. Indeed, Israel's biggest supporter, the United States, is saying that Rafah operation should not happen. But again, the reality is Netanyahu is defying the whole world, is throwing even his allies under the bus and continuing with actions that are hurting all prospects for a ceasefire, dragging the region further into the abyss, and again, causing another humanitarian catastrophe. I think it is time the whole world realize that Netanyahu has got tobe stopped. Statements and urging is not going to do it. It is time Netanyahu face consequences. That is the moment.

His Majesty was very clear and warning against the horrific consequences of an attack on Rafah and also of the devastating impact of Israel continuing with its war and not allowing for all of us to come together and try and create the peace that would address Israel's concerns and Palestinians' rights.

We all support the deal. It is -- it must happen. Both sides are going to have to realize that this deal is a must, get the hostages out, released, get a ceasefire and stop this massacre. But again, I think it is wrong. Morally, legally, it is unacceptable for Netanyahu to leverage the killing of other thousands of Gazans to get the deal. He needs to negotiate, negotiate in earnest. And again, the mediators are working extremely hard, have been working nonstop to try and get that deal.So, there are parameters that everybody agrees on. At least the mediators say that there are sufficient details need to be worked out and that's what negotiations are for. So, again, our negotiations should continue in earnest. Israel should negotiate, stop the attack on Rafah, and give the mediators the chance to get that deal and get us to calm that should ultimately lead to a permanent ceasefire.",

Israel hasn't changed its strategic goals this past seven months. He also said, and I quote him here, Foreign Minister, \"The work of political persuasion on the political front is becoming more difficult.\" Do you understand that to be a statement directed to Washington?

Netanyahu is vetoing all this effort. He is making sure that no efforts to bring an end to this war succeeds. And if I may, Becky, today, this morning, a convoy of aid moving out of Jordan to Erez was attacked by radical settlers, the same settlers who rampaged Palestinian villages with impunity. Israel is legally responsible to protect that convoy and it did not. It turned out those settlers to vandalize it, and it does so at the same time when it's closer to the Rafah and Kerem Shalom points and stop it from coming into the Palestinians with terrorists warning that Gaza is running out of fuel, or facing that risk of running that fuel tonight.So, that all should speak to the fact that Israel is just continuing with its aggression, violating international law, continuing with its siege on Palestinians and not listening to anybody, and dragging the whole region into war. How can Israel justify attacking an aid convoy that it promised to secure on its own -- with its own forces? And it did not. So, this is a despicable crime that must be condemned by the whole world, and must bring alarm to the whole international community that Israel will just continue to do what this -- to do what it wants to do, in defiance of the will of the international community. And it's time that the Security Council, the whole international community, acted firmly, effectively use all its legal tools to prevent this Israeli government from committing further crimes, further violation of international law, and starving more people. And again, all that Israeli government is saying about allowing for Palestinians in Rafah to be relocated is just unacceptable. The U.S. itself, that it has not seen a plan for that. What Israel is doing is people who have already lost their homes, displaced into shelters that do not have the basic requirements of life, now it wants to displace them again, under the bombing that continues to wreck their lives. So, that is the reality. It is time the world said enough, and act to stop an Israeli governments from further crimes and further escalation.",

But, that is what negotiations are for. And the U.S. is a mediator in this deal. And I'm sure that the three parties working to provide this deal would do what is required to convince those -- the two parties that the commitments that are being made would be respected.But again, we have an opportunity here that would get the hostages out, get a ceasefire. Netanyahu needs to engage, engage in earnest, and if he does not stop the aggression on Rafah, he is jeopardizing that deal. And he is, again, pushing the region further into escalation. That is what we should all be focused on.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, you were just talking about the word whiplash, and just think of what we have seen over the last 36 hours or so. Yesterday morning started with thousands of leaflets being dropped in eastern Rafah, directing about 100,000 civilians to leave that area. We then had the Hamas proposal, basically saying that they had agreed to a ceasefire. We then later learned that it was not the same ceasefire proposal that Israel had tacitly agreed to with Egypt. And then we saw Israeli tanks rolling into Rafah overnight, taking over that key Rafah border crossing.And today, the Israeli military now says that they have operational control of that Rafah border crossing. It's not clear how long they intend to stay at that Rafah border crossing and maintain that control for now. They say that this military operation is still ongoing. The Palestinian health officials say that 23 people, including six children, were killed in this military operation overnight, as the Israeli military not only rolled in with tanks and troops, but also pummeled the area with airstrikes and artillery, it would seem. We saw those explosions lighting up the night sky last night, and today we are seeing the damage that has resulted. But, ultimately, this is also a story about the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the impact that this military operation may have on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. We've heard the UN Secretary General in just the last couple of hours laying out those concerns, sounding the alarm that if this Rafah border crossing remains closed, and if the Kerem Shalom crossing, which is also closed at this stage, if those remain closed for much longer, you will start to see impacts on the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. These are the two critical points for the entry of that aid. And right now, both of those crossings are closed. Both of those crossings are now controlled by the Israeli military as well. So, enormous potential ramifications if this continues. And in the backdrop of all of this, of course, as you and Becky were just discussing, there will be these ongoing negotiations. Hamas and Israel still very far apart, particularly on this notion of a permanent ceasefire emerging in the second phase of this agreement. A lot of ground to be made up here, and unclear exactly how they will bridge that gap. Rahel.",

Now, one of the prosecution's major witnesses, the woman at the very center of their case, Stormy Daniels, is now on the stand. Now, attorneys for both sides huddled with the judge back and forth about Daniels' credibility before testimony began today. Judge Juan Merchan ruled that the adult film actress can testify about allegedly having sex with the former President, but he pointed out that we don't need to know the details. Fair enough. Despite the very real threat of jail time issued by the judge yesterday, Trump posted a message on his Truth Social platform today about the next witness in the trial, then deleted it. We've got a lot to talk about here.I'm joined now by criminal defense attorney Bernarda Villalona. She is a former New York prosecutor. Now, look, for the viewers, over the course of today, obviously we've been following Stormy Daniels' testimony. She has largely been testifying about her background growing up, kind of how she first met Donald Trump at the time and some of their initial interactions. It's not like prosecutors jumped right into the hush money aspect of all this. But, what is the significance of someone like Stormy Daniels to the actual prosecution's case here? BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, &amp; FORMER NEW YORK PROSECUTOR: So, interesting. The prosecution, legal-wise, there wasn't a necessity to call Stormy Daniels because she doesn't add to any of the elements of falsifying business records. So, there was no need to call her. However, optics-wise, that's the reason to call her because this case is all about the background help. It started with Stormy Daniels about this alleged relationship between Stormy Daniels and Trump. So, if the prosecution didn't call her, then the defense would have been arguing to the jury, wait, this case is about Stormy Daniels. You didn't hear from her. You didn't hear from her because this is all lies. And because you didn't hear from her, you can sense a piece of reasonable doubt and you should find Donald Trump now guilty. Also, the prosecution called her in order to avoid maybe a missing witness charge where the judge may have given to the jury that the reason legally didn't call her is because she had something positive to say for the defense. Either way, Judge Merchan would not have granted that. Interestingly enough, even though the prosecutor doesn't have to prove that there was a sexual relationship between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels, by proving or putting evidence out there, credible evidence that they were in a relationship, contradicts the character and credibility of Donald Trump. Because remember, already in evidence, there is already posted video where he says these women are lying. This is all made up. This never happened.",

But, I don't think you can necessarily separate all of these things from the moment that he is speaking in. And at the end of the day, when you talk about college protests and when you talk about unrest in the United States, the real hope inside the White House is that a hostage deal that would include a temporary ceasefire could lower the temperature, could eventually cause tensions to cool when it comes to this anger that the President has been confronting, not just in college campuses, but really everywhere he goes.The Rafah operation that Israel appears to be commencing over the last several days would complicate that, and could potentially aggravate the situation in Gaza even more. We do know that President Biden spoke yesterday with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He, according to White House officials, made very clear where he stands on this Rafah issue, which is that Israel should not go in unless there is a credible plan to protect the more than million Palestinian civilians who are sheltering there. So, even if he does not speak about this specifically and directly in the speech, I don't think you can separate what the President says today from the larger moment that he is speaking against. And it is a very fragile moment. This has been sort of one of the biggest sort of junctures that the White House has seen in this conflict in the seven months since it began. And certainly, President Biden, I think, will have that in the back of his mind as he is delivering this address. SOLOMON: And Kevin, you mentioned some of the pushback and some of the backlash he is getting from Republicans about not being stronger. But, I'm curious. I mean, this is obviously Holocaust Remembrance Day where we remember the horrors of the Holocaust. But, the President has also faced backlash from the more progressive wing of his party because of what's happening in Gaza. And so, when you talk about the fine line that he has to walk, I mean, it is -- it can't get any finer.",

Certainly, when the U.S. President speaks, all eyes tend to watch it really closely, and perhaps none more than this moment, the UN Secretary General saying that this was a critical opportunity in this war and things are moving in the wrong direction.

I think that it is -- there is undoubtedly antisemitism that has flowed from these college campus protests, demands that Jews go back to Poland, discussions of pro- genocide versus anti-genocide Jewish students. These are things that send shivers down the spine of American Jews, rightfully so. So, I think the President really needs -- has an opportunity here to take a very, very strong stand on this type of activity. You can speak out against anti-Jewish hatred as well as be critical of the way in which the Israelis have undertaken their military operations.
