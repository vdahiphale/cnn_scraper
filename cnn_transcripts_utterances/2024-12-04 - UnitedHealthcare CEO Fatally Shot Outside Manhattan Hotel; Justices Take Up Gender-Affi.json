And want to hear him discuss in length and in public about these allegations of misconduct, the sexual assault allegation, which he denies, as well as what happened at the time when he ran that veterans group several years ago in which the New Yorker reported about misconduct -- personal misconduct, drunkenness on the job and the like.So Hegseth, behind the scenes, has been denying those allegations, and that has alleviated some concerns. But some members still, like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, says she does not know how she'll ultimately vote if and when that time comes. Now, there's also discussion about whether there will be a replacement. Donald Trump, we're told, has been looking at possible replacement candidates in case Hegseth's nomination collapses. One of them, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, that's someone who, in fact, some Democrats are signaling they could be open to supporting if that nomination comes forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: I'm considering voting yes on DeSantis if he finally admits that he has lifts in his boots. I'm sure he does. Maybe three inches, four inches, at least. SEN. MARK KELLY, (D) ARIZONA: He's a, you know, governor of one of our biggest states. He served in Congress. He's, you know, served in the military. So I think he has what you would look at on paper as the requisite kind of experience you would want in the Secretary of Defense. SEN.

And before the video, we heard some of those characteristics from law enforcement officials and law enforcement sources about the timing of this incident, about the amount of time that the suspect was able to get there before the CEO walks by. So a lot of reconnaissance, a lot of understanding of where he would be.And as you look at the video itself, you see him behind that black suburban over on the left side. He steps out, he puts the gun up. It's on target, and then he fires. And as that video continues to play out, we're not going to show that part, obviously, because that is extremely graphic, seeing the CEO go down. But what we see is that the suspect continually racks the slide on that weapon that continues to cycle it. He has a suppressor at the end of that weapon, we're told, which would muffle the sound. That obviously is something that people would use if they want to do a shooting and not draw any attention to themselves. So a lot of sophistication there. And then at one point, you actually see the gun on this video, the part that we're not showing, it actually jams. And he goes through essentially a clearing drill, something that those of us in law enforcement and the military do, where you prepare for an instance where you may have to be in a gunfight and your gun jams, which is not, you know, that uncommon. But you have to quickly, immediately get that malfunction resolved, the gun back up on target. We see guys in this video. That's exactly what the suspect does. So a lot of a -- some level of sophistication that we can see there. This doesn't look like in any sense that it was random. And so then the question comes down to motivation, a lot of questions that authorities are trying to answer. Were there threats against this individual? Were there people out there who may have had some type of grievance against him? A lot of investigative work that they're doing in that regard as well.",

Understanding that New York City is blanketed by surveillance. Andthen understanding how they're actually going to flee, how they're going to get away. And you're spot on, you know, indicating there that this is someone who appeared, who appeared to have that planned out because he has still evaded police. One thing I'll point out, though, the one thing that that shooter cannot control is what that firearm left behind. There is a sophisticated gun tracing ability that law enforcement has where they can go through various steps. Anytime you fire a weapon, two things happen. You'll have the shell casing that's ejected, you'll have the bullet that comes out of the front of the gun. In this case, it's essentially like a fingerprint. Firearms leave individual unique markings on both the bullet and the shell casing. And so analyzing those, I imagine, you know, NYPD, they're obviously very proficient, but this is expertise also that agencies like the ATF could assist with to look to see what were those unique markings. And then I understand this is grim, but actually finding the bullets themselves, sometimes law enforcement will, you know, have to pull those from a victim, but they do that analysis and then run those through those databases to see is this a firearm that we know has been used in a past crime that's known to law enforcement? That could be key here. But again, this person was obviously sophistic. We don't know if this was a weapon that would have been used in a crime.
