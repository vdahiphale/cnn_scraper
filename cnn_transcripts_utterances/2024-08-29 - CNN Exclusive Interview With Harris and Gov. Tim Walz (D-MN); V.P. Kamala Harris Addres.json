I mean, but I think we should think about the difference that in context between 2019 and now, it wasn't just that it was off the cuff that was the problem. It was that the 2019 primary was one that had so many litmus tests about very specific kind of progressive, moderate policy questions that I think really caused her to feel torn between a lot of situations. And we had a lot of things that she ended up having to roll back the next day.Against Donald Trump, there is an ability for her to be focused on kind of consistent Democratic messaging and I think that allows a greater comfort and ease that we saw play out today.",

And so she talks about the things that she had to do, which is not banning fracking. I think that she answered that question very well. I also don't think that the progressive left, particularly those who care about climate, will balk at that issue. Maybe they will, we're not, they're not a monolith, but because Joe Biden has been one of the best presidents in our history on climate. So it is a yes and.

Dana asked her if she had anything to say about what they did for three and a half years leading up until the back and forth this year, completely sidestepped, did not answer it. She goes back to her time as attorney general. But, again, absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing, no responsibility, no reflection at all on the day one executive actions or anything else they did for three and a half years, or anything she said in her previous campaign, which was to have the most permissive immigration structure.

You and you gave sort of the progressive interpretation of what you heard. What I think she's saying is that any immigration policy has to include as part of it, not in order to mollify Republicans, but as a matter of public policy, has to include strong, enforceable borders.

She's changed enough positions and folks have really supported even within that.But I would say, from my voter perspective or talking to like folks about how they're making these decisions, it's not as if it is -- it's not as if no one gets that Kamala Harris has changed positions from then to now. It's that the change in the positions doesn't feel as drastic as the person she's across from. So, it is up to Donald Trump to make a substantive, based argument about why this matters in a way we have not seen him do or seen the ability for him to do in that time. So, I guess it's like if this was happening in isolation, I do think it would be fair to ask Harris what has changed between now and then. I remember asking her this when I interviewed her in 2019 on criminal justice reform, because a lot of the things that she concluded in her plan to run for president, I think she did not support as attorney general. And I remember saying, what has changed? And there was an answer that was something, you know, about the politics of somewhat changed. And that wasn't the language specifically. I don't want to say that, but it was, and it was the winds have kind of changed. I think that's happening from then to now also, and they're trying to make that values consistency. I don't think, I don't think that's a bad argument. I think people have a sense of understanding of those values.

You're exactly right, that kind of moment where -- look, it wasn't as if it was a surprise in the instant that it happened. A lot of people weren't sure that the president was going to finally decide, you know what, I'm out of here. But obviously we remember the pressure was mounting. We do know that from our reporting that just in case -- she was not doing anything, but just in case some of the people who are in the Kamala Harris orbit were just kind of getting everything ready just in case it happened. But that was a human moment. You know, this is a man who took her out of the United States Senate, made her his running mate. She made history with that. And he was giving her some pretty big news about himself, and then, of course, it was off to the races for her to try to do something even more historic to be the president, but also just with regard to the campaign process to scramble to secure the nomination, which wasn't really -- if you remember, Abby, it wasn't really set in stone that she was going to get it as quickly as she did. We weren't sure what the process was, but she sewed it up in about 24 hours.
