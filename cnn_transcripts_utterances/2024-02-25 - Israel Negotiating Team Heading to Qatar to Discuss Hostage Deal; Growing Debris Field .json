Well, in two next month, but look, according to my conversations with Donald Trumps campaign, they are really hoping that his big win last night means that some of the holdout Republican voters, as well as the holdout donors, will flock to his campaign. And also hopefully put more pressure on Nikki Haley to ultimately bow out. Now, last night, as he was taking the stage after his win, he had a very different tune than we saw after he won in New Hampshire. New Hampshire, he used those remarks to really sharply go after Haley, something that I know from my conversations with his advisers, they were not very happy about. But last night, he was a different person. He got up there. He was very congratulatory, hit his remarks or attacks really only focused on Joe Biden and then he didn't even mentioned Nikki Haley's -- Nikki Haley's name once. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now, there's this spirit that I have never seen. We ran to great races, but there's never been ever -- there's never been a spirit like this, and I just want to say that I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now.

I know that they've had trouble doing that in the past and in their conversations with him as they've tried to encourage him to ignore that.But I also just want to quickly point your attention to something I've been picking up from his campaign, which is that even though Donald Trump is already been shifting to more general election rhetoric on the campaign trail over the last several weeks now, now that they won South Carolina, they really want to start shifting the campaign itself and the campaign apparatus toward a general election as well. That means targeting some of those crucial battleground states like Michigan and Arizona, and Georgia. And also focusing a lot of efforts on more fundraising, something we know Donald Trumps campaign isn't necessarily struggling with, but they are struggling with finances given his mounting legal bills. So that's something that they're going to be putting a lot of time and energy into and really looking beyond the primary and to that general election rematch with Joe Biden -- Victor, Amara.",

And then come January, they did it again, kick the can down the road up until this coming Friday, which is going to be the first of two deadlines on March 1st deadline and a March 8 deadline, and they still don't have a deal between the House Republicans and the Senate Democrats. Now, Johnson and Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, had been negotiating for some time to try to figure out whether they can ink another deal. Johnson suggested in a conference call on Friday that they may have yet another short-term extension of funding and that could prompt serious blowback within his right flank. In fact, Johnson said two times ago that they will not be any more short-term extensions of government funding instead, to extend the government funding until the end of the current fiscal year ends at the end of September. But Congress has been unable to pass any of its 12th annual funding bills which is leading to the situation that were in right now, a dispute over some of the policy provisions that Republicans want to be included in your Democrats say there should not be certain policy restrictions in place against the over the Biden administrations actions, all of which is raising some questions about how do they get out of this mess again?

A key meeting happening in Paris on Friday with Israeli officials meeting with American, Egyptian and Qataris. And the Israeli prime minister last night saying that his negotiating team is actively working to obtain another outline for the release of hostages, basically working to try and see if they can agree on a framework for this deal and then work out the details and begin to actually implement it.The national security adviser of Israel Tzachi Hanegbi saying yesterday that the negotiators didn't come back empty handed, that there was a positive tone from the meeting and that it will be possible in his view to actually move forward with these negotiations. And we now understand that an Israeli negotiating team is going to be heading to Qatar to continue those talks. So a lot -- a lot of sense of optimism here, but we should be clear that nothing is agreed to until this deal is actually set in stone and actually can move forward. And the Israeli prime minister is also making clear that even as they push forward those intensive negotiations, even as there does appear to be some progress, he is still preparing for what he has said will come if there is no hostage which deal. And that is a major Israeli military offensive into Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah where about 1.5 million Palestinians are currently sheltering. The Israeli cabinet is set to convene to discuss those operational plans, which will also include plans to evacuate civilians from Rafah. All we haven't heard the details of those negotiations. But meanwhile, this war is very much still continuing. Over the last 24 hours alone, at least 86 Palestinians have been killed, 131 injured, bringing the total number of those killed very close to that 30,000 mark, which -- of which we're told the majority are indeed women and children. So even as the negotiations continue, the military operations are very much continuing as well.",
