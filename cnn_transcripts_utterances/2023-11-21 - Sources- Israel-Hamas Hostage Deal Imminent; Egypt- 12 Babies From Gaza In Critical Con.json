They have seen the different parameters that have been discussed, and they have waited and watched to see whether their loved ones would be part of this exchange. And even still tonight, as I spoke just a few hours ago, with the families of people who have -- with people who have family in Gaza, notably children in Gaza and therefore could likely benefit from this deal. They still don't know whether their family members, their -- these children will be part of that deal.I spoke in particular with the family of Sherry Bebas (ph), her cousin, Sherry Bebas (ph) was taken hostage with her two young children who are 10 months old and four years old. And her cousin you Ifat Zeiler (ph) told me tonight, we want to hold them in our arms and then I'll be able to save their home. But until that happens, she doesn't want to get her hopes up too high that her family will be part of this latest deal.",

Is there any place they can go? And she said, I can't -- I can't think of one. I just wonder, as you look at the situation now, what can be done to protect the lives of the children left behind?",

What we can do and we must do and will continue to do as UNICEF is to ask for a humanitarian ceasefire, so that the weapons are put down, the bomb stop, the bullets stop and children have a break and can receive the supplies they so desperately need. Most of them are suffering for over a month now. They've been traumatized by seeing their homes being destroyed their loved ones dying in front of their eyes, nearly 2,000 of them are under, under the rubble. So, we don't know how many of these children will actually survive. And they're lacking water, they're lacking food, they're lacking medical supplies and services. They are, you know, staying in the dark. Oftentimes when telecommunications go down, and things happen on the ground. It's a nightmare for them. It's a relentless nightmare for them.

So, they can maybe go to sleep without hearing the sounds of bombs or wondering whether they would be alive the day after.So, we welcome very much any, any humanitarian pause, any, any ceasefire, even if temporary. So, more supplies can come in. Three hundred trucks is a lot. But let's remember, it used to be 500 before October 7th, and even then it was not really meeting all the needs.
