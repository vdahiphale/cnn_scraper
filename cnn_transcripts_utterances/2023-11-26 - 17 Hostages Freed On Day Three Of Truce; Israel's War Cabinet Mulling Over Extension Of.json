Thank you very much for being with us.We are continuing with our breaking news coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. A nightmare that began seven weeks ago has finally ended for several Israeli families. Today a third group of hostages was finally released from the Gaza Strip. In just the past few hours, we've watched as they arrived at hospitals in Israel to be reunited finally with their loved ones. And for the first time tonight, we are also seeing some of those emotional moments. Families inside hospitals finally embracing after weeks of heartbreak and uncertainty. These are 13 of the 14 Israeli hostages released today, women and children. 13 of them ranging in age from 4 to 84 years old. There was a 14th Israeli who was also a Russian national, and then three more foreign nationals also freed today, bringing the total to 17. Today we saw the first successful release of a young American hostage. This was 4-year-old Abigail Edan. She turned 4 while in captivity just a few days ago. Her parents were killed by Hamas on October 7th. President Joe Biden has spoken with her family tonight. He says he's hopeful that the four-day truce can be extended to allow more hostages to be released. Kaitlan, I can't help but think that as we see these reunions, these joyful moments between parents reuniting with their children, specifically the one between Tom and Emily Hand yesterday, that Abigail is not going to have that. She's coming out, and she has to learn that both of her parents were killed and go on with her life. And of course there is a family that is so ready to welcome her back.",

They actually thought that their younger sister had been killed because she was in her father's arms when he was killed. They went and hid in their home. She ran covered in her father's blood to a neighbor's home. And then they were kidnapped into Gaza.And it just -- it speaks to, you know, the word bittersweet doesn't really do it justice, but that is what this moment is for so many of these hostages who are returning home, who are going to hospitals and undergoing these medical evaluations. A lot of them are learning for the first time the full scope of what happened today, whether their loved ones were killed or if they knew that they had been killed because they were killed in front of them, as was the case for Adina Moshe, one of the hostages, that I spoke to her family in recent days. Her husband was buried while she was being held captive. She did not get to go to his funeral. And so you just see moments like that, and it just speaks to the bittersweet nature of all of this. And the question is whether or not there are going to be more hostages brought home after this four-day truce is over, if it's extended. We are now hearing from Hamas for the first time saying they do want to extend that deal. That is not something we had heard from the group so far. But tonight a source does tell me that Israel's War Cabinet here in Tel Aviv has been discussing that possibility. It's not clear where it will end up yet. But as part of this four-day pause that is taking place right now, the one that is under way, an additional 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, they were released from Israeli jails today. You saw this moment in the West Bank as they are being welcomed back by their families. Also part of this pause, more than 100 trucks carrying desperately needed aid like food and baby formula arrived in Gaza, in north Gaza, today. I want to bring in CNN's chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance. Matthew, you were outside the hospital earlier. Can you just kind of set the scene of what you saw as we've kind of watched this process take place now three times?",

And they get that for the rest of their lives. Now it's not much in Israel to live on, but, you know, for people from Thailand, people from the Philippines that do often near kind of agricultural laboring jobs in this country, I mean, that will make a significant difference. And so, you know, this is something. It's a way for Israel to try and sort of, in part, compensate for what they've been through here.",

For more on what is happening, though, as we are now entering what is going to be the final stage of what has been agreed to so far, this temporary truce is the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus. Lieutenant Colonel, it's good to have you on the program again. I just want to first ask you about this request that we are now seeing Hamas weigh in, I guess I should say, on this idea of extending the truce beyond four days when it's set to expire tomorrow. Does that seem like that's likely now that Hamas is saying it also is on board with extending it? LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Hi, Kaitlan. Thank you for having me again. It's part of the agreement. It's part of the terms that there is this option to extend the pause in return for 10 live -- at least 10 live Israelis per day, and there is room for that in the agreement then that may happen. I have read the reports and I've heard the statements made by the prime minister's office. And of course the IDF will be ready to facilitate that. And as we maintain our readiness to continue operations all over Gaza, we, of course, wait for orders from the Israeli cabinet and having another day of no hostilities in return for 10 Israeli live hostages is, of course, a good deal.",

By the way, they lied about the fact, you know, they've violated the terms of the agreement.They were supposed to not split families, but they released a young Israeli girl, a teenage girl, and they kept her mother Raaya in their captivity. And when we asked about it, they said, well, no, we don't know where she is, only that the daughter tells that they were together up until two days before the release, and they were together the entire time. So we know that Hamas lies. We know that they will try to manipulate and create a difficult situation here. And we're ready to continue fighting. In terms of the other women here, you know, there's female soldiers, and there's women civilians -- COLLINS: Can I ask you -- Lieutenant Colonel, can I ask you? I do want to follow up on that, though, because you're talking about Hila Rotem, and she was separated from her mom.

He lives in Gaza with his family and he told me that people there are hoping that the current truce may lead to a permanent cease-fire but many fear it's only a matter of time before the fighting starts again.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOUSEF HAMMASH, NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL: People are really hoping and looking for an extending for this truce or this humanitarian pause and looking Gazan authority to reach a permanent cease-fire. But if you look to the people reaction for that, they are feeling lost, and all Gazans are hoping to get any sort of news to extend another few days of humanitarian pause, or it might lead for a cease-fire. We lived these three days, and tomorrow we're going to live the fourth day. But we're preparing ourselves that we might die in the fifth day. That's the situation in Gaza. This is for the first time since seven weeks we were able to walk safely in the streets, sleep safely, be in the streets without having that feeling that you might get bombed at any second. And that's what's going to make it really hard for people to go back into this cycle of violence because even for three days now, people have tasted the sense of safety. A lot of people were using this opportunity to reach for other people who are in the north or Gaza city to check if their house is still there or have been destroyed.

It's completely madness, the amount of bombardment, the amount of explosives that have been thrown into Gaza is unimaginable. We were having like an earthquake continue for seven weeks. We were living in earthquake. Our houses were shaking for seven weeks. We were completely disconnected during the bombardment and during this seven weeks, we have been disconnected a few times. We were even disconnected from each other. You don't know what happened the next street because there's no radio, no communication, no internet.

This comes after Hamas released a statement saying similar, that it supported the idea.Joining us now to discuss this and more are CNN military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied commander General Wesley Clark and former State Department Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller. Thank you both for joining me this evening. General Clark, I want to start with you. Even if this pause is extended, and we're starting to hear positive noises really from all parties, we do expect Israel to start its military operations again. Do you think that the United States is increasing its pressure on how Israel's military should conduct its activities going forward given this extraordinary level of death and destruction that we've seen? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think there's a lot of pressure on Israel not only from the United States but from others to somehow contain the level of destruction. Go after Hamas. Do it in some other way. Somehow get rid of the problem, but don't kill so many. Don't damage, don't destroy Gaza the way you've destroyed it. That pressure is real. It's on Israel, and the Israeli military is well aware of it and trying to implement it. But that's a very tall order.

Now it depends on how this is resolved obviously.If it's resolved and Hamas is the big loser, then Hezbollah may be deterred. If Hamas comes out of this as a hero for having blunted the Israelis, survived, released Palestinians, and raises its prestige all over the Palestinian cause, well, that incentivizes Hezbollah to follow suit, and the Israelis are going to be watching this very closely. They do not want to do anything that incentivizes Hezbollah to try to imitate Hamas in this. So this fear is not over. What this pause indicates, Alex, is that these groups all communicate. They understand pain. It's a system. It's a way of putting maximum pressure on Israel. Take the hostages, prove your power, and show through global pressure that Israel cannot effectively respond.
