But behind the scenes, it seems to be one step forward, two steps back. We'll go live to Tel Aviv with the latest. Then, a CNN exclusive. Ukraine's military spy chief speaks about the state of the war and those rumors of a rift between President Zelenskyy and his top general. And some of the world's most powerful tech CEOs are told their platforms suck by U.S. lawmakers. There's a fiery hearing on the Capitol today, looked into online child safety, we'll have all the details coming up. But we begin with the growing hopes for a deal that could secure the return of hostages in Gaza and bring Palestinians at least some temporary relief from the months of relentless bombardment. Hamas is reviewing a proposal for a six-week truce said to have been hammered out by negotiators in Paris. It's a basic framework and there are still many obstacles. But today, Israel's Prime Minister met with families of hostages and said, a real effort is being made to bring their loved ones home. The framework deal has three phases. The first would see the release of civilian hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Netanyahu is flatly rejecting Hamas' demands to end fighting and completely withdraw Israeli troops from Gaza. Well, I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who joins us now live from Tel Aviv. Good to have you there for us, Jeremy. So, it's almost four months into this war in Gaza, and of course, you know, the horrific terror attack. I do want to play some sound from a mother whose son was taken during the Hamas terror attack. Shelly Shem-Tov says she hasn't seen her son since he went to that music festival, and she spoke to our Clarissa Ward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHELLY SHEM-TOV, MOTHER OF OMER SHEM-TOV: We are tired. But we are doing everything. It's our mission of our life to bring my son back home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But these can be some of the most difficult moments for these families when you are seeing so much momentum, when you are seeing these reports about what could be the potential next deal to release their loved ones, that can sometimes be the most difficult because they see different reports. They're not quite sure what to believe, what's real, what's simply a fig leaf. But in this case, there is no question that there has been some real momentum, the most momentum that we have seen since that last truce to release hostages fell apart in early December. And the Israeli Prime Minister today telling the families of some hostages that he is committed in the fullest sense of the word, to securing their release. But yesterday, he also made clear that he has several red lines. He said that he will not see the release of thousands of what he called Palestinian terrorists in exchange for these hostages. And he also said that he is very much committed to achieving not only the release of these hostages, but the second objective of this war, which is to see Hamas removed from power in Gaza and dismantled as an organization. Those were the two objectives of the war that he set out, and he made clear that this war will not end until they are released. And so, there is still -- despite this broad framework that was reached between Israel, the United States, Egypt and Qatar over this past weekend during this summit in Paris, there still remains an enormous gap between the Israeli position and Hamas' position, as Hamas has been seeking a permanent ceasefire in order to release the remaining hostages.",

Israel claims some of its employees were involved in the horrific terror attack carried out by Hamas. Those employees have been stood down. A growing number of countries is stopping funding this U.N. agency as a result of that. I understand you spoke to the UNRWA head of health. What can you tell us about that discussion? HAJ-HASSAN: I don't need to tell you anything about that particular discussion. What I can tell you is that UNRWA is completely essential. It is the biggest humanitarian provider in Gaza. The Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council said a few days ago, all of us combined, every single humanitarian organization combined, all of us combined are not even close to bringing what UNRWA is for the people of Gaza. So cutting UNRWA funding is cutting a lifeline. It's last nail in the coffin for a community that is completely like living at catastrophic levels of suffering.

And those changes do signal that lower interest rates are likely on the way eventually. Now, let me draw your attention to a key line that was inserted into the very closely watched statement that the Fed put out, that officials wrote, \"The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent. Let me translate that Fed speak for you. Officials are basically saying, yes, interest rates are likely going lower. But no, it may not be imminent. This may not happen in the next meeting in March. Another line that was added here by Fed officials say that they believe that the risks of achieving their inflation and employment goals, they've come in better balance. Previously, they were all worried about inflation. Now, they're saying we have to be concerned about jobs as well. Now, big picture, Lynda, this is a big test for the Fed. They've got to get this just right because if they start cutting interest rates too soon, that could actually boost demand, right? If it's cheaper to borrow, then it's going to lift demand for houses and for cars and for appliances, and that could actually make inflation worse. But if they wait too long, then they could put too much pressure on the economy, and that could actually cause the recession that they have been trying to avoid. They've got to get this just right. And so, starting now, actually, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, he's going to be taking questions from reporters, and we're going to be listening very closely to what he says about exactly when they're going to start cutting interest rates and what it's going to take for them to start doing that.",

They, for the past two plus years, have pretty much just talked about this issue but failed to take any real action. It does feel like that is changing a little bit. There was certainly an effort in this hearing today to gain some momentum behind some of the legislative proposals that could hold these companies accountable. They talked a lot about the Kids Online Safety Act, the STOP CSAM, Child Sexual Assault Material Act, and potentially repealing Section 230, which is this really important shield law that protects these companies from being held accountable for content that users post on their platforms. These CEOs were pressured to endorse these bills. In many cases, they did not agree to do that. But it does feel like the lawmakers are finally, at a point, there's bipartisan agreement here, which is really rare, as we know, where they want to take action. For me, the big question is we heard so many different proposals here. Will lawmakers, after this hearing, actually be able coalesce around one plane of action that they can make progress on here, Lynda.",

We can see from where they position themselves across civilian infrastructure that low blows are just a possibility, in the event of a conflict. Low blows against civilians are part of China's plan. Just this morning, we announced an operation where we and our partners identified hundreds of routers that had been taken over by the PRC state sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon. The Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide, among other things, pre-operational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical infrastructure like our communications, energy, transportation, and water sectors. Steps China was taking, in other words, to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Khan has been behind bars since August and the former first lady is now in police custody. They were found guilty of not disclosing information on sold gifts that were sent to him by foreign leaders while he was in office. This sentence comes a day after Khan was handed a 10-year jail term in another case, and the new ruling extends Khan's ban on running for office to 10 years. And all this comes just days before a general election in Pakistan. Both rulings were in a closed court established under the Official Secrets Act in Rawalpindi, that's where Khan and Former Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi are currently jailed. Now, Khan will be allowed to serve his sentences concurrently. Imran Khan's media team slammed today's sentencing, saying this, \"Another sad day in our judicial system history which is being dismantled.\" While adding, this ridiculous decision will also be challenged. On Tuesday, Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison for leaking state secrets. He says, the charges against him are politically motivated, an allegation that authorities deny. The harsh sentences out this week are just the latest in a series of legal battles for Khan. He has dozens of pending cases against him, and now is a politically sensitive time. Parliamentary elections are due to take place February the 8th. Imran Khan is not able to run due to a previous conviction, but on Tuesday, he took to the social media platform X to urge his supporters to turn out. Writing this, \"My Pakistanis, this is your war and this is your test that you have to take revenge for every injustice by your vote on February the 8th while remaining peaceful.\" Our TV stations in Pakistan are banned from running his speeches, and many of his PTI party colleagues have been arrested. And despite not being able to stand in the upcoming election, Imran Khan still has widespread support from voters. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The hostages' families want him to do whatever it takes to bring their loved ones home. But one of his own coalition partners, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, is threatening to bring down the government if it agrees to what he calls a reckless deal with Hamas. Ben-Gvir also made headlines for appearing at a recent conference, calling for the resettlement of Gaza after the war. Other government ministers and lawmakers attended that as well. The event featured a large map that showed the location of proposed Jewish settlements in Gaza, some on top of existing Palestinian towns. Well, my next guest calls that conference a political horror show where, \"Jewish supremacy and anti-democratic euphoria were on full display.\" He accuses Mr. Netanyahu himself of fueling it.
