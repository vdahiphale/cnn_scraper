It follows a shocking helicopter accident in the town of Brovary near Kyiv. Earlier today, 17 people including the Ukrainian Interior Minister and at least three children are known to have lost their lives after the helicopter came down in bad weather, tragically crashing near a nursery. The death of the Ukrainian Minister is the greatest blow to the country's leadership so far during the illegal war with Russia. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is set to address delegates here in Davos in just a few hours, time. He's likely to discuss today's terrible developments and deliver a firm message once again, that fresh Military aid to his country is needed immediately there truly is no time to waste. Report saying Russia is massing troops for a new offensive soon. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz under intense pressure too from allies to permit the delivery of state of the art battle tanks to Ukraine speaks on the main stage of the WEF, later this hour ahead of crucial discussions of course to on this issue on Friday. Lithuania's Foreign Minister saying here in Davos to today that he's confident those tanks, which could prove crucial to current Ukraine's defense will be delivered. We'll discuss Ukraine's plight, as well as the global economic and energy crisis resulting from the invasion in detail over the coming hour too with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the current U.S. Presidential envoy on climate issues, and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, as well as Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin. Her message there is no other alternative to Ukraine winning the war, and that it will win. This yes, Davos I think playing a crucial role in further strengthening the global economy solidarity with Ukraine during this dark hour. And that's why I want to begin with the latest from the accident site embroidery now. CNN Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward is in Brovary and earlier spoke to my colleague Don Lemon.",

Tragically killing 16 people all nine people on board the helicopter was killed, including the Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi, also the Deputy Interior Minister, the Secretary of state of the Interior Ministry, as well as six others. And then on the ground, tragically, at least three children and their parents who were just taking them to school Don. I mean, as if this country has not been through enough tragedy and horror in this war. Now you have this on top of it. Authorities are saying they don't know exactly how this happened or why this happened. But we've been talking to a lot of people in the area and the visibility was terrible this morning. One man told us he was outside smoking a cigarette and he could hear the crash, but he couldn't see anything because of the fog. Another woman told us that after she heard the crash, she ran down to the kindergarten and saw children being taken out of the building, some of them still literally on fire. So this is an absolutely horrifying attack. Clearly having a big impact on so many people around here there's been a constant stream of people laying flowers taking a minute to come and to pay their respects. And you can see those rescue workers still going through the rubble trying to ascertain how this happened. They've been picking out large chunks of debris parts of the helicopter that I think from what we understand sort of clipped that initial part of the kindergarten there and then crashed just over on the other side, where we were earlier this morning, we saw at least four bodies covered in those gold foil blankets. But as we said just a tragic day, 16 people died among them at least three children.",

Of course, this is easily set, not done, because when you eliminate COVID restrictions in a country of 1.4 billion people where there was zero COVID. Guess what happens bushfire COVID spreads.

We're simply trying to point out, but their job is to occasionally mitigate risk or take some risks, and make it possible for the private sector to bring the trillions of dollars to the table necessary to affect this transition. I mean, the good economic reports the U.N. report, others say that we have a deficit of about 2.5 trillion 4.5 trillion per year for the next 30 years. That's what it takes to do this and right now, we're at less than about two, or somewhere around 1 trillion. So we need to up the ante here, one of the best ways we could do that is to have money available that can help de risk. Philanthropies are stepping up, they're putting some money on the table, countries are stepping up, and they're putting some public money on the table. I regret to say, we've gone the other way in our country, because of the fight in the Congress over this issue.

Why are the CEOs of some of the most successful and largest employers in the world biggest companies that are you have Google and Apple and Microsoft and airline, you have Salesforce, you have all these amazing companies are here? And they're pushing to move in this direction. Despite the fact that we have some people in public life, who still want to ignore the science, ignore the reality and not do anything.
