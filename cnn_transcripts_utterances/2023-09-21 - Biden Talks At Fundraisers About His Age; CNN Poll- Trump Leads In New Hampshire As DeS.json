      "sentences": "Good morning. Thanks for getting an early start with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is just after 5The big story at the bottom of the hour, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is fine-tuning a new plan to keep the government open. He is calling for deeper spending cuts and new border security measures. He's trying to satisfy some of his party's conservative hardliners. But meanwhile, Democrats are starting to talk about whether they might be willing to help him keep the government open. Conservatives say, though, that he could lose his job if he starts courting those Democrats. President Biden holds bilateral talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today and is expected to unveil a new package for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is also set to meet with lawmakers behind closed doors to answer questions about U.S. support in Ukraine's slow counteroffensive. And a rock-solid lead in the Granite State. A new CNN poll shows Donald Trump leading the GOP pack in New Hampshire with 39 percent. But the race for second is heating up. Ron DeSantis has dropped 13 points since July. He and Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, and Chris Christie only a few percentage points apart. All right. Last night, the former president, Donald Trump, did something that he rarely does. He stopped by a bar. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Cheering at an Iowa bar where former President Donald Trump stopped to hand out pizzas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think this simple answer here -- and we talked about the age issue last week. And as I said then, it's on voters' minds and it's -- Biden's team is seeing it in the polls. And so, their solution -- they recognize that voters are concerned about his age so they're trying to confront it head-on. And this is kind of the pivot we're seeing -- is instead of ignoring the issue let's talk about it. Let's confront it head-on.At the same time, I think Biden's team is not convinced that the age issue is going to be number one, number two, or even number three for voters when they head to the polls. They're not convinced yet that it's going to affect him all that much, particularly because you see some of these other really important issues like the abortion topic and democracy, as he's argued, on the ballot. And so, they're -- they remain confident that those are going to be the things that voters are going to go to the polls and have at top of mind.",

He's basically trying to put away Ron DeSantis in Iowa because we do know that if somebody comes close to him there it could really shake up the narrative in the Republican primary race.What's your -- he hates doing the kind of campaigning that we saw at that bar in Iowa -- he much prefers big rallies -- but they've got him doing it anyway.

If we get close enough to Trump in Iowa -- they don't have to win is their argument. They don't need to beat him in Iowa. But if they even come in a close second the race becomes very different. And so, even as we're seeing Trump kind of shift his messaging, in some ways, to a general election strategy, he's still kind of trying to close the door and wrap up this primary early.",

Because we have Democrats now talking amongst themselves about whether they should try to bail Kevin McCarthy out of this jam and do so, in part, to get some of their own policy priorities across the line. But obviously, from McCarthy and team, that has its own set of issues and they don't seem ready to go there yet. And part of that is because of what I'm about to show you, which are Matt Gaetz and Chip Roy talking about what might happen if McCarthy were to play ball with Democrats. Take a look.

MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  If Speaker McCarthy relies on Democrats to pass a continuing resolution, I would call the Capitol moving truck to his office pretty soon because my expectation would be he'd be out of the speaker's office quite promptly.",

We're seeing that.It is essentially a lose-lose situation because on the one hand, if he tries to cut a deal with Democrats you get the government and that's obviously a big plus in a lot of voters' minds. But on the other hand, is he going to be able to hold on to his position if he does that? And again, the hard-right faction of this Republican Party recognizes that they have a lot of power here and they're using it, and they're not afraid to use it. And what has also really complicated this situation is last night, Donald Trump weighed in and essentially told the party to hold the line. And so that, I think, is going to reenergize some of these Republicans who don't want a deal and who don't want McCarthy to cut a deal or fund the government.

We're four months away from the first votes being cast in Iowa. I think what this poll shows us in New Hampshire is that there is amarket for a candidate other than Trump. Six in 10 voters basically are looking at somebody else other than the former president. The problem is you've got four or five candidates there all around 10 percent, so the anti-Trump is being split. Normally, in a conventional presidential race you would expect Iowa and New Hampshire to whittle down that field and then the race would proceed through all the other big primaries after that. The problem is that Trump is so strong. That he is so familiar to voters. He's almost more like an incumbent running for reelection in this race than he is an outsider --",

And it does really look like we're seeing that same -- that same movie again.I mean, one question I do have for you Stephen. Looking at this New Hampshire poll is that it sort of struck me that hey, like, maybe the debates actually do still really matter in terms of figuring out who -- if we're going to get a second candidate -- that person might be. I mean, we saw Nikki Haley get a little bit of a bump. Obviously, Vivek Ramaswamy. DeSantis didn't really make any big mistakes in the debate but he also didn't stand out the way you would have expected the number one potential challenger to Trump to stand out.
