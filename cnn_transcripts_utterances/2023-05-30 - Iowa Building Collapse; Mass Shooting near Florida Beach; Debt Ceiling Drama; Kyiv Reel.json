Months ago, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to place some members on that committee to secure his speakership.Nine Republicans and four Democrats; by tradition, the opposition party never votes for the rule and so Republicans would need seven votes for passage. The problem is, Chip Roy and Ralph Norman are already saying they will vote no. So the key swing vote is Ralph Massie and he has to vote for it. But if it does pass, the House will be voting on it tomorrow, where there are frustrations on both sides. If a majority vote yes, 218, it would move to the Senate, where is everyone agrees, it could move to a near immediate vote. But unanimous consent and skipped debate means unanimous. One lawmaker could delay it. Senators Mike Lee and Lindsey Graham have already threatened to delay the vote in the Senate. So with the default deadline on June 5th, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the margin for error to get it passed in time is paper thin.

He had agreed to put them on the committee to stack more conservatives on the panel as part of the dealmaking to secure the speakership. Two no votes, Chip Roy and Ralph Norman; what is Thomas Massie going to do? There is some expectation that he will vote yes and, if he does, that would be a big sigh for Republican leaders. And then the bill goes to the next process. How much backlash will he get from the far right? They're trying to build the opposition toward the bill. But one of the deals McCarthy cut was to have one member to call for a vote to oust him as Speaker. Will that change it all? Tonight, Kevin McCarthy will try to convince his members to come along and support this deal. They will have a conference meeting, the first face-to-face since Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy cut this deal. The expectation of the Republican leaders is that they could probably get the majority of the conference behind them. But that means Democrat support, we know folks on the left are angry at the White House for making concessions. But they were forced to do that to suspend the debt limit up to January 2025. If there are enough center left Democrats to vote this forward -- and the expectation is there are 100 or so. So that means there could be the votes on the floor tomorrow to approve it in the House.

And it sets stage for what we will hear in the courtroom over the next few weeks. Some of the details that prosecution gave, federal prosecutor Sue Sung started opening statements by contrasting how the victims of the shooting started their day that October Saturday in 2018. And how Mr. Bowers, the defendant in this case, began his day. The victims were spending a normal Saturday morning in the synagogue and welcoming other congregants coming in and worshipping and helping with the prayer books. All of the while, Bowers was researching Jewish organizations and arming himself with several guns, handguns, a rifle and a shotgun and making his way to the synagogue to kill Jewish worshippers. And some of the most intense things that we heard from prosecutors is that Mr. Bowers \"methodically went through the synagogue, hunting Jewish worshippers.\" And what stood out to me is that the prosecution said that there were no stray bullets in this mass shooting, that Mr. Bowers went and targeted each individual person when he shot them. Also, the prosecution noted that, of the 22 worshippers in the synagogue that morning, only half survived. That brings us into the defense's argument, there was a shootout with the Pittsburgh SWAT team. They convinced Mr. Bowers to come out of a room they got into an altercation with. One SWAT member asked why he did it after the SWAT team saw the carnage left around them. And Mr. Bowers said, quote, \"All Jews need to die. The Jews are killing our kids.\" I bring this up, because then we heard from the defense and Judy Clark, who is a high profile defense attorney who represented other people accused of mass killings, she said, his actions are incomprehensible and inexcusable and no question this was a planned act. However, she wants the jury to consider this was a rational motive and misguided intent. And she is going to examine that question of why.",
