      "sentences": "Sure. There's a lot of talk about the Supreme Court right now with the new administration coming in.You know, Donald Trump had three appointments in his first term, which is a really big deal. And it's part of the conservative dominance going on for the past 20 appointments, over some 50 years. Fifteen of those have been by Republican presidents and only five by Democratic presidents. So there's always been this search for the center. And that's what you see going on now. The three Liberals left there, Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson are desperately looking for anyone at the center. And so far, Amy Coney Barrett has offered them the best chance. And that's for a couple of different reasons. One, she's one member of the six-justice conservative supermajority who never served in the top echelons of a Republican administration. You know, John Roberts was in the Reagan administration and H.W. Bush administration. Brett Kavanaugh in the George W. Bush administration. She's even made some gestures towards the center. But what my story today is about is how much hope they have in her but also how much, despite engaging with the left-wing justices, she sends up more with the justices on the right 90 percent of the time. She's voting with Chief Justice Roberts and voting with Brett Kavanaugh. But she's only 52 years old. She's the youngest justice on the court. And it's a bit of hope springs eternal. And you never know where someone's going to go. That why, right now, there's so much attention on Clarence Thomas, who's 76, and Sam Alito who is 74, with people thinking, will they leave now that Donald Trump is in office? I don't think they're eager to leave but might be enough pressure to go while a like-minded Republican is there in office.",

Given that they've already reversed half a century of abortion rights when they reversed Roe v. Wade.They have enhanced gun rights. They've rolled back the authority of federal regulators. There's been so much happening. But that's -- that's what the six-justice conservative majority. What will make the difference, Boris and Brianna, is that younger conservatives will come in, if, indeed, Donald Trump has an opportunity to fill more seats. So that means that his legacy would continue for decade upon decade upon decade. I used to say our children will be living with a Donald Trump court. That was back in his first term. Now it's going to be our grandchildren will be living with Donald Trump's court if he does get more appointments. And I have to say, getting just those three justices in his first term, that was amazing. That was really a big deal. He you were get one or two more to get five, you really have to go back to history for a president who was fortunate enough to have that many vacancies on his watch.",

Their answer was, it's death by 1,000 cuts. You won't see a major mass event or mass arrests or shutdowns of organizations. It's these small, obscure, sometimes bureaucratic steps that really whittle down the freedom of the press. It's things like attacks on access, attacks on media, those in power and indirect and direct pressure on the owners who have media companies leading to self-censorship, leveraging of their wealthy allies to buy them out and essentially turning them into government mouthpieces. And legal challenges. We've seen lawsuits and investigations not necessarily connected to journalism but we've seen targeting journalists for unrelated issues like tax investigation. And even if the lawsuit is thrown out, just responding to a lawsuit like that can drain a lot of resources from news organizations and from journalists. So if any of that sound familiar, well, we've seen President-Elect Donald Trump get a lawsuit currently going on against CBS, a $10 million, over their interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. And in terms of self-censorship, some of these experts pointed to the \"Washington Post\" and \"L.A. Times,\" their owners stopping their editorial boards from endorsing Kamala Harris and saying that can be a sign of that self-censorship, where you don't need direct pressure on a business owner but just a sort of indirect pressure, that can lead to self-censorship. As you know, the owners of those papers, like Jeff Bezos, have nothing to do -- they having nothing to do with it. I do want to end on a note of optimism, though. And listen, the United States is a much different place than a country like Hungary and experts say there's a big diversity of media.

He went on his podcast and, apparently, one of his top media advisors, Trump's, was his 18-year-old son, Barron. He said to his media people, go to Barron and ask him which are the cool podcasts, which are the ones. Obviously, he was making a very concerted effort to reach out to young men, young men of color, and was taking a lot of advice from Barron about the platforms to go on and not. And of course, what we saw at the end of the campaign was the battle over Joe Rogan, who was, I guess, the top-rated podcast in America. And very appealing to young men. And he went on it, three hours, ended up being very late for a rally later that night because he thought it's more important to be on Joe Rogan than any place else. And ended up getting Rogan's endorsement in the final days. Interesting enough, Kamala Harris was going to talk, was she going to do, was she not going to do it?
