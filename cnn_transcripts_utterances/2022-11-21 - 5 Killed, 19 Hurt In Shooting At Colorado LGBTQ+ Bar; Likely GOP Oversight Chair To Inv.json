Prosecutors ready to charge the suspect of yet another deadly mass shooting with a hate crime. Five people died in Colorado Springs shooting and we just learned the name of a second victim, Derrick Rump, who was a bartender. He worked alongside another victim, 28-year-old Daniel Aston. At least 19 other people in that nightclub were injured when a man opened fire in this LGBTQ+ nightclub on Saturday night. Court records show the alleged gunman will face multiple murder and hate crime charges once he is out of the hospital. An owner of the club tells CNN that the shooter entered with, quote, tremendous firepower. But the, quote, dozens of lives were saved after two people in the club confronted the shooter, disarmed him, and held him down. Now, many are asking how this could have happened. Should Colorado's red flag law have prevented this? The suspect was apparently arrested last year for threatening to bomb his mother's home. Colorado's attorney general saying this on CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL WEISER (D), COLORADO ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I do believe officers know we have a red flag law.

They're now at a super majority in the House and one vote away from it in the Senate and, of course, the governor there is also a Democrat though he is perhaps a more moderate Democrat. They have passed other gun control measures in recent years, have stayed away trying to ban AR-15s and similar firearms.This may, you know, add to that calculus in the state there locally for how they pursue new gun restrictions this year. I think at the national level, it's much less likely, especially with Republicans recapturing control of the house. But even when Democrats had control before the midterms, they passed an AR-15 ban, assault weapons ban through the House, but haven't voted on it in Senate because their control is very limited there as well.

So, Comer is seeking a wide swath of documents related to how the administration is enforcing its current immigration laws and what's it doing to stop the flow of drugs at the border. And in these letters, they went out to four different agencies and officials, including Homeland Security Department, Health and Human Services, the DEA, and the White House drug czar.But in these letters, Comer is already assigning blame on Biden, saying that their policies are to blame for the fentanyl crisis and also for all the problems at the border and what we've seen in terms of illegal immigration. But this is one of just many signs that the border's going to be a top investigative target for Republicans in their newfound majority. You have Jim Jordan, who's going to be the top Republican House Judiciary Committee. He sent a letter last week saying that they're going to be calling in people for hearings and transcribed interviews, including Alejandro Mayorkas. He's the secretary of homeland security department. He also multiple trips to the border that Republicans have taken, including Kevin McCarthy who is going to be there tomorrow with a group of Republicans and there's been calls to impeach him. Now, Democrats say they agree the immigration system is broken, but they point out that instead of Republicans trying to use their majority to find solutions legislatively, that they're just focused on investigation. And we should also point out, Brianna, that the Department of Homeland Security has said they have seized a record amount of fentanyl. So they are doing things to stop the flow of drugs at the border, but nonetheless, they're preparing for an onslaught of investigations, potential impeachment proceedings. They've been stepping up and taking other steps to prepare for that scenario. So, clearly, that's something everyone in Washington is anticipating right now.",

This was their first World Cup match since 1958.So, so much excitement and expectation around this young American team. They're one of the youngest teams in the draw. And they made a good start. That is really good first half. They took the lead here when the Chelsea star Christian Pulisic played -- he gave the Americans the lead. That was how it's done at halftime. But the Wales were much improved in the second half. And they ended up getting an equalizer pretty late on. And the Americans can have no real complaints, to be honest, with the way this went down. Walker Zimmerman, absolutely clattering LAFC star Gareth Bale. And Bale then dispatched the penalty with great aplomb. So that is how it finished, 1 all. It's not the end. Far from it, it's only the first game out of 3 in the group stage. But it now sets up an absolutely epic clash against England on Friday. That is the day after Thanksgiving and that game is expected to draw the highest ever television audience for a soccer game in the United States. KEILAR:  An epic clash. I cannot wait for that, Don.

That could've meant a booking or even being sent off the field.And, so in the end, they had to switch tack. The players could not do this.

The team did not sing as Iran's national anthem was played before the game against England got underway. Several of Iran's World Cup players have spoken out in recent weeks in support of demonstrators protesting the suspicious death back in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, or Zhina Amini, her banned Kurdish name that her family uses. And that brings us to the world lead and the unthinkable happening too many of those protesters in Iran. First, with the brutal crackdowns, even deaths. Now, women and also men tell CNN, security forces are using rape and blackmail to torture them. CNN's Nima Elbagir has their stories and a warning, their testimony is graphic and disturbing to hear. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Over these mountains is Iran, a regime that has succeeded in cutting many of its people off from the outside world. But disturbing stories detailing the authorities' brutal retribution, systematic sexual violence against anti-regime protesters, have begun leaking out. We have come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try to find out more. This is Hannah (ph), not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran. She fears for her life. After taking off and burning her head scarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  They choose the women who are pretty and suited their appetites. Then, the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller, private room. They would sexually assault them there.",

She estimates 70 to 80 men and women were together in a main hall that accessed for private interrogation rooms. It was in these interrogation rooms, she says, that she was assaulted and others were raped. CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah's description, eyewitness corroboration and geolocation, using key landmarks. It's in the Eslamabad neighborhood of Urmia. Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus. Police centers use as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another, often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held. One Iraq-based Kurdish militant opposition party PAK identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers. Human rights organizations believe the number is higher, in the thousands. Some of the victims as young as 14. Many are men, supporting female protesters. Their punishment, as severe as the women's. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  They brought four men over who have been beaten, screaming intensely in another cell.
