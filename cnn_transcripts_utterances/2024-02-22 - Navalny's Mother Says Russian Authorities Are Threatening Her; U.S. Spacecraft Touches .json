Federal judges ruling the MyPillow CEO must pay a software expert who debunked his election lies $5 million. The man was supposed to be getting that money is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Jim Sciutto, in tonight for Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news: Alexei Navalny's body now being held hostage tonight. We're learning the conditions that Russia has set in order for authorities to release the opposition leader's body to his mother. According to Navalny's team, some of the demands include the Kremlin wants Navalny's body to be transported to Moscow on special plane followed by a secret funeral. This ultimatum comes after his mother was finally allowed to see her son's body nearly a week after he suddenly died at a brutal Arctic Russian penal colony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYUDMILA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S MOTHER (through translator): Yesterday evening, they secretly took me to the morgue where they showed me Alexei. The investigators claim they know the cause of the death, which they have all the medical and legal documents ready, which I saw, and I signed the medical death certificate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It ended up being what's been described as a partial success. So there's a chance that this could happen here. But make no mistake. The fact that it has touched down on the surface of the moon is a significant milestone for Intuitive Machines and for the United States, which hasn't done this since 1972, also the first commercial company to ever do this in the history of the world really. But, Jim, the other big thing is just how Intuitive Machines did this. The NASA administrator and former Senator Bill Nelson said, this was an Apollo 13 moment minus the people. So, a lot less at stake here. This is only a robotic, uncrewed spacecraft. But NASA really kind of came to the rescue here because Intuitive Machines navigation system wasn't working and there was an experimental navigation system from NASA that was on the lander and that's what they used to land this thing, incredible that they were able to make this work on the fly.

And it's also a critical spot, Jim, as you know, because this is where NASA wants to land Artemis astronauts, the first astronauts to return to the moon since the Apollo program, but it's also where China wants to land its astronauts or taikonauts.

This is where he was arrested when he came back into the country and where he was first brought before a judge to face those charges. Now, what I'll read you a statement from -- a part of a statement from his lawyers who described what happened. They say Mr. Smirnov was rearrested on an arrest warrant issued by the same court where he was planning on voluntarily appearing when required. They say that he was inside our law office at the time of his the rest preparing for his defense. And we are we are pursuing lawful remedies to once again, seek his release. What they've done, Jim, is that they've asked the judge in Las Vegas, the one who had allowed him to go free for an emergency hearing. And so that judge, just a little while ago, issued a new order asking for the Justice Department, for the special counsel David Weiss, to respond by tomorrow afternoon. So in the meantime, Smirnov is going to be spending at least the night in jail awaiting to see what the outcome of this is. But in the end, what this means, Jim, is that the judge who is overseeing this case believes at least for now that Alexander Smirnov should be detained while these charges are being worked out.
