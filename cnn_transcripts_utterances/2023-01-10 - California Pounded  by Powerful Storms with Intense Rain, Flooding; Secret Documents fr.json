We have more rain coming in today. There was such relentless rain yesterday.Some spots in the state of California had more rainfall yesterday than on any day in history on record. More rainfall coming in today. Widespread flooding. More impassible roads. More mudslides. They started yesterday but I believe there will be more of them today because the ground is already saturated and more rainfall is coming. That little purple area there to the east of Santa Barbara, 10 inches of rainfall estimated by radar and the radar gauges and the rain gauges are matching up here from Three Peaks to Dewey all over 10 inches of rainfall in the past one day. So where do we go from here? Well, by 4:00 in the morning Pacific time more rainfall is really in the same place falling all the way down into southern California. Heavy snow in the Sierra. Could be four to five feet in the highest elevations. That's great news for the drought because the snow doesn't run off like this rainfall is going to run off. That's not it just yet. There's another storm behind this one. These are just relentless pieces of atmospheric river running on shore. It's that river of air that has so much humidity in it coming from the tropics that will run straight into California proper. We will get some snow in the Rockies, that's beneficial. Really the problem here is the rain and even the potential for some onshore water spouts coming in as tornadoes. There will be more rainfall in places that simply don't need it from Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and North Bay and Sacramento as well. These places are wet. Everything is running off.

So, while the president has remained silent, the White House has put out an on the record, very detailed time line of exactly how they feel this went down, what exactly happened. The point of this, Christine, is to show just how differently they are handling this classified document issue versus the former president, President Trump.Now, the office said they are fully cooperating with the National Archives and Department of Justice after a small, less than a dozen amount of classified documents were found in that Penn Center office that President Biden used a few years ago. After being closed down, those documents found by lawyers. They immediately notified the National Archives and just next morning the national archives came and picked those documents up. Now, a source told our own Phil Mattingly that Biden wasn't aware those documents were in that room and he's not aware what those documents are. Now, another difference that the White House pointed out here was that the fact that these documents were not requested. They were not sought after. Instead, they were willingly given over to the national archives immediately after they were found. Now, of course, this is something we haven't yet heard from the president about, but -- and it really is unclear how much he is going to talk about it in the future, but we know that the president is going to return to D.C. this evening and this is going to be an issue that looms over him, is waiting for him when he arrives as it made big news yesterday and it's likely to continue dominating news cycles in the future -- Christine.",

A source tells CNN the subpoena was part of special counsel Jack Smith's sweeping criminal probe into Trump's fundraising and spending as he tried to overturn the 2020 election. A Giuliani spokesman and the special counsel's office both declined to comment on the subpoena. All right. Police in Massachusetts now searching for the remains of missing mother Anna Walsh at a trash transfer station. Investigators have also put crime tape around dumpsters at the home of her mother- in-law. Anna's house, Brian Walsh, was arrested for misleading investigators. Police also say they found a bloody knife in the Walsh's basement. Police in Brazil found five hand grenades in Congress and the Supreme Court, that according to a Brazilian senator. The president is accusing police of negligence. About 1,500 people have been arrested after supporters of the former president stormed the three branches of Brazil's government. CNN's Isa Soares reports from Brasilia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A stunning attack on Brazil's seat of power, as supporters of former far right President Jair Bolsonaro broke through security quarters in Brasilia, roaming the presidential building, vandalizing congress, smashing windows, stealing presidential documents and destroying invaluable works of art -- simply running riot through Brazil's halls of power, in scenes eerily similar to the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol two years ago. One week earlier, the scenes were of democratic triumph as Bolsonaro's left-wing rival Lula da Silva was inaugurated following a tight election result. Bolsonaro never explicitly conceded and neither did his most ardent followers. This, this is my hero. I'm at his home, our home, our home a Bolsonaro supporter said from inside the presidential palace. Protestors dressed in the colors of the Brazilian flag now a symbol of Bolsonaro's far right movement. Unfell banners from the congressional building rooftop demanding the result of Brazil's most fraught election in a generation be overturned. More than 1,000 arrests were made after security forces used tear gas and stun grenades to regain control of the congressional building, the Supreme Court and presidential palace. But by the time they did, the damage had already been done. The president's chief of communications showed destruction inside his own office.",

This has been a story we've been talking about with Donald Trump and now we have something that seems very similar with President Biden and be there are some differences but there's a lot of key facts that are very similar. There are classified documents that were held after the point of being in office it appears and we have to remember that the vice president, unlike the president, does not have the same authority to declassify documents and they are subject to those laws regarding the handling of those.Now in this case with President Biden, it doesn't seem as if there's any obstruction efforts, the documents were readily turned over and certainly there hasn't been any claims he owns them or has any right over them. There seems to be Cooperation there. In terms of the obstruction which for president Trump's purposes is the much more significant legal issue, that does not seem to be an issue in this case.

So in terms of government agencies, there is a significant amount of classification. There are things that happen on a regular basis with people being mishandling them in some ways and those are handled sometimes administratively. There's not always criminal prosecutions involved with this because there is a high volume of documents. Again, the president has the declassification authority ultimately. Every other government employee, including the vice president, is subject to very strict requirements of handling those documents.

Of course, a lot of the explosive details are already out.Harry has promoted the tell-all in a series of interviews detailing the split from the royal family and the riff with his father and brother. CNN's Bianca Nobilo joins us from London. The book dropped, Bianca, in the U.K. several hours ago. It's number one on the Amazon bestseller list. Some columnists write about over saturation but some people keep reading about Harry and are buying his book. BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  They certainly are. Book stores in London, some of which opened early around midnight to cater what they perceived would be huge, overwhelming demand for the book. It's no surprise given the media blitz and any PR agent's dream scenario. Nobody really has stopped talking about it, least of all me this week. But I think what will be so instructive to witness, Christine, is whether or not when people can read Prince Harry's story, do they become more sympathetic towards him? So far we've had excerpts taken out of context. This time people will be able to read all 410 pages of the British version and make up their own mind. And that might be what's concerning Kensington or Buckingham Palace because it is a war of words at the moment and Prince Harry in his \"Good Morning America\" interview said something which I thought was one be of the most significant statements he's made throughout this media campaign. When asked if he felt that the monarchy was still relevant, still important, he said, yes, but not in the form that it is now. That might give us a clue to his over arching motivation here. We know he wants to inform and improve the antagonist of the British press and tabloids. Clearly, he feels the monarchy needs to modernize and free itself of unconscious bias. Hearing that from the person who's fifth in line to the throne has to be damaging. So, it's too soon to tell exactly what the impact constitutionally in the U.K. is going to be but given that the monarch is the head of the nation, the person that the country's supposed to have pride in and identify with, these damaging allegations are sure to have impact, Christine.",
