Happening now, we are just getting word that intense talks are going on at this moment to free a large number of the more than 200 people that could be hostage right now by Hamas in Gaza, but we are told the negotiations are, of course, complicated. So far, four of these hostages have been freed total. including two just yesterday. One of them an elderly Israeli woman spoke out this morning, she said, her ordeal, I should say, was hell.Let's get right to Sara Sidner who's in Jerusalem for the latest on all of this. Sara.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, the stories of one of those released hostages that she is telling are riveting and terrifying at the same time that also shows her humanity in what some might see as a surprising way. The two ladies who were released were taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz, 79-year-old Nurit Cooper and 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz were released overnight and are back in Israel finally today.Lifshitz is talking about her ordeal. She says her experience was hellish. She was kidnapped on a motorbike, riding on her side, all bruised up as she was taken into Gaza. She is a grandmother, and one of the founders of that kibbutz, and a long-time peace activist. She spoke not just about the terror that she experienced along with her husband and others, but how her captors treated her as they held her and dozens of others in the maze of tunnels Hamas has built under the Gaza Strip. She also criticized the Israeli security apparatus, saying, they missed the signs, something big may have been coming. Here's some of what she said after being released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS (through translator): The lack of awareness by Shin Bet and the IDF hurt us a lot. They warned us three weeks beforehand. They burned fields. They sent fire balloons. And the IDF did not treat it seriously. All of the sudden, on a Saturday morning, everything was very quiet. There was a hard pounding on the settlement, hoards broke into the homes, part were taken hostages. It was a painful act. They brought us into a gate, I was lying on the side on a motorbike. I got bruises which because of the drive it made breathing hard.",

But of course, her terror began when she was kidnapped in the first place. And so many people were killed at her kibbutz and others. Her heart, by the way, is still in Gaza because her husband is still a hostage, and so is Nurit Cooper's husband. Their ordeal, not over by any stretch of the imagination. The Israeli military is estimating that there still 218 hostages that are in Gaza, likely in that labyrinth of tunnels under the Gaza Strip that Hamas has built.I do want to mention also what is happening in Gaza. It is truly terrifying. The Palestinian population there is in dire shape there, a humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded because of airstrikes and the lack of food, water and medical supplies due to the Israeli blockade. Medical care has now completely collapsed, according to the Palestinian health ministry run by Hamas in Gaza. Doctors have told us that they are completely overwhelmed, and the hospitals can't maintain services to all of the people who need it. And now we're hearing this from Save the Children. They said on Monday that over 1 million children are now trapped in Gaza with no safe place to go, and warned of the devastating impacts of the lack of medication and electricity to power vital health infrastructure in the enclave.

      "sentences": "Well, first, I think, what Israel should do is to paint a vision of the future for the Palestinian people in Gaza, distinguishing them that war is not on them, it is on this terrorist group Hamas and its allies, the Islamist jihad. But they should lay out a vision. Life will be better.You know, when we did the surge in Iraq and we sought to separate the Sunni Arab Community from Al-Qaeda, we said if you support us against Al-Qaeda, life is going to be better for you. And we laid out concretely how that would be. They need to do the same, frankly, I think for the West Bank. But the real challenge, of course, is who will administer this territory? Ideally, it should be Palestinians. They don't want to ride in on the backs of Israeli tanks, needless those optics would be horrible. So, it seems to me inevitable that Israel has to do this for a period of time while working feverishly together with support from the United States to figure out how they can get in a -- an interim international authority. Noting, by the way, Kate, that this authority is not just going to do humanitarian assistance and restoration and basic services and reconstruction. It's going to have a hard edge to it because it's going to have to conduct a counter insurgency campaign to ensure that these terrorist groups -- there will be remnants of them cannot reconstitute. That is crucial. We know that extremist groups. We destroyed the Islamic state during the surge in Iraq, cut them down for three and a half years, and then when the Iraqi government took their eye off of them, they were able to reconstitute and a couple of years later they had the first ever caliphate that then had to be painstakingly taken apart. By the way, one of those huge panels was Mosul, a city similar to the size of Gaza that without the tunnel structure that without an enemy that understood it as well, it took nine months for the Iraqi Security Forces to clear it with our assistance. Nowhere near the capabilities of the Israelis to be sure, but again it gives you some sense of how tough this fighting would be.",

Everyone in the battlefield has a smart phone, access to the internet and social media platforms under which they can load video, photos, statements and so forth. And the optics here are going to be very, very challenging. There is already considerable destruction and damage despite Israel trying to do this precisely. They're going after specific targets, specific terrorist leaders, and also specific infrastructure elements of Hamas, but still the destruction is very substantial.The same was true in Mosul. And those optics are going to be, look, very difficult, and they will be very difficult. The reality will be excruciating. We see this also with the humanitarian situation. And in fact, Hamas is trying to play on that. They're dribbling out the hostages, trying to show that they have a kinder and gentler side when it's they who, of course, who have brought this existential moment in this tragedy for the Palestinian people in Hamas on -- in Gaza on themselves. But that level of the transparency is going to be something that is going to create the challenges for Israel, and I would contend that it already is. That's just a reality and it will create challenges for those who are seeking to stand by Israel as we are, rightly, and is something that will have to be dealt with. So, media monitoring, as we did during the surges in Iraq, isn't just going to be TV stations, radio stations, and print media. It's going to be innumerable social media platforms and posts on Twitter, Facebook, and so forth, and that is a major challenge.",

Byron Donalds 29. Kevin Hern 27. The rest were in the teens.So, they'll go out now on the second round of balloting. The ultimate goal is for someone to get a majority vote, to be the nominee for the GOP to be speaker of the house. But there are some warning signs for the leading vote getter Tom Emmer. You know, if he gets the nomination, he will need to get 217 votes on the House floor to be elected, meaning he cannot lose more than four Republicans. But some of them are concerned about some of his votes, including to codify same-sex marriage in the last Congress. I just asked one congressman about that issue, and me made clear that he would oppose Tom Emmer on the floor over that vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
