      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. We've just gotten a statement from President Biden congratulating Speaker Johnson. Just really remarkable, even seeing those words from a statement from the White House. Given that this is a turn of events that even folks here at the White House, of course, could not have predicted even a day ago. If I could just read a part of that statement. The president sayingWhile House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would lead their conference, I have worked on those pressing issues proposing historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan national security interests in Israel and Ukraine, secures our border and invests in the American people. These priorities, he said, have been endorsed by leaders in both parties. We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs to avoid a shutdown in 22 days. In other words, Wolf, the President is trying to say after 22 days were wasted by House Republicans, the White House is sort of eager to get to work on getting that supplemental package through to send additional aid to Ukraine and Israel, to make sure that there is no government shutdown come November 17th. But it is worth noting, this is not a well-known member here at the White House. There is going to be a bit of a scramble to figure out what kind of working relationship there is going to be between this administration and the new speaker. We're not talking about a Kevin McCarthy or even a Patrick McHenry. And I think it is worth noting that as that process unfolds, what the White House can look back on is the speakers voting record. They know that of course he is somebody who did vote to avert a debt default and that is an agreement that had the broad strokes of a budget agreement. So it's certainly something that they are going to want to see him adhere to. And I also think that it's worth noting that the president at the press conference earlier was asked about the speaker's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. And you saw how carefully he tried to sort of talk around that. Basically saying, look, I'm not worried about any efforts that he might make in the future to try to overturn the 2024 election results. But it is just an interesting dynamic because when you have observed the President, you do know that the -- where a member is on this issue, where a person is on this issue, sort of serves as an important litmus test for this President. So I think this is going to be sort of a fascinating new working relationship for us to observe. As again, White House officials, administration officials try to figure out how exactly they can work with the new speaker to get some things done on their top priorities, including, again, to get some funding through for Israel, for Ukraine and to avert a government shutdown.",

You were one of the eight Republicans who voted to force Kevin McCarthy out. It's been 22 days without a speaker. Is Speaker Johnson really that different in his policies, in his politics, then Kevin McCarthy was? REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): I'll point out, by the way -- Dana, great to be with you again. That the Senate did absolutely nothing during the three weeks that we were working on giving America hope by electing a new speaker. Congress has held in very low regard, as you know, about 20 percent approval because of the failures of the past from both parties, with congressional leadership. We've had the for the first time, in modern times anyway, a true national contest for speaker, where constituents could weigh in and let their elected representatives know who they wanted elected. Overwhelmingly, Republicans want change in the Congress, wanted change in the Republican leadership. It was worth taking a few weeks to get it right. As you know, we've also passed four spending bills out of the House. The Senate has passed zero, even though we gave him three weeks while we were working on getting the right speaker.",

CNN has spoken to UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency that operates inside of Gaza. They had said they would be forced to stop their operations from tonight if they didn't get more fuel. They seem to be recalibrating that message slightly saying if they don't get more fuel tonight or tomorrow, they will have to significantly reduce their operations.But more broadly speaking, across Gaza, we do already see the impact of that severe fuel shortage. The World Health Organization saying now that 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals are no longer operational. Eight of those because of this fuel crisis. Important to add that the IDF has come back and said that they believe there are 500,000 liters of fuel that are being held by Hamas, that they should be able to share that fuel. We have asked the UN about claims that the IDF has made in the past days that some of the fuel that they had has been stolen by Hamas. The UN said to us that they have no record and no indication of any of their fuel from any of their warehouses being stolen at any point. But while this back and forth continues about how much fuel is left and how long it's going to last, it's very clear that on the ground already the impact of this drastic shortage is being felt, both in terms of the hospitals, but also, Wolf, in terms of desalinating plants. People now, according to doctors on the ground, being forced to drink blackish water. A real lack of clean drinking water and all that aid that is sitting on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing, still unable to pass through. Just eight trucks went through last night. The expectation and the hope talking to the UN had been that starting on Monday earlier this week. That you would start to see more of a continuous and sustained flow of trucks going through.
