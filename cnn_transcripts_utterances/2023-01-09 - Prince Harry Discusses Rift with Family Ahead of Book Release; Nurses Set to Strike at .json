      "sentences": "I think most people would concur that as society modernizes, the Royal family probably needs to change, but historians will obviously also scrutinize the source and possible bias that they might possess -- and as everybody does when they're writing their own story. And Prince Harry has said that he wants this to form part of the historic record.There are some contradictions here, even in the way Prince Harry refers to how Royal commentators and Royal experts work. I've worked alongside a lot of them. From my experience that's not broadly true of everybody. And also, his desire for telling his own story. But then he is telling a lot of other people's stories in this book as well. Even talking about what how Prince William felt when their mother died.",

      "sentences": "Yes, he talks about how Prince William felt that they -- he and Prince William felt that she hadn't really gone. William was convinced that she was going to come back, that she perhaps gone off for a little break. Which is so heartbreaking to think of these two little boys saying to themselves that, you know, she's just gone off for a little break and she's going to see us again. So, he is telling a lot of people's stories.And I think also there is the contrast between -- he says how much he supports the monarchy, how much he loves the monarchy, and yet he is talking very clearly about all the many, many problems within it. And I think his principle, as he said, you know, honesty isn't burning bridges. I'm just being honest. And I think he feels the relationship is so damaged that he might -- he must speak out as well. But certainly, there's been a huge amount of criticism of Prince Harry, and I think there will be more so when the book comes out for telling his truth. But I don't think that this is the last of it. I think there are other interviews obviously to come. And also, I think, we may see more material being said, more words being said as time goes on because Harry's spoken a lot. There's clearly a lot of material I think he hasn't talked about yet.",

And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.In a few hours' time U.S. President Joe Biden will attend a North American Leader Summit where he is expected to discuss the growing migrant crisis at the U.S./Mexico border. The meeting comes a day after Mr. Biden visited El Paso, Texas, where he met with border agents and visited a shelter. And officials in Brazil have arrested more than 400 supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro after they attacked the nation's Congress over election results. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is vowing to punish those involved in the violence. And nurses with New York State Nurses Association looks set to strike in a little under 30 minutes after negotiations with Montefiore Hospital broke down. The Mount Sinai Health System tweeted hours ago that union leadership walked out of talks early this morning, setting off a potential strike at Mount Sinai Hospital as well. And according to Mount Sinai, the union refused to accept a more than 19 percent salary increase. The president of the nurses' union says money isn't their primary concern. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NANCY HAGANS, New York State nurses Association president: Our number one issue is the crisis of staffing. Chronic understaffing that harms patient care. Safe staffing is about having enough nurses to deliver safe care. Quality care to every patient. It is the issue that our employers have ignored. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they originally claimed that 600 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed after two buildings that they said that they were using as barracks had been hit. But actually, if you go to the site, which a number of independent journalists have done as well as Reuters news agency, la Repubblica, an Italian very well respected daily newspaper and indeed CNN also is in Kramatorsk. It doesn't appear as though there's any evidence of a few things. One,large numbers of Ukrainians soldiers actually having used these buildings as barracks. Two, there appears to be no civilian casualties or military casualties from the Ukrainian side from this hit. And the craters of where these rockets have landed aren't actually hitting buildings. They're outside of buildings. So, they appear to have missed these targets, and indeed it's very unclear as to whether or not these targets had large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers inhabiting them at the time. Now so the question is obviously, why would Russia do this? Well, it could be a propaganda play. Largely because the incident that you're referring to, Bianca, in Makiivka which happened on New Year's Day, Russia has now admitted that 89 of its conscripts, not soldiers -- professional soldiers -- conscripts here, which in itself is a very sensitive issue for Russians in general because originally this was is supposed to be a special military operation that would not have needed conscripts, 89 of them at least we now know, Russia admits have lost their lives. Originally Russia's military blamed them for having exposed their position by supposedly using their cell or mobile phones. Ukraine has dismissed that as fanciful. But we have to point out there's been disinformation perhaps or confusion on either side. Originally Ukraine said that that attack in Makiivka has killed 400 Russian soldiers. Russia only admits to 89 there. so, we're talking about large numbers on either side, and again, a very confused picture with some of these claims now having been debunked by independent media, as I just mentioned, make its way to these dangerous sites.",

Workers say they were told to go on holiday early amid a decrease for the demand in kits because China is ending its zero-COVID policy. According to social media posts, about 10,000 people were either unpaid or not paid in full. Some demonstrators clashed with police as they took to the streets to vent their frustrations.But for travelers in China, the dismantling of zero-COVID has created opportunities that they haven't enjoyed for years.
