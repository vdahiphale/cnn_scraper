So, you saw these headlines yesterday -- mainly in the Western media -- about morality police being abolished or shut down. Activists have been quick to push back on that. And you can understand why.Because it gives you the illusion or the sense that maybe the Iranian government, the Iranian authorities are responding to the demands of people on the streets. They say, that is absolutely not what is happening. Yet in some ways the morality police have not been patrolling the streets in the same way during the three months of demonstrations. But that means other branches of Iran's security apparatus, those that are even more brutal -- according to activists -- are the ones that are cracking down. Remember, rights groups say hundreds have been killed, thousands have been arrested. We've had a CNN investigation that show reports of torture and sexual assault at the hands of authorities by some of those that were detained. So, really serious and brutal crackdowns. And these protests continue, right. This movement continues. Currently there are the three-day strike. We're in day two of that strike. It culminates in in a big day tomorrow -- student day as you mentioned. And businesses across the country have been told to shut their doors in protest and shop keepers are willing to do this.
