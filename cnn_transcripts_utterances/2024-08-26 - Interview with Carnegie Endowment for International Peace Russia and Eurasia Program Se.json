Defense expert Dara Massicot on how Moscow is handling Ukraine's surprise incursion. Then, after a violent weekend in the Middle East, all eyes now on negotiations to prevent a wider war. CNN correspondents on the ground, join me from there. Also, ahead, as Donald Trump tries to find a strategy against the reenergized Democratic Party, his former Pentagon official Elbridge Colby on what Trump 2.0 would look like for the world. And why \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is more relevant than ever the director and star of in brand-new adaptation of this Steinbeck Classic. Carrie Cracknell and Cherry Jones join the show. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Ukraine is reeling from a massive Russian attack that killed at least five people and damaged vital energy infrastructure. Ukraine's air forces say targets across almost the entire country were hit during Monday morning rush hour by drones and missiles, including Kyiv, where many people took shelter underground. Widespread power outages are reported. President Zelenskyy says it was the biggest air assault since the war began. And he said it was time its allies lifted restrictions on the range of weapons and how to use them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Every leader, every partner of ours knows what strong decisions are needed to end this war and to end it justly. There should be no restrictions on the range of weapons for Ukraine while terrorists have no such restrictions. Defenders of life should face no restrictions on weapons, while Russia uses all kinds of its own weapons, as well as Shahed drones and ballistic missiles from North Korea. The United States, the United Kingdom, France and other partners have the power to help us stop terror. We need decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And maybe 2025, they would go on the offensive. I think it's fair to say just about everyone was surprised by this August offensive into Kursk. What do you think is going on?

They're beginning to set up the response now for the Kursk incursion. But I do think that this has shown that Ukraine understands the Russians. They picked a very weak spot of their border. And that's where they chose to enter. It is embarrassing for the Kremlin, and it is also highlighting that the Kremlin is not willing to take any major force off the table inside occupied Ukraine to deal with this. There are very few units that are actually up there to deal with the Kursk invasion -- excuse me, the Kursk incursion. And so, I think that it does expose vulnerability of the Russian state. The flip side is that it did take forces off the line elsewhere inside occupied Ukraine and Donetsk where the Russians are currently pressing forward.",

And the units that were moved up to Kursk, some of them were in that region trying to do the defenses. And Ukrainian units there are feeling pressure on that part of the front line.

So, I think that he will try to take the city. They are already -- and the Ukrainians already evacuating it. The police are leaving. The administration is leaving. So, I think the next question will be, what happens next? If they were to take it, what does that mean? It means that there are challenges in Donetsk, but it's still going to take the Russians a long time if they think that they have the strength to completely take over this.

They have been able to get the Russian Black Sea fleet to leave Crimea and be based in Russia proper. Russian aircraft that launched glide bombs have already relocated well beyond ATACMS range because they're anticipating that Ukraine might be given that authority. So, Russia does respond to this kind of threats or this kind of abilities to target platforms. And while Ukraine might not be able to target all the flankers that carry glide bombs, if they can push them back, they can reduce the number of sorties or how many times Russian aircraft can take off each day and bomb Ukraine.

So, they know how to do this. And I think with the right weapons, they can become more lethal at it. And none of those facilities or bases that I talked about are -- would trip a nuclear red line, at least from a purely military sense that I am aware of.

They are in the hands of the Ukrainian units now, and they are no longer experiencing those kind of shortages that we were seeing back then. There's still unresolved manpower problems. The Ukrainians are trying to adjust it on the margins, but there's still some shortages in these units that are pretty serious.

For now, there are efforts to de-escalateby both sides as Israel launched what it claims were preemptive strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon on Sunday. The scale of that strike is one of Israel's most significant to date, and it says around a hundred of its citizens fighter jets destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launchers. In response, Hezbollah says it launched more than 300 rockets and a swarm of drones towards Israel. Its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said further strikes could follow. Now, the situation has been at boiling point since the assassination of a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut last month. Hanging in the balance is not only a possible wider war, but the fate of the current one in Gaza, as ceasefire and hostage negotiations play out right now in Cairo, where the U.S. is taking a leading role as usual. Let's bring you the very latest with Ben Wedeman in Beirut and also Nada Bashir in Cairo. Nada, I want to go to you first because of the ceasefire talks.

And we have been hearing notes of optimism from U.S. officials familiar with the ongoing talk, saying that they are making forward progress that they are now focusing on. And there was the nuts and bolts and the finer details of the deal. But they've also cautioned that while there has been some progress, this is in no way a guarantee of a final deal at any time soon. And, Christiane, we know that there are still significant sticking points. In fact, in Hamas' statement yesterday, following the conclusion of those weekend talks here in Cairo, they reiterated the position that they have held for weeks now, which is one where they want to see a reflection of the deal presented by U.S. President Joe Biden in late May, a deal which Hamas officials have repeatedly said they agreed to in early July. And crucially, they are focused on two key areas. Firstly, they would like to see guarantees that after an initial six week pause in the first phase of this proposed ceasefire proposal, there would be a transition in the second phase to a permanent ceasefire. That has not yet been guaranteed or endorsed officially by Israeli officials. And in fact, we have heard from members of Netanyahu's coalition, including Netanyahu himself in June saying that they do wish to see a continuation of the war in order to fully eradicate Hamas' military capabilities. This, despite the fact that U.S. officials have said, they believe Hamas' military capabilities have now been sufficiently downgraded. And of course, the other key fundamental issue is questions and terms surrounding the presence of Israeli forces within the Gaza Strip following this ceasefire implementation. We know that Israel has presented new proposals which would see a reduced number of military posts and Israeli forces stationed along the Philadelphi Corridor, that buffer zone separating southern Gaza from Egypt. This is a revised proposal, it is a reduced number, but we have heard from Hamas once again reiterating that they want to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. But of course, these are the public statements from Hamas. Those working level discussions will continue. So, it remains to be seen whether we see any movement now.",

      "sentences": "Well, what we heard from Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, last night, he said to thepeople of Lebanon who have been on edge for the last month, take a breath, you can relax now. And it does appear that, as far as he's concerned, they've struck back, they've taken revenge for the killing of Fuad Shukr, that senior Hezbollah military commander on the 30th of July. He did say that they're still assessing the effectiveness of Hezbollah's strikes on targets in Israel yesterday morning, and that if they decide those were not sufficient damage inflicted upon the Israelis that they will consider a second ways -- a second phase, so to speak. Now, he was very confident. His tone was very confident and satisfied. He said, we have achieved what we planned. And now, the narrative from Israel seems to be quite to the contrary, that despite the fact that Nasrallah did say that he struck the headquarters of Mossad, the headquarters of Israel's signals intelligence unit, the 8200 unit, and the headquarters for the missile defense, that doesn't seem to be the case, but he's saving face. And it's important to keep in mind that Israel strikes yesterday, the preemptive strikes, were really limited to the border area. They didn't go deep into Lebanon where it is well known that Hezbollah is actually keeping its heavy -- its long-range missiles, its precision missiles. And therefore, both sides are continuing to maintain what we can only describe as red lines, that even though Israel has twice struck Beirut in the last two and a half months, that's only twice, it sometimes strikes deeper inside the Beqaa Valley, but both sides clearly want to avoid a full-scale war. I think Israel, because after 10 and a half months of war in Gaza, really might not have the capability for a full-scale war with Hezbollah, and Hezbollah, because of Lebanon's economic catastrophe that's ongoing, simply cannot afford to drag this country into another full-scale war with Israel.

Let's baseline something here, Christiane, neither presidential campaign is running on dramatic increases in defense spending, right, by the United States, and we know our defense industrial base should be fixed, and that's a key part of the Republican platform, but it's not -- it has not been fixed. So, there's a wild gap between what we're promising. And to your point about the heebie-jeebies, they should be more than heebie-jeebies, they should be very scared. What we need to get over is not the Cold War legacy of America. In the Cold War, we were quite tough on our allies and we expected them to do their part. It's the post-Cold War hubris after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Taiwan's a perfect example. Taiwan is a country, President Trump is absolutely right, it's right next to China. It's a country of 1.4 billion people that's in a historic military buildup, where the president of that country, and it seems a lot of the population, are pretty focused on forcibly unifying that, you know, Taiwan, if necessary.

So, you know, and the nature of our priorityis you got to -- and it's all relative. We're doing better than we were five -- you know, 10 years ago. But China's really -- you know, China's got 200 times the shipbuilding capacity in the United States. They're actively working to improve their military forces for, you know, something -- it could be in the coming years, God forbid. So, that's got to be our primary rival. Second, Europe -- Asia is now the world's primary theater. It's the primary market area. It's going to be upwards of 50 percent of global GDP. Europe remains important, but it's less important. Russia, I think there's a lot of sort of, extreme dialogue or sort of discussion on one side or the other, either that Russia is 1945 Joseph Stalin, or it's a joke. I think the Russians are a serious threat. I don't think it would be in our interest for Ukraine to be totally occupied, but the Russians are making incremental progress in Eastern Ukraine. My solution to this, getting back to what we were just saying, is really letting Europeans get -- know and get the memo that, you know, you got to take the lead in supporting Ukraine. I'm in favor of supporting Ukraine, it's just got to be done by them. We have to fix our situation, which is much more consequential and dangerous in the Western Pacific, and we have to recognize the reality of scarcity. And that's what I don't see at all. In fact, if I look at Vice President Harris, I say to myself, it's completely absent from the dialogue. Whereas, I think, President Trump is saying, we may be on the world -- the verge of World War III. I think, God forbid, that's correct.

I was at an event in the United Kingdom a couple weeks ago, and somebody said, hey, we need more consistency out of the United States and out of a, you know, future Republican administration. I said, well, our policy has not been successful for the American people. Deindustrialization, failed wars, global financial crisis, massive, you know, failure on the border, et cetera. We need to have a change. And that's going to involve pretty significant reform. And of course, President Trump and Senator Vance are arguing for something different, something much more common-sense, more aligned with what the American people's interests actually are, what their resources are, you know, what they're prepared to sacrifice for and expecting more for our allies.
