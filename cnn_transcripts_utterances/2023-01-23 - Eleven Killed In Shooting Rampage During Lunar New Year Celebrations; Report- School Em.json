Certainly not looking like that from what we have been seeing throughout the course of the day. The Germans seems very much on the fence about it, you just mentioned what the Polish prime minister had to say about it. They want to have this slow coalition. But they're also not near any sort of decision on that either. The Ukrainians are seeing every day that passes, their fleet of tanks that they currently have, Soviet made ones, is depleting. They really said they need those new tanks also to keep their troops alive. The survivability of those Western tanks, a lot better.
