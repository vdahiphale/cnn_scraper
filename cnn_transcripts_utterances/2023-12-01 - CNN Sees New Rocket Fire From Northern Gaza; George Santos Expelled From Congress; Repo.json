      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, while we were on air with you guys in the beginning of the hour, we heard very large explosions. Then shortly, right after that, as soon as we got off the air, we had sirens sounding above us in Sderot.And we actually saw the rockets coming from the northern part of the Gaza Strip and heading towards the town of Sderot, which is where we are now. There were at least a dozen interceptions that we heard. Rockets being fired from the northern part of Gaza Strip and several loud interceptions from the Iron Dome system overhead. What's really significant about this is that it comes after a week- long pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. Israeli military experts have long warned this would give time for Hamas to regroup and resume many of its operations targeting Israeli cities. And what's also interesting is that it came really from the very northern part of the Gaza Strip. One of those rocket barrages that we saw came from near a town in the northeastern most city in the Gaza Strip. So even after nearly two months of fighting, nearly two months of Israeli bombardment, several weeks of ground operation focused on the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Hamas or another Palestinian militant group who may have been firing these rockets still has the ability to fire rockets from several of these areas in the northern most part of the Strip. Which is really remarkable when you consider the fact that Israeli officials for weeks now have been saying that they are in control of the northern part of the Gaza Strip. And yet, clearly, Palestinian militants in Gaza still having the ability to fire rockets from those very same areas.",

It's a bipartisan committee.And part of a member of Congress' due process when you're in the House is the Ethics Committee. And what I was listening to was the Republican co-chair, of the Ethics Committee, the minute the report was finished, running down to the floor as fast as he could to file a motion to expel. So I think, if you're going to have an Ethics Committee and respect that process and have any kind of institutional integrity surrounding that committee, this was the right vote. And I'm glad it was cast today. I think he's going to have his day in court. And look, if he wants to run again, he thinks he's been wronged, he can put his name back on the ballot. I suspect he's not going to do this. But this was a good move for Republican branding in integrity today but also for the institutional integrity of the House.",

But I think, for the House itself, and the idea that this institution is held in pretty low esteem right now by the American people, using the Ethics Committee process to clean it up and to react to something that clearly needed to be dealt with is good for the institution. You bring up the institution of the presidency and we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there. Which is going to come sooner rather than later I suspect.

And it takes away a talking point that some Democrats can use against Republicans. But one thing it is not is a panacea for all the problems inside the Republican House today.

YOUNG (voice-over): Sheriff Bryan Bailey speaking about his department's so-called \"Goon Squad.\" In January, five sheriff's deputies and one police officer from a neighboring department forced their way into a home in Rankin County. That night, one deputy sent a text message asking, \"Are you all available for a mission,\" according to court documents. Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins were inside. The two black men were tortured, tased, and say they were sexually assaulted for two hours. At one point, a deputy put his gun inside Jenkins mouth, shooting him. Then, according to court documents, the \"Goon Squad\" tried to cover it up. Jenkins told CNN about the pain he still suffers.
