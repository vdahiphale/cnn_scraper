We will overcome it.\"That message from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a day after he hit the pause button on his controversial plan to overhaul Israel's judiciary. Mr. Netanyahu apparently giving into growing unrest in his country and growing international pressure, announcing on Monday he was holding off on the legislation until after the Knesset's Passover break in April. But he also made it clear the delay is only temporary, insisting reforms are needed. It didn't stop protesters on both sides from taking to the streets. Once again, the country's largest labor union is threatening new action if the prime minister revives the plan. CNN's Hadas Gold takes a look at how we got here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A political crisis and now a potential security crisis on the streets of Israel as the country was brought to a standstill by the largest general strike in Israeli history, sparked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to weaken the Supreme Court and his firing of the country's defense minister for speaking out against the overhaul. Fiery protests erupted Sunday and grew Monday, with demonstrators descending on Jerusalem from all over Israel, chanting for democracy as they gathered en masse in front of the country's supreme court and outside Israel's parliament, the Knesset, nearby.",

Now critics of these reforms fear that would destroy the independence of the Israeli judiciary. They would heart -- hurt minority rights and it would also hurt human rights in Israel, from everything from freedom of speech and expression to freedom of religion. GOLD (voice-over):  On Monday, flights were halted and Israel ports stopped work alongside universities, embassies abroad, malls and even McDonald's. The leader of Israel's largest union demanded the historic general strike to stop what he called \"this judicial revolution, this craziness.\" It seemed to have had the intended effect. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  Out of the desire to prevent a rift in the nation. I decided to suspend the second and third reading of the law in this session of the Knesset to give time to try and reach a broad agreement. GOLD (voice-over):  For Netanyahu, this may be more than just a political setback. Critics say the overhaul will help Netanyahu in his ongoing corruption trial, a charge he denies.

We are brotherly people.\" With the country in chaos, there are fears now that this divisiveness could still lead to bloodshed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If anything right now, the coalition -- and including the ministers likeItamar Ben Gvir and national security minister -- are vowing that these reforms will happen whether or not the negotiations are successful. And that's something that Benjamin Netanyahu echoed, saying that these reforms will happen in some form or another in the next parliamentary session. Ben-Gvir was clear that Netanyahu promised him that, if the negotiations don't work, that then they will push through the reforms as they are currently planned, which is considered rather extreme for a wide swath of Israeli society, according to recent -- according to recent polling. But I mean, they're still going to open up negotiations right now. We are hearing from Israeli media reports that negotiating teams are being drafted amongst the coalition government and the opposition leaders and that they should be meeting with the Israeli president, who is expected to act as mediator. But keep in mind the time here; the next session starts in just about a month. It ends on the end of July. There's a lot of work to be done to try and come to some sort of compromise. And of course, even being able to reach any sort of compromise reform, I think, will be a very difficult task for all parties involved. And I don't think that even a compromise reform will help tamp down on these protesters, who say that they are going to continue taking to the streets even during this pause. They essentially do not believe Benjamin Netanyahu when he says he will have negotiations. They want to continue their protests until they see these -- this overhaul completely taken off the table.

Now. We did. Actually hear from the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, that they do expect that the prime minister will be invited to Washington at some point for a visit after Passover. But no date has been set. And we haven't heard anything from Washington, saying that for sure the prime minister has been invited. But even just the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu talks about this long friendship with the U.S. President Joe Biden has not yet been invited yet goes to show you sort of the sensitivity of the situation here, that he hasn't been invited to Washington, hasn't been invited to the UAE. There is a lot of concern amongst Israel's allies about what these reforms are doing to Israeli democracy and what it's doing to Israel's status, as it continuously tries to boast that it is the only vibrant democracy in the Middle East.",

The last one last Thursday had 120,000 people, according to the interior ministry. It may or may not be larger than that. We simply don't know yet. But the main concern from the government's perspective, Becky, is that they are worried there  could be an increase in violence and that is because there was violence over the weekend in an unrelated environmental protest that ended up in pitched battles between demonstrators and the police. Now the interior ministry says there's about 1,000 hardcore troublemakers effectively that are scattered around the country. But there is a real concern that they could focus on this demonstration later on today. The unions have called for dialogue with the government. The government has agreed to that dialogue but not agreed to even discuss making a U-turn on what effectively is this movement from 62 to 64 in terms of the pensionable age, which is very shortly going to end up on the statute books once it clears the constitutional council. That is the only roadblock politically in terms of the legislation that is faced. But of course, the political consequences for Emmanuel Macron and his government in the National Assembly could be longer term. And that is really what the unions are now focusing on, is trying to get a dialogue going on perhaps a wider range of issues to do with the economics reform that Macron is trying to bring to France, whilst the unions, of course, trying to cling to more old-fashioned, in Macron's view, idea of how the economy here should be structured. But there is a great deal of anger on the streets that is carnival atmosphere as you can see, at the moment. But in the past -- and this is the 10th day of these formal demonstrations, we've seen spontaneous demonstrations here, particularly since last Thursday week, Becky, when the government rammed legislation through without a National Assembly vote.

And from there, the fire raged out of control, killing at least 39 people, injuring dozens of others, other migrants there at the National Migration Institute. And this comes after months and months of frustration for many migrants, especially Venezuelan and South American migrants, who have really struggled to be able to get to the United States, can cross the border at the end there, to request asylum here in the United States. There have been -- we have spoken over the over the last few months with hundreds of migrants, who have essentially been camped out in this Mexican border town, waiting for the opportunity to cross into the United States to request asylum. So the news that they would be deported and sent back elsewhere is the kind of news that has caused a great deal of frustration for many of those migrants. But this is a tragic case here, where at least 39 people killed in this fire, dozens more injured. The Mexican government says that the cause of the fire is still under investigation.
