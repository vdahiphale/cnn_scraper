Another huge endorsement, too, is the endorsement of the Koch Network, which goes, you know, not just picking up the backing of a massive conservative organization, but what I think is really key for Nikki Haley here is just the organizational grassroots power that the Koch Network has particularly, and that they're going to deploy in New Hampshire on her behalf.So I think that, look, you know, I think we've all been kind of I don't know if presuming is the right word, but thinking that Donald Trump is on the way to getting the Republican nomination again. But it is still too early to count Nikki Haley out. And as Jeff said, she does seem to be peaking at the right time. And what I find really interesting is that she started to have her momentum, I feel like started to rise after the first debate, where she started to do very well and she hasn't dipped.

Why haven't you expunged my impeachment? And so it was a very tense phone call. But my colleague Paul Kane reminded me this morning that this is a similar interpretation that McCarthy had after January 6, when he said that he had a very -- he, you know, cursed out the president after January 6, saying, what were you doing? What were you thinking? And then the president had said on the record that, no, that was not how that phone call went. So it's just very interesting in their relationship.
