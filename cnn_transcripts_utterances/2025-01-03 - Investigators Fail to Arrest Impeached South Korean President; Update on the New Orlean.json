Details of that dramatic standoff from Seoul.Residents and visitors return to Bourbon Street with a multi-state investigation into the New Orleans attack now underway. And as Israeli strikes continue to pound Gaza, Palestinians face more than one battle with winter settling in. And we do begin with developing news out of South Korea. Investigators are now slamming the brakes on their effort to detain the country's impeached president. Now, they arrived at his official residence hours ago trying to execute an arrest warrant against Yoon Seok Yeol as hundreds protested nearby. After a dramatic standoff with the presidential security detail, the operation was put on hold for safety concerns. Yoon is facing charges of abuse of power and orchestrating a rebellion following a short-lived martial law he imposed last month. Mike Valerio is monitoring developments from the streets of Seoul and he joins us now. I mean, look, the description that CNN now has of this standoff, it's quite grave. I mean, they're talking about having encountered a human wall of about 200 soldiers protecting the president. What is the latest from where you are right now?",

      "sentences": "And we want to focus on that new reporting. Two hundred members of the president's security team and armed members of the military presenting themselves as a human shield preventing the arrest and detention of South Korea suspended president, Yoon Seok Yeol. So the latest, Paula, is that investigators and prosecutors are huddling to figure out how do we do this? How do we bring in the elected president of South Korea, suspended president of South Korea, in for questioning about criminal charges related to martial law that he declared a month ago? So, there's that. And as we zoom in to look at supporters of Yoon SeokYeol who have crowded around his official residence, we're only a couple hundred meters away from where it is, the second bucket of things that are happening right now is his impeachment trial. We have new reporting that January 14th is going to be the first trial session poll of the impeachment saga that involves Yoon Seok Yeol. So that's not this Tuesday or the following Tuesday whereby law, Yoon Seok Yeol is required to show up. But, you know, the law requires a lot of things. The law requires him to cooperate with this investigation, and so far, he hasn't done so. So it's an open question and sort of drama that's held in stasis whether or not suspended president Yoon Seok Yeol is going to show up to his first impeachment trial session on January 14th. Meantime, everybody here, a couple hundred, low thousand number strong, certainly considers this a victory. Yoon Seok Yeol called everybody out here as soon as this arrest warrant was issued on Tuesday, and he said, you know what, all my supporters, I'm fighting to the end, I'm not giving myself up. All you out here, you got to make the job of law enforcement so much harder to bring me in. And it seems as though for the time being, they were successful in that, Paula.",

A disturbing new video shows just how frightening Wednesday's attack was. Jabbar speeding down Bourbon Street in a white pickup truck. You're about to see it there. Pedestrians celebrating the New Year and then having to scramble to get out of the way. Another video obtained exclusively by CNN appears to show Jabbar putting a white pole with a black top into the back of the truck. Police say an ISIS flag was attached to the trailer hitch during that attack. The FBI is focusing on the suspect's apparent interest in ISIS as the motive. CNN's Ryan Young has our details.

That's a soft target in and of itself. You have to take a look at your security plan.

You know, normally those are up. By day it will be down because the motorcade will go through that area, just a way in which you can allow emergency vehicles or authorized vehicles in but at the same time stop all other traffic.And so they got to come up with a plan that really allows for some flexibility. You've got businesses there that need deliveries. It's residential, you got people that live in the area.
