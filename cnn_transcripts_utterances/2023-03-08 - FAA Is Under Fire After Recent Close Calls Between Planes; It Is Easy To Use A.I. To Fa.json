And it's clear sky turbulence, Ryan. So, you're flying along, it looks like a beautiful day, and then the plane suddenly plunges a thousand feet, 2,000 feet, 3,000 feet. I mean, that one that was heading from Austin on a Lufthansa flight to Germany that Matthew McConaughey's wife, Camila, was on, she took a video of it. She said it plunged 4,000 feet.

The first thing the pilot or the flight attendant says is, please keep your seatbelt fasten while you're in your seat. These things happen. They happen not uncommonly. Usually, it's relatively mild. But when you see accidents, when you see -- I'm sorry, injuries, it's usually a result of people not being restrained properly. And I think the reason we're seeing more of it now is more because of social media and access. And people, without their phones, just like you're describing. It's scary, just like you're describing. So, the first thing you're going to do is want to record it, you're to want -- you're going to want to understand what happened.

Climate change is strengthening clear air turbulence at all flight levels in all seasons everywhere around the world where there's a jet stream. That is worrisome, of course.

You had a long slide as planes got more crowded, and then airlines switched from -- to slight larger planes.So that enabled the FAA to deal with the huge bulk of air traffic controller retirements in the 2000s and try to get back on a better control. So, it's not overcrowding, necessarily. Maybe (INAUDIBLE).

So, you had this atypical workforce, people who are all going to retire after 30, 35 years end. That happened in the mid-2000s. We are reconstructing the workforce now.The problem is that you can't do that remotely during COVID. They had to cut (INAUDIBLE) 2021, I believe, for COVID. And they're trying to increase -- right now, they're aiming for about 1,000 new controllers in the academy a year. That's a two-year apprenticeship and work after that. One thing that's going to be a problem, we're probably going to have another government shutdown this year because the Republicans and Democrats are so far apart in the budget. And that has a ruinous effect on the air traffic control academy in Oklahoma. A two-week shutdown means they closed the entire academy, sent everybody home, canceled all the contracts with the instructors, and then two weeks later, new contracts. You lose half a year-worth of control trainees every time a government shuts down. So, that is something else to watch out for this year. On the pilot side --",
