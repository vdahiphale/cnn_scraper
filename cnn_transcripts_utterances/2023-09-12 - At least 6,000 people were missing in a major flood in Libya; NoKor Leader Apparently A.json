Thousands now confirmed dead in Libya after heavy rainfall triggered catastrophic flooding that swept away entire neighborhoods. And then in Morocco, help is starting to arrive in some of the hardest hit areas since that devastating earthquake Friday. But for many residents, help did not arrive in time. Plus, Kim Jong-un has now crossed into Russia where he's expected to meet with Vladimir Putin amid concerns the two leaders could be planning on arms deal. We begin with another devastating natural disaster in North Africa. Just days after the deadly earthquake in Morocco, Libya is now coping with major flooding that has wiped out entire villages and reportedly killed thousands of people. Video from the region, you can see it there, shows buildings collapsed, cars submerged, torrents of water rushing through the streets. The Libyan National Army and a health official say more than 2,000 people are dead, 5,000 to 6,000 missing. Now of course it's impossible to verify those numbers as many areas are still unreachable and without communication. The city of Derna was especially hard hit. Authorities say two dams collapsed, three bridges were destroyed and phone lines remained down. The storm system dumped about eight months worth of rain on the region in just a single day. It caused catastrophic flooding in Greece just last week. The pictures are just staggering. We go live now to CNN's Eleni Giokos, who's been following developments for us from Dubai. Now, shockingly, the head of Libya's emergency and ambulance services admitted to CNN that there was no warning for people, no warning to evacuate, to get to higher ground, or to really understand what was coming at them.",

People woke up in the middle of the night when the storm hit, seeing their homes flooded, some say up to three meters, and then desperately trying to find a way to get out. And of course, we've seen these images of just water everywhere. Cars were swept away, people swept away. So many areas are now isolated, making it very difficult for search and rescue teams to try and figure out who they need to save and what is the next process. I mean, some of the search and rescue teams can't even get access and communications up with teams that are currently on the ground. So we're talking about immense catastrophe here, exacerbating the situation. You have two dams that were burst in where we're seeing now the epicenter of the big tragedy in the city of Derna and that of course causing more pressure water coming through filling up the valley causing more catastrophe. I mean what it seems like you've got roads that are basically and homes that are melting away with this water authorities are telling us there are still bodies lying around so when we say that the death toll now is over 2000 difficult to ascertain the number at this point in time between 5 and 6,000 people, Paula, still missing. You got the U.N. on the ground, Turkey, UAE, as well as Qatar sending assistance; storm Daniel causing havoc not only now what we've seen in Libya but also in Greece and Turkey just a few days ago and now moving towards northern Egypt the next two days they're expecting an extra 50 millimeters of rainfall to understand sort of what kind of rainfall the city of Derna has in the month of September it barely gets to 10 millimeters so we're talking about numbers that haven't been seen and felt before right now. Search and rescue is the most important thing to try and get access to people. Phone lines are down, internet is down. Power lines are down, making it a lot more difficult for the people there.",

Eleni Giokos, I mean you'll continue to follow this story for us, I appreciate it.To Morocco now, rescuers are working urgently to find survivors in the rubble more than three days after the country was hit by a devastating earthquake. And the death toll has now climbed past 2,800, with that number still expected to rise in the days ahead. Aid has been slow to reach some of the hardest hit remote villages, where roads have been destroyed or blocked by debris. State media report Morocco's military has now reached the epicenter with aid and equipment to help clear the roads. Now, according to UNICEF, initial reports show about 100,000 children have been directly impacted by Friday's quake. For so many in Morocco, their lives have been, of course, changed forever. CNN's Nada Bashir is in the hard-hit area where residents are losing hope of finding any more survivors. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Stone by stone, hour by hour, the desperate search for survivors pushes on. The silence in this remote mountainous village, punctured only by the wails of those who survived, now left to mourn. (on-camera): Well, for the rescue team here, this really is a race against time. There is a woman and her 12-year-old daughter buried beneath the rubble and fall, their family waiting anxiously for news of whether they have survived Friday's earthquake. They are quickly losing hope. (voice-over): Berzika has already buried 19 members of her family. Now she fears she will soon have to bury her niece, Sheyma. On Saturday morning, we could still hear her voice, she tells me. She was alive. Now we can't hear her. They took too long to get here. Until now we've been digging through the rubble with our bare hands. If help had arrived sooner, we could have rescued them in time. Though small in size, the village of Imi N'Tala was among the hardest hit by the earthquake. The deadliest Morocco has suffered in decades. But three days on, rescue teams have only just arrived, the high mountainous range simply too remote, the roads, up until now, still obstructed by debris from the quake. And with time running out, rescuers say this has now become a recovery operation.",

Kim Jong-un gave him the red carpet treatment, showing off the full range of his weapons capability in a military parade and an arms expo. South Korean intelligence says a second Russian delegation visited at the start of August, and a Russian plane believed to be carrying unknown military supplies left Pyongyang on August 8th. But Moscow and Pyongyang both deny any arms deal. CARL SCHUSTER, FORMER DIRECTOR, U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND'S JOINT INTELLIGENCE CENTER: North Korea makes good what I call heavy industrial weapons. Artillery and the ammunition is very good. It's very similar to Russian designs, in fact it uses the same calibers as the Russians. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Meaning certain North Korean ammunition could be used in Russian weapons immediately. The Biden administration believes North Korea already delivered infantry rockets and missiles for use in Ukraine by Russian mercenary group Wagner late last year. As for North Korea, U.S. officials believe it could gain satellite technology or nuclear-powered submarine technology in return.

But the question right now is whether or not -- whether or not Moscow is actually willing to transfer some of its most closely guarded secrets in the military. In the past, they had been reluctant to do so even to close allies like China, but obviously the dynamic has changed substantially.And right now, they do desperate need ammunition that North Korea, one of the world's most militarized nations that haven't fought a war for a long time, they have a surplus of that. So that is why there is growing concern from the West. But standing where I am, China has not publicly commented on this Putin and Kim meeting, actually, the daily press briefing by the foreign ministry. The spokeswoman was just asked about this meeting, and she simply ignored the question. I think if and when she does respond, she is probably going to strike this delicate balance given China's very much interdependence with the West economically. That's why I think they're going to stick to their usual talking points about their neutrality on the war in Ukraine while supporting other countries' independent foreign policy that includes opposition to global hegemony. Because when you think about it, geopolitically and ideologically, North Korea, Russia and China, they do share the same grievances against this current world order dominated by the West. And they have not been shy about trying to reshape it. That's also why at the U.N. Security Councils where Russia and China do wield veto powers, they have been working together to block U.S.- led efforts to impose and strengthen sanctions against North Korea over its recent missile testing activities. Instead, they have been pointing a finger at the U.S. for its military presence and activities in the region as underlying reasons for North Korea's behavior. And that obviously is a similar argument we have heard from Russia on the invasion of Ukraine and something that Chinese and North Korean state media have parroted as well, Paula.",

It's not just about a potential arms deal, which, of course, would be in itself significant, given the depletion in terms of its equipment that Russia has seen in Ukraine, given the strain that it's put on its defense industry, but it's also about this sort of multipolar world which Putin also mentioned today, this axis that is being formed around these anti-Western anti- sanctions ideologies.I think in that sense, North Korea would fit into that, which is why the optics of this forum, which Russia very much wants to be seen as an international event and this meeting happening on the sidelines of that, are crucially important for Putin. But, Paula, he's also being confronted with the impact of the war on his economy. He was asked in the Q&amp;A after this session about the ruble collapse, which has fallen by some 30 percent this year, and he very much played it down, saying the situation is manageable. It's not insurmountable, but he is facing this and of course facing re-election next year. Paula.",

Given everything that has been said about the China-Russia relationship, I mean, where do you see this? Because Putin, just in his speech right there, made it a point to single out the close relationship with China. He, in fact, said that it was the close personal and political relationship that he had with China's leader that made economic partnership possible.

But on the other hand, Xi Jinping, their top leader, has basically stuck to his friend Putin that no limit partnership very much remains strong even after the invasion of Ukraine.And Putin, of course, is coming here next month to attend the Belt and Road Forum. And that would be one of the few foreign trips he's now able to take. And just interestingly, Paula, I, you know, noticed the location of this forum, Vladivostok. That actually used to be Chinese territory. And it was only ceded to the Russian empire back in the 1800s. So in China, there are still quite some Chinese people who still hold a grudge against Russian over that. But look at that. Over there, you know, at the forum, their leaders are sharing the same stage with Putin and also with Kim talking about this united front.

Now the police arrested these two men, the researcher and another man, 20 year old in Scotland and a 30 year old in Oxfordshire near London. Back in March they were brought to London for questioning, released on bail but expected to be charged under the Official Secrets Act. So these are very serious and significant charges. There are conservative members of Parliament who actually have been sanctioned by Russia and hadn't been informed about this case. There's upset in the conservative ranks there, upset that a researcher could potentially have been providing information to China. The researcher himself, named in a British newspaper over the weekend into the beginning of the week, actually released a statement saying that essentially to call him a spy for China is wrong, that is not a case. He says the opposite is true that he in fact has been trying to tell people, teach people about the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese embassy in London pushing back themselves very strongly that there could be any truth in these allegations that there was a researcher in parliament with high security access and access to senior members, senior conservative members of parliament. Any idea that that's true, China says, is a fabrication, malicious. This is clearly something that will get more debate going forward when the two men are expected to appear in court in October, but until then the precise charges against them aren't clear.

He's also the author of \"Putin's Wars from Chechnya to Ukraine.\" And he joins me now from Broadstairs in England. Good to have you in on these issues, as Putin is speaking this hour from Vladivostok. Perhaps we are a bit reductive, though, about the war in Ukraine. It's always about winning, losing, defense, offense. Is it -- that makes it easier for us to digest, no doubt. But what about the nuance and the deeper analysis? I note that to that end, you say the front line really doesn't betray much about what's going on. Why not? MARK GALEOTTI, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, MAYAK INTELLIGENCE: Well, I think it's this obsession that we've acquired with exactly how many yards have been moved forward today and how many miles and so forth. Obviously, yes, it matters. Ukraine is committed to regaining all its occupied territories. But I think what we sometimes miss in that is precisely all the other indices. It's not just about territory. It's about positioning, it's about how much of the other sides' stocks of advanced weapons have been degraded, and so forth. And when one puts all these different calculations together, it's clear that while Ukraine is undoubtedly winning, there's no way of getting around that, it does suggest that this is precisely, as you've already said, going to be a rather long war than some people rather so triumphalistically expected.",

I think he's now reached a situation where he's not going to be winning some grand victory on the battlefield as things stand.However, he hopes that he can extort some kind of a settlement that he can then spin as a triumph. If he can outlast, outlast Ukraine's will and capacity to keep fighting, but even more outlast the west, because the critical potential point of failure is us. If we decide that we've had enough, if we decide to stop or scale down the amount of financial and military support we provide Ukraine, then Kyiv finds itself in a much, much tougher position. So, precisely, for -- from Putin's point of view, actually, a stalemate is very good. So, I mean, he will continue to throw soldiers into the fight. He almost certainly will launch a new mobilization wave. All really intended to try and deny the Ukrainians the chance at that kind of decisive victory.",

It's not about just simply gathering together recalcitrant 40, 50-year-olds who last saw a gun 30 years ago. And it's also about, and who's going train these people? Where they're going to house them? What weapons have they got? I mean, there's a limit to how much old 1970s and 1980s kids they can drag out of warehouses and so forth.To be honest, I think a more credible figure is between 200 and 300,000. Now that's still a lot of manpower to have at your disposal. But given that, as I say, these are not going to be good troops by any means, all they can really do is at best hold the line.",

      "sentences": "I think so. I mean, I think we have to realize there's two different threats here. One is from the public. We're not likely to see grand protests, because remember, this is an increasingly brutal authoritarian police state. If you go out and protest, you're almost certainly going to be arrested. If you're lucky, you're going to be fined. If you're unlucky, you're going to prison and going to be roughed up by the police.So, I mean, I think that there is a concern about not pushing the population too far, but we have to keep that in -- in sort of limited constraints. Secondly, though, it's the elite. And that's, I think, what the Prigozhin mutiny really brought up. It's really striking how many within the military and the security operators did not really want to get involved. They didn't want to join the mutiny, but they didn't want to protect Putin either. So, I think already we're beginning to see a certain kind of calculus. People thinking, what is more dangerous? Letting Putin drag this country into increasing chaos and misery or actually going against him. So far, at least the risks in turning against Putin are greater, but the longer this war goes on, the more the misery accrues at home, then people may well start to change their minds about that.",
