A team from the World Health Organization is calling it a death zone. U.S. President Joe Biden calls for two-state solution as he rejects calls for a ceasefire. We will look at his op-ed in The Washington Post. And the most powerful rocket ever built explodes minutes after blasting off, and some are calling the test flights success. We're following reports of a large explosion at U.N.-run school in Gaza being used as a shelter. One U.N. official called the carnage horrifying. And I must caution, the video is graphic. The source of the blast has not been determined and no confirmed casualty figures are yet available. The Israeli military says it's aware of the explosion but had no further comments. We will have more on this in just a moment. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization sends a team to Gaza's largest hospital on Saturday. They described Al-Shifa as a death zone, filled with terrified people. They said a mass grave with 80 bodies was right outside the entrance. Inside, the choking dust and smoke. The WHO team counted 291 patients, including 32 infants, in extremely critical condition. Al-Shifa officials say patients and staff have been ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military. Israel denies issuing such an order. CNN's Paula Hancocks covered the Middle East for years as our Jerusalem correspondent and joins us now live from Seoul. Paula, a WHO team visited the beleaguered Al-Shifa Hospital and we understand there are more gruesome scenes coming out of the Jabalya refugee camp after the blast there and another school in Norther Gaza was also hit earlier. What more can you tell us about these events.",

As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace. The president and administration officials have instead pushed for humanitarian pauses for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but also to get aid into Gaza. Now, the president went on to say that Israel should respect humanitarian law and protect innocent civilians. The president also stressed that a two-state solution is the way forward in the Israel- Hamas conflict, reiterating a message from earlier in the week when he said that that was the solution. And he also went on to note the ongoing efforts to get hostages out of Gaza who are held by Hamas. But above all, the president taking the moment to remind Americans that conflicts unfolding both in Israel and in Ukraine affect U.S. national security. That has been a message that he sent repeatedly, including last month in a primetime address when the White House was also asking for billions in funding to support both Israel and Ukraine. Now, that funding has not been met yet and the president taking the moment on Saturday to remind Americans why these conflicts abroad are important for the United States in a key moment.

You know, I think that he has certainly given broader support to Israel, in effect, more rope to Israel than you might have seen under Barack Obama, but he has also been more critical of Israel and more willing to exert pressure on them both publicly and privately to restrain their behavior and also to envision what comes after than you would have seen from Donald Trump.And, you know, it is a lonely island, in effect, that he is on. You know, this is an issue that, as we've talked about before, genuinely divides his coalition. I mean, it is striking that if you look at polling consistently, Democrats divide about 50-50 on whether they support military aid to Israel, whereas Republicans are predominantly in support of it. And their verse is true on Ukraine, where Democrats are preponderantly in support of aid to Ukraine and most Republican voters now reflecting kind of the influence of Trump on the party oppose it. So, this is something that is difficult for him. He is also in alliance with a figure in Netanyahu. The Democrats have historically not fully trusted for good reason. I mean, he has identified very much with the Republican Party in American politics and his government is one, the Netanyahu government, that is well to the right of what most Democrats would want to see, you know, in Israeli policy. So, Biden is trying to thread a very lonely course here and one in which he is balancing both support and constraint or restraint on Israel and one that, you know, threatens to leave him, you know, with a disappointed reaction on both sides.",

There's a much more critical view of Israel's behavior.And as I said, you know, to some extent, I mean, Netanyahu is reaping what he has sown. I mean, he is going back to the Iran deal when he openly lobbied in U.S. politics to oppose the policy of Barack Obama, the way he interacted with Trump, the way he interacted against Obama in 2012 with Mitt Romney. He is not a figure that many Democratic leaders have a lot of faith in. And the distrust, I think, you know, is spilling over in terms of what we're seeing in the public reaction on this. You know, Biden's approval on handling this is underwater, more disapproved than approved, but it's better than his approval on many other issues. What he needs ultimately is a resolution to the fighting and a movement toward the diplomatic aftermath, whatever that is going to look like. You know, you can see in that op-ed and elsewhere, he is putting more pressure than he had before this attack on the Israeli government to begin something that looks like a negotiation toward a two-state solution. And I suspect he will move heaven and earth to ensure that something like that begins at any, you know, whenever the active hostilities have cooled down.

They're going to be posing an unexpected and very credible challenge to the ruling DPP. The current vice president is the presidential candidate. He was considered a shoe-in by many analysts until this surprise union between these two opposition parties, which notably tend to have a more pro-Beijing or at least pro-cooperation with Beijing's stance, whereas the DPP has long said that you have to stand up to China with strength.

And the contest is closely watched around the world because it beats a far right candidate, Javier Milei, who is a disruptor and a populist candidate, against the finance minister and the career politician, Sergio Massa.Sergio Massa is currently serving as Argentina's finance minister and has pretty much built his career in and out of public office. On the other side, Javier Milei, his challenger, has only entered politics only 36 months ago. And before that, he was working as an economist for the private sector. A win for Milei, who is clearly hailing from the hard, far right, would mean a change of momentum for conservatives worldwide. Milei has associated himself with the likes of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Donald Trump in the United States, and decisively move Argentina to the right. For example, Javier Milei is proposing to completely privatize the Argentinean public health sector and also to support private education in a country that has always supported public education. Another way this election could transform Argentina for good is because Javier Milei is completely dollarize the economy of Argentina by getting rid of the Argentina Central Bank and replacing the Argentinean peso with the U.S. dollars. Argentina is once again battling record high inflation and struggling to repay international debtors. The plan to switch the currency from the Argentinean peso to the U.S. dollars has triggered a debate among economic think tanks. And, for example, it's not so hard to imagine the Cato Institute in the United States considers dollarization the best way for Argentina to finally provide the reforms that the country so desperately needs. However, his opponent, Sergio Massa, is not leading in the polls but has already pulled up a surprise victory in the first round of the Argentinean presidential election and is here for a fight. In just a few hours, the polls will open in Argentina and by Monday at this hour, we will know who the next president of the country will be.",

And someday, the ultimate goal is for this rocket to allow and carry up to 100 humans to the surface of Mars and ultimately colonize Mars and make humanity multi- planetary. That's the goal. But, first, SpaceX has to get this thing up into orbit. And the test flight on Saturday was a success in that 33 engines did fire, all of them. The launch pad survived. There was successful stage separation between the booster and the spacecraft on top. And it did make it up far past where it flew on its first failed flight test back in April. It made it all the way up to the edge of space. But then something happened, and that's why this test flight was also a failure. There were two explosions, both the booster and the spacecraft exploded after separating, and the spacecraft, if all had gone according to plan, was supposed to make almost a complete lap of Planet Earth and then splash down in the Pacific Ocean. That is what's characterized as a mishap by the FAA. They are now investigating a mishap with SpaceX. It's an investigation that SpaceX will lead, but it's now unclear exactly how long that will take before SpaceX is given the green light to fly again.

      "sentences": "Now, those remarks are in line with Donald Trump's increasingly vitriolic rhetoric that we've heard from him on the campaign trail of late. Remember, last week in New Hampshire, Donald Trump received a wave of backlash for calling the political left being like vermin and saying he wanted to root them out.Now, one more just really interesting thing I want to put your attention to is what Donald Trump did after his remarks. He got off the stage and went into the crowd. He signed hats and shook their hands. And that is very rare for the former president. He typically will immediately exit the stage and start getting into his motorcade after he wraps up these speeches. And so a big moment for those in the room, and I think it really underscores the aggressive attitude that Donald Trump and his campaign are taking to Iowa in this final stretch.

The organization, IQAir, which monitors air quality, categorized air in the Indian capital as, quote, very unhealthy.The mix of car emissions, construction dust and smoke is made worse every year by cold temperatures, which trap toxic particles in the air. So far, efforts like banning construction and limiting heavy vehicles on the roads hasn't mitigated the problem for long. While recently, India's Supreme Court banned crop residue burning to try to cut down on smog. But many farmers are defying the order and winds are sweeping the contaminants into the cities, which further degrades the air quality there. And we stay in India where the Cricket World Cup Final is underway, India going head to head with Australia. And you can see fans there, wow, so many of them, pouring into Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabaad, which seats some 132,000 people. Australia won the toss and elected to field first. We will bring you more updates on the state of play as we get them. And in Brazil, Taylor Swift delayed her Saturday concert in Rio de Janeiro as scorching heat grips the country. The move comes after a fan died before her Friday show in Rio. Swift says the news left her with a, quote, shattered heart. The high temperatures have led Brazilian authorities to make new rules for public events. They now say organizers should provide free water and allow attendees to bring water into venues. Organizers will also need to provide enough space to ensure a quick emergency response. The measures will be in place for at least 120 days. And thousands of wildfires are killing animals in nature reserves and indigenous communities in the Bolivian Amazon. Deer, rodents and several species of birds are dying from carbon monoxide poisoning. Right now, firefighters and volunteers are working to put out nearly 100,000 fires. Environmental activists gathered in Bolivia's capital Friday to demand that more be done to prevent the fires. And one of the busiest travel periods of the year is just now kicking off for Americans and the weather is not going to make it any easier.
