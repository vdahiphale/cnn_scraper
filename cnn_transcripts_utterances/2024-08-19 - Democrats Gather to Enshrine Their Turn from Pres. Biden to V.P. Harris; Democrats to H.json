This is where it'll all happen, United Center, home of the city's beloved Bulls and Blackhawks. There it is right there, a majestic Chicago skyline on this beautiful Monday morning.And just hours from now, Democratic delegates and political heavyweights will fill this room that you're looking at right now. The goal, energize and unify the party around Vice President Kamala Harris with 78 days, just 78 days until Election Day. Today's theme is for the people. The party will highlight the stark differences between where Democrats want to take the country versus former President Donald Trump. President Biden will deliver the keynote address tonight. He will talk about his 50 years of public service and argue the Harris-Walz ticket is the natural successor to carry his legacy forward. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Jill Biden, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, former first lady, and Senator, Secretary of State, she will also take the stage tonight. Democrats are hoping to turn vibes into votes. For the first time, two major national polls show Harris beating Trump in a head to head matchup, but she says there is still a lot of work to do.

She's been a part of passing this legislative, this historic legislation to fully fund EPA. The first district of Illinois has some of the highest amount of lead service lines in any district in the nation. That money is now fully funded for that. I'm very grateful what President Biden said he was going to do. He's done it. He said he would nominate and put an African-American female on the Supreme Court. He's done that. And now he's also put an African-American female on the ticket as vice president. She served him and now he's serving her as supporting her to be the president.

There's not an isolation. There's been a route that's been proposed. Of course, it's going to grow. And I like to hear the young people having dissent that shows that our democracy is alive and well. We all don't have to do the same thing. We can all sing together get on the same page.And the question is we are now being able to nominate a prosecutor, a person that's upheld the law. The Republicans have to deal with a criminal, a person that's broken the law. I think there's going to be a stark divergent. For those that are protesting, I encourage them, raise your voice. It's a right that we have. And I've been all along seeking reconciliation so we can bring an end to this war and their right to raise their voices. And so let us keep that. But unlike our group, we're not going to storm the Capitol. That's what Donald Trump has done. They had Officer Sicknick killed, and they won't even mention Officer Sicknick at their Democratic Convention. I know it was an unfortunate attempt on his life, and they had a ceremony regarding that, but they also talk about Officer Sicknick. We cannot act like January 6th did not occur when the president of the United States could not come out onto the mall and address all of the American people. That was a dark day in American history.",

And you did hear from Israeli officials a short time ago that the meeting between Blinken and Netanyahu was constructive. Yes, but that's the U.S. and Israel, right? When you get to Hamas and Israel, the language, the rhetoric is quite different.And last night, just as Blinken was arriving in this country, Hamas released a statement accusing Israel of introducing new conditions, putting up new obstacles to an agreement. And then in the midst of that, you had an attempted suicide bombing here in Tel Aviv, not far from where we're standing right here, right now, and then Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for that. Only the bomber was killed. It could have been much worse. But this region, though fears of an immediate expansion of the war have dissipated somewhat, it's a tinderbox. And all it takes is a spark, right? And an attempted suicide bombing could be such a spark. There was an Israeli soldier killed on the northern border today. That could be a spark. That's the situation here. Those diplomatic efforts continue, though. Blinken's going to travel from here to Cairo to meet with other parties involved. And then you have a bigger group getting together on Thursday. But, Jim, it would take some progress, frankly, from both sides, right, to get this across the finish line. If we don't see that today, it doesn't mean the hope has disappeared. But the rest of the region is waiting, and I would say in quite a nervous state, Jim.",

O'SULLIVAN:  Hey, Jim. Yes, I mean there's going to be probably tens of thousands of protesters expected outside the arena. But when it comes to here on the convention floor, I mean, obviously the Democrats want to tell a story of remarkable unity and the party getting behind Harris. But for pro-Palestinian activists and demonstrators, they also want to bring that point up here on the convention floor and they want answers from Harris on Gaza.
