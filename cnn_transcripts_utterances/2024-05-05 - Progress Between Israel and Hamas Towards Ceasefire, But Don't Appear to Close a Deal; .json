Both U.S. and Israeli officials say, any agreement could take days to finalize.And adding to the pressure to end the fighting scenes, like this one. In Rafah, video shows a child being rescued from a damaged building after an Israeli airstrike on Saturday. In total, rescuers saved two children and two adults from the building. The death toll in Gaza is now more than 34,000, according to the Ministry of Health. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now with the latest on the negotiations. So, Paula, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kim, there's certainly a feeling that there has been more progress this weekend than where we were last weekend. But there is also a lot of caution on all sides, given the fact that we have been here before. That there have appeared to be significant progress made and then there was no agreement at the end.But what we're hearing at this point is that Bill Burns, the CIA director, was in Cairo on Friday. Now, the Egyptian officials have been key mediators in trying to secure the ceasefire, along with the Qataris. And we know that Hamas was in Cairo on Saturday. Now, we heard from a Hamas leader saying that they were coming with a positive spirit. Saying that they are determined to finalize the agreement. Now, the onus is on Hamas at this point, according to the Israelis and the Americans. They say that there is a proposal on the table. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has called it extremely generous on the behalf of Israel. So, at this point, we are waiting for some kind of response from Hamas, believing that that could come at any time. This, we understand, would be an agreement on the format, the framework of a deal which would come in stages. Now, we understand the latest proposal to be around about 33 hostages. We cannot give an exact number because that is unknown at this point. But those hostages would be women, it would be the elderly, the sick, the wounded, and that would be in return for a temporary ceasefire, a pause in fighting in Gaza. There would also be a number of Palestinian prisoners released in conjunction, to that. Now, the framework itself has had some difficulties along the way. There are certain demands that Hamas has been making that Israel was not willing to give. We know, for example, from an Israeli source that they have agreed now to allow those displaced to move back to their homes or what's left of their homes in Northern Gaza, that was one of the key demands by Hamas. So, really, what we're waiting for is whether or not this is a framework that Hamas can accept. Now, we have also heard from U.S. and Israeli officials to -- cautioning that even if Hamas does say yes, that's not the end of the deal. There are still details to be hammered out. It could still take several more days to try and finalize the finer points of this deal. But it is key that it will be in stages. So, if this first stage can be agreed to, there is certainly a hope that once the ceasefire is in place, it gives everybody room to try and discuss the next stages, which would be further hostages being released, including soldiers in return for further Palestinian prisoners. [04:05:00] And of course, the key element in all this is that any kind of ceasefire will allow humanitarian aid to get in, something that agencies say is absolutely imperative. Kim.",

Getting rid of Netanya, this is one part, and obviously releasing the hostages, which is another part. Not always together. None of them is calling to end the war and say, I don't see it getting more momentum than it got until now, which is very impressive. But it's not enough.Elections will be only if they will -- if Netanyahu will lose his majority in the parliament. There is no other way to get there. And his government, his coalition seems, until now, very solid. Would he go to an agreement right now, he might lose this majority, and that's exactly what stops now the negotiation because Netanyahu is more concerned about his government rather than the deal. The deal might bring the fall of this government because the right wingers threaten him that they would leave the coalition and then he doesn't have a government. It depends now on Israel and on the United States. Unlikely what Blinken, said as far as we hear it here, the main obstacle right now is Netanyahu and he tries to sabotage it. No other way to describe it. He published two announcements over the weekend on the name of sources, anonymous sources, in which he claimed that Israel will go to Rafah, in any case, and it will not bring the end of the war. This is sabotaging the deal. And this, in my view, is almost criminal, because Israel has now the last chance to release the hostages. And a very big chance for creating a new reality in the Middle East. I don't exaggerate because Saudi Arabia is waiting. Hezbollah is waiting. We are really in a turning point, very dramatic one, and this government might spoil it all, and this will never be forgiven. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Biden needed that vote. In order for him to win, he needs an alliance of young voters, minority voters and women. And if he loses one of those constituencies, and the young voters are key within that, then he really is in trouble.It's interesting that they say that they're going to vote for Trump. I think the likelihood is that they just won't vote at all. This issue around protest is not a wedge issue. Trump is likely to come down, or he has said that he would just close down entirely. So, it's not something that's just going to divide the party.

Yet the Israeli military still hasn't taken responsibility for the attack. Jeremy Diamond has more on what CNN has learned. And we just want to warn you, his report does contain distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This grainy home video is the closest Mona Audatallah (ph) will ever get to seeing her 10-year-old daughter. A stack of school certificates, a wardrobe of her favorite clothes, the perfume she used to wear, all that remains of the daughter Mona poured everything into. There is no Shahed (ph) now. Every time she came in, she said, Mom. I would say my soul, my soul, my soul is gone. Shahed (ph) was one of ten children killed when an Israeli airstrike hit the crowded street in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp where she was playing with her friends. Her pink pants impossible to miss among the small bodies splayed around a foosball table in the chaotic aftermath. Two weeks later, the Israeli military still won't take responsibility for the strike that killed her. CNN provided the IDF with the coordinates and time of the attack, based on metadata from two different phones in the immediate aftermath. The IDF said they did not have a record of that strike. They said, they carried out a strike at a different time than described, and that the collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF. The IDF makes great efforts to mitigate harm to the civilian population from areas where strikes are being carried out. Evidence recovered and documented by CNN at the scene of the strike paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. This circuit board and bits of shrapnel, walls and shop steps distinctively pockmarked, and a small crater barely a foot wide. All pointing three munitions' experts to the same conclusion. The carnage was likely caused by a precision guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. CHRIS COBB-SMITH, WEAPONS EXPERT:  I've seen these strikes so many times. There's a relatively small crater in the road. There's no large shrapnel holes or fragmentation holes that would have been -- which would have been caused by, say, a mortar round or an artillery round. The fragmentation is consistent.",

In the U.S., the University of Virginia says at least 25 people were arrested during a protest on Saturday. Police were brought out in to clear out an antiwar encampment. The university says, police were met with agitation chanting and violent gestures. A group of protesters stood up and walked out of Indiana University's graduation ceremony on Saturday night. CNN's Whitney Wild has the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT:  Here at Indiana University, what we saw was dozens of students stand up as Indiana University President Pamela Whitten began speaking. And while it did not disrupt the ceremony, people that we spoke to who were inside Memorial Stadium here in Bloomington said that they could at least hear the protest. Our understanding, based on those conversations as well as social media video, is that the students stood up, made this audible protest and then walked out. It was a big question here, to what degree protests might disrupt the ceremony, if at all, for two reasons. The first is because Indiana University had set up a protest zone outside Memorial Stadium, but also because they have had pretty robust protests here in Bloomington. It was in April that 33 students were arrested at Indiana University at a pro-Palestine protest. And what we've seen all across the country is that schools that have seen those protests, in many cases, have seen disruptions to their ceremonies. For example, at the University of Michigan, pro-Palestine protesters were able to actually disrupt the ceremony briefly before they were escorted out by Michigan State Police. So, again, that was the big question here at I.U. in Bloomington, Indiana. 41,000 people inside that stadium. And our understanding is that just dozens of students stood up, again, as the president was speaking and then filed out. It was audible, but it was not disruptive.

Still to come, it's the season of dazzling spring flowers. And in the Netherlands, tulips are taking the spotlight, but not all is as it seems. We'll explain why coming up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [04:50:00] BRUNHUBER:  It's tulip season in the Netherlands. At this time of year, the flowers can be seen blooming at their best. But as CNN's Lynda Kinkade explains, these days, they're falling victim to rising temperatures, wetter weather, and border controls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  Springtime is bloom time for tulips, the flower, a sign of unconditional love, rebirth and forgiveness. From afar, these majestic blooms in the Netherlands look like a perfect field of budding pink and red tulips, but up close they're suffering. These fields have grown generations of tulips with Arjan Smit's family overseeing operations since 1940, but climate change is changing their production year after year.",

And we were planting also four hectares -- four percent, of the total less.KINKADE (voice-over):  Smit says, with this change, they'll lose at least 13 percent of next year's bulbs. Higher temperatures add more water vapor to the Earth's atmosphere and cause wetter winters.",

When Smit began this work 30 years ago, he says they only watered the fields two to four times in spring. Now, he says sometimes they have to water them every week, but the changing climate is not the only challenge. Farmers say, Brexit and its increased border controls could have negative repercussions for tulip farmers.",
