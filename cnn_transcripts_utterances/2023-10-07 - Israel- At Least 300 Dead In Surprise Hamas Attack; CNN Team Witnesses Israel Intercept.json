America's closest ally in the Middle East and its only democracy is under attack as we speak in a highly coordinated stage terrorist attack by Hamas. An attack on Israeli civilians, unlike anything that Israel has ever seen, according to the Prime Minister of Israel.Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu is vowing to take, quote, mighty vengeance. Thousands of rockets lighting up the skies over Gaza City. The death toll has risen tonight to at least 300 Israelis killed, more than 1,500 injured after Hamas terrorists invaded several Israeli towns earlier today by air, land, and sea at daybreak. A surprise attack. Shooting at civilians, kidnapping many, along with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli Defense Forces says the number of civilians captured by Hamas is, quote, a significant number, but they would not be more specific than that. Tonight, most Israelis are likely holed up in their homes, while others in Gaza have been urged to get out of Gaza immediately for their safety. Warned by the Israeli government. The ongoing threat is so dire. Netanyahu and opposition parties have discussed forming an emergency coalition government as Israel faces war. There is, of course, the looming question of how could an assault of this size and scale happen? How did Israel's intelligence fail to anticipate and stop this? We'll have much more on that ahead. United States President Joe Biden has condemned these attacks, reiterating America's unwavering support for Israel. Tonight, U.S. officials say it is too early to say whether Iran was directly involved in this attack, but the U.S. government says it is looking into that question very closely. Let's go straight now to CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, who is live in Israel for us, near the Gaza border. Nic, thanks so much for joining us. What is the latest at this hour?",

And then beyond the checkpoint, that's areas that's still maybe Hamas militants operating that Israel's defense forces are still in contact with them in some areas. About 20 minutes ago, we're able to hear in the distance heavy machine gunfire. We think fired from a helicopter -- we heard the helicopter before. That's something else we've heard throughout the evening. And also around that time, there was another salvo of rockets 20 minutes or so ago fired out of Gaza. The Iron Dome intercepts -- intercepting them over our heads here. This appeared to be a smaller salvo than the salvos we've seen this evening, and appeared to be potentially shorter range falling or targeting Ashdod and Ashkelon along the coast, not reaching as far as Tel Aviv as they were earlier this evening, and then this morning in that big barrage.

Really appreciate your time this evening.The Israeli Defense Forces says its main objective right now is to reestablish control and that the number of Israeli civilians captured is, quote, significant. Joining us now is an international spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces Jonathan Conricus. You have called this a, quote, Pearl Harbor type moment for Israel. One of the questions that I've heard a lot of people asking is about the intelligence failure. And obviously, intelligence in real life is not like it is in TV shows and movies. Intelligence failed to anticipate what happened on 9/11. Intelligence failed to realize what happened on January 6, 2021. Intelligence failed to realize what happened during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. So, by no means is intelligence operations in the United States infallible. But that said, what went wrong here for Israel? LT. COL. (RES.) JONATHAN CONRICUS, INTL. SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES. Yes, it is a very difficult day here in Israel as we are counting our dead and wounded and coming to terms, wrapping our heads around the situation that we have many Israelis captive, abducted by Hamas that are now in the hands of a murderous terrorist organization in Gaza. What happened? Hamas planned and put into motion a premeditated attack where they used all of their resources available. All of these resources, by the way, have been provided to Hamas by Iran, which is, by a long margin, the biggest world promoter or supporter of terrorism. And Hamas used all of their weapons. Their operatives and we're talking about maybe up to 1,000 terrorists who were able to infiltrate into Israel during the day, or at least many hundreds. The numbers are still being verified, and they were able to launch an attack, a multidimensional attack on the ground, at sea, and in the air. We will have to investigate, and we will have to ask ourselves tough questions how this happened, how Hamas was able to launch such an attack with such horrible consequences for Israeli civilians, and we will have to provide -- the IDF will have to provide honest answers to the Israeli public. And it will take time to set things right in Israel again after the fighting ends. But that as important and as interesting and as pressing as it is, and I understand the interest is of secondary importance. The number one priority is to make sure that we clear all Israeli communities of terrorists that are still inside Israel as we speak.",

They can go towards the shore and they can be in locations that are not close to Hamas facilities. They shouldn't be -- they shouldn't have allowed Hamas in the first place to build and to use them as their human shields, but that's a discussion for another time. But what matters now is that, yes, we care about human life and we do not want Palestinian civilians to be affected by the coming fighting and by the level of destruction that we will rain upon Hamas. And again, it's worth mentioning and reiterating that responsibility for everything that's happening for the dead, for the butchered men, women and children and soldiers in Israel and for the Palestinian civilians. Lies squarely with Hamas. They started. They are the aggressors. We are responding to their aggression and we are defending ourselves against their aggression.

And someone shouted like, \"siren\". Everyone gets to the floor. We all crowded down on the floor. There are a bunch of little kids next to me that were borderline crying or hysterical. And then one of the fathers next to me was like, OK, guys, let's start singing. Let's sing together, like, try to cheer up the kids a little bit, just to try to help them a bit. Only then, since most of us didn't have our phones on us, we didn't really understand what was going on. And then people started telling us, they told us there's like a situation down south and there's like a war starting. So we went home just to go be near bomb shelters. And then later in the afternoon, a friend of mine came knocking on the door frantically and told me that they called him up for reserves and they called everybody up for reserves. So I got in my car, drove him over to his base. On the way, I saw tons of road blockings of checkpoints where they're searching every single car looking for terrorists. I saw thousands of reservists lined up trying to go back to base. It was horrible. And then I got home only late tonight after being stuck in all the traffic, and I checked Twitter. Unfortunately, a lot of the stuff you see on the news is not the worst of it on Twitter, a lot of it's not censored.

And also where Iran and their proxies have been attacking U.S. forces. We have about between 800 and 900 troops still in Israel. So, you know, we're going toe to toe with Russia and Syria right now. And all these folks, you know, they're meeting in Damascus together, including Hamas. So, you know, it's kind of hard to separate out how much people -- different countries were involved, but, you know, there's a lot of fingerprints all over everything.

By the same token, Israel, as you have stated, has every right to defend itself. And these were horrific attacks on civilians. And Hamas took hostages, including children and the elderly.

I think that the president of the United States said after his meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu that whatever Israel needs, we will make sure that they get it. We will fix the intelligence and talk about the intelligence and next moves.But I think that you'll see a close coordination, dialogue and conversation between the Israeli government and our president of the United States. We are ready, willing and able to stand by and make sure that we start to get those that have been taken. Those lives are still in danger. There's still individuals who may have infiltrated Israel. So we will be working hand-in-hand with them, their military, their intelligence, and ours to make sure that this is is resolved. Now, I, too, am worried about further regional warfare. And it just seems to me, and I think we'll find out more, I hope to have a classified briefing either tomorrow or Monday. But as soon as we are getting close to have some peace in the Middle East and have conversation, others are trying to prevent that from happening. Because it was clear with the Abraham Accords and some of the dialogue and conversation that has taken place with Saudi Arabia and some others that were part of the Abraham Accords, that is the right direction to go. Because what you have to have is people in the Arab world first understanding that Israel has the right to exist. That's what the Abraham Accords was about. And in that conversation, there was also talk about concessions made for the Palestinians. But when you see this evil Hamas terrorist group and organization, they don't believe that Israel has the right to exist. And that's why we've got to work with Israel to make sure that we wipe out Hamas so that we don't have a vicious attack like this ever again.",

But I do think that that conversation will be taking place because we understand the seriousness of the moment. And I would anticipate and would hope, and that's why I tried to make sure on our committee that Michael McCaul and myself sent out a bipartisan and unified letter and stating so that everyone knows that we are together, that we are not going to allow the dysfunction that we're having to prevent us from moving forward and protecting and working with our ally Israel. And so, that dialogue I can assure you is taking place.
