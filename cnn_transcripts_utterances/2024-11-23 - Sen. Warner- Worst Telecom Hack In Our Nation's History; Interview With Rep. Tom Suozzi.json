Jessica Dean has the weekend off.In a sign of mounting concern over what turned out to be a long running Chinese cyber espionage campaign in this country, targeting some of the most senior US political figures, there is now going to be an all senators classified briefing scheduled for just after Congress returns from recess next month. CNN has previously reported that hackers burrowed deep into some major US telecoms providers, which allowed them then to have access to the phones, phone calls, text messages of so many people in this country and that this hack went on undetected it seems, for months. The full scope of the hack, not clear at this point, but one senator described it as the worst Chinese espionage operation in this country ever. Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi from New York. He serves among other things, on the Homeland Security Committee. Good to have you back. Thanks so much for taking the time this Saturday. REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Yes, Jim, thanks so much for having me on.",

Now, do I think that 90 percent of them are going to be approved and it is not going to be much of a show? Yes, I do think that will happen. But you know, that five percent or 10 percent or whatever the number is, there is going to be questions raised about people. And you know, you said, is there a plan? Is there a strategy? There is always a concern about whether Trump really has a strategy, whether he is thinking through all the different steps, the next step, it is kind of like more of a gut thing with him, an emotional thing.

One is that when the president does something that is irresponsible or out-of-control or something we disagree with, like when he, in his first term, he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, he tried to get rid of protections for DACA, for the DREAMers, you've got to fight back. You've got to resist. But you have to also look at what can we do to work together to solve problems?I remember when Trump was first elected in 2017, it was the first time I was elected to Congress. I have been in office before as a mayor and county executive, I wrote down things that I agreed with Donald Trump on and things that I disagreed with Donald Trump on. And, you know, those things can continue to be things that I agreed on and disagreed on, and some things he flip-flopped on. So we have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. If everybody is going to explode and freak out over every single thing, then you're never going to be able to focus on the things that really matter. You know, they said the other day on the show, I was watching you know, if everything is a five-alarm fire, then there is no such thing as a five-alarm fire. So we've got to pick our battles and resist when things don't make sense or they're irresponsible and we have to work together when they do make sense. So am I worried about going after the enemy within? Yes, I am concerned about that, but let's see what unfolds.",

That's the video you're seeing there that it fired on Ukraine this week. Why those multiple flashes at high speed? Because the missile contained multiple warheads capable of hitting multiple targets. The target, in this case, the city of Dnipro. The Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is tonight looking to the near future, saying he is waiting to see President-elect Donald Trump's proposals for ending the conflict when he takes office in January. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for when the war will end, when Russia wants this war to end, when America has a stronger position, when the global south is on the side of Ukraine and on the side of ending the war, it will happen.

      "sentences": "Well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested that the war could end next year, and I think that is a reflection not necessarily of victory looming for Ukraine or defeat looming for Russia, but the increased noise around the idea of some sort of peace settlement. Indeed, in similar comments, he said that he would go and see Trump in January once the president-elect has taken office and might discuss what points or ideas for peace indeed, Donald Trump had in that meeting.At the same time, too, increased diplomacy by NATO around Trump. We understand that the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, has been in Florida to meet Donald Trump, and so that is just I think, a reflection of the increased motion around a new White House administration months away. But that change in Washington is also augmenting the pace of events here inside of Ukraine. We have had a startling week, frankly, in which we've gone from last Friday, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, breaking nearly two years of isolation from major western leaders by telephoning the Kremlin head, Vladimir Putin, essentially to sort of maybe kick start the idea of diplomacy. It didn't seem that call went particularly well. But then we had the Biden administration authorizing Ukraine to fire longer range missiles into Russia. They did that pretty fast and then the Kremlin had Vladimir Putin announcing that the device they fired over Ukraine, over industrial sites in the Dnipro, a multi-warhead ballistic missile was something new they say called the Oreshnik, a hypersonic, non-nuclear missile, which they claim could get through any western air defenses. So startling fast paced events, and that is, I think, also too reflected on the battlefield where even the UK's Ministry of Defense intelligence suggested that the frontline was least stable as it has been since the invasion. That is simply a reflection of what we are hearing on the ground from multiple military sources of increasing Ukrainian weakness and various points along the front line in the east in particular, because Russia appears to have an extraordinary tolerance for casualties and consistently finding momentum. So a particularly fragile two months ahead here. The geopolitical stakes increasingly rise. The kind of armaments that Moscow and Washington are finding themselves, either using or supplying here, increasing in their sophistication and severity and I think a real concern that Russia is going to go all out in the next two months to try and improve its negotiating position, if indeed, it ascends to going to the table when Donald Trump takes office in January.
