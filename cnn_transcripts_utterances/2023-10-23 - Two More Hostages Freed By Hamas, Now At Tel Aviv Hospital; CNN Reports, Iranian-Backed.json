He surprised the audience with a performance of Hatikvah.

That's tonight on Newsnight.And good evening, I'm Abby Phillip. Two more female hostages are now free tonight after being released by Hamas, both are Israeli citizens. Two women, 79 and 85 years old, are now at a hospital in Tel Aviv after being handed over at the Rafah crossing. You'll hear from one of their daughters in a moment. But, first, CNN is reporting that the U.S. has been pressing Israel to delay its invasion of Gaza to allow for the release of even more hostages. And there are some signs that Israel is getting impatient. Airstrikes have grown, troops have been amassed at the border for a week now and verbal warnings of an impending assault from the, quote, air, ground, and sea are multiplying as these days go by. And Israel, which denied being asked by the U.S. for a delay, says it is not considering any kind of ceasefire. And there are more signs that the Biden administration has concerns. U.S. intelligence shows that Iranian-backed militias are ready to ramp up their attacks against US forces in the Middle East, an official telling CNN that red lights are flashing everywhere. And this apparent tension over a ground invasion is noteworthy, as we learn that the U.S. has rushed an American three-star general, an expert in urban warfare, to help the Israelis. While the general may be able to advise on how to avoid civilian casualties in a region that is already on fire, it does carry some risks, giving the appearance that may very well be the reality, that the U.S. is linked to the Israeli operation, no matter how it goes. And at the center of all of this, of course, are these hostages. Here is the daughter of one of the ones that was released tonight speaking with Anderson Cooper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think what happened here with Hamas and this evil terrorist organization, they don't just hijacked Israelis, they also hijacked the Palestinian cause. And I think this does a tremendous disservice to this cause, because now calls for free Palestine or from the river to the sea actually become slogans, like Itbah al Yahud, which means murder the Jews, you know, because they all now behind this evil ISIS-like, Nazi-like organization and they are like the ones who will free Palestine. So, I think the Palestinians must separate themselves from this organization because I think them and the progressive in the state, you know, putting themselves behind this evil in a way makes them, in a way, accomplished to all this. And also, I don't think this serves the purpose of getting a step one day. I really don't. And I really hope the death of my sister and the plight that I'm going through -- and it's not just me. There are many, many, many other people here in the same situation as me, you know, looking for loved ones and really don't know what is the situation.

It should be a parallel thing. Give some time now because there are some chance maybe people with dual citizenship, maybe children, maybe mothers, maybe babies would be released because they took all of the hostages, and then after this, you know, you need to do something about this cancer or it will kill us, you know?

So, they've backed the militias in Iraq, inside Syria, and then in Southern Lebanon with Hezbollah. So, it's known as the Shia Crescent.So, basically, Tehran pretty much controls foreign policy from Tehran across through Baghdad, Damascus, all the way through Southern Lebanon, to the Mediterranean, and then also the Houthi rebels down in Yemen, where the Saudis and the Iranians had fought a proxy war for quite some time. So, each of those represents a particular risk. And the Iranians early on in the conflict had stated that if they were to be attacked directly, that they would respond with proxies from these locations.

And tonight, the White House is clarifying its messaging around the rise of anti- Semitism following this afternoon's press briefing. When initially asked by CNN's M.J. Lee about the president's level of concern specifically about threats against the Jewish community, the White House press secretary said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, we have not seen any credible threats. I know there's been always questions about credible threats. And so I just want to make sure that that's out there. But, look, Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks. And certainly, President Biden understands that many of our Muslim, Arab-Americans and Palestinian-American loved ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities.

That's why the president mobilized his Homeland Security team to address any potential threats that could harm Jewish communities as well as Muslim, Arab-American, and Palestinian-American communities. And according to a new intelligence assessment put out by the Department of Homeland Security, hate crimes rooted in both anti- Semitism and in Islamophobia will surge in the U.S. as the war between Israel and Hamas intensifies. Now, former President Obama is also weighing in today releasing a statement that underscored his support for Israel and its fight to defend its citizens from violent attacks. But he also issued a warning, reading, in part, but even as we support Israel, we should also be clear that how Israel prosecutes this fight against Hamas matters. In particular, it matters, as President Biden has repeatedly emphasized, that Israel's military strategy abides by international aw, including those laws that seek to avoid, to every possible extent, the death or suffering of civilian populations. With me now is Jay Michaelson. He's a columnist for Rolling Stone. And also with us here, Natasha Alford, she's a CNN political analyst. Natasha, this is really interesting from President Obama. He didn't have to do this. This is a very lengthy post.

We had nine men stand up there and offer themselves, I guess, on the sacrificial altar of being speaker. But eight emerged. Dan Meuser decided not to run.
