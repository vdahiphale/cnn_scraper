Donald Trump says he has a warm spot for TikTok as he meets the CEO of Mar-a-Lago. Drone dilemma. More sightings across the nation as the president-elect claims the government knows more than it's letting on. And chip charge. The author of new book, \"The NVIDIA Way.\" We'll discuss the tech trials and tribulations of the A.I. stock everyone wants to own. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, we begin with the latest shooting at an American school, a teacher and a student losing their lives in Madison, Wisconsin. The shooter is also dead. Six students are hurt, two of them with life threatening injuries. A law enforcement source saying the suspect was a 17-year-old girl who also attended the school. She's believed to have died from a self- inflicted gunshot wound. We're also expecting authorities in Madison to hold a news conference in around 30 minutes time. We will bring you that update live.

We're trying. There's literally hundreds of millions of guns already in American society. You're not going to get rid of those in the near future no matter how successful you are in getting gun control. So, what we have to do is go to the third point. And the third point is this, it takes police an average of two to three minutes to respond to our call for a school shooter.

This is going to be quite fascinating because not only did Trump once try to ban TikTok unsuccessfully, many members of his incoming cabinet want it banned and actually led the charge in Congress to get it banned. For example, Secretary of State Designate Marco Rubio, Mike Watts, the incoming White House national security adviser. So, Trump is going to have to fashion some kind of climb down if he doesn't want to get TikTok banned and it's going to be very interesting to see how he gets himself out of this. He could ask Congress to repeal the law, the ban TikTok, that would seem a heavy lift in this anti-China Congress. He could not enforce the ban. That would be cause all sorts of legal challenges, or he could try and find some way to certify that the asset was divested. You've got all these CEOs going through -- of tech firms going through Mar- a-Lago, maybe that's his idea. But it's going to be interesting to watch when he takes office, as with many other things.",

He described the Ukraine-Russia situation is actually being far harder. And just bearing in mind, he suggested previously that he could solve that or resolve that issue in 24 hours previously, it suggests he's recognizing that this situation is perhaps far more complicated to resolve and bringing Russia to the table in this circumstance is going to be tougher than he realized.",

At the moment, and given Trump's contacts with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it appears that the Ukrainians are more amenable to some kind of end to this war than the Russians might be, notwithstanding the severe economic effects we're starting to see in Moscow because of U.S. and international sanctions. The tide on the ground in the war appears to have turned in Putin's favor in recent months. Now, Trump is faced with the position of trying to get President Vladimir Putin to do a deal, a deal that will be acceptable not just to Ukraine, but to Europeans and every other stakeholder in this conflict, and it's going to be difficult. What exact leverage does Trump have right now if Putin doesn't believe it's in his interests to stop? And either way, Putin is going to drive a very hard bargain. You've got this very difficult question of how do you not reward Russia for an illegal invasion of a sovereign democratic country? Trump might not be -- might not care about that too much. But the problem is he doesn't want to set himself up with a situation and some kind of peace deal that might last a few years and then erupt into war in the middle of his presidency.

And bythe way, he made a similar cash commitment back in 2016 after Trump's first presidential win, vowing to invest $50 billion in the US. He ended up exceeding that goal with a total investment of some $75 billion. Now, Masayoshi Son maybe one of the world's savviest tech investors, but he appears to have made at least one movie regrets over his highly successful and volatile career, his decision to sell SoftBank's entire stake in NVIDIA years before the A.I. chipmaker became a Wall Street darling. SoftBank was one of NVIDIA's largest shareholders before Son unloaded he's almost 5 percent stake in the firm back in 2019. He even commiserated with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang about the move at an A.I. conference in Tokyo last month. And this year, NVIDIA remains one of Wall Street's outperformers up 174 percent since January with a market cap of almost three and a quarter trillion dollars. And taking a wider view, it's up more than 2,000 percent over the past five years. Look at that chart. A new book called \"The NVIDIA Way\" is the inside story of how the chipmaker transformed itself from a firm specializing in computer gaming chips to the A.I. trailblazer it is today. And it was written by Tae Kim, who spent years writing about the company. And I'm pleased to say Tae joins us now. Fantastic to have you on the show. Two things stand out for me in this book, and it is the highs and lows sort of technically and technologically of in video and what it took to get to the place they're at today. But it was also about the unique leadership, I think, that Jensen provides and the corporate culture that he built and sort of the anti-fragile business that it created. And actually, that's where I want to start. According to the book, he's got 60 direct reports. I mean, most CEOs have a fraction of that. He's intimately involved in even the most junior people via an e-mail method. Just describe the culture first and foremost, because I think it's key. TAE KIM, AUTHOR, \"THE NVIDIA WAY\":  The culture is very flat. And it's one of speed and velocity. They talk about this concept called speed of light, where you do things as fast as possible. It's not based on, you know, 10 percent better than competitor, 10 percent better than last time. Jensen wants you to do it as fast as possible. No lag time. And only to the limits of physics.

So, it gives you a sense of the character as well. One of the interesting things as well was Intel for me in the '90s, where Intel were like, look, we've got a chip coming. Don't bother with NVIDIA. You're wasting your time. And people -- buyers listened on their pipeline died, and he even went to the staff and said, look, we're probably going to be bankrupt in 30 days.

So, why don't you wait for us? And NVIDIA -- like, Intel at that point was 860 times larger, right?

Just days ago, she admitted in an NBC interview that there were inconsistencies in her original story. And returning now to our top story once again and fresh details emerging about today's school shooting in Wisconsin. A law enforcement source telling CNN the shooter was a female 17-year-old student at a private school in the City of Madison. Police say the shooter took her own life. The two people killed were a teacher and a teenage student. Another six people were injured, two have life threatening injuries. The mayor of Madison says the whole community has been impacted.

And these are all questions which are going to be asked, but at this point, within, you know, hours, this is -- these are going to be questions and be answered in days from now. You have to give the FBI and the Wisconsin law enforcement entities time to conduct the investigation. But at this point right now, it's the community helping those -- the victims, which are in the hospital, but also the victims that are still at the school, the students who were there, who may witness something. Those students need the victim specialists at the FBI who are trained in how to deal with this and trained and talking to young children and how to get them to talk about what they heard what they saw. Not the four, you know, as a witness and not to gain evidence, but you get them to start processing what they worked on. So, I think that we're going to be looking for certain answers. Maybe if they know the motivation, maybe if they -- you know, the family -- where the gun was purchased, those are the sorts of things that they're showing that they're going to be positive.

If they are going to have a weapon in the house, you should be a responsible gun owner. Keep it locked up. Keep it in a safe. And teaching the children that these are not toys. These are not -- you know, this is nothing to be trifled with. But I'm sure that there has to be a figured out way how she was able to obtain the weapon, maybe from her parents, maybe illegally on the streets. I don't know. But at 17 years old, I know in the State of Wisconsin, it is illegal for her to purchase a weapon. In the United States, 21 years old. But in the State of Wisconsin, there are some legal loopholes, which were - - she can obtain it at the age of 18, but not at 17. So, determining these things are going to be to find out her pathway to violence. A lot of these things we learn from these incidents into addressing the future and how we can avoid and having people around her, what did they see? Did they know that there was something going on? Did they see any trigger signs, send any red flags? Could something have been said to avoid this situation? Those are the things that we're going to learn at, we're going to talk about.

And whether their child was affected by this or not, they were affected by it because what affects one part of the body affects all as we know, the bible says. And so, we hold that dear. We also have a very strong faith in our community that in spite of tragedy, God is working and we believe that God is good in everything and that he turns beauty for ashes. And so, I had a number of families who mentioned that to me, that this wasn't a surprise to God and that he's going to do something mighty with it. And so, we're holding on to those words and we're continuing to believe and trust in him. He is our foundation at Abundant Life Christian School. We are -- we exist to bring and to build disciples of Jesus Christ. And so, we have complete faith that he will carry us through this.",

I know that this is an emotional event, obviously for students, but those teachers really take it to heart when they are sitting there protecting those little ones at the school. Can you talk a little bit about what they did right in this situation? Obviously, this is tragic, but unfortunately, we've seen school shootings play out that are far worse than what we saw today.",
