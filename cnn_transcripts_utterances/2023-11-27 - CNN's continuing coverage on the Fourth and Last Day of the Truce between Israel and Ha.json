I'm Rosemary Church.It is now the fourth day of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas. And Israel says discussions are underway after it received a list of hostages expected to be released from Gaza in the hours ahead. Today is said to be the final day of the agreement. But Hamas says it wants to extend the pause in the fighting beyond the four-day deal. A source told CNN Israel's war cabinet also discussed that possibility Sunday night. On day three of the truce, 17 hostages were freed, including Israelis and foreign nationals. The group included mothers and children and ranged in age from 84 to four years old. Other hostages released by Hamas over the weekend, including this mother and daughter, have already been reunited with their families. And as part of the deal, an additional 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released from Israeli jails on Sunday. All were males, 18 years old and younger. Well, CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So as we head into this fourth and possibly final day of the truce agreement, how likely is it that the Israeli government will extend that truce?",

What we're hearing from both sides, the source telling us that the Israeli war cabinet has been discussing this possibility.Hamas also putting out a statement saying that they would want to extend the truce once the four-day period ends, saying that they would want to do that through serious efforts to increase the number of those released from imprisonment as stipulated in the humanitarian ceasefire agreement. It shows that they are referring back to that original deal and saying that what was agreed there could be possible. We just don't know. We know this morning that the prime minister's office in Israel has the list. provided by Hamas of potential hostages for release today and are reviewing that. We don't have any more information beyond that. They expect to put out more information later. It's very delicate, but there is also pressure from outside to potentially extend. Qatar has made no secret of the fact that they hope that this agreement will provide momentum towards something potentially more long lasting like a ceasefire. Now, we haven't had any discussions of a ceasefire from the U.S. side, but President Biden did express hope on Sunday that this wouldn't be the end. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: That's our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza. We've seen this is the day-by-day approach, hour-by-hour process. Nothing is guaranteed and nothing is being taken for granted. But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again.

This is supposed to culminate in the release of 50 hostages overall in exchange for about 150 Palestinian prisoners who have been held in Israel. These are terrorists who were convicted of crimes, as well as obviously the flow of humanitarian supplies to Gaza.But there is that clause in the deal that was originally approved by the Israeli cabinet that allows for an extension if Hamas is to release 10 more hostages every single day. This could go on for at least another week. I think the dilemmas will start to come up, Rosemary, if there is, let's say, on Wednesday or Thursday, Hamas says, well, we can't give you 10, but we can give you four or five or six. What does Israel do then? Because on the one hand, they want to continue the operation and the offensive into southern Gaza, where Hamas is still entrenched. But on the other hand, to get back five, four, or six hostages is still a big deal, and the Israeli public will want to see that happen.

The more military pressure that Hamas feels that it is under will get it to want to reach a deal to release more of the hostages to get a ceasefire. It's doubtful that without the large-scale offensive that Israel had been carrying out in northern Gaza over the last few weeks, without that, Hamas would have even agreed to this release of 50 out of the 240 hostages that it was in possession of.So Israel's campaign and military offensive is imperative to keep pressure on Hamas to get it to feel the squeeze and to feel that it is in danger, that it will want to reach a pause or a temporary truce and in exchange release hostages. The question is going to be now going forward, right? So let's say these 50 are released. maybe is what it's another 10 or 20 or even 30 in the best-case scenario what happens after that because what we know in the south that's what Hamas leadership is still intact. Hamas is three brigades in southern Gaza and Khan Younis and Rafah, and other places thousands of fighters are still there significant military capabilities and the rest of the abductees the rest of the Israeli hostages are there so how does Israel then go in on the ground there by the way also all almost all of Gaza's civilians are in the south, which complicates things even more.

And Israel's going into Gaza with the with the backing of its people with the backing of the world with an understanding that Hamas can no longer exist and can no longer present a threat but at the same time says we have to stop for now to get back as many people as we can because one life is an entire world as the Jewish tradition dictates. And therefore Israel's doing it. That's our strength, but it's also our weakness because Hamas knows that. And that's why they took so many hostages. And they will play on that exposed nerve and exposed pain that Israel has to get Israel to pause more. They will play with us. They will hold back the hostages. They will engage in psychological warfare because they know that this is Israel's weak point. And this is why Israel will have to be stronger in a way that I don't think this country has ever really been tested in the way that is going to be tested in these next few days. CHURCH: Right.

These boys are among 33 teenagers released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. This is, for many here in the occupied West Bank, a moment of hope. And for those now freed, a moment of utter relief. I'm so happy. I can't believe this is real, Ibrahim says. I don't even know what to say. This scene, a product of a delicate four-day truce agreement between Israel and Hamas. Set to see 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released, and at least 50 Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. There are many Palestinian families who will still be waiting anxiously to hear if their loved ones will too be freed. The Tamimi family, seen here on Saturday, has rallied for months, calling for the release of 17-year-old Wissam. He was seriously injured by Israeli forces and later arrested in June accused by Israel of offenses including possessing a weapon. But he was never charged. Now, he and his family are finally together again. I can't describe to you how I'm feeling right now. I honestly can't believe it. I feel like I'm in a dream. Weisam's mother, Huneida, says, My son is finally with me. I thank God and pray that every mother will be able to feel this joy. I pray God grants the Palestinian people this happiness. We just want to be able to smile and laugh together. Many of those now released are among the over 3,000 Palestinians held under administrative detention, meaning no charges have been laid against them and no ongoing legal process. Israel says some of those released were being held on terror or weapons charges. But in a list published by Israeli authorities of 300 women and children eligible for release, throwing stones and harming regional security were among the most common charges. DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PALESTINIAN POLITICIAN AND ACTIVIST: There are children here who have been in jail for eight years, five years, six years. It's unacceptable. Many of them have now huge psychological problems because of the torture, at least psychological torture, because of the way they were interrogated. It is a terrible atrocity that is practiced against these children. BASHIR (voice-over): For the crowds gathered here in the occupied West Bank, this celebration, they say, is a symbol of justice. Bringing thousands of Palestinians together to share in the joy of now reunited families. But for many, that joy is coupled with grief, with pain felt deeply here for the people of Gaza.",

But we also know that Russia has been stockpiling its weapons, stockpiling its drones and missiles with the aim of targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure just like they did last winter. Temperatures here have plunged, it's not officially winter yet but it's snowing outside, it is freezing. So that is Russia's aim and Ukraine knows it.",

We need more drones. We need more ammunition. We don't have enough to make the inroads gain that momentum to gain ground against Russia. This is now, without doubt, a war of attrition. And we heard from the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Zoluchny, recently, he wrote a nine-page essay where he said, Ukraine needs advanced technological weapons to really make inroads here. He also talks about the delays in the weapons from the West. You know, the F-16s that have been promised from the United States, they're not going to be delivered until late spring of next year. So how is Ukraine supposed to make the gains that they need to win this war? Many people here are growing more and more perplexed. So really, Rosemary, you know, Ukraine needs all of this weaponry and they need it now.",

These were lines at the airport here in Atlanta on Sunday as travelers waited to board their flights. More than 7,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. were delayed on Sunday. That's according to tracking website FlightAware. But less than 50 were reported canceled. American Airlines says Sunday was their busiest Thanksgiving ever, servicing nearly 6.5 million customers and more than 6100 departures.Well more travel delays across the U.S. may be coming this week thanks to winter weather. The U.S. National Weather Service reports more than a foot of snow fell across some states on Sunday. Even more is on the way for states in the northeast. Meteorologist Elissa Raffa has the latest forecast for the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We have a couple of warnings in effect for snow, some lake effect snow warnings off of lakes Erie and Ontario advisories stretching up into Maine. You can see where some of that travel slows from Minneapolis to Chicago in Detroit as some of those lakes, no showers really start to pump.Then even from New York and Boston, the last of that rain and even some snow showers getting into New England even late in the day on Tuesday, some totals for rain could be up to an inch. The snow totals really zeroing in on some of these communities right off of the lakes as that cold air really starts to pump some of that lake effect snow. What's happening is we have Arctic air coming in behind that front. That very cold air is going to swipe across the lakes. When that happens, the lakes are relatively warmer than that cold air. So the cold air is able to pick up some moisture from the lake. It starts to hit into the land rises very quickly and it gets that snow machine to pump and man, will it pump. We're looking at some totals well over a foot for some communities near Cleveland and Erie, some 12 to 18 inches of snow possible up in Oswego. The Tug Hill could be looking at some totals, maybe two or three feet. So getting pretty treacherous. As we start the work week here after the holiday, temperatures are going to stay below average. We'll keep that Arctic air in play. They're at least Tuesday and Wednesday with quite a bit of a chill in the air. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
