A call for democracy. Last hour, Joe Biden wrapped up his final D-Day speech just hours after apologizing to Ukrainian President Zelensky for a delay in assistance. Also ahead, Netflix under fire. A Scottish woman is suing the media giant for $170 million over the hit series \"Baby Reindeer\" after online sleuths labeled her the real Martha Scott. And later, safari scare. The moment a giraffe tried to remove a child from her family's vehicle. All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga is off today. You are indeed watching \"ONE WORLD\". A poignant scene coupled with a very powerful message. U.S. President Joe Biden is making the case for democracy as much of the Western world faces a critical choice. A short time ago, the President wrapped up a speech in Pointe d'Arc, France. A symbolic backdrop that was the site of a pivotal battle in German-occupied France 80 years ago. His stark warning, the fight for freedom is far from over. The President made reference to those American soldiers in 1944 who put their mission and their country first. And he spoke about the debt we now owe to them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  They're not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves. They're not asking us to do their job. They're asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP) Earlier, Mr. Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Paris. It comes as Russian troops are gaining momentum along the front lines in Ukraine in what could mark a critical turning point in the war. The U.S. President announced new military aid to Kyiv and apologized for the way Republican hardliners delayed the $61 billion package. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He also drew parallels between Vladimir Putin and Adolf Hitler. VOLODYMIR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Can Putin win this battle? No, because we have no right to lose. Can this war end along the current lines? No, because there are no lines for evil, either 80 years ago or now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're simply asking all of us to stand up for what is right. He apologized to President Zelensky for the hold-up in weapons. And I think the question that a lot of people are asking is does the delay in providing military aid -- several months delay in providing military aid to Ukraine, show that perhaps this generation may have indeed forgotten the most important lessons from World War II?",

And just to our audience, we are looking at live pictures of Macron, PresidentEmmanuel Macron of France and the First Lady, Brigitte, of France, meeting and exchanging pleasantries and hugging President Zelensky and his wife. This, of course, has been a pivotal trip for Zelensky. He has been courted. He spoke to several World War II veterans just yesterday. There was this beautiful moment of Zelensky sort of hugging a World War II veteran, telling them that, listen, you saved Europe. And it's just you can't fail but draw parallels between Zelensky being courted here and, of course, Vladimir Putin's absence. Let's dig a little bit deeper now. Julian Zelizer is a historian and professor at Princeton University. He joins us live now. Just in terms of getting your take from President Biden's democracy speech, did he do a good job at conveying urgency in this speech, in terms of conveying really what is at stake right now in Europe?",

He made a pretty boldargument that connected the domestic issues that he's campaigning on, namely opposing the former President and the current state of the Republican Party with global autocratic threats and strains on democratic processes and pitting himself against all of this. And I think that message was clear. I think, obviously, the backdrop was dramatic. And one other element for those it will touch is that he invoked Ronald Reagan, who went there in 1984 as a conservative Republican and essentially made a comparable argument when the Republican Party was in a much different place during the Cold War.",

Many young votersare either disillusioned or frustrated with both parties, including the Democrats. And some will hear this and say there's a disconnect between the theme he is arguing and the message he is sending and what they believe is going on overseas in places such as in Israel, Gaza, and even other parts of the globe. And there's others, you know, we live in an era of disinformation and fragmented communication. So, a speech like this, it's very hard to reach a lot of voters or change minds, and young voters fall into that, you know. This gets out on TikTok, maybe it will have more of an effect, but I do think it will still be limited.",

And he will use the words to try to mobilize support for himself and continuing with what he's doing in Ukraine and what he's doing in arming adversaries. So, I think it won't be a calming speech from within Russia, but Biden understands that.

Let's bring in CNN's Katie Bo Lillis, joining us live now from Washington, D.C. Katie Bo, thank you so much for being with us. So, this report essentially concluded that Netanyahu is judging, that he can get away with not really defining a clear plan for post-war Gaza and really discussing it in very vague terms without losing too much support. But the fact that this CIA assessment exists, just walk us through what that means in terms of how the U.S. really views Netanyahu. It almost seems like the U.S. now views him as less as a trusted partner and more like an unpredictable foreign government. Just walk us through that.",

And as you mentioned, of course, it has found that the CIA believes that Netanyahu is likely to continue to try to defy pressure from the Biden administration and from the West to find a really clear picture for what post-war governance is going to look like in Gaza. But it does come amid a little bit of a shift in rhetoric that we have seen from the Biden administration. There has been a real reluctance in sort of the early months and weeks of the war to discuss Israeli politics publicly, right? And I think what you have seen really in the last few weeks and months, as there has been these sort of growing tensions in between what the Biden administration wants Netanyahu to do and what Netanyahu is actually doing, you have seen Biden administration officials be more willing to talk in more frank terms about Netanyahu and the political calculations that he's making and in particular the kind of balancing act that he's having to do in between sort of the far right element of his very fragile governing coalition and the pressure that he's receiving from the West. Now, certainly the CIA and other elements of the U.S. intelligence community do the kind of analysis and assessment that we have seen in this report routinely. But what is interesting, I think, and what you are seeing is a shift in the public rhetoric. The President, of course, saying last night that he believes that Netanyahu is listening to him, but speaking very frankly in an interview with \"Time\" that became public earlier this week where he talked about how it was reasonable for Americans to conclude that Netanyahu was potentially extending the conflict in his own sort of political interest. Now, one of the things that this CIA assessment really delves into is the deep divisions within Netanyahu's own governing coalition about what the post-war governance, both from a security perspective and a governance perspective, could look like in Gaza and sort of that struggle that Netanyahu is going to have in sort of getting a consensus around any potential path given the deep divisions within his own government.",

It's also the story of the people who enabled those two generals. And I think to get to that durable peace, we need to unmask the actors who are enabling these fighters.

And let's not forget that this is the same Darfur that witnessed ethnic cleansing by some of these very same authors of atrocities back in the early 2000s. And so, the impunity gap, the lack of accountability is just enabling this conflict to get worse and worse. And so, when you ask for credible interventions, for me, the three things that come to mind are, well, what can we do to protect civilians? What can we do to create a wedge that protects and shields these civilians from these fighters? We've seen the National Army isn't trying to protect civilians. They're not standing up to shield Darfur, Masadit or Zagawa. We've seen the RSF are very willing to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity on a large scale. So, who will step in? And I think in the past in Sudan, United Nations peacekeepers were brought in, African troops were brought in, and we need to be re-examining that option very closely because when there is a protective wedge, then we can also have the opportunity for aid to be delivered without being obstructed by these fighters. But all of that, unfortunately, requires a degree of political will that we just haven't seen. The United Nations Security Council, although it's considering dozens of drafts on Gaza, has said very little on Sudan.
