There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab- Americans or Palestinian-Americans. It's simply wrong. There's no place for racism in America. It's all wrong. It's un-American. I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.

A strong majority of the American people do not want to see more U.S. taxpayer dollars going to Netanyahu's destruction of the Palestinian people.

If there had not been millions of people, mostly women, coming out into the streets, and saying that they are sick and tired of being second class citizens, they want a right to control their own bodies, we would not have made progress in the struggle for women's rights. If we had not had demonstrations saying that we've got to end homophobia in America and we've not made -- would not have made the progress we have made. Demonstrations is what -- and the right to dissent, the right to protest, that is what the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is all about.

If kids are depressed, they're not going to go to class and they're not going to finish. And this, of course, impacts the bottom lines of the universities. So, that's in their interest to make sure that they are taking care of the kids who are there. And around 2012, we saw a decline in mental health and a raise in anxiety and then depression around the times that the cell phones, pocket cell phones became ubiquitous. That trend continued into the pandemic. But the reliance on technology during the pandemic seems to really have stuck. And so, the kids are more inclined to want to be on their phones, on their computer screens now than they were before. So, you know, you may have an option of taking a class online, in your dorm room, or go to the class. And a lot of kids are opting to just sit in their dorm room to take the class.

There's something called the Red Folder that professors pass around that sort of keeps tabs on students and the ones that they believe are struggling. You know, it gives them options about how to talk to them and treat them. So, professors are sort of the first line, that wasn't happening a few years ago. That's one big thing. There are care teams that try to identify students who are struggling. I think we spoke to folks at Tulane that they have failure tales. Kids are anxious about failing. And so, they go into community and they tell stories about things that they blew. And the idea is to sort of take the pressure off of each other so that they come to the sense that it's, you know, it's OK to screw things up. That's part of growing up. Part of life. They're encouraging kids to join different groups. What's fascinating about it is that there's, I think, a sense that the return to normal is beyond the cajoling of the administrators and their professors, the kids sort of have to find their own footing and no one's really sure, you know, where that new level set will be.",

They didn't necessarily take root. And so, when it's time to connect with other people, there's an anxiety attached to that now. And so, one way to avoid that anxiety is just to not deal with it. Sit in your room, take the class online where you're comfortable, where you can control your space. You can sit in your sweatpants. You don't have to worry about being called in by a professor. If you do go to class, the professors are saying that, generally speaking, kids aren't as prepared and they're less likely to raise their hand into debate. They're unnerved about being a part of the discussion and being called out. There's other issues, I think, of, you know, step (ph) is saying the wrong thing.

But there's not a conversation happening. I think there's also an attraction for some students to join these protests because, you know, they can stand side by side, shoulder to shoulder and get a sense of community that they really haven't had since they've been in college, and then that feels good. It feels good to connect with one another, to be kind of -- it's almost everybody's saying the same thing and believing the same thing, so you're -- it's almost a low stakes situation if you follow the script. Not to demean what these kids are doing or believing in, but there's a sense, I think, of community that's really important. On the flip side, it's a really polarizing issue. So, you've got students that haven't made the connections on campus that, you know, normally they would have over time and they're angering one another and they're losing friends because they've posted a meme or a message that the other side doesn't agree with.

The schools that survive, I don't see why they wouldn't respond and become places of community and where kids will re-engage. Human beings are awfully strong and, you know, in figuring out a way forward. The kids who were in school during the pandemic, some will recover and some won't. We've looked at studies about lifetime learning loss for kids who were in school during things like natural disaster. In Argentina, for instance, there was massive teacher strikes for years that kept kids out of school. In Pakistan, there were tremendous earthquakes that destroyed whole villages. And when you compare the children who were around those natural disasters and didn't go to school for a year or two, they didn't catch up. What happened is they got discouraged. They didn't take the next step in school. Their lifetime earnings declined. There's one professor researcher at Stanford who suggests lifetime learning loss is probably around $70,000.

So, the British Empire resulted in a certain amount of democracy in places like Australia.

We destroyed 60 percent of New Zealand's forests, for example, but it also led to the birth of modern-day environmentalism. It resulted in the rule of law in certain places, but also resulted in a huge amount of homophobic legislation in other parts of the world.
