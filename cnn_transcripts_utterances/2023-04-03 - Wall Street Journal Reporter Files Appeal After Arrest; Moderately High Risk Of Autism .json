Gershkovich is currently being held in the -- in the notorious -- in a notorious pre- detention facility in Russia and he faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. In a phone call yesterday between Secretary of State Tony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Blinken called for his immediate release.Joining me now is Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He has been involved in many negotiations for detained Americans overseas including helping with the successful release of Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner from Russia. Ambassador, it's good to see you. Thank you for coming in. This news that Gershkovich has filed an appeal, is this just part of the process? What does this mean? BILL RICHARDSON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Well, this is part of the process. It's a good process that they're following. I think what is encouraging is that the secretary of state at his level, called the secretary of state of Russia. That is very important. Keep it at a very high level. They hadn't been in touch in a long time. Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, is a pragmatic person. I dealt with him when I was ambassador to the UN. He was the Russian ambassador to the UN. But this is -- this is positive at that level. [11:35:04] Now the process of appeal when the hearing is, this is normal. This is Russian delight tactics. Russian, they've leveled this unfortunate arrest to a very disturbing level, raising the stakes enormously.",

We have worked with them on the past, as you mentioned.But right now, the family is going through a very traumatic moment because they got all these people calling them all these pressures. But I think the fact that the secretary of state at his level, calling Lavrov -- also including Paul Whelan, which is the forgotten Navy guy out there. He's been there for years wrongfully detained. But it's going to take a very tough negotiation. I think outside actors have to be part of this. It can't just be official channels.

Third, I mean, the general state of relationship, it's so rocky between the United States and Russia. And I don't know how much contact is going on. I think it's important to keep these humanitarian issues separate from the geopolitical issues on Russia and Ukraine. And I believe the secretary of state making this phone call after a long time that they haven't talked at that level with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Secretary of State, is important. Let's see how that plays out. But I think a lot of actors need to be part of this. This is an attack on journalism. I think you guys in the journalistic community, in the media community -- the journalist community, need to be part of a public effort internationally. It's not just America. Journalists are being arrested all around the world. In Myanmar, in Iran, and Venezuela. All over the world, journalists are becoming prey because they're just doing their job and they're criticizing existing governments. So, I think there has to be an international effort, a multilateral effort, not just the United States but the European Union, the United Nations, protect journalists, protect NGO workers that are being all over the world arrested for no reason at all.",

In fact, if you look at the moms who had the highest level of exposure, their children were 46 percent more likely to develop autism. So, this is not to say -- I want to be clear, not to say that lithium causes autism at all. No one would say that. But you know, you and I both know so many families affected by autism.

He was the pilot for this. Christina Koch, a mission specialist who holds the current record for the longest time in space by a woman. And Jeremy Hansen from Canada. And Reid Wiseman is the commander of all of this. So, what are they going to do? They're going to orbit the moon. It'll be the first lunar trip in more than 50 years, the last time we had men on the moon was in 1972. It possibly will be the farthest space trip ever because they may loop far enough out that this would be a record flight out there. And then they will come back here in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Very, very big news on all these folks making this trip, John.",

This would launch in November of next year, so we're more than a year and a half away from that to turn around and then actually go land on the moon in 2025. It's a reach, it is the goal, most likely it will push down into later years there.So, that's the goal but it's just a goal right now. But boy, do they have the right people for this. These are really unbelievably talented aviators from the military. I mentioned Christina Koch spending so much time, but there, she also spent a year at the South Pole. Jeremy Hansen, the man from the -- from Canada, this is his first flight assignment as an astronaut. So, boy, that's a way to start with the big splash. And interestingly enough, just because you're curious, they're all in their 40s. So, they all have a raw -- really strong resume of experience in flight and in space. And they will know what they're doing for this incredible, incredible mission. And think about it this way. For a brief period of time, they will be the only four people who are that far away from everything that have ever been. That's a remarkable thing to think about. And boy, so exciting.",
