Trump says it will happen within minutes of taking the oath of office. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, the President-elect is rapidly accelerating his own timeline for pardoning the very people, who attacked the building that you see behind me right now. When it's lit up, on a night like tonight, it can be almost easy to forget that on January 6th, things looked more like this. In interview after interview, Donald Trump seems to be eagerly anticipating the moment that he can free the people that you see here storming the heart of U.S. democracy, nearly four years ago.

We have the one and only Kara Swisher here to join us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [21:30:00] COLLINS: Tonight, I have new reporting that Amazon, founded by the tech billionaire, Jeff Bezos, is expected to donate $1 million toward Donald Trump's inauguration fund. This, as Bezos himself is expected to visit Trump in-person, in the coming days, down in South Florida. And this is news that comes just one day after we learned that Meta, Facebook's parent company, and founded by Mark Zuckerberg, also gave a million bucks to Trump's fund. Both tech billionaires have their own histories with Donald Trump. But it appears that they are leaving all of that behind, maybe even taking a page out of Elon Musk's playbook. Of course, he himself spent over $250 million, supporting Trump's campaign, catapulting himself directly into the President-elect's orbit. Now, with only 39 days to go, until Trump is back in office, we are seeing the billionaires working to ingratiate themselves with him, as they are certainly top of mind for him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And former Hillary Clinton campaign adviser, Karen Finney. And it's great to have you both here. Kristen, let me start with you. Because Trump did say, right after that quote, \"I think that they will,\" as in, go down. He said, \"I think that energy is going to bring them down. I think a better supply chain is going to bring them down. You know, the supply chain is still broken,\" he said. What happens if Trump doesn't? If grocery prices don't come down? Because, I mean, this was kind of the argument, the Biden folks were making was, it's not that easy to -- you can't really control this. KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER: Yes, expectations are very high. When you look at approval ratings of his transition, right now, they're pretty good. Americans are expecting an awful lot out of this administration. And so, it really comes down to, it is true, you cannot just wave a magic wand and things get cheaper. But if you can make American energy cheaper, if you can make the supply chain work better, that can go a little ways, toward making the cost of living a little bit more affordable for Americans, it can make things feel a little better. So, the bar is very high, and he's going to have to meet it. But he does have some plans in place to try to get there. KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, SENIOR ADVISER, HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 CAMPAIGN: But it was interesting. Because remember, also in the NBC interview with Kristen Welker, she asked very specifically about prices and the impact of tariffs. And he really backed off there, as well, and said -- she said, Well, can you promise? And he said, I can't promise. And she said, Well, what would you do? Will you do anything to try to hold companies accountable for gouging people? And he really didn't have an answer for that. And so, I think part of what we're going to see Democrats do certainly is, Let's hold him accountable for what he said he was going to. I think the American people will. But certainly, I think from a policy perspective, you're going to hear Democrats highlighting, He told us he would do these things. And you saw the -- President Biden, this week, do an economic speech, in part, to lay down some of these markers about, Here's where unemployment is, here's where the economy is.

But New Jersey leaders, and the political leaders there, say that they're still not getting answers on where exactly these objects are coming from, or who is controlling them, or where they're going. [21:55:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): People got enough on their minds, right? They don't have -- they shouldn't have to worry about things flying around that they don't know who they belong to. MAYOR TONY PERRY, (R) MIDDLETOWN, NEW JERSEY: Until you know the origin and what these drones' intents are -- intent is, how can you tell me that there's no imminent threat? STATE SEN. JON BRAMNICK, (R) NEW JERSEY: What are these drones doing in New Jersey? I can tell you what they're not doing. If they're Martians, I guarantee you they're not staying because the taxes are way too high. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, hearing those lawmakers there. I thought one of them raised a good point. If you don't know what it is, how can you tell us what it's not? I mean, what is your take on what we've been seeing pop up over New Jersey? NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, ASTROPHYSICIST, AUTHOR, \"MERLIN'S TOUR OF THE UNIVERSE,\" HOST, \"STARTALK\": First, I agreed with the sentiment that if people cannot identify what they are, you are in no position to say whether they are or are not a threat. So, I don't get what it means when they say, Oh, don't worry about it, we don't know what it is, but don't worry about it. But I can tell you this. Yes, if I can't claim to know the motives of aliens, but -- just being an earthling. But of all the places to show up on Earth, they picked New Jersey? That would be odd for me--",

As an astrophysicist, right, my signoff to my podcast is, Keep Looking Up. And if looking up means you're more aware of what's in the sky, and if that can be helpful to lawmakers, to the Pentagon? Then, let's keep doing it. In fact, there was a committee set up by NASA, to help the Pentagon and lawmakers, be a clearinghouse for people's observations of things they don't understand, by using their smartphone, which has all manner of metadata related to how you use it. And so, this would be an ideal case for everyone to whip out their smartphones, get data, and see what we can make of it.",

It's also being paired with a growing distrust of people, like you, who do what you do for a living, who back things up with data and facts and science.
