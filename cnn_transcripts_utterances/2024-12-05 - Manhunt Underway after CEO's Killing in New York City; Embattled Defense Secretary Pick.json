She's actually someone who has endured sexual assault herself, a victim of sexual assault, and has sort of pushed to change the practices of how the Pentagon deals with these sexual assault claims. Now, Hegseth, of course, has been accused of sexual assault. He's denied those allegations. But leading a meeting with him for about 45 minutes on Wednesday afternoon, she refused to say if she would support him for the position. She only said she had a thorough conversation and a frank conversation with him. Really would not say anything else when I asked her if she would vote for him. Now, there have also been questions about some of these allegations of misconduct, including excessive drinking on the job.

Being loyal to your wife, being faithful in marriage. People make mistakes.
