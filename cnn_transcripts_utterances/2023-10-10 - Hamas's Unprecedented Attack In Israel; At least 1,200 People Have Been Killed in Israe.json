And really, I want to take a step back tonight. I want to talk about the weight of all of this. It has touched all of us, and you've undoubtedly been feeling it, too. Perhaps many of you are extremely knowledgeable about the political history of the region, and maybe many of you may be learning in real time since Hamas's unprecedented attack, and you're trying to understand the complexities and the nuances, all, of course, while trying to process the horror of war. You're not alone in trying to balance when to lean in and when to look away. The stories of brutality and cruelty and devastation, they are truly shocking. The death toll is still rising. At least 1,200 people have been killed in Israel since Saturday, and that's according to Israel's public broadcaster. Nine hundred people dead in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Mothers, fathers, children, brothers, sisters, neighbors, friends slaughtered in the middle of their daily lives. Now Israel is hammering Gaza with airstrikes hitting hundreds of targets and reducing neighborhoods to rubble as new and unthinkable atrocities are being uncovered in its territory after the devastating attack by Hamas militants.

It is a place of beauty, a place of agricultural production, culture. I have no way of estimating how long it might take for any kind of negotiations, if they will ever exist, with Hamas as a terrorist organization, to free any of these people. And keep in mind, we're not talking just about young men like my son. This is from infants to very elderly people who could not actually move on their own to be taken into captivity. They were taken in wheelchairs, dragged, uh, across fields in order to be taken back to Gaza. And so, we're talking about, uh, an absolute disaster. In our case, perhaps, uh, a bit differently from the poor young people who were murdered at the music festival. This is our home. Our home was rendered utterly uninhabitable. The entire community and almost all of these border communities are no longer inhabitable because it was not just murder, it was not just barbaric treatment of people of all kinds, it was the utter destruction of our communities.

Of course, the Israelis have not given a timeframe for that, although the defense minister of the country today said that it would happen later.But in the meantime, remember that Israel has called up more than 300,000 of its reservists. It called up just another 60,000 in the past 24 hours. It has deployed something in the region of 35 battalions in various places around the country, but directionally towards the Gaza Strip. And so, every sign, every pointer on the ground is that preparations for a land invasion of Gaza of some kind are being -- are being set out. Now, if that does happen, and I think there's a lot of political pressure on the Israeli government to do something like that, I think it will have a lot of support amongst the Israelis because we've spoken to even the most left-leaning of Israelis in this country that have been in the past opposed to incursions by the Israeli forces into Gaza, even people like that are telling us that they now support military operations towards and inside of Gaza. And so, the effect of these attacks by Hamas and we've been reporting on how appalling they are has had the impact of really uniting Israel in this moment of horror and rage and crisis. Remember, every Saturday, for the past several months, there have been protests against the Israeli government. That has now ended and the political divisions have closed at least for the moment as the country sort of braces itself for what will be the next stage in this -- the war that it has said it is now engaged in.

I think President Biden, obviously, has been through a lot of family pain himself, having lost a wife and two children. So, I think for Israelis, they are incredibly grateful to the president. And I think the president himself, even though this is an incredibly complicated political issue for President Biden, understands that Israel has to do what Israel needs to do in order to destroy Hamas, the terrorists that have committed this genocide, and go after the weapons that are inside Gaza.",

You know, I don't want to diminish anyone's life but, you know, maybe one or two people getting killed or, you know, rockets going off, I mean, this is of a proportion that is unfathomable for anyone involved looking at this. And so, that is why the Israeli public and the president over decades and decades and decades, you know, very much committed to defending Israel. So, this is part of his DNA and saying, this must stop. You know, it can't actually happen again. And so, now, something has to be done to prevent Hamas from doing this again. And so that's where we are now. But I do think that we're going to reach a period in the coming weeks now if this ground incursion goes forward at any scale. Maybe it'll be smaller. Maybe it'll be probes in and out. So, we don't know exactly what this will look like. But if it is at scale and there isn't some way of evacuating Palestinian children and innocents, we're going to see a lot of carnage.

Hamas took over Gaza after the Israelis withdrew every soldier, every citizen, every grave. And Hamas had an opportunity to build a decent society. There actually was a bitter Palestinian civil war where they actually killed and threw Palestinians off rooftops and shot them in the knees.Hamas takes over and Hamas then begins to use the borders to bring in weapons and brings in concrete that you would hope they'd use to build hospitals and schools like any governing authority would. Instead they build terror tunnels. They used to move weapons and fighters into Israel. And so, this is why Egypt and Israel imposed a blockade. But Hamas was founded in the 1980s, and its founding charter explicitly calls for the extermination of Israel. And I can tell you, I lived there in the 1980s, the 1990s. I remember Hamas suicide bombings where Hamas terrorists strapped suicide belts and walked into schools and cafes and discos and slaughtered Israeli children. So, Hamas slaughtering Israeli children and women is not a new phenomenon and it has nothing to do with the blockade. It has everything to do with Hamas's founding ideology, and it has been 35 years of slaughter of Jews that Hamas has undertaken.",

Given the historical context and given the 16-year blockade, why did it happen last Saturday? DUBOWITZ[23:40:05] And what Khamenei has understood, and he has had a longstanding partnership with Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, he has provided about a billion dollars a year in funding weapons and support, and there's some disagreement about direction and control. But at the end of the day, what Khamenei wants to do is light up the fire in these borders. And he lit up the fire in the West Bank. Israel shifted its military resources to deal with the West Bank, and it left that southern border vulnerable. I agree with Director Clapper on the technical tactical analysis about how Israel missed it completely and became overly reliant on technology and not on force buildup.
