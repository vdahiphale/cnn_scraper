And after days of leadership arguing this bill would not be changed -- Negotiations are closed, they said repeatedly -- they decided to make some changes.And that is because they knew that they did not have the votes as the bill was currently structured. So around 1:45 a.m. this morning, the House Rules Committee moved forward with what is known as a manager's amendment. Basically, leadership's changes to this bill. And those changes included a few important factors. One of them, they are moving up work requirements and when those work requirements would go into effect. That is an effort to shore up support from some conservatives who were on the fence. People like Matt Gaetz. The other change that they made was they decided they are not going to repeal some of the biofuel credits that they were planning to get rid of in this legislation. That is because they had key holdouts from Midwestern Republicans who were concerned about those changes, Poppy. So we are going to get a lot more information around 9 a.m. this morning, when House leaders convene with their members to try to get a sense of whether or not they now have the votes that they need.

He will now have only between now and May the 5th. So about ten days to review that very serious charges that his team say would carry a maximum sentence of 30 years, which would, of course, come on top of the 11 1/2 years that he's currently serving. Separately from that, Navalny has said that he has been told he faces another terrorism case, he says, related to something he allegedly did in prison. All of this taking place in a closed hearing. Something that his team has criticized. And all as we see increasing concerns around his health: his restrictions on food, the weight loss and as you say, hearing this morning that after just finishing 15 days in solitary confinement, he has now been sent back for what his spokesperson says will be his 14th stint.

However, they feel confident that the intelligence that they have, that this senior ISIS-K leader was killed, is accurate.

So our information really is kind of limited in that respect. But look, the fact that the U.S. is announcing here that the Taliban carried out this operation rather than the United States to kill a senior ISIS leader really speaks to the limits of the U.S. ability to carry out counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan post-withdrawal. And actually, the commander of Central Command, he spoke to this on Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, saying that the U.S.'s ability, really, to see the -- the broad contours of a growing threat of a terrorist organization, especially like ISIS, is very limited in the wake of the withdrawal, Kaitlan.",

It's certainly been a point of scrutiny for Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are praising the fact that this -- this leader has been killed.But they're still saying that doesn't take away from how the withdrawal went down.

So Republican Representative Michael McCaul, he is saying that, of course, he is happy that another terrorist was taken off of the battlefield and that is a good thing.But at the same time, he does not want to see the Biden administration take a victory lap about this. He said in a statement last night that he still plans to hold the administration accountable in committee hearings, for example, that they are doing to investigate the U.S. withdrawal. And that he believes that this is not enough, really, to hold the -- not enough to hold the administration accountable for the very chaotic withdrawal that left those 13 U.S. service members dead. We should note that we spoke to a father of a U.S. service member who was killed in that attack. And he also said that, while he is happy that this terrorist has been killed, according to the U.S. government, he also believes that more needs to be done to hold individuals in the U.S. government and the Biden administration administration accountable for what happened to his son and, of course, others -- Kaitlan.",

They hid under a coffee table whenever they heard gunshots or explosions. Her sister- in-law was on with us and told us they were just following orders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REBECCA WINTER, SISTER-IN-LAW OF AMERICAN WHO ESCAPED SUDAN: We're in a very awful holding pattern, because Trillian's been told by both the U.S. embassy and the international school that she works for that she has to shelter in place, and that she should not accept any offers for private evacuation. So she is just stuck waiting right now in fear. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
