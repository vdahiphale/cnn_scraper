And before any Israeli hostages are released, for Israel, that is a non-starter.Whilst its military ramps up operations in Rafah, which it says are still limited, satellite imagery shows they've expanded to include ground operations. A large number of Palestinians are now fleeing the densely populated city, now home to more than a million people. A spokesperson for the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees estimates 80,000 have left Rafah so far. The IDF says 150,000 Palestinians have evacuated to areas in eastern Rafah after receiving orders to evacuate earlier this week. CNN's Paula Hancocks following all of this for us live this hour from Abu Dhabi. So when we get to this Israeli reaction, clearly there's a lot of politics in what Benjamin Netanyahu has been saying.

So this is really the concern that they have. But as far as Israel is concerned, they say that they have what they need at this point, and they appear to be defiant.

Many are wounded. It's very difficult to be able to get to this area. And we've heard from UNRWA, the U.N. teams on the ground, that it's not ideal even when they do get there. They have called the conditions there inhumane and pointed out that they don't have the infrastructure to be able to cope with this sheer number of people. I'm pointing out as well the hospitals in Rafah, one, al-Najjar, which is in eastern Rafah, has now had to close effectively. It's building a makeshift facility in the central part of the city. But they have said clearly that is going to be limited, and it was already limited when it was the full hospital in eastern Rafah. So for those people on the ground, it is a desperate situation. It's a very fluid situation as well. UNRWA saying that they believe 80,000 have evacuated, the IDF saying 150,000 have evacuated.

And I think when you're in the realm of soft diplomacy, anyone who's a practitioner of soft diplomacy will tell you that hard diplomacy does occasionally come knocking at your door. I think the reality is this protest is real. The debate is ongoing. They're struggling to keep politics off the stage. And that may be all they can do.

This is all kind of going on in a bubble. It's very difficult to punch it because you have this. The arena is sort of on the edge of Malmo. The protests are in the center of the city. Most of the delegations from the various Eurovision countries are staying in hotels, but in large groups. I'm in a hotel with 17 delegations in the one hotel and security checkpoints at reception. And kind of, you know, so it's sort of to the degree to which that outside conversation punches through is kind of hard to measure. I think what's going on is there are two distinct conversations. I think on social media, you kind of have this volatile group of Eurovision fans who are making really specific comments like the comments that you're quoting. I don't think that the protest is in the center of the city, who are kind of driving a more general political message, are kind of having those conversations. I think the protests in the city are very much driven by capitalizing on the audience. This is a television event with approximately 160 million viewers worldwide. And I think, you know, their thinking or their strategy is to kind of take their protest, their narrative or the message they're trying to kind of bring forward and put it in the sort of in the most exposed space that they can place it, which is obviously what they're doing.",

I mean, certainly during the 90s, when all the former Soviet republics were gaining independence and joining Eurovision, that was sort of like a big political moment in many ways. Russia was banned a couple of years ago. Turkey's been banned. Greece boycotted. I mean, it's been a place for protest and political controversy since the get go. [02:14:57]",

And look, the thing is, you know, when you look at the history of Eurovision, it was created after the Second World War when hilariously coaxial cable, which is very antique technology now, was laid across Europe and they wanted to create something to kind of capitalize on this new tech that they had. Then the song contest was seen as a kind of opportunity to kind of create a harmonious environment in the aftermath of war.I think the kind of inconsistency that we're kind of grappling with right now is Eurovision's focus is on the stage. Their position is we can control the song. We can control the lyrics. We can, you know, we can create barriers to stop political messaging being used in that way. The challenge they have is you're quite right. Historically, it's incredibly inconsistently applied. You know, Russia obviously was asked not to participate in the wake of what happened is happening in the Ukraine. Belarus was expelled in the same year because there was a perception that a lot of this is driven by national broadcasters. There was a perception that Belarus' national broadcaster was not reporting that war objectively. So, you know, they make these decisions and that brings politics to their door. I think they're sort of they're not in a really winnable situation. I think it's kind of -- it's kind of no win for them if they do nothing. To expel Israel would have been an overtly political act. To let them stay in the competition has been seen as an overtly political act. And so I think their position is it's kind of lose, lose. And they're trying to navigate it as best they can. I mean, in this in the arena last night, there was there was booing. I mean, these are ticketed guests who have purchased tickets to come in and watch the Eurovision semifinals and final. And when, you know, Israel took to the stage, there was a lot of applause, but there was booing. There was free Palestine chanting. So, you know, there's a lot.

They have their agreements and they have their disagreements and you optimism that they would get through these disagreements as well.

So, Sao Paolo's military has rescued the horse which had been trapped there for four days.

Mammoth is the second biggest vacuum made by Swiss company Climeworks. It sounds simple in theory, the vacuum captures carbon from the atmosphere and then Climeworks plans to permanently lock the carbon underground. Climate scientists say right now, carbon capture removes only a small fraction of what's actually needed to reach global climate goals, but they do know it could be an important step. Jan Wurzbacher is the COO and CEO of Climeworks. He is in Zurich, Switzerland, this hour. Thank you for getting up early, relatively early. Thank you for being with us.

And over the past couple for years, every three years, we've scaled up our capacity by at least a factor of ten. And going ahead with that speed by 2030 will be at the scale of capturing millions of tons of CO2 from the air every year, and then being on the path towards 2050 to come to gigaton scale carbon removal that means removing billions of tons of CO2 from the air every year. So if we look at other industries like solar PV or wind industry, those are about the same scaling rates that those industries have proven to be viable. And if we can replicate that by middle of the century, this technology can remove carbon dioxide from the air at climate relevant scales. So, removing billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.

In terms of the process, what is the most difficult part is actually getting the carbon emissions out of the atmosphere, or is it storing them?

There is way more available storage space than we would ever be able to capture carbon from the air over the next hundreds of years. That's good though, storage space need to be -- need to be developed that's what we are on.Then, the more tricky part is capturing the CO2 from the air at large scale at lower cost.
