This is CNN Newsroom, and we do begin with the breaking news this hour. At any moment, we are expected to hear from officials in Los Angeles for an update on the wildfires raging across that area. We're going to bring you those remarks as they happen. That, of course, in reaction to several life-threatening blazes which are raging out of control. You see just a small picture of the destruction here, a number of homes, buildings, businesses, in ashes. Tens of thousands of people at this hour are under evacuation orders. The Palisades fire in the upscale Westside community of Pacific Palisades is now said to be tearing through an area the size of five football fields every minute. CNN spoke with some of the evacuees. They described the scene. Take a listen to their words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are now four active fires burning in the Los Angeles area, as well as one in Riverside County, one of the worst fires is the -- in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. Entire blocks have been destroyed now by flames, thousands fleeing their homes overnight in the Pasadena area to the east. Another large blaze, the Eaton fire, has now taken two lives, we understand. We do not know the exact cause of those deaths, but there have been two fatalities reported, more than 2,000 acres burned. Strong winds are continuing to fuel these flames across the region. Tens of thousands of residents told to evacuate, either under evacuation orders or evacuation warnings, told to be ready. Tricia Cosentino is one of those residents who has, in fact, evacuated from her home in Pacific Palisades. You made your way out late yesterday afternoon. Tricia, we're glad that you're safe. Glad that your family is safe. I know there is much concern at this hour, of course, for what was left behind. Do you have any news at all at this point of your neighborhood, of your neighbors?",

I'm in a townhouse. It is all walks of life, and it's amazing how the community is coming together. Everyone is not at home, and we all have had friends open our -- their doors to us all over the city. It's been an incredible show of support from the entire country.",

We'll continue to stay on it. And I hope, ultimately, there is some good news coming your way when you are able to get more information about your home.
