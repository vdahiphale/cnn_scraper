You essentially go shopping to make yourself feel better. It's that dopamine hit that you get when you're shopping to make you feel better about something that's going on.So for the election, for example, we saw some people reported that they were doing a little bit of shopping in anticipation of maybe the results not working out in their favor. And we saw that people were spending right after the election, maybe if the Donald Trump who is in office, who's going to be in office, wasn't their candidate of choice. But essentially, where it can get hairy is because 50 percent of Americans have reported that they are carrying debt on their credit cards. And that's where it can get tricky. It's not just the one-off. It's the constant spending when you're not feeling good. And we know that Americans are carrying over $1 trillion in credit card debt. That is a record. And so it's important to note that if you are doing this every so often and you can afford it financially, OK. But if you're tying it to how you're feeling about something, the economy, politics, it's probably something that you want to try to look at.",

CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston is with us this morning. We are happy to see you, Mark.

They have put a statement out. They have said that, in fact, that is going to happen.This is now the third person we have seen named by Donald Trump since he's been elected into key positions. We saw Tom Homan late last night. He has been named as the border czar. What does that mean? Well, he's going to be in charge of rounding up all of the immigrants that are here in the country illegally that Donald Trump wants to send back. Elise Stefanick, on the other hand, she will be somebody who will be carrying Donald Trump's foreign policy message, certainly within the United Nations. And then, of course, we know that Susie Wiles, who was chosen, who led his campaign, she is the first woman chief of staff, somebody who is considered extremely serious, who can keep the trains running on time. And what I've been told just this morning is, as far as timing of picks, sure, there may be some big names that pop out in the next few days that we're all looking for, but we should really be focusing in on the worker bees, the ones, those bureaucrats who will now be bureaucrats who are being be brought in as political appointees to implement the Trump agenda, folks that he trusts such as Tom Toman, Elise Stefanick, Susie Wiles.

So while Donald Trump is working on his plans, many Democrats are still trying to figure out what went wrong and what the message is to Democrats from voters this time. Donald Trump won all swing states, the Electoral College, and is winning the popular vote as we see it right now. What do you think the message is from this election?REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL):  OK, Kate, thanks for having me. And what I want to first acknowledge is that the Democrats absolutely have work to do. We have work to do on making sure that we can communicate our message effectively. By message, I mean the substance of what we've accomplished. I mean, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, massive -- which brought massive reductions in prescription drug prices, the most historic investment in global warming and climate change. We passed the Chips Act. We passed the infrastructure bill. And those all created jobs and contributed toward our having the most robust economy worldwide post-COVID. But obviously, that message didn't get through, and we didn't really -- we're not able to acknowledge consistently the pain that voters feel. And I can hear it from people in my district and I feel it in my own grocery store when I go and buy my groceries every week or every few days. We were not acknowledging that there are people who are still struggling to make their daily ends meet. But the problem that we've got is that the communications landscape is so diffuse. There are podcasts and YouTube WhatsApp messaging. And we have to make sure that we're meeting voters where they are, and we didn't really do a consistent job. But this result cannot be overstated. Yes, Trump looks like he is headed to have won all of the battleground states. But at the same time we won the Senate race in Nevada, in Michigan, in Wisconsin, and likely Arizona. And we are likely, either way, in the House to have the same slim majority, no matter which party ends up. So this was not the way the election, that the majority of the media is portraying. Voters had a Trump on the ballot the last three elections. We had a very short presidential campaign with our nominee, and there were a lot of other issues as well.",

But we got 58 percent of the vote to restore abortion rights in Florida. And what they should do is the legislature should go back into session and they should restore our abortion rights legislatively, like the overwhelming majority of voters, Republicans, Democrats, and NPAs or independents here in Florida, came together and said, they went too far. We have a six-week, essentially a total abortion ban here. And voters need to be respected.The legislature won't do that. Ron DeSantis won't do that, because they're extremists. And they want to control women's bodies. And that's going to reverberate over next few years. We have a midterm election coming up. But stay tuned to 2026, Kate, because inevitably, most often, the first congressional races after a president's victory ends up seeing gains for the party in the minority. So overreach, which is clear that Donald Trump is headed towards, and likely in Florida, too, is going to face some likely backlash if they're not careful. And they won't be careful.",

The first Trump administration, not many know this, had put out their own guidance on AI. And there are many elements in that guidance that are very much in line with what the current guidance looks like. The fact that systems should be accurate and effective, they should be safe and secure, and that they should be trustworthy. That's actually in the title of the Executive Order that the first Trump administration put out. But I want to emphasize what is most important of all. That we not have a policy vacuum. I think there are some that will call for a complete suspension of any rules regarding AI. I think that would be a huge mistake. I think we've seen for the past many years what happens when we put AI out in the world without any guardrails and we don't want business as usual.
