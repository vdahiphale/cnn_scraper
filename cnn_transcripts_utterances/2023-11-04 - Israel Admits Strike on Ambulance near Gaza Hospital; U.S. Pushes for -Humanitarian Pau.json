We saw injured, the Hamas-led health ministry saying 15 people died, 60 people are injured. From what we understand, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, they say that this was a convoy carrying the injured, heading toward the south, which is, of course, really important information. The IDF is alleging that they were targeting Hamas operatives. Now we also heard from the International Committee of the Red Cross that they were aware of this convoy but while they weren't involved in the movement of the injured, they say that no ambulance should be struck, that this is basically a no strike zone. It is a hospital, its ambulances are governed by international law. Now the IDF has been warning Al-Shifa and frankly other hospitals to evacuate. They have also alleged that Hamas operatives or command centers are operating from some of these traditional safe haven places. And of course, international organizations have specifically said, and categorically now, that it is impossible to move the injured people from these hospitals to what the IDF says, to safer areas. Now Antony Blinken met with Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. And there is so much pressure that is building for some kind of pause or at least consideration of a pause to try to get more aid in, because the numbers of civilian death toll is rising. It is basically becoming untenable. And so many questions are being raised about proportionality after the October 7th terror attack. And seeing now what Israel is doing into the Gaza Strip with, basically, we know there is no real safe area and the death toll has now risen to about 9,000. Antony Blinken also mentioned the West Bank and the attacks on Palestinians there a very big concern. So all of these issues and, of course, we saw earlier this week, we saw Jabalya refugee camp that was struck over a three-day period. Of course, the death toll there being really high. And we have seen these images; we have seen bodies being pulled out of rubble. We have seen the civilians stuck in the middle and really no consideration right now by the Israelis for a pause or a cease-fire because they want to see all the hostages released. That is what they are putting on the table.",

I think the U.S. assessment is pretty close to the mark. What we've seen since 7 October has been heavily an air campaign. But over the last week, with the incursions into the north and across Gaza by the IDF, they've now been able to isolate northern Gaza and advance to the ocean.

The U.S. has deployed two carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Hezbollah and others from joining the fight.

      "sentences": "And another thing the president talked about is how he's had to make too many of these visits before, including in places like Buffalo and Uvalde and, of course, now here in Lewiston, Maine.One thing we heard from a community member ahead of his visit about whether they wanted him to be here, they said they were glad he was here because it showed that the highest levels of the U.S. government cared about what happened here in Lewiston. And another thing that my crew and I have heard overwhelmingly, even in the hours after the shooting actually happened a little over a week ago at this point, is that they couldn't believe something like this happened here in Maine. And I say that because when you look at their yearly homicides across the state, that number is comparable to the amount of people that were lost in a single night in this community. And that gives you an idea of the shock but also the amount that they're actually having to process over what happened, again, in just a matter of minutes at two separate locations, here at this bowling alley and just a few miles from me at that bar and restaurant as well. Every indication we have seen has shown that they have banded together in the face of this adversity and they are going to try and move forward, stronger together. That's why you can't go far in this community without seeing symbols like the state of Maine and a heart over where we are in Lewiston to represent the love and the strength they will have for each other moving forward -- Omar Jimenez, CNN, Lewiston, Maine.

      "sentences": "Asteroids are these rocks, some of them metal, some of them rocky, some of them we don't know. They are flying through the solar system and they crash into things.And in the evolution of the solar system and our Earth, for 4.5 billion years, first there was a star that was spit out of a cloud of dust and gas. And that became a medium-sized star called our sun. And then all of these gases and dusts started forming into smaller planets and some of them were bigger. And then things crashed into each other and planets crashed into each other. And over that 4.5 billion years, some of these asteroids that are flying through space are the remnants of those early collisions. And it gives us, then, when we bring a sample back or we send a spacecraft like Psyche out to an asteroid closer to Jupiter, we can determine what is in that asteroid. In this particular asteroid , Bennu, we now know it has ice crystals and it has carbon. And those are the building blocks to life. (END VIDEO CLIP) FISHER:  And for an asteroid sample that traveled billions of miles to get here, you might think that there would be some sort of pomp and pageantry associated with its arrival at the museum. But no, it actually got here from Texas in somebody's carry-on luggage on a commercial flight. It even went through a TSA checkpoint. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
