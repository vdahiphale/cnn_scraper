Police say at least one person has been killed and 60 to 80 are wounded or injured after a driver plowed his car through a crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, about 90 miles southwest of Berlin. Video shows the driver on the ground being arrested by police after the incident. Social media video that has been verified by CNN. But we're not going to show at this moment, shows the driver plowing directly into a crowd of people walking throughout the Christmas market. Some people run away from the car in panic. Others dive directly into the stalls to try to avoid it, and many are unfortunately hit by the car. The scene is eerily similar to a 2016 terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, where an Islamist extremist killed 12 people and wounded dozens after driving his truck through the crowd. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is getting updates in from Berlin. Fred, give us the latest new information in this horrific incident.",

And the latest that we're getting is that apparently this incident, as the Germans put it, started at around 7:00 p.m. local time. That's about 1:00 p.m. your time, when that BMW plowed through that crowd in that Christmas market, a black BMW. Obviously, that place at that point in time, at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday, absolutely packed. You can see on some of the surveillance camera video, people trying to jump out of the way. Unfortunately for many people, in vain because the market stalls on those Christmas markets very close to one another. The aisles are extremely narrow. And again at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening, that place would have been absolutely packed. It is also, by the way, one of the main Christmas markets in the city of Magdeburg, which is itself the capital city of the state that it's situated in. So it was a very large Christmas market, the latest that we're getting from authorities there, speaking right now of one person having been killed, but at least 60 to 80 people having been injured, 15 people severely injured. So definitely a mass casualty event that is going on for the hospitals and the emergency medical rescue crews in and around the Magdeburg area. It is actually quite a large urban area as well. The police are saying that they've cordoned the area off widely, that there are tents that are being set up to tend to some of the people who have been injured in all of this. You already mentioned that the driver of the vehicle has been arrested. It's unclear whether or not the police are able to speak to him or her at this point in time. It is also right now unclear what exactly the motive for all of this might have been. However, German authorities are speaking of an attack on that Christmas market. And you know, you mentioned it, Jake. There was a huge attack on a Christmas market here in Berlin in 2016. And after that, the German authorities vowed to drastically increase safety and security around those Christmas markets, specifically to prevent things like cars and trucks plowing through those markets. So obviously, as you can imagine here in Germany, questions are already being asked about the security concept that was in place for this very Christmas market and how it was possible for a vehicle to be able to get onto the premises of the market and really speed through there -- obviously injuring a lot of people in its wake, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Jake.You know, this just reconfirms for us. How prominent these Christmas markets are as an enduring target for extremists and for issues of violence. So in addition to the 2016, you had another attack in Germany in 2018, in Strasbourg, which same basic plan, driving a car into the crowd at the market killed five people. And then, of course, as you mentioned earlier this month, \"Politico\" reports another attempted plot against the markets was foiled when the authorities arrested an Iraqi refugee. So this, you know, security at these markets at Christmas, it can't possibly be a higher priority than that for our German intelligence and law enforcement officials. We know they have a suspect in custody at this point. They are likely trying to render information from that suspect. Germany has the same sort of post-arrest laws that the United States does. You have a right to remain silent. You have a right to an attorney, an interpreter, if you don't speak German, that sort of thing. So whether or not that person is cooperating with authorities is really the big question right now. I know it seems crazy that anyone would cooperate in these circumstances, but very often terrorists or extremists who are arrested after participating in an act like that want to talk to law enforcement. And basically they want the world to know what they did. We don't know if that's the case here yet, but that's certainly what German authorities are focusing on, trying to suss out whether or not there is a similar attack, whether there are other attackers who are poised to do the same thing, trying to make those critical decisions about what sort of guidance they should give other cities, other towns in terms of protecting their own markets.",

The car is also going to give a lot of evidence who owned it. When was it acquired? BMW are obviously common in Germany. Was it under someone else's ownership? And then that would give you a sense of are there others that they have to be concerned about? I will say, knowing Germany, that that this is high alert throughout the entire country right now. These are very common areas, common festivals. We are now just a few days out from Christmas. They are clearly vulnerable. Hard to make them not vulnerable, just given the pedestrian aspects of it as well as the stalls, as we were saying, are very close. They're festive. There's beer, there's -- there's partying, there's shopping. But now you have an entire country that is going to be worried that that this would be followed up. So it's a -- this is a horrific event.

We've seen similar style attacks all across the world. If the UK is no stranger to vehicle attacks, vehicle attacks followed by incidents where the operators of the vehicle jumped out of the vehicles and then started to stab people.So it is a kind of a go-to approach for terrorist organizations to advise their members or just their followers, individuals like Josh mentioned who are inspired by them. Vehicles are easy to acquire, bladed weapons are easy to acquire. And so, you know, you can go back all the way to AQAP who used to put out \"Inspire Magazine\". It was a primary propaganda tool in the early 2000s, and one of their issues, they actually advocated for their followers to buy trucks and vans and attach bladed implements to them and drive them into crowds. So this -- this is something we have seen in extremist groups, a technique used by extremist groups for many years. And it's predominantly in places like Germany and other places where weapons and things like explosives are hard to acquire, vehicles are easy to acquire completely unprepared. Well, I shouldn't say completely unprotected, but soft targets like large public gatherings in places like markets and open sporting events and things like that, they present themselves as very opportune targets for people with vehicles.",

Peter, the suspect drove his car, apparently deliberately, through the crowd at high speed. Police suspect an explosive device could be in that car. The suspect has been arrested. Obviously, we are waiting for facts to come in about the driver and the -- and his motive, but this is obviously very suggestive of -- of other similar terrorist attacks. PETER BERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via telephone): It is, Jake. I mean, the one that comes to mind most quickly is the attack in Berlin on a Christmas market in 2016, which killed a dozen people and injured 56 more, again, using a vehicle. Also, we've seen ISIS-inspired terrorists in the United States conduct vehicle rammings. For instance, in the fall of 2017, an Uzbek-American inspired by ISIS killed six people in Manhattan using a vehicle as a weapon and, you know, this is -- it's a very easy tactic to do. You don't really need any training. Obviously, it's not like I'm carrying out some kind of sophisticated truck bomb attack. It is something that groups like ISIS and al Qaeda in Yemen have called for in the West. We've seen fewer terrorist attacks from Islamists of late, in Germany. We don't know the motive of the person here. Matthew Chance is reporting it based on local media. It could be a German, a Saudi doctor, which would be quite interesting. We had a Saudi national, a Saudi military officer carry out a terrorist bombing in the United States in 2019 at the Pensacola naval air base, killing three American sailors.

Times Square and years eve is very well-policed, and that for good reason, because Times Square has been the target of potential terrorist attacks in the past. The Germans do have a history of these markets being attacked. But that said, you know, this is a relatively obscure town in Germany, and, you know, if indeed this turns out to be Islamist terrorism or any other form of terrorism, people can radicalize online, they don't have to be part of a group. And as I said, you know, the easiest form of a terrorist attack is a vehicle ramming. You just acquire a car and you slam it into a place, you know, it's crowded. It requires no special training.

And that then allows the authorities to see is this someone who had some type of connection to a known or suspected terrorist, which would obviously be important, but as we've been discussing, oftentimes we see the so-called lone wolf, the person that is self-radicalized. And as authorities continue to tell us, this is their greatest concern because authorities can surveil a group of individuals that provides a greater opportunity, you know, that may be one of them will slip up or there will be some type of vector into the communications of that group in order to identify a particular plot. That's a lot more difficult if you have an individual who is not communicating in advance what they are about to do, not telegraphing their particular attack plans. I think that you mentioned that this individual was a doctor. I think it's worth pointing out, and obviously Peter knows this better than anyone, as far as you know, his terrorism expertise, there's kind of this misnomer that a lot of people have that, you know, terrorists are destitute and impoverished.

The United States of America is less than eight hours away from a federal government shutdown -- unless one of two things happens in the next four hours. One, Speaker Johnson puts forward a Republican bill legislation to fund the government that can get enough Republican votes to pass. His effort last night to do so, which was endorsed by President-elect Trump failed to get enough votes to pass. The second option is that Speaker Johnson puts forward a compromise bill, a compromise government funding legislation that Republicans and Democrats will vote for without Trump and Elon Musk blocking speaker Johnson from doing so, that was also a problem this week. There was a bill that did have the votes, apparently to pass, but the Trump and Musk did not want that bill to be introduced. So it was not. Let's go to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill.

Is there going to be a government shutdown? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Look, I've been very clear from the very beginning of my time in Congress, we cannot shut the government down. And that's why today, we met as a conference and agreed to put a continuing resolution on the floor with a one-year farm extension, farm bill extension, as well as disaster relief and aid to our farmers who are struggling, you know, in the post-pandemic world. So we have to get this across the finish line today and keep the government open. It would be the height of stupidity to shut the government down right before Christmas and heading into a new Congress. And so that's why I will absolutely vote in favor. And I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do so. Look, there are provisions that were removed from the original proposed CR to this one, including health care funding for 9/11 first responders, that I was 100 percent in favor of, as well as PBM reform and outbound controls on China. But those are issues that we're going to have to deal with in a new Congress and get them across the finish line. What cannot happen is that we shut the government down, and so folks can be upset about, you know, particular issues that they wanted addressed, not being in this new version, but to shut the government down is wrong. And I would just point out, Jake, as you know, a lot of the focus has been on obviously, President Trump weighing in and he rightly should weigh in, but where is Joe Biden? He's the sitting president of the United States. Nobody has heard a word from Joe Biden or the White House, and we're eight hours away from a government shutdown. You know, this is why Washington is so broken. You talk about the fact that we got to this point of a government shutdown, go down the hall in the Senate.

Again, that's not confirmed, but its being sort of widely reported inside Germany. And certainly there is an investigation underway and bomb disposal teams at the scene to try and determine, you know, the -- you know, the veracity of that of that report. And so we'll bring you the latest on that as soon as we can. The casualty figures, just very briefly, Jake, absolutely horrific. Two confirmed dead at the moment 68 injured. The fear is that the death toll could get much, much higher -- Jake.",

At this moment, authorities say he killed two people, one an adult, the other a toddler, 68 others are believed to be injured and the suspected driver identified, as I said by authorities, is a Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany since 2006.We turn now to David Sanger of \"The New York Times\", who is also a CNN national security analyst. David, what do you make of the details of this tragic attack?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, the first thing is there's a lot clearly, we don't know here, but as things come out sure looks like a terrorist attack. Looks like a deliberate act. There are reports in Germany which we have not yet separately confirmed that there were explosives in the car, or suspected explosives.If that turns out to be right, and first reports frequently are not, then that would suggest both that this could be a lot worse and was an act of terrorism. But the fact that the doctor had lived in Germany for nearly 20 years tells you that, you know, in modern Germany, he would be considered a German, right? And that he was, you know, part of the community. And so it's not immediately clear whether he might have been radicalized or may have had some more, you know, local grudge that had very little to do with a radical ideology.",

I mean, the government has essentially fallen, Jake, as you as you've seen, there are new elections set for February and it's unclear whether or not that had any relationship to this attack. You'll remember there was a very major attack in 2016 that was ultimately attributed to ISIS, or an ISIS follower. But, in this case, we don't know whether the local political situationor a radicalization issue is what was at work here. What is interesting about the political turmoil is it may step in the way of how the Germans react to this. I mean, there's a criminal matter. They could go do it if they had a political motivation or an ordered attack. It might be a little bit tricky for this government as its trying to head toward elections that will almost certainly result in a different -- different chancellor.",
