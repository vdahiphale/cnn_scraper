They write -- quote -- \"It would be a striking paradox if the president, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity.\" With us, chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic, also a team of the best lawyers on Earth.

Circuit Court rejecting former President Trump's argument that presidential immunity should shield him from the federal election subversion case.Now, this outcome was very much expected. He lost on this issue at the trial court. And a month ago, when they held oral arguments on this question, the three judges hearing the case appeared quite skeptical of Trump's lawyers arguments that their client enjoyed near-absolute immunity for anything that he did while in office. Let's listen to this quote now from today's opinion. They say -- quote -- \"For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as president no longer protects him against this prosecution.\" Pretty clear there on what they think of his claims of presidential immunity. But this is also very much about timing. The Trump legal strategy, while they are litigating some legitimate constitutional questions, they are also trying to do anything they can to delay these federal cases until after the November 2024 election. If Trump is reelected, he could through his attorney general likely make both of these cases go away. That is part of why they want to delay these. And this appeals court heard this case on an expedited schedule, but it still took them a month to issue this opinion. But now they are making up for lost time, because they're saying that they're going to send this whole case back down to the trial court next week, unless the Supreme Court intervenes. Now, if the Supreme Court does not opt to intervene here, if this does go back to the trial court next week, that means that it is likely that this case could go to trial before November.",

So, all the judges in the circuit would hear the case. Now, many people opt not to do that, because, if you lost with three judges, unlikely many times that you're going to win with the full circuit. But here again, it's about anything to delay. So they may try that. These three judges have laid out instructions if the Trump team does that, or they will appeal to the Supreme Court. And they have set this deadline of February 12. If the Supreme Court does not intervene by February 12, the circuit is going to send this back down to the trial court. Now, after that, when can this find a place on the calendar? Well, possibly April. I mean, they're going to do a little time to prepare. The case has been on hold.

First of all, they say there is no absolute immunity for the president. It is not and cannot be that a president or former president can never be charged for anything he did from January 20 at noon when he took office to four years later when he left office. That would leave us in a state of lawlessness. So they reject absolute immunity. Number two, they reject Donald Trump's argument that, well, even if there's limited immunity, I was within the boundaries. They say, oh, no, you were not. Not only do they say you were outside the boundaries. They say -- essentially, they say in this ruling, what you did was criminal.",

That's part of the president's job. What Jack Smith and this Court of Appeals panel say is, oh, no, what you were doing was well over that line, well out of bounds and indeed potentially arguably criminal. The third argument that they reject is Donald Trump's sort of, let's say, inventive argument that a former president or president can only be indicted once he's been impeached by the House of Representatives and then convicted by the U.S. Senate. Only then can he be criminally indicted. That was a creative construction that doesn't work for a lot of obvious reasons.

TIMOTHY HEAPHY, FORMER JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE LEAD INVESTIGATOR:  It aligns completely, right? The Select Committee found that there's evidence of the violations of federal criminal statutes and recommended that the Department of Justice evaluate them. They did that and brought those charges, and have only developed more evidence beyond that which was available to us. So it's not a surprise. It's, frankly, consistent with the facts and consistent with the Select Committee's view of the law, really, really thorough opinion. I mean, I -- just looking at it quickly, it goes through every argument that the former president and his team raised and the policy behind those arguments, rejects them on the law and the broader policy, essentially rejects the president's, former president's argument that it would impede decision-making and deliberations of future presidents if he or she were subject to criminal liability and upholds the interest and accountability above that.

And they do not want to weigh into political matters, as you can imagine.But this really isn't a political matter. It is a question of presidential power and checks and balances. It really goes to the heart. Remember when we talked about the actual oral argument in the hearing? They talked a lot about Marbury v. Madison. Eyes probably glazed over. Others probably tried to Google what they were talking about. All it really meant is that the Supreme Court has every right to weigh in and have judicial review of what they want to review. And that precisely could be this case. Why? Because it's asking a very novel question. Does absolute immunity apply to a president for all conduct that occurred while they were in office? And we have never had a president who's been indicted in the past. And so this is really a matter of first impression. If the Supreme Court were to take up this case, they would have to look at the constraints and limitations of what means -- what it means to have an official act. Because Trump will talk about this, and he has talked about this issue, in terms of what he has done leading up to January 6 and beyond as a matter of official duty. It was all because he's the president. Remember, the role of the president, as the head executive branch, is to enforce the laws as written. If he believes that the laws were being violated somehow, he is suggesting that he was just trying to enforce them and ensure that the voter fraud laws, that laws relating to a free and fair election, were not actually violated. The Supreme Court has looked at issues around official duties and actions in the past. Remember the Virginia governor in terms of whether he interacting with people about whether there were lobbyists or watches given or meetings that were set up, they had to first look at what it means to have official powers and duties. They will likely look at those issues as well here. But I do think, at the end of the day, a Supreme Court is hard-pressed to find that there is no way to hold accountable an official for criminal behavior. That falls outside of the duty of one's official conduct that goes into the campaigning and the election side, which is no longer a part of a presidential duty. But at the end of the day, this Supreme Court will have a lot to decide. And you asked the question earlier whether this Thursday's oral argument about the 14th Amendment and about Colorado might meander to that. I bet the Trump team will try. They want to have some kind of indication. Should I try? Do you want to hear from me? Remember, February 12 is Monday. It's not a distant date in the future.",

That was the one that the Select Committee highlighted in our criminal referral. It's a very high standard in any criminal case, as it should be. The Court of Appeals goes to great lengths to say those factual findings as to whether the elements of the crime have been satisfied will be up to a jury. They don't weigh in on the facts. Appellate courts generally do not. Look, the evidence is there. We believed, the Select Committee believed that it was sufficient to merit the referral. The special counsel has gotten additional evidence that makes that potential showing even stronger.
