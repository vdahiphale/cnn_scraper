In a statement the Palestine Red Crescent said 500 patients are at risk of losing vital medical care and people in the ICU will likely die.It's appealing for immediate aid, especially fuel. CNN crews witnessed heavy Israeli strikes overnight in northern Gaza. Israel announced on Friday that the death toll from the October 7th terrorist attack had been revised downward to 1,200. No explanation for the revision was offered. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, 11,000 people have died in the war, including 4,000 children. Meanwhile, we're learning about a potential deal to get many more hostages freed. A senior U.S. official tells CNN the proposal would require a sustained pause in the fighting that would last for several days.

The Saudi government made the decision to combine two emergency meetings into what is going to be a very large meeting.I think likely that we'll see some coalescing around the calls for a cease-fire, which we have seen from the Arab League and many countries taking part in this meeting. It is delicate. They have called not only for a cease-fire but a revival of the long-term peace process toward a two-state solution. And many people are looking to avoid a spillover of this conflict, which is something many have been worried about. We do see the Iranian president very strikingly in Saudi Arabia very soon after that delicate rapprochement. But his country has the power to call for an escalation, if they choose, being the primary backer of Hamas and Hezbollah. They have not done that yet. And Raisi is putting a lot of store in this meeting, saying on his way there that he's looking for decisive, actionable and implementable decision on Gaza. He also warned earlier in the week, if the meeting was not effective, that could lead to the possibility of a spillover because of frustration with the ineffectiveness of Muslim governments' pressure piling up on this meeting to really come up with something concrete. I think aside from coalescing around calls for a cease-fire, you're likely to see growing frustration and anger, signs of what we have already seen, with the U.S. and the West for their support of Israel. We have certainly seen diplomatic cables that show rising anger and frustration in Arab and Muslim countries. There's been attacks on U.S. forces in the region. So certainly the U.S. and the West will be watching this meeting very closely for that.",

As said, we don't know, there's no guarantee of success. But this is something that is being considered. And this track is very important.

I think Hamas is also hoping that external pressure will force Israel into a two-state solution. The Israelis over the last three decades have been unwilling to adopt a two-state solution. And they are hoping that external pressure from the rather tragic war will force Israel. So there's some opportunities for the U.S. to leverage some of that military aid to encourage Israel into looking to a post war. At present, the Israelis don't seem willing.

Gloria Pazmino explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is certainly a significant escalation of the investigation into whether the mayor's 2021 campaign conspired with foreign nationals to help funnel donations into campaign coffers. As you know, foreign nationals are not allowed to make political contributions here in the United States. And last week we learned that the mayor's chief fundraiser was raided by the FBI. She has not been accused of any wrongdoing. But almost a week later, we have learned that FBI agents approached mayor Eric Adams on a New York City street and presented him be a warrant to seize electronic devices. The mayor was delivering a speech at a public engagement on Monday evening. After he left there, sources close to the mayor tell me the FBI agents approached him in public. They asked his NYPD detail to step aside. And then they got into the mayor's city-issued vehicle and presented him with this warrant. The mayor then turned over his devices, two cell phones and an iPad, and then he went home later that evening and collected more electronic devices, including two old phones, and turned them over to the federal authorities. Now we should make it clear that the mayor has also not been accused of any wrongdoing. And here's what he had to say in a statement. He said, \"As a former member of law enforcement, I expect all members of my staff to follow the law and fully cooperate with any sort of investigation. And I will continue to do exactly that. I have nothing to hide.\" Now following the raid of the mayor's top fundraiser last week, the campaign conducted a review of records to determine if there had been any sort of wrongdoing. They apparently came up with some information showing that there was wrongdoing by one person. That's according to my sources close to the mayor. What is less clear is whether or not that wrongdoing amounts to criminal activity. That will be determined by the investigation. But this is certainly getting closer and closer to mayor Eric Adams.

His conference so far is split over which direction they should take. In the one corner, there's moderates and appropriators, who want a more clean, straightforward stopgap spending bill. And in the other corner, there are more conservative hardliners, pursuing this much more complicated idea that would extend funding for government agencies for various lengths of time, essentially teeing up multiple fiscal cliffs. That option would be dead on arrival in the Senate and would risk a government shutdown, which Johnson said he does not want on his watch. But at the same time he does not want to infuriate his right flank, especially so early on in his tenure.
