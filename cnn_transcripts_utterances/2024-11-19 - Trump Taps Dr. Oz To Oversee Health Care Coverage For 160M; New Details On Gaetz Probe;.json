Also, breaking, Trump not backing away from Matt Gaetz, doubling down moments ago, saying he is not reconsidering his pick. The attorney, whose clients say they were paid for sex by Gaetz is OUTFRONT tonight with new details. How much money he paid them? And, Putin's alarming nuclear warning as Ukraine wastes no time using American missiles to hit Russia. We're live in Moscow on this 1,000th day of the war. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump tapping yet another television personality to join his administration. This time, Dr. Mehmet Oz. Trump naming the TV doctor to oversee Medicare and Medicaid for more than 160 million Americans. Now, Oz, of course, is a household name. He does not have experience running any sort of a large government bureaucracy or institution of any way. So why did Trump choose him? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: My friend Dr. Mehmet Oz, he's a great man. Dr. Oz, I've known him a long time. His show is great. He's in that -- he's on that screen. He's in the bedrooms of all those women telling them good and bad and they love him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, just a reminder in a caveat, we were told this was coming last Friday.However, this has been an ongoing issue because of what was going on behind the scenes. Donald Trump had been set to pick hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, when Howard Lutnick, the co-chair of the transition, inserted himself into the mix, saying that he wanted to be secretary of treasury. This caused a lot of headaches for the people on the transition team, one, Lutnick and Trump have had a relationship for a very long time, but we are also told it started somewhat of a knife fight between the two of them, with really Howard Lutnick as the only one wielding a knife. It actually annoyed people on the transition team and even annoyed Donald Trump we were told by a number of people he spoke to about it, and caused him to open up the field. So I want to show you who we believe the four finalists to be at this time. Scott Bessent still in the mix here. We also have Tennessee Senator Hill Hagerty. We have Kevin Warsh, who was a former Federal Reserve governor and billionaire Marc Rowan. I am told that all of them have met with Trump and or the transition team, that all the interviews are done, and tomorrow is going to be the time they have these long discussions with the hope of getting secretary of treasury out of the gate by tomorrow night. Now again, of course anything can happen in Trump world, but that is the goal right now. Remember, this was one of the ones they wanted to get out first because Donald Trump has made so many promises that are contingent on the economy. And they wanted somebody to be the face of all of that. And just a reminder, the reason why they feel they can move forward. I don't know if I mentioned this is because Lutnick was named secretary of commerce today, getting him out of the way, paving the way for this to actually happen.",

There's a lot of people who get put into these jobs who haven't overseen much, right? So I'm not going to say the fact that he hasn't overseen disqualifying in and of itself.

He is casting the characters that he wants to play in his administration. And the point behind this is actually a serious one. They're not just good looking people. They're very effective communicators who actually are recognizable to the American public. If you think about why Donald Trump thinks he won this election, it's because he was able to have a consistent message. People listened to him. He is recognizable, and he was palling around with people like Elon Musk. He is putting people in these positions that people know and that can sell his policies. So whatever he does, there are going to be people who are able to go out into the manosphere, into podcasts, on cable news, and talk about it in a way that people will relate to.

It's been very mutually beneficial for both of them to be seen together. But it's going to cause a lot of problems. This is I think, the honeymoon period.

He is innovative, he's inventive. And by the way, you don't get to be that level of creative and inventive without having some degree of eccentricity. And he is he is a brilliant, eccentric genius. And if he throws out 100 ideas and you know some number of them are bad or ridiculous, so be it. But Trump campaigned on the notion that we're going to break the mold.

Just moments ago, trying to get into the U.S. and they only stopped when they saw our crew there filming them, doing it. Border agents telling our David Culver, who is right there and its his team that noticed the men trying to climb over the wall. They told them that Mexican cartels right now are urging migrants to rush into the United States before Trump takes office.This comes as Trump insists he will begin mass deportations and vows he'll use the military to do that. Let's just show you a checkpoint about 30 miles from the border in Arizona. This was empty in June, and now it is fully staffed and active. I want to go straight to David Culver, who just witnessed all of this. Those migrants trying to scale that wall and has been reporting from the border for days now. And, of course, over and over again over these past months and years joining me now from Nogales. So, David, you just filmed that video. What happened? DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that caught us off guard. I mean, we were preparing to come live and talk to you here, and this is about ten, 15 minutes ago, a very high part of the border wall as well, that they just came over or at least tried to come over. They were scaling, and as soon as they noticed that we were recording, they went back down and put on their hoods and continued along their way. What's interesting about that area, though is if you compare it to, say, six months ago, when folks were desperate to get over, didn't care if people were seeing them, didn't care if they were caught, in fact, they would try to get flagging down some of the border sometimes us to say, hey, can we get a ride? We want to be processed. Then in June, President Biden's executive action came into play and that limited the number of people who were going to be allowed into the U.S. We're now hearing more and more deportations going back over the border into Mexico. But I want to revisit though, that checkpoint that you mentioned, because this all ties together. You're having people who are coming over who are trying to do so undetected, and they make their way into the U.S. but what happens, as you mentioned, that checkpoint that's 30 miles inland. And when we were here in June, Border Patrol said they didn't have enough resources to have agents at those checkpoints. Now you're driving northbound and you're waiting 10 to 15 minutes. You then come through. It is fully staffed. You've got K9 there, you've got them looking at every single person in the car. They wanted to make eye contact and then they let us continue on. Some people were also then pulled aside for secondary search. It is far more thorough than we've seen before. But, Erin, the point that border patrol agents are telling me is they didn't have the bandwidth to do that before. As one agent has been telling me, he has felt like a federal babysitter and having to drive migrants from the border to processing centers. Now they say they have enough agents to be able to do these checkpoints and they're at several locations. We've passed three in the past couple of days and they are fully operational for now.",

They tried to cross somewhere else, but ran away from your cameras.Look, you've been down there just on this particular trip, David, for days.

NEIL MAKHIJA (D), MONTGOMERY COUNTY, PA COMMISSIONER &amp; BOARD OF ELECTIONS CHAIR: So essentially, look, this is something that's only true of mail in ballots. One of the requirements under the election code is that you sign and date the outside of the ballot. Now, we also have a bar code on the outer envelope of the mail in ballot which allows us to track. When we sent out the ballot and when we receive the ballot. So we know when a voter is lawfully eligible to vote. We know when they're registered to vote and we know when we got their ballot on time.
