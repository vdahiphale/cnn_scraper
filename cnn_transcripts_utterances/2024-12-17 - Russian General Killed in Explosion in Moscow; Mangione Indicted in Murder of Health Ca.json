Tech leaders descend on Mar-a-Lago for an audience with the president-elect. We'll look at why. Plus, chasing the sun, a space mission with a lot of flair. We'll call it the hottest story in science. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, A top Russian general has been killed inside Moscow, apparently by Ukraine. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was killed by a bomb, according to Russian authorities, a source telling CNN that Ukraine's security services are behind the assassination. It comes just one day after Ukraine charged him in absentia, alleging he'd used banned chemical substances. The general was in charge of Russia's nuclear, chemical, and biological forces, with Russian officials calling his death a, quote, \"terrorist act.\" Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow for us.

We got there pretty shortly after all this happened, and you could immediately tell in that sort of suburban area in the Southeast of Moscow, that someone who was very important had just been killed. There was a huge security perimeter. There were a lot of security forces on the ground, police investigators, but also military investigators. And now, as you can imagine, Russian politicians, Russian media absolutely railing against the Ukrainians. Here's what we're learning.

And there does seem to be a stark contrast between the way the Kremlin and Putin himself is speaking aboutthe decisions being made by the current U.S. administration and perhaps how things may shift under the president-elect and the next administration. I just wonder whether, and there clearly are those out there wondering whether events like this will perhaps complicate the challenge of bringing Vladimir Putin to the table over some future negotiations. Certainly, the president-elect on Monday was suggesting that this was going to be perhaps far harder than he'd initially thought, having said he could solve this in, what, 24 hours. PLEITGEN (on camera):  Well, first of all, there are some here in Russia who are saying that they believe that that is the case. It was quite interesting because the top Russian senator came out today after this event, after the killing of this very senior Russian general, Julia, and he said, quite frankly, that he believes that this could indeed complicate any sort of efforts to try and get talks going between Washington and Moscow once the Trump administration takes office. Of course, it's one of the things that is a big talk of the town here in Moscow and among Russian officials about how serious Donald Trump is and how serious the future Trump administration is about trying to solve this conflict and stop this conflict as fast as possible. Certainly, one of the things that we've been taking note of over the past couple of weeks is that the Kremlin does appear to be increasingly confident that Donald Trump wants an end to this conflict as quick as possible and that the Russians could get a deal to end the conflict that could be very favorable for Moscow in the not-too-distant future. So, certainly, something like this is something that could complicate that. One of the things, of course, that we've heard from many Russian politicians here throughout the day is that there will be revenge for all this. You do also see them laying blame on the west as well. It was interesting because another politician also said that he believes there was a direct link to the west. One of the things that we have not heard today, which I think is also quite remarkable, Julia, is that the Kremlin has not directly commented on any of this yet. There usually is a conference call with a spokesman for the Kremlin with journalists, that did not happen today. So, whether or not the Kremlin is sort of trying to lay low with any commentary, we really don't know at this point in time. However, we know that the Russians are saying some of the things that they have heard from Donald Trump over the past couple of weeks certainly has them believing that the president-elect really does want to find some sort of end to this conflict as fast as possible. Certainly, that recent press conference that he gave at Mar-a-Lago was another sign to the Russians. But they are, of course, also saying that the use of ATACMS missiles to strike deep into Russia and certainly assassinations like the one that we saw today is definitely something that could complicate things in these final weeks that the Biden administration still is in office, Julia.",

That's the only, only argument they possibly could have. And you're facing a mountain of alleged forensic evidence that suggests that the bullets were, his knapsack was his, he fled, which is consciousness of guilt. But at the end of the day, you still got to prove that that is the individual, Mr. Mangione is the individual who walked up behind him. Now, I don't say that's a great argument, but it's the only one I can think of because he has evidence that he was in the area, he was at a hotel or a hostel. So, it's going to be hard to prove that he was in Chicago or L.A. and had an alibi. So, that's the only defense I can think of, short of he claims that he was under a mental disease or defect. That's insanity. But it doesn't seem, based on the video, if it is him, that he was insane when he walked up behind and allegedly pulled the trigger. I want to comment on the ghoulishness and the sick comments of people. Vigilante-ism is not something that should ever be tolerated. You cannot take the law into your own hands. And that's what he's done.

Yes, that's very important. The softer Wall Street action coming as the U.S. Fed kicks off a two-day policy meeting in Washington, another quarter of a percentage point rate cut is expected on Wednesday. The Central Bank's third consecutive cut. Investors believe policymakers will dial back their outlook for cuts next year in their updated dot plots, as we call it. Also on Tuesday, shares of Nissan and Honda revving higher with Nissan up a whopping 11 percent. Take a look at that. And Nikkei report says the two Japanese car giants are set to begin merger talks as competition from lower cost Chinese firms continues to pile up on the pressure. And checking Asia markets, the South Korean KOSPI leading the declines there. It's a sea of red. A Reuters report out after the Asia market close could also affect Wednesday's trade later today. It says Chinese leaders have agreed to run a record budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP next year to help boost growth. New numbers Tuesday showing Chinese retail sales coming in weaker than expected too, all this as they yield on China's 30-year bonds fell below 2 percent due to slower growth fears. Now, the Asian Development Bank believes Beijing will fail to meet its 5 percent growth target both this year and next due in large part to its ongoing property sector slump. It says in a new quarterly report that developing Asian nations will see growth under 5 percent both this year and next, too, and more economic challenges across the region, too. The bank lowering its growth outlook for South Asia due to a softer picture in India. The big wild card across the region, of course, is the threat of higher Trump administration tariffs next year.

Albert, fantastic to have you on the show as always. Let's hone in on China because there have been a number of headlines in recent days.

And so, although this will definitely negatively affect Asia and China, because they've always been big exporting, manufacturing economies, actually, this time, I think the effects will be a bit more muted, partly because if the focus is on China, China has already reduced quite a bit of its export exposure to the United States. And so -- and there's been a realignment of supply chains in the regions where China has been supplying other countries and we see other countries stepping in like Vietnam, which has really significantly increased its exports to the U.S. to replace the Chinese exports that were facing tariffs.

North Korea has suffered several hundred casualties fighting Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region. This, according to a senior U.S. military official.

We have heard optimistic comments over the course of the last week from U.S. Israeli, Qatari, and Egyptian officials, and now Hamas is joining the fray. But as with the others who are expressing optimism, Hamas is also adding a note of caution to their comments. In their statement, they are making clear that, quote, \"Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions.\" And that if is indeed that note of caution that they are raising, suggesting that Israeli negotiators are making additional demands as this negotiating process moves forward. A second Hamas source said that they view the current state of negotiations as, quote, \"positive and optimistic.\" And it is important to note that amid this optimism, we are also seeing a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region. The U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just last week traveled to Israel, Egypt, and Qatar to try and advance a deal. He said he hopes that he can put the conditions in place to reach a deal within the next month, and that is indeed the target here appears to be to try and reach a deal before President Biden leaves office on January 20th and President-Elect Trump will then be inaugurated. And we know, of course, that the Biden administration has also been closely coordinating with the Trump administration over this deal, as incoming Trump advisers have also been traveling to the region and coordinating closely with the officials who they will soon be replacing. It is important to note that to caution though that as we are seeing this momentum as we are seeing this optimistic language the reason why we are also hearing notes of caution from all of the parties involved is because we have been this close in the past. We have been very close to a deal and ultimately, talks have collapsed. And that possibility still very much looms. But Israeli and American officials who I've spoken to have pointed to a new set of conditions in the region in terms of Hamas being increasingly isolated, Israel having accomplished a slew of military achievements in Gaza, including the killing of Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, then might make them more willing to reach a deal now. All of this pointing us in the direction of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal. But again, the deal isn't reached until it's done. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The two traveled to the International Space Station, if you remember, on Boeing's Starliner back in June, but they couldn't return as planned due to safety concerns about their spacecraft. NASA has been planning to bring them back aboard a SpaceX capsule. With today's decision, that flight will not take place now before March. And if all goes well, NASA will make history next week on Christmas Eve. One of its probes may become the closest human-made object to the sun. And by close, we're talking a mere 3.8 million miles or more than 6 million kilometers, a hair breadth in space terms. The Parker Solar Probe was launched back in 2018 on a mission to expand our understanding of the sun. And while the probe will be traveling through temperatures in the millions of degrees, the body of the spacecraft will sit at 85 degrees Fahrenheit or around 30 degrees Celsius. Nicky Fox is the head of science at NASA. She's also part of the Parker Solar Probe Project. Nicky, fantastic. And what a cool job title. That's all I can say. Let's just talk about how extraordinary it is for anything, let alone this probe to be so close to the sun.",

And it took 60 years for technology to literally catch up with our dreams, to be able to actually have materials that can withstand -- you know, and for us, it's not just the incredible heat.

And it sort of allows us to focus and turn the path of the mission closer and closer to the sun each time we do a Venus flyby. So, we've done seven of them. The last one was in November, you know, just last month. It was really exciting to be with the team. I actually went to the Mission Control Center and I was with the team when we did that Venus flyby. And it is just, you know, even more science. We actually do science when we fly past Venus as well. So, we've kind of taken the U.S. back to Venus after all this time, taking really, really high-resolution images. We've been able to sample, again, the atmosphere around Venus as we've flown past it. So, that's a really exciting way to be able to do planetary science as well as heliophysics, as well as astrophysics, because we're learning about our star and it helps us know about stars in other galaxies and how maybe they could support life on neighboring planets just like the sun supports life here.",

The star is active. And we have something space weather. So, when we talk about these beautiful, large events that we see on the sun, and we were all treated in the U.S., even to amazing auroral displays, the northern lights visible from many, many parts of the U.S. throughout this year, as we've had a lot of activity. When you see those Aurora, you know that you have an active space weather event. It's like an electric current in the sky. And so, understanding it, it also causes radiation, it can cause damage to spacecraft, to sensitive electronics. And also, of course, we want to be able to protect our astronauts. So, it's yet another reason as we step -- kind of step away on our journey to the moon and then to Mars and beyond.
