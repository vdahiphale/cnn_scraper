On the one hand, you have those who are opponents of gun control measures who talk about this in the language of mental health is the only viable way to actually stop this problem, akin to that notion that a good guy with a gun will stop a bad guy with a gun every day. There's not a lot of evidence to support either one of these theories and instead on the other side, you have people saying, look, we can have reasonable gun control that includes background checks, maybe a graduated level for the type of weapon, raising the age of who has access to the weapons and, of course, the red flag laws to flag issues of people who can actually identify who might be likely to be the classic person that John was alluding to. The problem is the kind of whack-a-mole with the number of different mass shootings that we have where policymakers simply try to suggest that, look, one narrow measure is not going to solve everything. There is no panacea. And there begins to be a paralysis of all these things.

So, while I'm in Mexico, let me just show you in these live images here what's across the river. And that, you see this barbed wire fencing, and then on the other side, that's the U.S., though camped out between the barbed wire and border fencing, you see hundreds of migrants. And, Wolf, this is only a very small portion of the tens of thousands that have come here into Ciudad Juarez waiting to try to figure out how exactly they can get over.And we should point out Title 42, while it's still in effect, essentially, what that means for these migrants here is that in the next hours, potentially days, and we're talking in pretty scorching heat, 90 degrees, without much access to food, little access to water, they will hope to be processed up there at that entry point. And little by little, they're being allowed in to start their processing for claiming asylum. Currently under Title 42, they can be deported right away to places like Ciudad Juarez, right across the river. They can then, hours later, try again. What's going to change when Title 42 expires, assuming it does on Thursday, is Title 8 will take effect, and that means the migrants that try to go in, Wolf, they have to be processed so the U.S. will have to have a preliminary interview with them. Officials will have to hear their claims for asylum. But if they do not qualify for asylum, Wolf, they will be again immediately deported, the difference being they'll be barred from trying again within for five years. So, it's a pretty significant change in what they could they facing once Title 42 lifts. Though a lot of these folks, I've got to be honest, you talk to them, are not timing their efforts around Title 42 anymore. They saw this in November, where it was nearing the deadline and then extend. They saw it in December. We were here as well to cover that. Again, nearing the deadline, but then continued on here into May. And so they've said the back and forth over U.S. policy, they can't follow. They're just focused on how they can try to get over. And if they can't get in this way, Wolf, they are determined to figure out ways in, including ways that mean going undetected.",

The gunman was removed from the U.S. military for mental health concerns and had a history of extremism. We all know that now.

TONY GONZALES (R-TX): Thank you for having me, Wolf. And it is a heartbreaking situation what's happening all throughout Texas and throughout the country. We have a problem in this country with violence. We have a problem with shootings. We have to address that. We have to realize that this is a real problem and it is one we have to protect the Constitution and make sure those can legally purchase weapons, but it's much deeper than that. And there needs to be less finger-pointing and more solutions. We need to look into this individual in Dallas' specific situation. Why didn't we catch this ahead of time? You had an earlier guest on that said, it's a classic case of a shooter. I agree with him. I mean, we need to be able to identify these earlier and get ahead of the issue, not responding to it.

But, once again, less of the finger pointing. More of the solutions, you know, Congress has a role to play in this. I certainly agree to that. The White House has a role to play with that.

So, that's how he's dealing with it, that he's wise, not old. But let's face it. Just this week alone, he faces a trifecta of issues, those poll numbers, the debt crisis and the border, which is all going to come to a head very shortly. Joe Biden likes to say, watch me.

I mean, if you look at this poll, again, it's -- as David will agree, it's a more severe version but they're actually similar to what we are seeing, you know, elsewhere.It shows you that there is an audience for Trump. I mean, the question really to me was this was a poll where Biden's disapproval was at 56 or 57 and Trump was still at 44 percent of the vote, can he really go beyond that when you have a majority of Americans saying that these charges are justified and he faces multiple further possible indictments, not to mention the hangover of January 6th? I think the view among Democrats and I think even among many Republicans is that until you get to the actual choice, when voters are faced with the question of whether they will willing to entrust Donald Trump, if he's the nominee, with the powers of the presidency again, it's really hard to get too fine a gauge on where they are going from these early polls. I think that will be the pivot of the election. In a strange way, if Trump is on the ballot, he more than the incumbent, I think, will be the pivot. And the core question for voters will be, do they trust him with the powers of the presidency.",
