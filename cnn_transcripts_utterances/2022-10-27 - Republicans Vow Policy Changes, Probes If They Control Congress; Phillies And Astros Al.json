And that is part of what is driving their legislative agenda. It's important to note that the party that runs the House typically engages in two types of legislation. One is built purely around messaging, and firing up the base. Democrats, for instance, did that with sweeping gun reform measures, even though they knew the bill they passed, wouldn't even get 50 votes, in the Senate, let alone 60. The other kind of legislation is actual legislating. Last month, House Republicans laid out their legislative priorities, calling it their \"Commitment to America.\" So, let's break it down, and try to figure out, exactly, what the Republicans will try to do. A big focus, obviously, will be the economy. Republicans are vowing to repeal the $80 billion, currently set aside, at least partly, for new IRS agents, in the bill that the Democrats called the Inflation Reduction Act. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): But on that very first day that we're sworn in, you'll see that it all changes, because, on our very first bill, we're going to repeal 87,000 IRS agents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Republicans also want to reimpose Trump-era border restrictions, to stem the flow of migrants, coming from Mexico. There's also what they call, a \"Parent's Bill of Rights,\" taking a page from the playbook of Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, who was elected, last year, in Virginia, a state that Joe Biden won by 10 points, partially by appealing to parents, frustrations, with remote- learning and masking in schools.

That of course was the 2018 Super Bowl, when the Eagles trounced the Patriots. But since I clearly cannot be objective here, I thought I would bring in a guy, who knows a thing or two about sports.

And, in fairness, and I realized, you have a little fun with your hyper-partisanship, for Philadelphia teams, which you're entitled to.But once the sanctions came down, the Astros weren't able to use any nefarious tactics. And they made it as far as the ALCS six straight years, and they've been in the World Series, four out of six. So, we can't attribute that to banging on trash cans. This year's Astro team won 106 games. They blitzed through the postseason so far, at 7 and 0. They are a really good team. Dusty Baker will likely make the Hall of Fame as a manager. Plus, he was a very good player, and he's a beloved figure, 73-years-old, kind of a wise man, to the game, wonderful storyteller. The only thing he doesn't have, on his resume, is a World Series championship. He's been to the World Series, but he hasn't won it. So, his pursuit of that one thing is a storyline. But the Phillies are also a storyline. They won only 87 games. In the expanded playoffs, there are now 12 teams, playing in October. And only one, the Rays, who won 86 games, had a lesser record than the Phillies. But a pennant race is a 162-game challenge. But the postseason now has become a tournament. And in a tournament, it's which team gets hot, and stays hot. And the Phillies are not the team that won 87 games, during the regular season, and was the sixth playoff qualifier in the National League. Right now, they're playing terrific baseball. And they've got Nola and Wheeler set up. Of course, they'll face Verlander and Valdez, so that might be a push. But in any case, they're playing their best baseball. And if they can get out of Houston, the first two games with a split, they come back to Citizens Bank Park, for Games 3, 4 and 4, the place will be crazy and who knows what might happen.",

The Cardinals themselves, in 2006, snuck into the playoffs, got hot, at the right time, and won the World Series. The Seattle Mariners won 116 games, in 2001, and didn't even make it to the World Series. That's kind of the nature of baseball. Are there upsets in every sport? Sure. But in a short series, in baseball, just the nature of the sport makes it more likely that the team that appears to be the lesser team, on paper, has a better chance, not a better chance, to win, but a better chance, if they played a 100 games, not a better chance to win, but a decent chance to win, a best out of five or a best out of seven.",

Now, they openly acknowledge it, and they do everything they can, within the nature of the game, equipment changes, the protocols put in place, et cetera.But as someone once said, \"The biggest problem with football is football.\" It's the very nature of the game. Injuries in other sports are by and large, incidental, although obviously they happen. In football, it's just fundamental. It's a contact sport, on every single play. And the sub-concussive hits, especially the linemen? Linemen collide on every play. That doesn't result in a diagnosable concussion. But there are sub-concussive hits, on almost every play. And cumulatively, that takes a toll. So, the very nature of the game, as exciting as it is, as interesting as it is, with all of its strategies, and the generational connections, and all the excitement, and in college sports, the campus atmosphere and all that stuff? That's undeniable. But so too, is the very nature of the game. TAPPER: Yes. No, it's true. Some 2 million kids play youth and high school football. Neurosurgeons tell us, the real risk is, as you note, from the cumulative hits, to the head, whether or not they're concussive.",

In fact, there is a film that comes out tomorrow about what life was like pre Roe v. Wade. It stars Elizabeth Banks, and Sigourney Weaver. The movie was in fact conceived, written and filmed before the federal law that Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court precedent, was overturned. This film is called \"Call Jane.\" It's about what was the Jane Collective, a real-life underground operation, in Chicago that's facilitated more than 10,000 abortions, in that city, between 1965 and 1973. Elizabeth Banks plays Joy, a conservative suburban housewife, whose pregnancy threatens her life, because of a heart condition. Joy is eventually helped by the Jane Collective, in her darkest hour.
