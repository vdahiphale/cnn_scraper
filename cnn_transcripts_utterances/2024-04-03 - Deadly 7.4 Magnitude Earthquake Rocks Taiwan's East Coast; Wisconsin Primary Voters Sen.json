We begin with breaking news. Taiwan rocked by a deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake. It's the most powerful earthquake to hit the island nation in 25 years. Here's what we know right now, rescue efforts are underway. More than two dozen buildings have collapsed, and people are trapped. The epicenter of the quake located just south of the tourist city of Hualien. There are already powerful aftershocks and more are expected over the next several days, possibly reaching a 7.0 magnitude. Well, just look at this dashcam video was reported as the earthquake hit those cars and buses shaking violently. Very scary. The earthquake also triggering landslides. And at this hour, at least seven people are dead with dozens more injured. Those numbers are expected to rise. Lets get the latest from CNN's Hanako Montgomery. She is live up from Tokyo for us. Hanako, good morning to you. Do you have a handle yet on how much destruction this earthquake has caused? And what are the possible ripple effects",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Kasie, good morning.You know, really powerful are earthquakes felt in Taiwan this morning, I really just shocking footage. But in terms of what we know about the effect of this earthquake and the shocking aftershocks, you know, we've seen seven deaths and at least 700 people injured. We're also hearing reports about 77 people trapped in some of these tunnels in Taiwan. Now, we have to note that the epicenter of this earthquake was in Hualien County, which was located on the eastern side of the island. Hualien County is a really popular tourist destination. It's also a rural area, and coincidentally, it's where most of Taiwan's earthquakes take place. But because it was very close to the epicenter, were actually seeing most of the damage happened in Hualien County, actually, of the seven who died, all of them were killed in, again, Hualien county, three of them were actually hiking in this very popular spot called Taroko Gorge. So in terms of the people trapped still in the tunnel, again, you have 77 people are still trapped. We're hearing reports that some of the people trapped include foreign nationals, two Germans and two Canadians. So, authorities are desperately trying to get those people out and to safety. Now, in terms of the damage that we're seeing across the island, we're seeing more than 100 buildings damaged or destroyed, including seven hospitals in Taipei, the capital, we're also hearing that more than 91,000 homes were without power. Some of these roads were also partially destroyed, which was affecting some of the rescue efforts. Now, in terms of just how people are trying to help those who are still stuck underneath some of the rubbles stuck in those tunnels, the Taiwanese defense ministry has dispatched military personnel and they're working with local authorities and trying to secure those people. And this is very common protocol when you see a natural disaster of this magnitude, Kasie.",

I'm sure we'll bring any new reporting as soon as we have that.Let's go now go to politics. Primary voters in the key battleground state of Wisconsin sending a message to President Biden and Donald Trump, both men sweeping their respective primary races last night but you can see some cracks for both men. Trump failing to break 80 percent in Wisconsin, almost 13 percent of the vote going to Nikki Haley. [05:05:01] She, of course, dropped out of the race nearly a month ago. President Biden, meanwhile, winning roughly 87 percent of the vote with more than 40,000 Democrats in Wisconsin casting a ballot for uninstructed, essentially vote for none of the above. 47,000 votes, more than double the margin of Biden's victory in Wisconsin in 2020.

Probably is the first question. Within this plan as we understand, it would be quite move. The U.S. leads on certain coordination work and NATO would take over that work be interesting to see what Trump and Biden think of that. There'll be losing some control of that, but maybe they'll be happy to do that. But I think, you know, what do you think, Kasie, but Trump has been calling for NATO to be -- NATO members to contribute more to NATO. If they do sort of a grievous, he might have the arguments say, look, they've done it, they've listened to what I've said. So, now, I don't have a problem with NATO, I don't know.

In particular, when you listen to the way that the former president talks about Vladimir Putin, they're almost seems to be oftentimes in admiration and in far-right corners of the party, you see that pretty openly and, you know, Trump if there's anything he's good at, its kind of putting his finger in the wind to see where his people are on these kinds of things, and then following through on that.I mean, I think the big question in terms of the Ukraine war is whether he would go with that sort of sentiment in the party. And I think you have people out there like John Bolton, who of course worked for Trump. But one point, but has now become a prominent critic raising real questions about that. And I think for Europe and for NATO this in many ways is aimed at tying Trump's hands or at least going around him in the event that he's not willing at to put this money out there. What is your sense of how Europe is -- I mean, this does take a lot of consensus, right? I mean, all these nations have to agree. Is that an issue? Do you think?",

So who pays the most and how they carve it up and what can they deliver the money?I think what will be interesting is whether if they do approve it, it does show massive resolve to support Ukraine in this war and try to beat Russia. The other thing they'll be considering is what the reaction Russia might be because it could be seen as an escalation. You know, it doesn't allow the Putin to then say NATO is gearing up for war with Russia. There'll be aware of that, but I think there's a feeling within NATO that they've actually provided the countries within native, provided quite a lot to Ukraine and they haven't had a response from Russia, so they may be to get away with this, but it shows resolved from NATO. We have to wait to see how Russia response to it because increased tensions. If it's approved, there won't be approved straight away.

We do have a live severe thunderstorm warning there just to the south of Macon. The storm those stretches up north, I mean, we've got some heavy rain towards New York and Philadelphia. It gets you flash flood warning earnings there around Atlanta. Flood watch in effect for a lot of the mid-Atlantic going into New England where we've got one to three inches of rain. That's possible from jersey back down into West Virginia. The severe risk continues to move east as we go into the day-to-day. That's where we've got the threat of damaging winds, large hail and isolated tornadoes from Norfolk, Virginia, back down towards Orlando and Tampa. So, we're looking at the spring side of this with a severe threat along the East Coast. But look at what happens as cold air comes in from the top.
