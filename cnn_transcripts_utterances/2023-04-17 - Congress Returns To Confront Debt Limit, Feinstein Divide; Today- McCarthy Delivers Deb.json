      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. 2024 revs up Ron DeSantis aligned Super PAC, answers what you might call a sticky ad by asking why Donald Trump is now spending his time attacking other Republicans. This week the Florida governor heads here to Washington, to Capitol Hill that after a donor defects from his campaign in waiting.Plus, a class field trip tries to turn up the pressure on Alvin Bragg. House judiciary Republicans hold a hearing in Manhattan, the D.A.'s backyard. They call him soft on crime, and yes, to deflect attention from Bragg's prosecution of the former president. And a delay on the eve of a billion-dollar trial. Our Fox and Dominion perhaps headed for a settlement or will the tankers, some of whom read blatant lies on the air have to take the witness stand. But up first for us, Congress is back today, and lawmakers returned to a very long to do list. This morning, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy using the New York Stock Exchange as the backdrop for a speech in which he placed blame for the debt ceiling stalemate at President Biden's feet. Speaker McCarthy detailing the broad strokes of what Republicans want in exchange for agreeing to let the government borrow more to pay its bills. Now Republicans don't have a budget yet because of infighting. And they do not even have full agreement yet on a new strategy for this debt showdown. Yet, McCarthy says the president is the problem, branding him an absentee negotiator, unwilling the speaker says to make the hard spending choices. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): President Biden has been missing in action and misleading the public. Mr. President, with all due respect, enough is enough. This is not how the leader of the free world should act. A no strings attach debt limit increase will not pass. But since the president continues to hide, House Republicans will take action.

Leader McConnell ignoring questions on a pressing Senate issue, where the Republicans will block a democratic plan to temporarily replace the ailing Senator Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee.Let's get straight up to Capitol Hill with CNN's Lauren Fox. Lauren, let's focus on the Republican leader who was talking today, the speaker McCarthy. Again, Republicans don't even have a plan yet, but he wants to make the case.

He walked his conference through some of the details of the spending cuts that they are hoping to rally around. But as you noted, House Republicans have struggled over the last several months to get together on even basic messaging bills, on immigration bills at times.And therefore, whether or not they're going to be able to rally around a debt ceiling negotiation is another question entirely. And that is exactly what the White House is banking on that this idea that Republicans are going to be able to coalesce around one plan is really a far reach for them, especially given the fact that they have such a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. Still, they are going to try to push ahead in the upcoming days. I'm told from sources they are hoping to unveil legislative tax. If they do so, they are also hoping to rally around one single debt ceiling increase plan. It would raise the debt ceiling until next May. It would be accompanied by strong spending cuts. Whether or not they can do it though, John, another question entirely.",

They have not moved on a border security bill in the House this year because of infighting within the party. Also, other things as well, dealing with the repeal of green energy tax credits. I'm told that some conservative pushing hard for that uncertain how they will deal with those internal issues. But John, in talking to a number of these senior Republicans over the last several days, they do feel confident that they can ultimately get there, even though they can only limit his factions to just four Republicans in order to pass a bill long, straight party lines. McCarthy, I'm told, wants us on the floor in May. The hope is they can get this out of the House and that will strengthen their negotiating position with the White House. Even though, as you said, no chance of passing the Senate, but they want to try to force the White House to the negotiating table. They're saying the White House demands for no clean, no conditions with the debt ceiling increase simply will not pass. So, they're trying to make that case here. We'll see if they can get there.",

You have the White House, you know, sticking firm to this position. But below the surface, there is some acknowledgement that, you know, Republicans do have some leverage and there will have to be some kind of deal. And then Republicans meanwhile, you know, going back and forth with the different factions, trying to triangulate all of these different perspectives, which is very difficult with such a narrow majority. So just to get something on the table is going to be hard enough.

They suggested that those would be devastating cuts more or less. And so, this is just something that they say that they are not going to be negotiating on.

She is not here. She's dealing with the case of the shingles. She says her doctors have not cleared her to come back to Washington yet. Listen to three of her Democratic colleagues, essentially saying we have to get a resolution here soon but let's have patients. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): She's been voted by her state to be senator for six years. She has the right in my opinion to decide when she steps down. SEN.

This is also the president's, you know, trying to get as many judicial nominees as possible. Where's the tipping point? I guess the Democrats probably do not have the votes. Republic, they probably won't get 10, Republicans to go along to temporarily replace her. So, when does the clock -- when does someone pick up the phone and say Senator sorry.",

His position on entitlements, which he hasn't really clarified since taking the votes referenced in the ad back when he was in Congress.All that being said, you know, the larger sort of political context is that, yes, you have a lot of sort of donors and supporters around DeSantis, who has started to get heartburn about him not rebutting Trump's attacks to this point. And, you know, I think Governor DeSantis himself wants to seem above the fray and focused on his work in the Florida. Legislature and the fact that he hasn't declared his campaign yet.
