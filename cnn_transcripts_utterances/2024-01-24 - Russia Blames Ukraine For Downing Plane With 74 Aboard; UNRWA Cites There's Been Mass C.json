But who was onboard and what caused the crash are in dispute. We will have the very latest. Then in Gaza, the U.N.'s Relief Agency says a U.N. shelter was struck by tank fire, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens of others. I'll speak to the director of that agency for the very latest. Plus, a resounding victory for Donald Trump in New Hampshire with the next primary only weeks away. The question is, can they get Haley stay in the race? But first tonight, Russian officials are accusing Ukraine of shooting down a military plane in Russia's Belgorod region, that's near the Ukrainian border. The region's governor says all 74 people on board were killed. Most of the details are in dispute at this hour. Russia says the plane was carrying Ukrainian prisoners bound for a prisoner swap. Ukraine says it doesn't yet know who was on the plane, and Kyiv has yet to comment on Russia's claims that it shot the plane down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called it, quote, \"a terrorist attack\", speaking at the U.N. a short time ago. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEY LAVROV, FOREIGN MINISTER, RUSSIA (through translator): The Ukrainian prisoners of war were transported to the Belgorod region in order to conduct yet another swap, which was agreed between Moscow and Kyiv. Instead of this, the Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv region. It targeted the aeroplane and was a fatal strike. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of the things that we have heard from the Russians is they say that all this happened around 11:15 a.m. local time when this plane was apparently coming in to land, the Russian say in a flight from a military airport in the Moscow region to Belgorod. The Russians say that the Ukrainians fired a surface-to-air missile from near the border with Russia. But on the Ukrainian side, that they hit this plane, but the plane then went down northeast of Belgorod where of course, it was supposed to land the Russians as you noted, saying that no one on board survived. Now, the Russians are saying that there were 65 POWs onboard that plane, Ukrainian POWs meant for a prisoner swap. The Ukrainians so far have not acknowledged that they shot the plane down. However, they have acknowledged that there was a prisoner swap that was supposed to take place  today, and that, that prisoner swap has been canceled. Now, the Ukrainians are also saying that if this plane indeed was carrying prisoners meant for a prisoner swap, the Russians would have had to inform the Ukrainians that they were going to fly a plane with these prisoners to the Belgorod airport to ensure that the transport -- that the transfer of these prisoners occurs in a safe way. They say the Russians did not do that, and they also say that, of course, a cargo plane coming in to land in Belgorod would be considered a target by the Ukrainians, because cargo planes like the one in question often carry missiles at the Russian's venues to shell Ukrainian towns on the other side of the border. So the Ukrainians not acknowledging they were behind hitting this plane, not acknowledging that there were POWs on this plane --",

It appears as though, before it hits the ground, that it might be losing parts of the plane, something might be falling off, and then obviously hits the ground very hard and then explodes in a ball of fire. The Russians are saying that it was a defense missile The Russians are also saying -- and this again, we haven't seen any evidence of it, but they say that they did track the launch of a surface-to-air missile in an area nearby the border on the Ukrainian side.

As Fredsaid, the IL-76, I've flown on one too, it's a little bit smaller than the USC-17, but it is a transport plane. And as Fred said, it's a workhorse. They use it for transporting soldiers at times and also for weaponry. But the thing is, they -- I don't think they have -- the Russians have used this for transporting prisoners of war in the past. They usually like to make the last trip back to Ukraine for the Ukrainian prisoners be the most uncomfortable ones you can think up. And I don't think they would be using this kind of piece of equipment for a 65-man prisoner swap. It just doesn't make sense. There's some other open- source resources that are claiming the tracking of this aircraft over the last several days have gone to both -- has gone to both Iran flown over Egypt through Syria into this airport. And in fact, this airplane open-source now, this is not confirmed, and there will be part of the investigation. We're claiming the plane was taking off as opposed to landing. What you see in the film that you showed a minute ago is not only the crash of the aircraft, but is the camera pans to the left.

So they have found what they call a cheese-board effect from Russia's air defense, that they are not covering their borders very well because they have pushed most of their air defense pieces to the frontlines. If they -- if Russia has open areas where Ukrainian air defense can come in, something like this, they would hope might cause the Ukrainians to take pause in shooting down other Russian airplanes.

The challenger Nikki Haley is vowing to stay in the race. Trump won the state by double digits, getting almost 55 percent of the vote, 43 percent voted for Haley. The former president called on Haley to drop out, and sources tell CNN, he was seething that she plans to stay in the race. Haley remained defiant after the loss, optimistic about the next Republican contest in her home state of South Carolina one month from today. That's a long time. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now from Nashua in New Hampshire. And Kristen, it is a significant win here for Trump. But Haley says this is not over. She is refusing to back down. So what kind of path are we looking at here, that for her to get to this point, what are you hearing from her campaign? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, that's the big question is what is the path if you ask the Republican National chairwoman, there is no path and everyone should unite behind Donald Trump. And that's what you're hearing from a lot of Republicans as well as a lot of Trump supporters. You're seeing so many Republicans fall in line, unite behind Donald Trump, because they continue to say that there's no path for Nikki Haley. Now for Haley, it would be critical for her to do well in her home state of South Carolina. However, even though she expressed confidence, Trump's team is also very optimistic about South Carolina. They believe that, yes, it's her home state. Yes, she was governor there, but that was a long time ago. And that the electorate has changed to a more pro-Trump electorate. And if you look at CNN's polling, it really reflects that. We have a ref poll that shows him up about 30 points in South Carolina. Now, Haley is working it, she is putting out ads already, she's already at a campaign event in South Carolina. We have asked Donald Trump's team what they're going to do. Do they have ads lined up? Are they going to go out and campaign? We have no answer yet? I'm sure he'll have a rally on the ground, but no real strategy except for the fact that we have seen him and his campaign tried to embarrass Haley in her home state. And they did that even here in New Hampshire. They brought out the Governor Henry McMaster, who worked closely with Haley to campaign with Donald Trump say -- excuse me, Senator Tim Scott, also from South Carolina, brought him out to campaign with Donald Trump as well as some congressmen from South Carolina who had endorsed Trump. They are clearly trying to send a message that Trump is more popular in South Carolina than Nikki Haley. The big question is, can she close that 30-point gap, and right now, we just don't know.",
