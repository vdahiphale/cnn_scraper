He's nothing like the portrait he shows to the world, at least to those people who were inclined to believe the myths he tells about himself, right.So I think what keeps him up at night, other than a lot of diet coke would be this concern. One, that he doesn't actually have the money, which is a distinct possibility. You know, we could say that this offer to come up with only $100 million was a ploy to buy more time or to see if it would work, but he may not indeed have that much cash, would reveal not just to the world, but to himself, that he is not as rich as he claims to be.

I think deep down, Donald has always been a terrified little boy. But the truth is, he has much, much more to be terrified about now. His entire future hinges on his ability to get back into the White House. And despite the fact that there are plenty of people helping them out, including it would appear some members of the Supreme Court that is not something that he can totally count on. So he's going -- it's going to impact his ability to think straight, to express himself. Weve seen in the last decade or so, the difference in how he performs during depositions, for example, he appears to have much less impulse control and he appears to have a much lessen ability to be coherent for any length of time.

And we should be doing our public service role that it's not so much about chasing the latest clicks and the latest horse race coverage, but rather to make sure that we're getting the stakes of the race across to people.

In pairs, they make the final dash, but it's not just the Serbs they face. It's the U.N. soldiers who control the airport. Caught in the search lights, they dive for cover. The U.N. is under orders to prevent this traffic. Undaunted, the civilian stay hidden for a few seconds before getting up and running off again. But by this time, the U.N. search light have attracted the snipers. Two people have been killed in the past two weeks. Those who do make it past the Serbs meet the French at the airport perimeter. Their armored vehicles are on patrol all night and the soldiers are told to catch the Sarajevans and turn them back. \"Send everyone back behind the fence,\" says this radio message from the spotters on the control tower. It's a cruel fate for people who have risked so much. A woman stands in the freezing, driving snow and pleads to be let through. Three people accord. They're taken to the armored vehicle and searched. All they want is to go across to free territory and buy food for their families. It's not easy for the soldiers either. It's our most difficult missions says this commander. It's hard to turn back women, men, and children who are cold and hungry. The airport is officially off-limits to all the Bosnians who come to this darkened sign out room desperate to get out. It's been that way ever since the Serbs handed back control of the airstrip to the U.N. in July. And the people who come here resent the U.N.'s control. But the U.N. says it has to stop Bosnians bringing weapons across the airport. They say several hundred civilians manage to make it past them every night. \"It's the first time and the last time I do it,\" says Eva. \"It's just too frightening.\" She and her friends have come back from the other side. They weren't trying to escape. They were just trying to buy some food. Food they can't get in Sarajevo. A young mother brought back some bananas and some butter. These luxuries will provide a month of happiness for her and her two young children. A father holds a half-rotten apple. For this, he has risked his life. \"My daughter hasn't seen apples since the beginning of the war,\" he says. I was forced to do it.
