      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, live from Israel, President Biden now on his way here, stepping into a tinderbox growing more volatile by the hour. Hundreds feared dead after an explosion at a hospital in Gaza and protests already immediately overnight here tonight spilling out into the street across the region.Plus, dispatches from Gaza. The brave CNN journalist sending his daily updates to us. Well, he and his family have fled northern Gaza and are now desperate for clean water. You'll see that. And Hamas' arsenal. I'm going to show you firsthand the massive amounts of weapons that Hamas used to pull off the deadly attack in Israel. You'll see for yourself. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett live from Tel Aviv tonight. And we begin with the breaking news. President Biden right now is in the air on his way to Israel and his entire trip is now in flux. A high-stakes crucial meeting with Arab leaders canceled. The reason is this horrific scene, the situation here in the Middle East at a possible dangerous tipping point after hundreds of people were killed in a strike at a hospital in Gaza. Now, those numbers are according to the Palestinian heath ministry. And no matter what the true toll is, this is a horrific loss of human life. The hospital was being used to shelter thousands of families who had been fleeing from the north to the south of Gaza. And already 11:00, 12:00 p.m. -- a.m., 1:00 a.m. 2:00 a.m. now, protests across the region, this was the scene in the West Bank where police were forced to use tear gas to break up the crowds. And our Ben Wedeman reporting just now that hundreds of protesters are in Beirut. This is at 1:30 a.m. they hear about this happening an hour or two before and gather in the streets there in a square that leads towards the U.S. embassy. Ben reports that they've been trying to break through security gates. A canceled summit, protests, blame being cast no matter what the facts turn out to be. And at this hour, it is still unclear who is responsible for that explosion at the hospital. The Palestinian foreign ministry points the finger at Israel, calling it a, quote, cold-blooded massacre. But Israel categorically denies it's responsible, tonight putting out a video they say shows it was a failed rocket launch by another terror group, not Hamas, one called the group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. IDF, in fact, says 450 rockets by this particular group at Israel have actually landed within the Gaza Strip since this war began ten days ago. What we do know is that hundreds of innocent lives were lost, and we have new images coming in right now from that strike's aftermath. These are graphic, they are horrible. It's a disgusting loss of human life, bloodied bodies, people who were seeking refuge. Some who appear to be children. It would make sense. This was a place families sought refuge as they were moving to the south of Gaza. This attack adding to the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the Gaza Strip. Food, fuel, water dwindling fast. You'll hear from our producer Ibrahim in just a moment about that. Doctors inside the 25- mile-long strip tell CNN that they're having now, do operations without painkillers because they simply do not have them. Now, remember, this latest violence comes after Hamas fighters stormed Israel's border two Saturdays ago, two Saturdays ago already since this all began, slaughtering 1,400 people and taking 200 people hostage. I went to an Israeli base to see what they found, what Hamas weapons soldiers found from that attack. And it was antitank mines, grenades, shoulder-fired rockets and so much more.

And if it is an accident, it is the worst tragedy that we have seen so far in Gaza of all the things that have happened of the hundreds of people that have already been killed.A hospital is to all people everywhere, a sacred place, a place where you're supposed to be healed and to be in that hospital and end up losing your life because of a strike is something that is, for most people, unfathomable, although we see it in war all the time, unfortunately. There is something people refer to as the fog of war. Immediately, the response from Hamas who is governing Gaza blamed Israeli airstrikes, and almost immediately after that, Israel said, look, this is not us, this was actually not the Hamas fighters, the Al Aqsa brigade, but indeed the Islamic Jihad fighters who are linked and backed by Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, generally speaking, and some folks in Syria have backed Islamic Jihad. I spent in time with them years ago, and they feel the same way as Hamas. They do not think that Israel should exist. They think that this should be an Islamic state. They do not follow the Oslo Peace Accord and don't want to see them come to fruition. So, at this point in time, they are being blamed by Israel. Israel says, look, we have video proof. At one point, they tweeted out the video, but then the IDF took it down. An ambassador tweeted the video and then they took it down. But Israel, we're hearing from now, the IDF saying we have proof, you'll have that in your inbox very shortly, we will wait for that. But in the meantime, it doesn't matter right now to the families who did this, it matters that their loved ones had been killed at a hospital, which, by the way, the Palestinians are saying was also being used as a center for evacuees because it's in Gaza where people were trying to get to safety so they went to the hospital to find safety, and here this horrible thing happened.

There were two impacts further away, and then that impact that was very, very loud, and we realize that it was quite close to our location.Now, we went to see the house, the destruction you can see that the rocket had punched all the way through one wall, out through another wall, the tailfin of the rocket was sort of lying outside in a hallway. You could see the windows, the doors were blown open. Huge destruction inside of this house. Fortunately, no one in the house at that time, you just heard that explosion there, that was an airstrike, I think. In Gaza I hear the fighter jet flying away. We've been hearing those in the last couple of minutes. What we're beginning to see is that the rockets sort of coming from Gaza are able to land here in Sderot. Most of the civilian population has left. There's about only about 4,000 people left here out of an original 40,000. So, a lot of people have gone. But there were still people here in danger, and those rockets are really a reminder for them that they are effectively almost on the front line of this war.",

It's not something that we cannot rely on or assist them that we need to guess. It's a clear one that we didn't shot the target. So we know that.

There will be these kinds of civilian casualties. All one has to do is look at the operations in Mosul in Iraq or Fallujah or Grozny or even recently in some of the Ukrainian villages, where we've seen it. So, there's likely to be this. But, second, overseeing all of that, we have significant tension between -- among a range of Arab populations as well. So we've got the prospects of potential spillover in Lebanon and Syria. We've seen demonstrations in Iraq. So, this is more than just an urban combat operation in Gaza. There's a lot of animosity that we're seeing.

What we don't know right now is whether the Israelis are going to focus mostly on special operations types forces, how long are they going to focus mostly on northern parts of Gaza.

Hamas, of course, claims Israel. So, I know that you've said you shared information about the blast with the United States.

JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Yes, good evening, or good night, Erin. Because of the magnitude and the sensitivity, and because what we see that our enemies are trying to do with this fake event, we did a thorough investigation, and it was the information was approved, was seen and personally approved by the highest levels of command in the IDF. Now, what we have and what we are going to share, and this will happen momentarily, I suppose, in a few but within the hour, I hope, information will be out which shows two things. Both footage of the event from an Israeli UAV, and, very tellingly, a conversation between Hamas terrorists which was intercepted by us where they discussed the fact that, oh, there appears to have been a malfunction or an explosion by a rocket, which landed short inside the Gaza Strip. And that is, of course, very authentic and very telling of exactly what happened. We also, to be on the safe side, cross-checked all our systems, first and foremost, to make sure that we did not fire in the area. And then we looked at the radar which tracks enemy incoming fire. And we saw that there was a barrage of rockets that was fired from mid- or northern Gaza Strip towards Israel, exactly at the time or a little bit before the explosion reportedly happened, which was caught in our systems, and perfectly corresponds with the information that we have.",

We have made it very clear that this wasn't a war that we wanted, but it is a war that we intend to finish with the complete dismantling of Hamas as a military entity. And we have also said to Hezbollah and anybody else that we strongly encourage them not to attack.
