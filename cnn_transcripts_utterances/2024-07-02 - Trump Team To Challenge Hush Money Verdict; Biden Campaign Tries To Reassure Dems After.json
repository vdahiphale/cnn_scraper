      "sentences": "All right, just after 5The Supreme Court's landmark decision on presidential immunity is sending shockwaves through the country and potentially upending Trump's guilty verdicts in the New York hush money trial just days before he is set to be sentenced. The high court ruling that a president's official acts cannot be used as evidence in a trial. Trump's lawyers say that this means his New York conviction should be dismissed. Trump echoing that argument with this post. \"Today's historic decision by the Supreme Court should end all of Crooked Joe Biden's witch hunts against me, including the New York hoaxes.\" In their dissents, the liberal justices warned the ruling has implications far beyond Trump's ongoing trials. Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing about future president, \"When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy's Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\" Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson to help us understand this decision. Joey, good morning to you. Wonderful to see you as always. I actually want to start in New York because this sentencing is set for July 11. They have asked that to be moved. How much -- I mean, how much do you think that this immunity ruling really affects the nitty gritty facts, details, et cetera of the New York trial? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie, good morning to you. So there's various schools of thought, right? The one school is that certainly this was private conduct as it relates to his conduct with a porn star. No official act to be seen there. And as a result, what are we doing? Keep moving forward. The other school of thought though is if there's any official act, such as the introduction of his Twitter account -- he was president -- he tweeted. Should that have been introduced into evidence? Should an ethics form that was signed off in 2018 while he was president be admitted into evidence? Should any other acts that he engaged in as a) including Hope Hicks' conversations be admitted into evidence? So the critical question will be what, if any, influence they had on the jury. There's a doctrine of law case here. It's called harmless error. And what that means is that if there's other evidence that's so overwhelming, even if there was the introduction of evidence to a trial that shouldn't have been there, the conviction would still stand. What we might see, at a minimum, is a delay in the sentence for the judge to ferret out these legal issues before the sentencing. And so, a delay in that is certainly possible.",

      "sentences": "I think you should. I think a delay would be appropriate. I mean, judges, Kasie, do what they do, but I think a delay to determine whether you got it right -- remember, what Judge Merchan did though -- he said that the presidential immunity arguments were rejected as untimely, meaning he gave the lawyers a time in which to move forward with all of their motions and all of their issues. They did not do it by that timeframe.However, since the Supreme Court has made a pronouncement here, it might be appropriate just to examine it and look at the motion of the attorneys, answer it. Have a hearing if necessary. Delay the sentencing. Consider it. Issue a written decision and then move forward. That, of course, will be litigated no matter what Judge Merchan does. We have, of course, a vibrant court system -- a Court of Appeals that could certainly look at this issue. But I think it leads to a delay at a very minimum with respect to the finality of the New York case.",

We could see some of this additional evidence come to light if the judge in the case, Tanya Chutkan, moves ahead with an evidentiary hearing.How quickly do you think something like that might be able to happen?",

And even if it does, remember what happens because now she has to ferret out on remand all these questions as an official act. Is it not his conversations with the vice president, excluding the Department of Justice conversations, looking at tweets and other things.And so, I think it's a process, at least, that's entitled to a hearing. Lawyers need time to prepare for the hearing and to convene in the court. To submit documents and motions after the hearing to buttress their arguments. And then, of course, that's subject to appeal as well. And so it goes through another set of -- you go from the district court -- that's Judge Chutkan's court -- to the circuit court -- that's the appellate court -- and maybe back to the Supreme Court. So I think it leads to inordinate delay no matter what happens in terms of whether the case gets to move forward in a modified or gutted way or not. We're not going to see it happen anytime soon.",

The Biden campaign doing everything they can to try to calm the nerves of fellow Democrats after last week's dismal debate performance.Within the last hour, the campaign putting out new fundraising totals for the month of June. They say that they raised $127 million. A quarter of that, they claim, was raised since Thursday. The campaign co-chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, held multiple calls yesterday trying to reassure party leaders and staff. The campaign did ruffle some feathers, however, labeling those suggesting that the president bow out as the \"bedwetting brigade\" in an email blast. A senior Democratic official tells CNN that was \"disrespectful.\" Another called it disgusting. Even as some Democrats begin to consider who else could top the ticket, others, of course, publicly voicing their support. Here was Kennedy's -- excuse me, Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDY BESHEAR, (D) KENTUCKY:  Only the president can determine his future as a candidate. He is the candidate and as long as he is, I'm supporting him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, he gave credence to that idea in that quote that we did here from him. He is, of course, one of the people that is named as a possible person who might top the ticket instead. However, we mostly have seen -- I mean, Gretchen Whitmer has been very aggressive in trying to tamp down, at least publicly, talk about her being that person. How would you characterize -- I know you kind of talk to sources all the time and this is one of those things that has an ebb and a flow. The panic was very high right after Biden took the stage.

I think that the truth of the matter is if Democrats thought they had a consensus right now for a path forward they would take it. But there isn't that consensus because there's so much division on whether to let Biden make the decision a), and then there's not consensus on how to move forward even if Biden were to decide he was ready to step aside. And with all these factors and unknowns they're safer -- a lot of Democrats think the status quo is safer even as kind of the Biden team hasn't done a whole lot, really, to convince people that there -- that he's going to be able to address the concerns that were raised in the debate. That, again, there's just -- there's so much unknown. The only thing that Democrats are unified is that they don't want Trump to be elected in November, but they're not unified on how to get there.",

What about that person? There is a reality that there is a sitting vice president who -- should the president step aside for some reason, would be in a very strong position. You know, obviously, she is on the ticket. She has support from key Democrats. She would likely take over any fundraising.

There really hasn't been energy around a true Trump-Harris matchup.But again, there still is risk there, too, because there are some Democrats that would get behind her. But now, especially after all the primaries, there is risk about disenfranchising voters even if Harris is the candidate. There is risk that racism, sexism, xenophobia -- anything you could think about could be used against her or could be a detriment to her candidacy because she is a woman of color. So again, there are all these unknown factors that, really, Democrats won't know unless they really move forward and test her in a real way.",

Didn't really see what he allegedly did as a major threat to the country. They were thinking far ahead into the future to some sort of hypothetical future president who was bedeviled by potential bad-faith prosecutions going forward. They saw a kind of structural threat to the country that was totally unrelated to the particular allegations against Donald Trump. And they also made a point of the fact that no president has been prosecuted before after leaving office. That was, for them, the important point. So this prosecution was anomalous and dangerous, and a threat. For the dissenters, what they said was no president has been prosecuted before because no president allegedly did these things before. They are so outside the norm of the peaceful transfer of power that it's never occurred to anyone to prosecute a former president. And so, they really saw what the threat to democracy in this case as a total mirror image. Jack Smith was the threat, according to the majority, not Donald Trump.",

But in some cases, they were pretty explicit about what does fall into the category of official acts.For example, the conversations that Donald Trump had with his then- vice president Mike Pence, who he was basically urging to not certify the election. That seems like a tricky spot to me because yes, he's president, but on the other hand, he's been told he has lost the election and needs to leave, and he's trying to screw around with the system that is written to protect the peaceful transfer of power.

But he's also in the Congress because he's president of the United States Senate.So the role of the vice president is somewhat unclear, and because Congress has assigned the vice president the job of overseeing the counting of electoral votes, he's not fully functioning as an Executive Branch member. So this very opaque, sort of confusing structure is what the Supreme Court said the lower court has to resolve. And they say Trump would be presumptively immune, but the government can overcome it if they can make certain showings -- evidentiary showings.
