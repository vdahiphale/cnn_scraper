And we're expecting the architect of Trump's mass deportation policy, Stephen Miller, to make a major White House comeback.Also tonight, how women will figure into the second Trump administration as Representative Elise Stefanik is tapped to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and as the Trump record and treatment of women remains deeply divisive for his opponent. Plus, where the fight for control of the House of Representatives stands right now. After the Democrats loss of the White House and the Senate, House progressives are taking stock and taking aim at their party's message. We'll talk to a member of the progressive caucus this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with the new additions to the second Trump administration, the president-elect hiring more of his most fervent and loyal allies for key positions with fresh announcements possible at any time. CNN Anchor Kaitlan Collins is in West Palm Beach, Florida, covering the Trump transition for all of us. Kaitlan, what are you learning, first of all, about Trump's latest picks?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it's been a very busy 72 hours or so here in Palm Beach. I expect that we could get more announcements potentially as soon as tonight or tomorrow as Donald Trump is making these choices, ones that, to him, he's been thinking about for some time. Certainly, Elise Stefanik as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for example, is one of those that he confirmed today and that she accepted that position.But other steps that he's taking here, Wolf, just fill out what we know once his administration to start working on, on day one, once he takes that oath of office, and, obviously, immigration has been a big part of that. And that is why it's no surprise that you're seeing Stephen Miller and Tom Homan return to the West Wing in two very significant roles for everyone who's watching to see what that immigration agenda is going to look like. Obviously, Stephen Miller is someone who is a policy adviser to Donald Trump in his first term, often was doing a lot of the speech writing for him in his first term in office. He's been with him essentially ever since then, a loud voice on Fox News arguing for his strict immigration policies and also, Wolf, I should note, was part of drafting that Muslim country majority ban that was enacted in the early days of the first Trump term and also the family separation policy, something that Stephen Miller continued to argue he believed would have worked if it had stayed in place. Obviously, Trump rescinded it after there was major backlash to it. And then Tom Homan is the other one who is notable as well. He was Trump's acting ICE director before. And now he's coming in in this czar-like role as it was described to me last night when he was on the verge of being offered this position where he is going to really be helping streamline and head up these policies. And that is something that Trump wants to start working on day one when he's in office. And then, Wolf, the other thing that Trump has been very focused on, maybe more than anything else besides immigration is the EPA and environmental regulations and what that's going to look like. And he did announce today that he has selected Lee Zeldin, a former New York congressman who ran for governor there unsuccessfully in 2022 to lead the EPA. Obviously, Wolf, if you want to know what Trump is going to do with the EPA, he's been promising to drill, baby, drill, has been what he has said repeatedly. He has been targeting very specific regulations, wants to reverse some of them on day one, actually already has those drafted and ready to go when he does get into office. And now Lee Zeldin is going to be the former congressman who helps him enact that if he is confirmed as the head of the EPA, Wolf.",

I think she's going to do that.In terms of the other individuals, the American people voted for the former president, president-elect, based on a couple of different things, the economy and immigration in particular. And I know there's some concern on the left about some of the immigration stances of some of these individuals, but this is in part, if you look at the data, what at least a sizable percent of the country actually expects.

You know, you have to imagine that the administration and the EPA is going to do everything they can to get as much of that money obligated, out the door, committed to local projects, and committed to doing the work it's supposed to do before the Trump team takes over, as they've stated, that rolling back some of these things is, you know, the top of their priority.So, yes, of course, I think it is personally hard but this is also the way democracy works and administrations turn over.

I don't think they want family separation, which we saw in 2017. 2018 was one of the least popular things that the Trump administration did. It generated you know, massive outrage across the country. It will also have enormous economic impact both in terms of what it would cost logistically to execute something like this and the impact that it would have on the economy, low wage workers. It's like you think food prices are high now, wait until -- are we deporting every person who works in -- you know, who works in the fields across the country?

Trump and you care for the working class. And how about this one? I feel that you both are outsiders compared to the rest of D.C. and less establishment. And then there was this one.

For more on that, let's bring back CNN's Kaitlan Collins.She's joining us from West Palm Beach down in Florida. Kaitlan, tell us what you're learning. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah. Wolf, we've just learned that Donald Trump has selected his first of many national security roles to fill, something that will be obviously a closely watched portfolio of his second term. He has now selected Florida Republican Mike Waltz as his national security advisor. He's the first Green Beret to actually ever serve in Congress and now he will be serving right in the West Wing with Donald Trump, obviously, navigating some very difficult geopolitical conflicts the war in Ukraine that has been going on that Donald Trump has pledged to solve in one day. Obviously, big questions about what that's actually going to look like once he takes the oath, the war in Gaza that's been underway. All of these issues that the Biden White House is dealing with right now is soon going to be something that the Trump White House is inheriting, these global crisis that they are facing. Of course, they are expected to handle them in very different ways and so people will be watching this space very closely. I should note, Congressman Waltz was seen down here in Palm Beach just a few days ago. He's been seen at the Mar-a-Lago club once or twice. He is someone who was rumored to be in some -- in the running for some kind of national security job, Wolf, whether that was national security advisor or defense secretary was one that was also floated to us in recent days. And so, he's also been someone that you've seen and that people will be familiar with from television he has been an ardent defender of Donald Trump's over the last several months often out there defending him after the incident with the Trump campaign that happened at Arlington National Cemetery when they got blowback for -- for filming campaign material there. Mike Waltz was out defending him on television. So, of course, that is someone that Trump something that Trump is always looking for in this portfolio. But, Wolf, one thing to keep in mind as we are announcing all of these new staff picks that Donald Trump is announcing seemingly by the hour here in Palm Beach is that all of these have been informed by what happened in his first term in office. Office he has tried to learn from that and said staffing was one of his biggest mistakes. So all of that is a factor in every single person whose name you're seeing be announced, including Mike Waltz -- Wolf.",
