Justin Smith, Emmitt Martin, III, Desmond Mills, Jr., Demetrius Haley, and Tadarrius Bean -- all five, now ex-cops charged today with killing Tyre Nichols who died three days after a traffic stop and violent arrest on the seventh of this month, all five facing identical counts -- official oppression, failure to perform a duty imposed by law, unauthorized exercise of official power, aggravated kidnapping while possessing a weapon, aggravated kidnapping causing bodily injury, aggravated assault and second-degree murder. Today in addition to the charges, we learn more about what kind of officers they were along with some details from the timeline of Tyre Nichols' deadly encounter with them, which Tennessee's top State law enforcement official says are appalling to him. Sadly, there will be more tomorrow when video describe in excruciating terms by those who have seen it is made public. CNN's Sara Sidner is in Memphis tonight with all the latest on all of that, but also a closer look at who Tyre Nichols was and the life he lived. Sara, first, you know what's the reaction in the city now that charges have been filed against the officers.",

They aren't people who would overreact to something. Now, they have seen the video, and that has been their response to it.And so I'm sure that tomorrow when we finally do get a chance to look at the video. And I must say, when you look at the video, and I've done a hundreds of these things in terms of use of force, when you have multiple officers, you have to take the time and try to isolate each officer individually and see what they are doing. When you look at the bail that is set, two are set higher than the others. I don't know if that really has any meaning, but it could very well be that two of the individuals were more active in this than the others. So, we have to really look at this probably over and over again before you get a real feel for it.

I have no reason to believe that that will be the case here, but it is always helpful to have another option to move against a particular offender.

There is usually one primary actor, one or two, and there are some who participate, you know, partially and then others who stand back and watch.Here, you have everybody charged the same way. It suggests that they are all engaged in some very violent behavior.

Now, obviously, depending upon where each officer was positioned, based upon the level of threat, if any, that they felt, the conduct that they engaged in, or the lack thereof, they will justify with their defenses, but the fact that all of them were charged with the same thing means to me that upon examination of that videotape, authorities felt that each of them was culpable, responsible, and accountable for what we're going to see, learn, and hear when we see that videotape upon release.",

As a young adult, he spent a few years in Brazil, where local prosecutors now want him to return to face charges related to a stolen checkbook in 2008. Santos has denied any wrongdoing.

It's a fairly standard strategy. Don't forget, we defense attorneys do not need to prove innocence. We need to prove reasonable doubt. And the way we do that is showing whatever we can that the investigation was flawed, searches were inappropriate, gloves weren't worn, or booties weren't worn or tire tracks weren't maintained. All of this is to tell this jury that they rushed to judgment that day, thought of nobody else but Murdaugh, and that they were sloppy because sloppiness lack of evidence or conflict in evidence is what leads to reasonable doubt.

O'MARA: Well, I think even though a motive is never, you don't see that in a statute as far as a burden of proof, every juror on that panel, and most of us are watching it, want to hear about the motive. So, it's just that common sense thing. You don't have to prove motive, but you have to give this jury a reason why Murdaugh did what he did, why he would slaughter two family members. And even though it's not a proof requirement, they have to come up with something compelling. And all they really have is this, you know, this shell game taken away from my view now my family has been slaughtered.
