The Special Counsel found that President Biden willfully retain and disclose classified materials after leaving office but said a willful intent couldn't be proven. The documents were found in his garage officers and basement den of his Wilmington Delaware home. President Biden blamed his staff for putting him there but took responsibility for not paying attention to what they were doing. The part of the report that really seemed to hit a nerve with him was the Special Counsel basically saying Joe Biden is an elderly man with memory issues who would be difficult to prosecute. The President appeared visibly annoyed by that telling reporters quote, I know what the hell I'm doing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case. That was their decision to make. That's a counsels decision to make. That's his job. And they decided not to move forward. For any extraneous commentary they don't know what they're talking about. It has no place in this report.

The challenge for Trump is that the one-quarter to one-third, maybe 40 percent in the in the most favorable state that is voting for Haley is expressing enormous discontent with him. I mean, you know, we've seen in the AP vote cast exit poll, something like three-quarters of Haley voters in New Hampshire and two-thirds in Iowa saying they would not vote for Trump in the general election, similar results in the exit polls that CNN is part of not all of those people in the end would vote for Joe Biden. But there is clearly a slice of the Republican Party that is deeply concerned about Trump. And this kind of takes us back to our very first point. It's hard to imagine by November, there's going to be a majority of Americans who affirmatively say, yeah, I want four more years with Joe Biden, given the concerns about his age and his record, but that doesn't mean there is not a winning plurality or majority that says, I do not want four more years of Donald Trump.",

But all signs do point to a win for Trump. And this court could decide fairly quickly. In fact, case in point back in 2000, the Supreme Court decided Bush v Gore, were they halted the recount in Florida, essentially handing that win to George W. Bush.

I believe there are 11 other states right now with pending litigation. It leaves it open for those states as well to say Trump will not appear on the ballot.

I think the answer is probably not. The D.C. circuit wrote a per curiam opinion, meaning they all joined, no dissents, no concurrences, 57 pages.

Bush. That was a 5- 4 decision. It made it look like there were only five votes in America that really mattered when it came to the presidential election. And that caused a crisis of legitimacy for the court. They don't want to go back there. They know about the optics and how that can harm the respect for the institution. And let's remember, the Supreme Court only exists because we respect what they do. They don't have an army to send in. They write something and we adhere to it. Thats how it works. So I think that's part of why we will not see them take up this allegation that Trump has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. They don't want to get involved in each of these cases.",

There were reports of violence and multiple terror attacks in a numberof provinces across southwestern Pakistan. Polling stations and security personnel were targeted. Several people were killed and dozens injured. The threats of terrorism was the reason authorities gave for shutting down Internet and mobile services across the country that had several parties crying foul. Pakistan's human rights commission and Amnesty International criticized the decision as a quote, \"blunt attack\" on rights to freedom of expression. It's been a tumultuous two years for Pakistan since the ousting of former prime minister Imran Khan, who as the country's most popular politician, remains behind bars, disqualified from running. In the past few weeks, he's been convicted in three cases and handed lengthy sentences, which his supporters believe is part of a state crackdown on Khan and his party. Many analysts believe Khan's predecessor Nawaz Sharif will be elected prime minister. This would be a historic fourth term for Sharif, who's never completed a full term. His most recent stint in 2017 saw him fall out with the all-powerful military accused of corruption, disqualified from holding office, and forced into exile. Sharif is seen as a pragmatist and a businessman, and he will need to apply this with Pakistan going through the worst economic crisis in recent history. Inflation soared to a record high of nearly 40 percent. Well, Sharif wants to strengthen relations with the U.S. and China. He's even made overtures to mending bridges with arch rival India. And while there's anger over Khan, disillusionment in the political system and the overarching power of the military, there is a sense of exhaustion and resignation among the population that wants stability restored. However, critics say these elections are one of the least credible in Pakistan's 76-year history and that will undermine any political or economic stability required to govern this nuclear arms nation of 240 million people.

And that pushed this new record over. I'd just spent an age of broken record-breaking one is set, another one goes on and that is both on land and sea. As we look at the sea surface temperatures, that's the most alarming when you consider that heat out at sea is the engine of hurricanes. We also got word that the El Nino that is present and at a super strength in the Pacific could be switching over to a La Nina pattern within the next six months or so, which sets up the recipe for stronger hurricanes, especially in Atlantic and Gulf Coast areas there as well. And just to add another sort of punctuation to a day of climate news, a new study looked at the ice sheets in Antarctica through history and found that at the end of the last ice age, about 8,000 years ago, when the planet wobbled in a way that warmed up the planet, a massive amount of South Pole ice disappeared over a relatively short period of time. An amount of ice taller than the Empire State Building disappeared in about two centuries. That seems like a long time, but in our human scales that is just terrifying when it comes to coastal cities around the world that could barely deal with six inches, a foot, you know, half a meter of sea level rise would be major upheaval around the world.
