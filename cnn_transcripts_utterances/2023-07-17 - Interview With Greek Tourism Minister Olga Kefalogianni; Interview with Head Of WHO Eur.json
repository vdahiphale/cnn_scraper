Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper talks to Michel Martin about unexpected fame, and his new TV show,\"Extraordinary Birder.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, heat and fire. Greeks are facing life-threatening elements this week, as temperatures soar with no relief in sight. A summer camp evacuated children near a wildfire today. And take a look at this dramatic video of horses being rushed to safety as the blaze near Athens started to burn their stables. This after Acropolis was temporarily shut Friday to protect tourist from sweltering heat. And this isn't only happening in Greece, across the Northern Hemisphere, China recorded its hottest temperature ever, 52.5 degrees Celsius. That is a whopping 126 degrees Fahrenheit. And good timing too, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry is in Beijing for talks. It is one of the hottest summers ever recorded in the Chinese capital. Here in the United States, a heat dome is scorching much of the country. And smoke from the Canadian wildfires is spreading over the northeast. As the director general of the World Health Organization says, the climate crisis is not a warning, it is happening. Olga Kefalogianni is Greece's tourism minister, and she is the one making tough calls on how to protect tourists, and keeping them visiting her country. And Francesco Racioppi is the head of the WHO's European Center for Environmental and Health Work. They both joined me earlier to discuss how they're adapting to the heat. Olga, let's start with you and what we're seeing take place now in Greece. The Acropolis was close for a few hours on Friday to protect tourists there. We know that there were some tourists that were taken to the hospital because of heat related issues, and some first responders there were on site that hand out thousands of water bottles. Give us the current picture of what's happening in the country right now related to heat specifically.",

So, this, you can see the ripple effects of concerns for people in your country when you see these record numbers, and I know that you, for the first time, have designated, your government has, a climate envoy for these particular issues.

So, of course, there are concerns, and I guess the climate crisis is an issue that is a horizontal policy that all ministries should follow. This is why we need to have a special envoy in order to be able to sometimes control and sometimes make the necessary suggestions to all the ministries for the policies that each one of us has to incorporate in our own strategies. So, it's important to have it as a horizontal policy. As ministry of tourism, of course, as you said before, it's not just a direct effect that tourism has to the GDP, but it's also the indirect effect that it has. So, overall, it's more than 20 percent of Greece's GDP. So, we definitely have to make sure that we have a model of tourism that is sustainable in the future, and that we do the necessary adaptations and adopted the necessary policies in order for the tourism offering to be always attractive.

This does not, of course, mean that we don't have a special concern about our beaches and about coastal area, you know that Greece has one of the biggest coastlines in the world, and this is the overall strategy that I was mentioning before, which is a priority for our prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, both in terms of sustainability and also, in terms of protection of our cultural sites. So, we have a special committee in the ministry of culture which is concerned about the effect of the climate crisis on our cultural heritage, on our cultural sites, and we have a strategy for protection with a timetable up to 2050. But of course, as I said before, as I mentioned before, it's important to also be able to adjust the strategy. Because you see that the challenges are here and we get to face new challenges all the time. So, we really need to be able to adapt to make the necessary adjustments.",

So, it is a part of a global crisis, which brings together climate change, the loss of biodiversity, pollution. It is all lumped together. And just a couple weeks ago in Budapest, the 53 member states of the WHO European region came together and they agreed upon an unprecedented declaration, a political declaration, which is the Budapest Declaration. And then, you are going to break these silos, they are going to work together, and to work in partnerships to addressed exactly these kinds of issues.

So, not just having visitors around for the summer months in the sun and, you know, also visiting the cultural sites, but also, having visitors around the year, because Greece has so many -- so much natural beauty, and we have mountains, we have all sorts of different types of tourisms, (INAUDIBLE) tourism, wine tourism, special types of tourism. And also, I guess, the cultural sites are much better enjoyed when the weather is more moderate. So, I think we can also be much more effective in terms of achieving the goal of extending the tourist season because Greece is always attractive.

We'reswitching -- a lot of companies are dealing with declining linear and focused on streaming. That having been said, how do you respond to what he just said and what exactly are you demanding? ALEX O'KEEFE, WRITER, \"THE BEAR\":  Yes. It's very funny that this multimillionaire CEO says that we're not being realistic. You pan out, there's a beautiful sun valley background there, and if you pan out even more, you'd see a fleet of private jets. It's funny who gets to imagine, in this world, who gets to be unrealistic because we're living in the wildest imaginations of a few billionaires who have designed our economy exclusively for themselves. And increasingly, there is a 1 percent, and the rest of us are the 99 percent. And that is why you are seeing not just the writers go on strike, not just the actors go on strike, UPS is gearing going to go on strike, workers across Los Angeles are going on strike because the same thing is happening across every part of their machine. And these media companies, you know, about six corporations control 90 percent of the media, I believe, they control so much of the economy and they have rigged for their profit exclusively. And their next step is to replaced human beings with machines, replace drivers with machines, replace actors with machines, replaces all with artificial intelligence. So, this strike is, at the forefront, the fight against A.I. to actually regulate A.I., which many scientists and leading A.I. experts have said has an existential threat to humanity. We don't need more existential threats. We have enough, all right? So, let's just focus on actually paying workers what they deserve. The workers who kept us alive through the pandemic, the writers and the actors who kept us entertained in our darkest moments, let's pay them what they deserve. I wrote for a very big show called \"The Bear.\" I made very little money. I saw no profits in it. I lived below the poverty line working on this show that has made millions of dollars for FX and Disney at large. This is not how the world has to be. There is enough wealth in this industry alone for us all to have success, and for 100 years in this economy, and this industry, that's how it worked. It was a common expectation that this would be a good union middle-class career. Not for the big actors, but for everyone who makes the machine run. And now, we are not even allowed to be middle-class. We are told just to be grateful to be there. No, we're mad as hell. We're not going to take it anymore. We are going to stand up for ourselves. And these billionaires, they're about to get a reality check, because workers have all the power. We make this economy run. And we will shut it down until we get our fair share.",

The residual model was won by the last time actors and writers went on strike together in 1960. And what it said is, if you make something that's very popular, that has a lot of success, you get a share in the success, you get a share in the profit. It makes a lot of sense. With streaming, they have made it so actors, writers were getting less than $1. We're getting cents on the dollar, residuals. You know, and I'm talking about big shows, even \"Abbott Elementary\" or \"The Bear,\" you're getting no money from the success. And what the studios claim, we're not making any money. We're just doing this for the love. I really doubt that. I really doubt that these billionaires are doing it for the love of the craft. Because if you work with, you know they don't care about the art. They care about the money. But they're stealing all the profits, they're not sharing it. They have broken the contract. They have broken the code between worker and employer, and that is why they have forced this strike. And they are refusing to negotiate with us, which is why they are burning down Hollywood. And it's up to the workers of Hollywood to build a better Hollywood. Let me tell you the end result, the consequences of not having these residuals. That when I won the WGA Award, best outstanding comedy for \"The Bear,\" I went to that award show with a negative bank account, a bowtie I bought on credit, a suit that I had to ask my brother and my mom, can you give me a little bit of money so I can get a suit? I was broke. I was actually broke. And yes, I got the gilded award. I walked the red carpet. But all that glitters is not gold. You know, I don't do this to be rich and I don't do this to be famous. I come from poverty. I just want a middle-class lifestyle. I just want to not worry about bills. I don't want to eat ramen when I'm working on one of the biggest shows in America. I think that is completely ridiculous. And if I know, if I can't at least make a middle-class income doing this, there's no chance for young black people, young people of color, young people in general, it's hopeless unless we stand up. Right now, my generation is being offered nothing, being offered nothing. And really, being told, you are going to be replaced by machines if you act up. Well, this is now or never. This is our shot to actually show the vision of what this generation can build. The economy that's been built. An economy that works for everyone, a Hollywood that works for everyone.

That for better or worse, there was an opportunity here to articulate certain things about where we stand as a country and to, at least, give a certain perspective that maybe people weren't aware of, particularly white people. I think most of us black people are aware of it, but I think a lot of people -- and white people weren't aware of racial bias and how deeply it infects our culture. And so, this was a chance to talk about it in a way that, for example, George Floyd could not, because he's no longer with us. So, I figured, let me try and do that in -- with, you know, what's been given.

If -- but I also understood that there was potentially a legal point to be made. So, there was a lot to balance. Ultimately, I was right on the line, and I decided on -- that -- you know, sort of a sense of mercy had to prevail. But there's something even more important that happened in that moment, which is that it's not about her. And to focus on her, to -- for everybody to say, of, we got to throw her in jail, that puts the attention in the wrong place. The important thing in that incidentwas how it demonstrated how deeply racial bias runs in our country and how it's integrated. And that bubbles up in much more important ways than the dustup between me and her. It manifested later that day when that racial bias made a white police officer think it was OK for him to kneel on the neck of a black man until that man was dead. That racial bias comes to the fore in the other cops who were there who did nothing because of that racial bias that informs how they make their decisions. You know, we see that racial bias going all the way to, for example, the fact of the people of Washington, D.C., largely black and brown, don't have any voting representation in Congress, while, you know, white rural Vermont, with fewer people than D.C., white rural Wyoming, with fewer people than D.C., get two senators each, but the larger black and brown and urban people of Washington, D.C. have no representation. That's racial bias at work. Those are important. Those are the things we should focus on. You know, while we're high-fiving, we put that woman in jail, the Supreme Court is rolling back affirmative action. So, we got to keep our eyes on the prize. We got to be focused on what matters, and what we can do to try to eradicate that racial bias when it bubbles up in these places the matter.",
