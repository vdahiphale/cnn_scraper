      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. This is the third attempt to delay the trial in three days and the third loss for former President Donald Trump. There were arguments just a short time ago where the Appeals Court judge heard from both Trump's attorneys and prosecutors in the case. And what Trump's lawyers were arguing is they want this trial stop because they said they want to challenge the judge because he hasn't recused himself in this case based on work his daughter has done for a political consulting firm that has worked with Democrats. And they also wanted to stop the case because they don't like the judge's ruling on presidential immunity.Trump's lawyers wanted to stop the trial because until the Supreme Court rules in a different case on presidential immunity, the judge said that they made that motion far too late in arguing to the judge. Trump's attorney Emil Bove said, this can only be done once and it must be done right because the impact it will have on this election. Now, the lawyer for the District Attorney's Office, Steven Wu, is their chief appellate attorney. He had pushed back on this saying that this was entirely the wrong way to challenge any of these rulings, so that can only be done procedurally after there is a conclusion to this case, a verdict in this trial. He urged the judge saying there is a powerful public interest to ensure this trial moves forward on the scheduled date. And just a short time after that, the judge issued this ruling denying the state, denying Trump's effort to stop the trial. What was extraordinary today, Wolf, was that this court had a full calendar of appeal arguments that it was hearing. So what they had to do was move this down to the basement to rearrange the tables, to create a makeshift courtroom so they could accommodate this hearing today. So they created a table for the judge, a table for the attorneys to argue, and then a table and chairs in the back for us in the media to be able to witness this event. But they made this extraordinary accommodation, which may be the first time they've ever done this in order to address this emergency action brought by the former president. But as we said this is the third attempt in three days to try to stop this trial. And so far, they're 0 for 3. Jury selection is still set to begin on Monday. Wolf?",

So it's kind of juicy and I don't think Trump wants to sit through that. And I don't think it's going to be good for him to sit through that. So there are lots of reasons to try and delay it.

That's, of course, the standard for jurors, not -- you don't have a right to have a jury of your own political supporters, or friends, or enemies for that matter.

One of them is to extend key surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as a major division among those who believe it's essential to national security and others who believe it infringes on constitutional rights. Donald Trump urged Republicans to kill that measure today.He successfully did so, 19 Republicans revolted against the Speaker of the House and stop that bill from coming to the floor. Then there's aid to Ukraine something that Mike Johnson is still moving behind the scenes to try to piece together after he stalled the Senate's plan that passed almost two months ago. But that is another issue because some members including Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene are warning him not to move ahead on that issue. Greene, of course, has introduced a resolution to oust Mike Johnson from the speakership, and she could call for that vote within two legislative days. At any point, she has not made the decision on when to move forward yet. But even as she met with Speaker Johnson today for 70 minutes in a very tense meeting, there are many Republicans who are concerned about her effort and warned that it could cost them the majority if she moves ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAX MILLER (R-Oh) Anyone who votes to vacate him should not be a member of Congress, in my opinion. REP. RICHARD HUDSON (R-NC): Obviously, we have to have a speaker and any effort to remove the current speaker would put us in chaos. I think it'd be a big mistake. REP.
