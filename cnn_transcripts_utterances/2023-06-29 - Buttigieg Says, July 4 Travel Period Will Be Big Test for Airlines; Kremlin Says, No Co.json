The FAA says 52,000 flights are scheduled to fly today through U.S. airspace. That is the biggest number we will see going into the July 4th rush, even though United Airlines is the one that is really struggling. You mentioned it's canceled more than any other -- more flights than any other airline in the last few days, canceling 2,500 flights, delaying another 7,000.Now, remember that United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby put a lot of the blame for this on the Federal Aviation Administration and its shortage of air traffic controllers. But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is really swiping back at that. He does admit that there is a shortage of controllers, but he says United really needs to look at the mirror here at its own problems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They dida flyby and then went back around and came in and landed with the nose landing gear still up. It is a testament to the engineering of the airplane, how strong it is. You can see it came down in one piece. No big deal. The crew, the pilots, the passengers, 96 of them on board this Delta flight of Boeing 717 evacuated on those emergency slides. All is well that ends well.

Domingo German was perfect.All right, here's why, this was absolutely awesome, Domingo German was only the 24th person ever to throw a perfect game and a Major League game, and he did it against a team that hadn't even been no hit since 1991. He owes a lot to his defense. You saw Josh Donaldson there, but especially first baseman Anthony Rizzo, saw the play right there, made that diving stop in the fifth inning to preserve the history. Now German becomes the first Dominican born player to retire 27 straight batters in a single game, also became the fourth Yankee to do it. David Cone was the last Yankee to throw a perfect game. He did it 1999, just 88 pitches. A year before that, Boomer, David Wells pulled it off. And, of course, everyone knows Don Larson through the only World Series perfect game in 1956. It's game five against the Brooklyn Dodgers. So, for context, here, how rare is a perfect game? Think about it this way. More than 23,000 games have been played since the last one when Seattle's Felix Hernandez did it in 2012. Since then, more than 54,000 home runs have been hit. More than 213,000 runs have been scored. There have been more than 407,000 hits. It's rare. Let's put this in the historical conference. Now, according to Baseball-Reference, there have been more than 237,000 games played in the league's 140-plus-year history. And, again, there have only been 24 of them that have been perfect. That means it only happens once in every 9876 games. And that, Poppy Harlow, is why it is absolutely the best story in the world today.",
