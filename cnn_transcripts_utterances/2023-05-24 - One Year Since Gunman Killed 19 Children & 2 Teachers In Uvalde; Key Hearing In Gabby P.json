      "sentences": "May 24th, 2022. One year ago today, a gunman walked into an elementary school and went on a murderous rampage. He slaughtered 19 schoolchildren and 2 teachers in Uvalde, Texas.And a botched police response and many still unanswered questions torment the heartbroken families. Last hour, at 12:49 local time, church bells rang out to mark the moment that police finally answered the classroom. Also today across the state, Texas held a moment of silence. And statewide, flags are flying at half-staff. Next hour, President Biden is scheduled to speak and call on Congress to confront the nation's gun violence epidemic. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is joining us now from Uvalde. Where this is a community that is coping still a year later, Shimon? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, coping, I think, feeling a lot of anger, a lot of anxiety. I was just talking to some family members that we featured in our documentary Sunday night. They actually came here and dropped off flowers, Mia Cerrillo, who was one of the girls who called 911, as she's on that bus with the other students who were rescued, some 77 minutes after, and they came here to lay flowers. But you can tell that this is really affecting the families today and the survivors. You can just see it. You can just feel it. There were tears in her eyes. And you could -- you know, having been around these people for a little while now, there's definitely a different feeling today than there has been any other day that I've certainly seen them. It's just really sad to see. I can only imagine the memories this must bring back for many of the survivors and for these families, who a year ago were on the streets here, as police were, at this point, rescuing their kids or some of these parents finding out that their kids were being brought to a hospital. Parents on this day were out here for over an hour awaiting answers. And to think about this, Brianna, we're now a year later and they're still waiting for answers and trying to get some sense of what exactly happened here. That's what they're dealing with here. Today is a lot about the grief, a lot about the suffering, the sadness. There's also anger. Because they just feel like they can't move forward right now without these answers, without getting the support of many of the political leaders and the community leaders here, and law enforcement. So, a lot of work, but today is certainly a day about those families, about the kids who died and those who are survived.",

This move now makes it official.We will continue to cover as other events are planned for today, including a conversation on Twitter. The headline there, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has filed to run for president in 2024. Another story we're following right now, an important court hearing underway in a civil lawsuit filed in the family of Gabby Petito against the parents of Brian Laundrie. That comes nearly two years after Petito's killing and then Laundrie's disappearance and his subsequent death. One of the key rulings we are expecting centers on whether a letter Laundrie's mother wrote to her son labeled \"Burn after Reading\" can be handed over to the Petitos. CNN's Jean Casarez has been following this story for us. Jean, tell us the importance of this letter and what you're learning so far about the Petito family's demands here.",

We have confirmed with a source that is familiar with the situation that there is an investigative grand jury in Pennsylvania that has already heard testimony via subpoena -- they did not come voluntarily, they were subpoenaed.The mother of Bryan Kohberger has already testified before an investigative grand jury. The father is set to testify before a grand jury. We understand that is set for tomorrow. We do not know what this is in regard to at all. But what we know are the facts. And that is that an investigative grand jury in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, can only look at potential crimes in that county, in Monroe County. Of course, this is where the family home was. It's where Brian and his father drove to, where he would spend the holidays with, when, at the time, he was arrested. But one other thing that can be done with an investigative grand jury, they can offer a presentment of what they believe should be crimes. They can say that they don't believe there are any crimes. Additionally, under the law, the judge and the district attorney in Monroe County can send the transcript of any testimony to another jurisdiction with another investigation. So in this case, it would be Idaho. They can do that because that transcript is an official record and it can get in the hands of the prosecutor.",

Now as you said, Netflix has long turned a blind eye to this. But because of their subscriber issues, they've had to really find new ways to gain revenue. And you know, we're talking about a lot of potential money here. Netflix estimates that as many as 100 people worldwide are password sharers. And if you do the math here, you quickly find out, if everyone paid that $8 a month, that's $800 million a month in Netflix's pocket. So a really big deal -- Boris?",
