Pearson of Memphis. Last night on this program, Representative Jones said he saw a change of heart in Governor Lee and in perhaps another sign of that, both his reinstatement and Representative Pearson's today were unanimous. Representative Pearson joins us now. Representative, thanks so much for being with us. How does it feel to be reappointed just six days after you were first expelled? JUSTIN J. PEARSON (D), REINSTATED TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: We have to realize that the antidemocratic behavior of the Tennessee State Republican Party is dangerous and that disenfranchising thousands -- hundreds of thousands of voters is always wrong, especially on an issue where we are trying to elevate the need for gun violence prevention and gun reform, especially in the time when we're recognizing the loss of life in Louisville and Nashville from gun violence. And now, there is determination and a movement that's building of young people especially that is demanding change happen, and so that gives even ever present hope during these difficult times.",

What we need are laws that the people in Tennessee overwhelmingly want. You see with Governor Bill Lee's push for more universal background checks as an executive order, but that can easily change. We need that to be a law. We see him nodding, at least at Red Flag laws. We need to turn these ideas into policies and into practices and into laws.

So the data that was looked at by the Agency then, the hundreds of studies that have been generated since, have all supported the safety profile of this medication that there are side effects certainly to be sure, but they are mild to moderate and, since they are known, oftentimes can be well controlled by the providers working with their patients.",

It's hard to independently verify everything that's thought to be the case about them. The first I should refer to, seems to have been filmed in summer months. That's because of the foliage you see during it. I've seen the entire unblurred video and most of the versions you see online are in fact heavily blurred.This shows what seems to be a Ukrainian soldier, judging by their uniform and the yellow armband they're wearing, that's often used to delineate sides in the conflict here. That man does appear to be alive and then another man, a massed soldier, he seems to be wearing a white band, that's often used here to delineate the Russian side in the conflict. He leans in and begins to cut him around the neck and slowly decapitate the individual. It's exceptionally gruesome, I should point out, and lasts for a lengthy period of time. Shocking and there are enough signs I think in there to suggest that what we are seeing is a Ukrainian member of personnel being the victim here and potentially a Russian, according to those signed committing the crime. The second video appears to be from a different time of year, possibly winter months, judging by the sort of harsh nature of the land, grainy too, but it appears to show the aftermath of a mine explosion that's hit a vehicle. And then there are the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers there. One that we see appears to have its hands and head missing. Now, that could be caused by the intensity of an explosion like that. But some observers have pointed out that the cuts -- the places where those parts, forgive me the graphic nature of the details here, were the heads and hands. So the hands and head removed appear to show cleaner cuts. Exceptionally graphic material here, but certainly something which many would point out shows the ferocity of the conflict here, if indeed they are genuine, and also to the intensity of the information we are dealing with as well, Anderson.",

You know, anything from the bombing of bomb shelters we talked about in Mariupol to the intense ferocity of artillery strikes against civilian infrastructure, it's been an utterly brutal war, a lot of that, specifically, the finger pointed towards Moscow.Moscow themselves have said that they need to look into this further to see who's doing what to who clearly and it could be potentially propaganda as well. But as this conflict drags on, Anderson, the shocking nature of the images you see -- [20:55:00] -- I mean what I saw today, the nature of that beheading video reminded me very clearly of the shock tactics ISIS would use (inaudible) ways often to sort of seem like an outsized enemy towards those that were facing (ph), by being so utterly savage in the things that they did, shows you quite how fast this war is escalating as it drags on into its second year now, Anderson.",
