There is a difference between those, of course, in flash bangs that the police use. Can you give us some sense? Are you seeing that as well? It looks like there are puffs of smoke in the sky and also where those flash bangs are being deployed because we are not seeing -- we can hear them, but we're not seeing exactly where they are being deployed and what is happening in that area. Do you have a vantage point?",

I'm Sarah Sidner here on the Columbia campus watching what is happening here, where the protests have been completely dismantled and police are now replacing protesters on campus.Let us go though to UCLA, where you're seeing some pictures from a bird's eye view looking down on the encampment that is currently as we speak being raided by police, police trying to go in. We have seen arrests already this morning. We have seen many protesters with zip ties around their arms being taken out of that protest. We've been hearing flash bangs this morning as the police try to disperse this particular encampment that has been there for about a week now. And so what we're watching is police standing eye-to-eye with protesters and trying to push further and further into an encampment that we learned is about the size just smaller than a football field. You see many, many tents that are still up. You also see some of the boards that they had put up that surrounded the encampment. Those have been taken down by police as well. Let us get to our Camila Bernal. She is on the ground there. She has been watching this unfold. Camila, what can you tell us at this hour? How has the scene changed at all or is it becoming more intense?",
