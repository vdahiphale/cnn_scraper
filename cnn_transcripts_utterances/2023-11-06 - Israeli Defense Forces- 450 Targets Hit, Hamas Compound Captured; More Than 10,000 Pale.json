But now, we will continue our coverage of the Israeli-Hamas war. Israeli incursion into Gaza continues to take a staggering toll nearly one month after Hamas attacked Israel, according to Hamas supplied figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The number of Palestinians killed in four weeks of retaliation against Hamas has now passed 10,000. That includes more than 4,000 children. This is smoke near a camp for Palestinians taking shelter. The Israeli military says it struck 450 targets just in the past day and captured a Hamas compound. Israel says its forces have encircled Gaza City and are now closing in. The IDF released these images of ground fighting. Wrapping up a series of meetings with leaders in the region a few hours ago, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is working aggressively on getting more aid into Gaza. All right. A lot to unpack here. We have a team on the ground standing by. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been reporting from southern Israel. And Nada Bashir of our share is in Jerusalem for us. Great to have you both on the show during this time. Jeremy, I'd like to start off with you. And of course, we've just heard the news over the past day that it is from terms of what we are seeing, the IDF has encircled Gaza City. They say that they've basically split Gaza into two, the north and the south. The question now becomes, when is the idea of going to enter Gaza City now that they've encircled the area?",

But I think it is very clear that they are not operating in the center of Gaza City, in the most densely populated areas where there are reports that Hamas has effectively reinforced their defensive lines and where they are waiting for the possible entry of Israeli troops. What we have watched over the last 24 hours is a continued intensity of that aerial bombardment and artillery strikes on the Gaza Strip. We have watched as Israeli forces have carried out strikes on 450 targets in just the last 24 hours last night. And throughout the day today, we have been listening and watching to those strikes. You can see, perhaps, behind me some of the smoke that is still emerging from Gaza -- from inside the Gaza Strip. But as you said, this is a question now of whether Israel's political and military leadership is actually going to be willing to send a significant number of Israeli forces into the stronghold that is Gaza City, in order to try and achieve the objective that they have set out, which is to eliminate Hamas and effectively remove it as the sovereign in Gaza. At the same time, is really forced to say that they are working to establish a corridor for civilians to evacuate from the north to the south. There are enormous questions about that effort though. We know that in the past, Israeli military has told civilians to leave to the south, but that many of those evacuation routes have still been targets. Parts of southern Gaza have still been targets. And we have watched over the last several weeks, as the toll of civilian casualties has continued to mount as Israel rather than sending its forces into those most densely populated areas is instead targeting many of those areas from the air, killing Hamas fighters, they say, but also very clearly from the images on the ground, killing civilians as well.",

Prosecutors say he exaggerated his wealth for his own financial benefits and that of his business. The judge has already found Trump liable for persistent and repeated fraud.

This is a civil case, the distinction being this pertains to his business. And the essence of this case is whether or not his business engaged in fraud by overvaluing properties, and by engaging in practices that were contrary to New York state law. What's on the line is the loss of his business's licenses and his ability to really have his empire in New York at all. So that's significant. I think what I'm expecting is I'd like to know, really, things pertaining to his knowledge, pertaining to his control, and just pertaining to overall what he knew and what he directed, right? Because when you have a case that's being brought that speaks to this fraud, what knowledge did the president have of this? Right? He'll obviously indicate that he was running the free world, and therefore, there could be limitations on that knowledge. What control did he have in terms of what was happening in his business?

Even before, fining him because he didn't obey the court directives and the gag order. There was another issue where his team didn't provide discovery. Discovery is information that legal team needs to provide so that items can be scrutinized and evaluated before trial. I bring that up because it goes to whether or not the judge even believes in the credibility of the person who's testifying. And that's important, because it ends with what we talked about, and that's the numbers. Is it a fact that you valued properties where the units were not, yes -- yet constructed? Yes, or no? Obviously, if you're indicating that there are more units that are live and operable that are the case, that's a problem. It inflates the values.

The trouble is, it's not clear that they're speaking the same diplomatic language. Because when you hear from Blinken, following the meetings, he will talk about the need for humanitarian assistance. It is clear that all sides, certainly, Arab leaders in the U.S. agrees on the immediate necessity for that. But when it comes to a ceasefire, you hear very different things. For instance, the readout from the Turkish side of Blinken meeting with his Turkish counterpart was the Turkey is demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza by Israel. Very similar, we heard from the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, when Blinken went to the West Bank. When you hear from Blinken, as he leaves those meetings, he talks about a humanitarian pause. But it's not clear that even that lower bar is being met by Israeli officials. So, you have the Arab world demanding an immediate ceasefire. They view military action in Gaza, as punishing civilians there. The U.S. position somewhere in between discussing the need for a pause. But it's not clear that the U.S. is getting Israel on to something along those lines anywhere in the near term, in part, because Israel is demanding, at least, in its public comments for the release of all hostages before it considers such a stop to military action. So, the distance between those sides, at least based on the public comments coming out of those meetings remains vast. It's not clear when they're going to bridge that gap. But the success that has been achieved so far is really about getting at least more humanitarian aid into Gaza. We've seen more trucks go in. We've seen the border crossing at Rafah along the Egyptian border open up again. But in terms of that ceasefire, or something acceptable to Palestinian leaders, Turkish leaders, Jordanian leaders, just doesn't seem that they are there yet. All right. Jim Sciutto, thank you so much for that update. We've got Ben Wedeman standing by for us as well. Ben, great to see you.

It was a grandmother and her three grandchildren, ages 10, 12, and 14, who were killed, according to the Lebanese authorities, by -- in an Israeli drone strike. The Israeli said that, you know, militants use vehicles to move around the area, it's hard to imagine how there were any militants in that vehicle, in which four civilians were killed. Today, we've heard from, for instance, the military wing of Hamas, they say that they fired 16 rockets into Israel, aimed at the town of Nahariya, which is the first large Israeli town on the other side of the border. And also, according to a statement they put out, south of Haifa. Now, those represent certainly the deepest strikes yet into Israel. But it's not at all clear if those rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome system. Hezbollah also has come out and said that they have been targeting Israeli military positions once again, focusing on surveillance, communications, and observation equipment on the Israeli side. And, in fact, just a little while ago, we did hear several large explosions coming from the south of us in the direction of the border area.

However, I feel that, that argument they are inherently dismissing the death, in fact, even endorsing and justifying the death of thousands of civilians. And that is just morally irreprehensible. It is also short sighted and not entirely rational. Because, as I've said before, you know, if you manage to eliminate all of Hamas, what next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. It is routine human rights abuses, illegal settlements, this regard to U.N. resolutions and international law. If we do not address these root causes, then, you can kill the combatant, but you cannot kill the cause. So, on the rubble of these destroyed buildings will emerge another group more determined and more motivated to do what Hamas did. So, I think Israel needs to once and for all realize that if it wants its security, the shortest route is through peace. You know? Not the strongest military or the most capable intelligence services, or the Iron Dome or the separation wall will safeguard Israel's security as much as peace would.

And it's been unbearable to watch to the avalanche of human suffering that we're seeing. Almost 10,000 deaths, almost half of them are children. And if you just put that in perspective, over the last four weeks in Gaza, eight times more children were killed than the 20 months of the Ukraine war. UNICEF has called Gaza, the grave yard for children. And, you know, these are not just numbers, each one of these children was somebody's everything. Now, there's an acronym in Gaza, WCNSF, Wounded Child with No Surviving Family. That's an acronym that should never exist, but it does exist in Gaza. You know, I think the world is just screaming, when -- how many more people have to die before our global conscience awakes? Or is it forever dormant when it comes to the Palestinians?",

It's never justified toattack somebody based on their political beliefs. But I also want to remind everyone that Israel does not represent all the Jewish people around the world. Israel is a state and it alone is responsible for its own crimes. Jewish people around the world, many of them are appalled by what they are seeing. And, you know, like you said, Islamophobia is the other side of the same disease. And we Muslims, we have to be the first to condemn anti- Semitism. We have had a long history of peaceful coexistence. So, this is not about religion. It is about politics. And what we've seen in recent years, is the charge of anti-Semitism being weaponized in order to silence any criticism of Israel. So, defenders or supporters of Israel who cannot defend Israel's actions or conduct, they revert to -- they revert to shutting the conversation down by equating criticism Israel with anti-Semitism. Let me be very, very clear, being pro-Palestinian is not being anti- Semitic. Being pro-Palestinian does not mean you're pro Hamas or pro terrorism. I think Israel deserves more from its allies than just unequivocal support. I think it deserves some uncomfortable truths. Because if you are a real friend, you support your friend when they are right. But you also tell them when they've crossed the line. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In Cape Town, South Africa, we meet a team of marine scientists who are implementing artificial intelligence to protect aquatic life and the ocean they live in. Bianca Nobilo has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The ocean of the coast of Cape Town's South Africa is home to a captivating underwater world known as the Great African Seaforest. It's one of the most biodiverse marine environments on the planet. A desire to study and play a part in conserving this rich ecosystem is what drew marine scientists Mike Barron and Dylan Irion to Cape Town. They co- founded Cape Research and Diver Development or Cape RADD, an organization dedicated to marine research that engages both biologists and citizen scientists. MIKE BARRON, MARINE BIOLOGIST, CO-FOUNDER CAPE RADD: we wanted to create something which allowed people accessibility and engagement in marine conservation and science without having to be a scientist.",

Trump answered questions about his responsibility in preparing a 2014 statement of financial condition. At one point, the judge told him to answer the questions put to him and not make speeches. He said to Trump, you can attack me you can do whatever you want. But the answer -- but you've got to answer the question. Our Kristen Holmes is standing by in New York to give us an update. Kristen, great to see you. Quite a bit happening. We knew that Trump wasn't going to be your average witness. But tell me what we've heard from inside the courtroom.",

As you said, the judge noting, you can attack me, but you can't -- you still must answer the questions. We also know that the judge went after Trump's lawyer saying can you control your client? Because Donald Trump continues to avoid answering questions in a yes or no fashion, but instead, make lengthy remarks, sometimes off topic. Now, this is not surprising given what we know about Donald Trump. One thing to keep in mind is that he does actually believe that he is a victim here, that has really been his mindset since day one that people are out to get him. So, of course, he's going to continue saying that. But also, Donald Trump is somebody who's going to continue to focus on the fact that this is going to impact his career and his campaign. And so, he is campaigning off of this, and actually taking that campaign onto the stage. Saying that this is election interference. That people are trying to get him because he is running for president. Those are things that we know are part of his messaging in his campaign for president. Now, whether or not something is going to happen here in terms of the judge shutting this down, it does seem as though things are escalating just in terms of a back and forth. But it will be interesting to see how this continues forward, particularly, as Donald Trump sticks to his playbook of essentially answering the questions that he wants to talk about. Answering them with the answers that he wants people to hear as he takes control of the public narrative.",
