So there's a lot of scanner traffic right now that we can't confirm. What we can confirm from police is that multiple injuries have been reported and that this remains an active and ongoing investigation. Police have closed a lot of the roads around the school right now. They're asking people to avoid the area. We just heard -- we were listening to a mother who's been interviewed by local police. She said that she was able to ascertain that her kids are OK because her sister works at the school. But there are a lot of parents right now who obviously have not been able to get in touch with their children. This is a K-12 school. We understand that this is a Christian school. It was founded in 1978. And it is a very small school. About 200 families from some 56 different churches make up the greater Dane County area, where the school resides, including the metropolitan Madison and its surrounding communities. And those are all students that are represented in the student body. It's a very small school. And we are still learning more. This is the second shooting at a Christian school in just weeks. There was one in Northern California where a 5-year-old and a 6-year-old were shot. Those two children did survive, but they have serious injuries, very, very serious, still in the hospital, have a long road to recovery, according to the sheriff from the Butte County area. That school shooting happened in early December. So this is the second school shooting at a small Christian school in just weeks. Boris and Brianna, as we learn more, we will bring it to you.",

Thank you, all three, for being with us. Obviously, we are awaiting word from police officers. We understand that there's going to be a press conference in about 12 minutes or so. I do wonder, given that this appears to be an active scene -- we just saw a set of officers walking in with a canine into the building -- Ed, what do you make of what we're seeing and the fact that we're set to hear from law enforcement shortly?",

So there's a lot happening in the very early minutes of an incident like this. It's hard to get information out. The fact that the police have already scheduled some type of communication with the press is really encouraging, give us some ideas to what's going on in a fairly short period of time.

We just saw three officers going in and video from just moments ago here.Rob, take us through this, because police officers have told CNN as they're working to clear the school and they have no one in custody. We are awaiting details, of course, but there is an array of possibilities here, which is the understanding that the shooter may be inside and is no longer a threat, is inside and is a threat. Explain to us whether this -- that would be still active and ongoing. The body language that you were suggesting does make you wonder about perhaps not being inside and a threat or that the shooter could be off scene. Take us through these possibilities. D'AMICO:  Yes, so as you mentioned, that the shooter is what we call neutralized or down hard would be that he was shot and he's not posing a threat, as in handcuffed. It could be running medical assistance him if he's shot.",

Our CNN's Shimon Prokupecz actually spoke with the Madison police chief. And this is on the record here. One suspect is down. Several casualties have been reported, and there have been transports to hospitals, including children. One staff member has potentially been killed. They are still conducting secondary searches of the building and vehicles. So that's from the Madison police chief, according to our CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. That's the latest.",

There is also a teacher or a staff member that is injured as well, severely injured. That is something that they're still investigating, but that staff member also taken to the hospital and severely injured. They are conducting secondary searches, which is what we obviously always see in these situations, where police go back in, they start to search to make sure there are no other suspects, no other gunmen on the loose. So, that is what we are seeing develop now. They are doing the secondary searches, but obviously still a very much ongoing situation. We don't know if the gunman was a student or if it was someone outside, but, as you have been reporting, the chief said -- he's expected to brief the media at about 15 after. So in about five minutes or so, we should hear from the chief, but obviously a very, very serious situation under way here in the Madison, Wisconsin, area. Again, several students have been injured. They believe at this time that the gunman has been contained, has been either injured. He's telling me that the suspect is down, and so right now at this point, they're trying to actually investigate, obviously, exactly what happened. But at this point, they believe they have it contained. They're doing secondary searches to make sure there are no other shooters.",

And then you also need to make sure that other schools in the area are not unduly impacted. We may get a motive if they do have the suspect or they do know who the suspect is. Why this particular teacher? Was it a classroom or was it -- why was this particular teacher killed? Was it she was leading a classroom that the shooter was in or was this a known suspect? And that will help. It's not ideal, but that will help sort of give police and, of course, the community a sense of what happened at the school. Of course, we are always in the -- we're always in the school shooting season, I have to say, and not sarcastically. It's been a little while since we have seen this kind of police activity. And that was probably because they didn't have him originally, but like your other analyst -- the worst is over. We now need to figure out in particular what the motive is and who the suspect is.",

I was in touch with him as this was happening.And he tells me that they believe that, at this point, the suspect is down, that there are children that have been taken to the hospital and been injured. There is also a staff member of the school that was seriously injured, potentially a fatal injury, but they're still sorting through that. And, as you said, we are waiting to hear from the chief. He told me he was expected to speak around 1:15, 12:15 local time. I think they're still gathering a lot of the information.And as they try to get everything they can together, that's when we should hear from the chief here. But the key here now is that obviously the police here know what they're dealing with, they believe they have the suspect. They believe now that the situation itself is under control. And now what they're doing are secondary searches to make sure there are no other gunmen, no other suspects that they're looking for, but, obviously, a very frightening situation here. You have children that have been injured. You have staff members that have been injured. And police are still trying to sort through everything. I asked if the gunman was a student or if it was from somebody outside. I have not heard back from the chief yet. So, obviously, they are still trying to gather everything, and I believe they will have a lot of information for us once the chief takes to the mics,but a very serious, serious situation here. Yet again, we're dealing with a school shooting. Immediately, when I texted with the police chief, that's what he told me. He said, we're dealing with a school shooting here. This is something that I know this chief has trained for, has dealt with, and it is something that has been on the top of mind for them there in Madison, Wisconsin, as it is for every police chief across the country now having to face this threat. And this is something that certainly they have been preparing for. And I hope here soon we will hear more information from him.",

So I would say to you it was around maybe or so -- close to 1So, some time around that point, they already knew that they had the situation contained. So, just before 1:00, they realized that the situation was contained. Suspect being down usually means that it was someone who -- a suspect that was shot, whether self-inflicted or by the police. That's usually what that means to me, but I have not been able to get, Brianna, any more information at this point, but it seems, like from everything that I communicated with him about, it seems that at least, at the very least, they do have the situation under control.",
