But I suppose you could ask the question, you know, when is a ceasefire not a ceasefire? And the answer, I suppose, is when it is a tactical localized pause as the Israelis are calling it.And what they're doing is really formalizing what they've been doing on a kind of ad hoc basis, as you say, since last weekend, opening up these safe corridors to enable civilians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where its operations are focused in terms of attacking Hamas and their infrastructure and commanders, and enabling them to move to the relative safety of the southern part of the Gaza Strip. They're also going to be opening up a second evacuation corridor. And there'll be during that four-hour window, an area or a neighborhood will be designated to be free from fighting for that period of time to enable residents to leave their homes and to get water, food, medicine, if they can actually find any that's available during that period of time. So the U.S. says a step in the right direction. It's not quite the humanitarian pause along a kind of two, three day pause of fighting that they wanted. And it's certainly not the total ceasefire that we heard again from the Emirati and Qatari leaders calling for yesterday and also aid agencies and many in the international community are calling for. So it's not a complete ceasefire. And Israel's position, as we heard from Netanyahu, is simply that there can't be one until those 240 or so hostages are released. And then we also saw that latest hostage video, didn't we, from Islamic Jihad, the smaller militant group in the Gaza Strip, an elderly wheelchair-bound lady and a 13-year-old boy talking to the camera, saying how they miss their family, how they're being treated well, and how if anything happens to them, it'll be on Netanyahu's head.",

A diplomatic source familiar with the Qatar-led negotiations confirmed to CNN that a meeting on Thursday between CIA Director William Burns, the Mossad head David Barnier, and Qatari officials in Doha discussed a proposed plan to release up to 20 civilian hostages in return for a three-day humanitarian pause in Gaza.Now the source told CNN the plan also includes access for further humanitarian aid into the enclave. Why is this all significant? Well, this certainly appears to suggest that progress is being made. CNN has been reporting for some weeks that there is no prospect of Israel agreeing to a sustained pause in fighting or temporary ceasefire without a substantial number of hostages being released. That is according to one senior U.S. official. In public, both Israel's Prime Minister and his Defense Minister have been categorical. No ceasefire deal without the release of all those held in Gaza. Well a pause in the fighting would enable Hamas to compile and hand over a list of all hostages. This has been a major sticking point in any progress to date. And what have been extremely complicated talks made all the more difficult, mediators say, by the intensity of the Israeli assault since it launched its second phase of this war two weeks ago. What is not clear is how long of a pause Israel would be willing to agree to and what would amount to an acceptable number of hostages released. The Israel Defense Force says the military's current count of hostages being held by Hamas is 239. That number includes both Israeli and foreign nationals. Now these multi-party negotiations which also include Egypt's have also centered around exchanging hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. And it's not clear whether this current proposed plan includes a prisoner exchange. Becky Anderson, CNN, Abu Dhabi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Officials say Ukrainians repelled seven new attacks on Avdiivka on Thursday. Russia has been trying to lay siege to the city for more than a month in a possible attempt to turn the tide of the war.Further south, Ukraine says one person was killed on its balcony in artillery attacks on the city of Kherson. Two other people were wounded on Thursday when Russia reportedly hit apartment buildings and other civilian targets. A non-profit group is trying to help Ukrainian children deal with the psychological trauma from the war. On Thursday, it opened a new center in western Ukraine for children who moved there from frontline areas in the east and the south. The non-profit called Ukraine Children's Action Project says about five million children from those regions are displaced because of the fighting. And many of them are now dealing with serious psychological effects of what they saw in the war zone. In the last hour, a co-founder of that non-profit spoke with CNN's Michael Holmes. He asked Dr. Irwin Redlener whether the war in Israel is taking attention away from what people in Ukraine are facing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. IRWIN REDLENER, CO-FOUNDER, UKRAINE CHILDREN'S ACTION PROJECT: We're actually very, very worried about it. And that is even exacerbated by the fact that the world's attention is very distractible and there are crises all over the world and especially what's happening in the Middle East. That said, we have about two- thirds of the Ukrainian child population that since the beginning of the war have been displaced. About half of them outside the country is refugees, and another half of them are in Western, relatively safer parts of the country to avoid the direct impact of the battlefields. But on the other hand, too, we know, Michael, that children are also being exposed to bombing and missiles and other terrifying events that are affecting how they're feeling and what their attitude is about the future. But, you know, I should say the Ukrainian children are phenomenally resilient, as are their whole families. And this is people that don't know Ukraine would be, I think, really surprised at the courage, the resiliency and so on. But there are kids now that are not just psychologically traumatized, but many of them have had their education severely disrupted. I mean, schools in Ukraine were closed for almost two years from the pandemic before the war started. Now we have another two years of interrupted education for many of the kids. And Ukraine and the countries that they're going to as refugees are doing a lot to help them deal with school. But there's going to be a tremendous need to remediate education.",

CNN senior crime and justice reporter has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: We're now getting a picture of just how many witnesses or the types of witnesses who may be called to testify against Donald Trump at his upcoming trial on the handling of documents in Florida. So this is exclusive new reporting from Paula Reid and I here at CNN. And what we've learned is that there are notable figures around Donald Trump, people from his White House, people who may be former intelligence officials, Secret Service agents, political advisors, and others, who are very likely possible witnesses against Trump at that trial that prosecutors would call. But there are also Lower-level workers, staff members at Mar-a-Lago, even contract employees that were coming in and out of his Florida resort property, who could be witnesses in this case and could build this picture that prosecutors want to tell a jury about on how unsecured these documents were that Donald Trump had after the presidency. Those people include a plumber, a maid, a chauffeur, a woodworker even, and we have heard what some of these people were seeing. So the maid was someone that was cleaning Donald Trump's bedroom suite, and that when Trump found out that she was a person of interest to investigators and would be speaking with investigators for this possible case, he went ballistic. That's what one source told us. The woodworker, for instance, that person was putting crown molding into Donald Trump's bedroom, and when he was putting it into the bedroom, when he was installing it, he noticed stacks of papers that were lying around or a stack of papers that appeared so suspicious to him that he thought they might be some sort of top secret or classified material. He didn't actually know what he was seeing, but this is the sort of story that prosecutors may want to put on the witness stand and have that person tell just to show how suspicious it was, how things were lying around the resort, and how the national security material that was ultimately found there was being handled by Donald Trump and others, a very important aspect of their case going forward. That's just a glimpse into what may be seen at this trial. Right now, the trial is set for May of next year, but it's unclear if that date is going to hold. The federal judge overseeing this case in Florida is looking at potentially moving that date and other dates in the case. There are a bunch of deadlines on hold right now, and we are waiting for that judge to say when that trial actually will take place, there's a possibility that these witnesses may not be telling their story to the public or to a jury until after the presidential election.

As CNN's Will Ripley reports, all of this is the unexpected fallout of a population bust after China's controversial one child policy.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China's communist rulers face a looming population crisis, a crisis some say they helped create. Now they want women to help solve it by staying home and having more babies. The one child policy, decades of forced abortions and other draconian measures imposed on the Chinese people, preventing an estimated 200 million births may be backfiring, experts say. For the first time since the post-famine years of the 1960s, China's massive population is shrinking. It may be too late to turn things around. 1.4 billion people living longer, getting older, aging faster than the social welfare system can keep up. China's birth rate also falling fast. Far fewer babies, a baby bust that could cripple future growth. Adding to Beijing's biggest economic challenge in four decades, youth unemployment skyrocketing. Many Chinese young people struggling to find decent paying jobs unable to financially support themselves, never mind their aging parents. Marriage, children, forget about it.
