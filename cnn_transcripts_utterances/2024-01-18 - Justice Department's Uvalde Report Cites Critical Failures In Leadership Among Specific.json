It concludes that this was a failure of leadership, and so all members of the leadership who were at -- who failed, were identified. It also identifies individual officers by rank and by what agency they're from.But the standard practice of the Justice Department in these critical incident reviews is not to name those who are not listed as at fault, and particularly not to name those in lower ranks who acted on the scene.",

The shooter here is dead, and there's no federal -- criminal jurisdiction. What we've done is responded to the mayor's request for -- that mayor's request for a critical incident response examination to determine the manner in which the agencies responded and to provide recommendations for the future.

And that requires tactical training. That's the first thing. I'd say the second thing is critical incident response. Establishing who's going to be the on-site commander. Making clear to all other agencies that that person will be the on-site commander. That again requires training and practice and response.",

All hundreds of pages. I will say there was an epic, complete lack of leadership, unity of command. There was no incident command set up. That's not the case with the Pulse nightclub.And so, in this particular one, in comparison, that is not entirely true. And the response was a failure of leadership.",

All of which meant that people who were shot, people who were killed, mostly children, 10 and 11 and 12- year-old children. So much of it could have been prevented. I want to bring in Shimon Prokupecz, who was in the room there, and I just want to underscore led the way in pushing for answers from law enforcement on a local level. These law enforcement officials, local officials beyond law enforcement, who were not giving proper answers to the families, which is now acknowledged in this detailed report by the Justice Department and was just done again publicly by the attorney general in a really extraordinary press conference. Shimon, as I come to you, I just want to give a couple of the lines that the attorney general used that really sum up this horrific, horrific failure. \"Had law enforcement followed the accepted practices\" -- what was started after Columbine, the shooting in Columbine back in 1999 -- \"lives would have been saved and people would have survived.\" Shimon?",

I hope that the failures end today and that local officials do what wasn't done that day. Do right by the victims and survivors of Robb Elementary, terminations, criminal prosecutions. And our state and federal government enact sensible gun laws because Robb Elementary began the day an 18-year-old wasn't allowed to purchase an AR-15.",
