They have campaigned on a policy of keeping the military out of politics and they have won the most votes according to the unofficial result, which will be official in about five days according to the electoral commission.What they've also said is they want deep structural reforms of the military, of the economy, and also the once untouchable monarchy. This was something that just a number of years ago was a taboo subject. You could only speak about it behind closed doors. But this party has now turned reform of the monarchy into a public debate. But what happens now is that this party has to form a coalition. They have to have as many parties -- like-minded parties on their side as possible because over recent years when military-backed parties have been in power they have changed the constitution, which means the deck is stacked in their favor. So they need as many votes as possible from MPs to be able to secure the prime ministership for their person. In fact, they have said that they understand this will be difficult but all the progressive parties have agreed to band together and agreed to work together to make sure that democracy is respected and that the will of the people is respected -- Christine.",

It was wind speed over 210 kilometers per hour. The last time there was a cyclone as severe as this was about 10 yearsor, rather, more than that -- about 15 years in 2010 I believe, when more than 150 lives were lost and more than 15,000 homes were destroyed by a tropical cyclone in the western coast of Myanmar. So here is what we know. We know that the most impacted areas are within the state of Rakhine in western Myanmar. There's a city called Sittwe that's been completely demolished according to reports. We are waiting to hear from officials on what really is happening on the ground there. The storm surge has been as high as 3.5 meters because of which low-lying areas in Sittwe are completely inundated. Like you said, trees have been uprooted and roofs have blown off. So more details are awaited as of now because the comms are down, the power is down, the internet is down. But it's been a huge relief for the country of Bangladesh -- the neighboring country of Bangladesh and here is why. They were expecting this cyclone to pummel through Cox's Bazar, which has the largest refugee settlement in the world -- over a million people there. And it seems to have veered off Cox's Bazar and gone towards the western coast of Myanmar, and that has been hugely impacted. It might take days, it might take weeks to understand the extent of damage there but we're waiting to hear more from the officials on the ground, Christine.",

There are families out there that can still be reunited.ROMO (voice-over):  During the last decade, CNN has documented multiple cases of babies who were stolen at birth in Chile. During the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet babies were funneled to adoption agencies -- some from upper classes taken or given up to protect reputations, and some from lower classes where children were simply stolen. Chilean authorities say many priests, nuns, doctors, nurses, and others conspired to carry out illegal adoptions. Authorities told us the number of stolen babies could be in the thousands but the investigation into the adoptions has languished over the years. Scott Lieberman is one of the lucky few.

The Wall Street Journal says this sheepdog bag is an example of how companies keep hiking prices and consumers keep paying them. Some of the price hikes that companies are actually bragging about to their investors -- those price hikes are even bigger than the higher cost of raw materials and labor due to inflation.In 2020, Kate Spade's popular pineapple bag cost about $100 less than that. All right, looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished higher this morning. The Hang Seng up nearly two percent ahead of China's industrial and retail data. European markets are also slightly higher this morning. And on Wall Street, stock index futures -- a check there -- leaning up, but not too much here. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow fell for a second week in a row. Consumer sentiment hit six-month lows. We learned that Friday. And that debt ceiling drama is still unresolved. The Nasdaq finished higher though for the third consecutive week. On inflation watch, gas prices rose a penny overnight to $3.54 a gallon. A lot ahead this week. Retail sales, existing home sales, weekly jobless claims. But really, the most important thing is getting this debt ceiling fixed.

Joining me this morning, Gene Marks, a small business advocate, CPA, and president of The Marks Group. Gene, super great to have you on this Monday morning. You know, I've been concerned about this for some time. We're running out of time to fix this. You advocate specifically for small business, so how concerned are you that Congress won't be able to do this -- to avoid a default -- at least in the very near term? And what would that do to small businesses? GENE MARKS, SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE, CPA, PRESIDENT, THE MARKS GROUP (via Skype):  Hey, Christine. Yes, thanks for having me on. Yes, it is -- it's obviously a big concern for myself as an advocate but we have thousands of clients that we serve in our firm and they are -- many of them are very, very concerned about what impact this loan defaults could potentially have -- this debt default -- as well as any kind of shutdown of government services. I have a lot of clients, Christine, that are in the contracting business, so they get money directly from the federal government or they're indirectly impacted because they get money from contractors. They get money from the federal government. And if the government shuts down and their prioritized payments -- and they're not making those payments, there are just countless small businesses around the country that are really going to be impacted by this.",
