I mean, there's two things you can do in a campaign. You can campaign. You can raise money and buy advertising. The problem for a lot of these Republicans right now is that no matter how well they do at either one of those things, the thing sitting on top of their head like an anvil is Donald Trump. He's sitting at 60 percent nationally and Republican voters still, by and large, like him. Even people who say they want to vote for someone else say they still like Donald Trump.

People were still, you know, coming back from that sense of insecurity and we're making good progress. But, to be frank, I think some of this is, you know, people feel like the economy has not been fair for too long. That's why the president says we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, in which everyone is included. I talked about Diana Ross earlier, but if you look at the comparison between CEO pay and frontline worker pay, in 1970, CEO pay was something like 20 times higher. Today, it's 300 some times higher.
