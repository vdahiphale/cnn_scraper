But that currently according to his view and his vantage point this is Speaker Johnson catering to the most extreme small group of Republicans in his own caucus.

This of course has drawn a lot of ire from a lot from a lot of world leaders.

I mean if you break out these different conflicts, Israel for example, they could probably go on for much longer than, say, Ukraine could. Israel has a sizable military industrial complex that can support its ongoing war in Gaza. But there certainly they have run low on various weapons.Ukraine really here is the one of major concern. We're about to hit the two-year mark of Russia's invasion in Ukraine. The administration has completely run out of money from the two main buckets that it uses to help support Ukraine. And we hear from soldiers on the front lines that they are running out of bullets. They're running out of artillery. They're running out of the long range rockets they need to disrupt Russian logistical lines and their bases at long distance. So Ukraine really is having a scary moment here and the United States provides far more assistance to both Israel and to Ukraine than any other country around the world. So this was a message not just to Republicans and his fellow Democrats here in this country, but to the world in that this is the message that so much - so many of the European and the NATO allies want to hear. There - this is a moment in which they are - some are freaking out, especially when we hear what Trump had to say yesterday, encouraging Russia to invaded NATO allies. I spoke with one senior European official who called it very unfortunate and that it erodes the trust that they have in the United States.

His entire campaign and this is what appeals to his base and many Republicans, is about \"America first,\" in this America first policy, and that's what Donald Trump calls it, they don't give aid to other countries. They keep aid within the United States. This is not about helping foreign governments, it is about helping people within the United States.Now, obviously, there are different factions of money and things are not as cut and dry as the way that Donald Trump often puts them out there. But the way that he sells his message is that if we don't give money to Ukraine, that money can be used elsewhere, that could be used on the border. And this is a message that really resonates with a lot of Americans. You have to remember, we're talking about two big issues that Donald Trump wants to run on in 2024, run against Biden on. One of them is the economy. He knows that people across the country are still suffering from what they feel is inflation. He wants to play that up, essentially saying, oh, if we keep the money for ourselves, that will help our economy. These things, again, are not all interrelated. Donald Trump is conflating several of these various issues, money that would go to foreign aid, money that would go back into the United States' economy.

Thank you to Kristen and MJ as well.And we are now in a critical 24-hour window for hostage negotiations in the Middle East, leaders trying to hash out a deal to free captives held by Hamas in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza. Egypt's president announcing that CIA Director Bill Burns is meeting up with top officials today from Israel, Qatar and Egypt. But those talks remain difficult, that is the word, difficult, that one official is using when we hear in reporting that we're getting. So after Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, ordered his military to come up with a plan for evacuating Gaza's displaced civilians from Rafah in the south, we're talking about a staggering 1.3 million people, adding to the complex negotiations a rescue operation that saved two Israeli hostages, but reportedly killed more than 100 people, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. Let's talk about all of this with former commanding general for the U.S. Army in Europe. We have retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges. General, thanks for being with us. Barak Ravid, a contributor here to CNN and Axios reporter, is saying that Netanyahu told President Biden this weekend that he does indeed want a hostage deal, despite what some are reporting in the Israeli press. We see the CIA director in Cairo and we're hearing these things about a deal, difficult but also constructive. Do you think there's any chance of a deal for hostages? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCE EUROPE: Well, certainly, I hope so. I mean, you think of the families and the people who are worried about these hostages, what they're going through, the huge risks that are there. And then, of course, the special operators who go in to rescue some of them. So I hope that the negotiators are successful. But for me, the biggest problem is the Netanyahu government. I think that their unwillingness to work in good faith towards a regional, broader two-state solution is what makes this so extremely difficult.",
