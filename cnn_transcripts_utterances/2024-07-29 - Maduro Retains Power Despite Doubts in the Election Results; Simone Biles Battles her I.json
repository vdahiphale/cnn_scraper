That is according to the country's National Electoral Council.The government-controlled council reports Maduro won more than 51 percent of the vote with more than 80 percent of the votes counted. Now this marks Maduro's third consecutive six-year term. Maduro suggested there would be bloodshed if he lost but sang a different tune after being declared the winner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I said it, there was peace before and there was during and we have it and there will be peace, stability and justice after the 28th of July starting from today. Peace, justice, respect of the law and justice. (END VIDEO CLIP) The leader of Venezuela's main opposition coalition rejected the council's results saying their candidate won 70 percent of the vote. Maduro's main challenger was opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, a former diplomat who the coalition rallied behind after their two preferred candidates were barred from running. Journalist Stefano Pozzebon brings us the latest from the capital Caracas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is how the Venezuelan opposition reacted. MARIA CORINA MACHADO, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): We want to tell all Venezuelans and to the entire world that Venezuela has a new president-elect and that is Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia. We won and everyone knows it, everyone knows it. I want you to know that this was something so overwhelming, so big, that we won in every sector of the country.",

Hezbollah itself says that it is pulling out of certain posts, certain areas. Of course it didn't provide details on that.It has denied responsibility for this attack but it's absolutely preparing for the possibility of retaliation. You also have warnings that are pouring in. Iran saying that Israel shouldn't take, quote, \"any new adventures in Lebanon.\" You had warnings as well from the Lebanese government saying of course they don't stand with Hezbollah in a broader sense but at this time that if Israel did attack Lebanon, the Lebanese government would stand with Hezbollah, that that would drag in the militias of the region from Iraq to Syria, all of these Iran-backed militias that could potentially be drawn into a wider conflict. But I also want to draw your attention again, Rosemary, just back to the original incident, back to the horrific attack that happened that killed 12 children and wounded more than 40 others among this tight- knit community, this Druze community that lives on the border that has for many years felt it is treated as a second-class citizens within Israel. Some members of the Druze community even requested that Israeli officials do not attend the funerals for fear that it would turn into a political event and that's exactly what has happened, Rosemary, is you have these small communities all along that region being dragged into a conflict that perpetuates, escalates and builds that fear of a wider war. But we've seen this possibility time and time again, Rosemary, over the last several years, more so since the October 7th attacks and time and time again everyone has pulled back from the brink. So there is hope with negotiation efforts on the table for Gaza and mediation efforts pouring in around the region and from the U.S. that these tensions can calm from a boil to a simmer.",

She's considering Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and even Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Vice President Harris has relationships with most of these potential candidates. But the question is, who can be a governing partner? Her vetting team is looking through the backgrounds of all of these candidates. And she, of course, I'm told, will begin weighing in with interviews. She hopes to have a decision by August 7. That, of course, will frame this race. Harris and whoever she chooses against Trump and J.D. Vance going into the final three months of this campaign, clearly too close to call.

So with less than 100 days to go until the election, polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris tightening the race against Donald Trump, taking it from a runaway win for the former president to a very tight race with no clear leader as yet. So how does Harris maintain this momentum and keep the honeymoon period going right up to the election?",

So the question of which side can fill in the picture, you know, more tangibly for voters in the next few weeks is going to be critical. The fact that she is as close to Trump as she is in this first blush, which don't forget is coming right after the Republican convention, which is usually the high point for a candidate, is encouraging to Democrats. But the question of who really fills in the blanks and defines her for voters, I think, is going to be absolutely critical over the next month.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So that was Joe Biden's only path to victory. He had fallen out of play in the four key Sunbelt battlegrounds of North Carolina and Georgia in the southeast, Arizona and Nevada in the southwest. And that was largely because his biggest problem in this election was how much ground he had lost among younger and more diverse voters since 2020. And those are all younger and more diverse states.Now, Harris, I think, without doubt, is going to regain at least some of the ground that Biden lost among younger and more diverse voters. The question is whether she regains enough to actually have a shot at any of those states, in particular, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona, since North Carolina seems a bridge too far, even for her. If she can put any of those states back on the board for Democrats, it would enormously ease the pressure on them in terms of reaching 270 electoral college votes. But if she can't, if she only does better in those states, but can't actually win them, then she is in the same position that Biden was in, which is that she has to sweep the three states that were formerly in what I once called the blue wall: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in order to get to 270. And Rosemary, those states, unlike the Sunbelt states, those states are not built for her strengths, they are older and whiter. And so she's going to have to show she can compete for those voters. The good news for Democrats is that those three Fox polls you mentioned all showed her running better than Biden did in 2020 among white voters without a college education. If she can really do that in November, she would be in a very strong position to win those states and thus in a very strong position to get to 270.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think the Republican Party was feeling extremely confident and Trump was feeling extremely confident about his prospects. There's really no other way to explain a vice presidential choice like J.D. Vance. I mean, J.D. Vance doesn't really bring any conventional political benefits in the near term. He was really more about stamping Trump's brand on the party and succession and so forth.So they felt that the race was locked into place, that their lead over Biden may have been small, but it was steady and that Biden had failed to dislodge negative impressions about him even after spending enormous sums in all of the swing states this year, really unrebutted by Republicans. Now you have a race that's much more unpredictable, that's much more fluid, where Trump's inroads among certain groups, particularly black voters and young voters, may be more at risk certainly than they were to Joe Biden. It is a new environment. It doesn't mean that Trump is now the underdog. I mean, Vice President Harris on Saturday acknowledged that she was still the underdog. And I think that's right in that Trump has more plausible pathways to 270s. But now he has to face someone who is much more effective than Biden was at making the core democratic case against Trump, that he's a threat to your rights, to your values and to democracy itself. And it is just a completely different race than it was a week ago.",

Rafael Nadal up against Novak Djokovic, one of the greatest rivalries, not only of this generation of tennis, but of all time.Here in Paris, the place where Nadal has had so many of the iconic memories and moments of his career. He's a 14-time winner at Roland- Garros. And we're at that period in his career where every singles match could be his last, although he keeps trying to play that talk down. That is the reality. He's booked his place in the second round against an old adversary in Novak Djokovic. Djokovic, for all that he has won in his career, 24 Grand Slam titles, he has never won an Olympic gold. And he's set his sights very much from the start of the year on getting his hands on a medal. It promises to be a fantastic occasion. We do have some question marks about whether Rafael Nadal's body is going to be able to cope. He said to me just a couple of months ago, he wakes up every morning and he just doesn't know what his body is going to do. On Friday, he carried a torch at the opening ceremony. On Saturday, he was playing doubles with Carlos Alcaraz. Yesterday, Sunday, he was in singles action and now four days running, he's back on court. But we know something and he's going to be giving it his all. And this last time they met actually here was two years ago in the French Open and it was Nadal who got the better of his great rival.",
