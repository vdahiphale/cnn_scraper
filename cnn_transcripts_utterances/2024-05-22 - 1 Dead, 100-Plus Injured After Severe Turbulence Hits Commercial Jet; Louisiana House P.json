Hospital officials in Thailand, where the plane made an emergency landing, said that 20 of those hurt are now actually an intensive care. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But once it is encountered, you have to maintain totally the airplane to maintain your assigned altitude possible.And to deviate from your designed -- from your assigned altitude from air traffic control, if necessary, to avoid over stressing the airplane. But these airplanes are designed, engineered, and built to very high standards to accommodate severe turbulence, plus a 50 percent margin of safety. So it's very unlikely that it's going to severely damage the airplane, but it certainly can injure people and make a mess of the cabin when things fly about.",

The Louisiana State House passing a bill to classify abortion-inducing drugs as controlled, dangerous substances.The Biden campaign warning this law is, quote, \"example of this dystopian agenda that Trump and his allies are pushing.\" Dr. Megan Ranney is joining us now to discuss. She's an emergency physician and Dean of Yale's School of Public Health. Great to have you with us, Doctor. I just want to start with the fact that the risk of death with Mifepristone is lower than that of penicillin. So medically, why would it need to be classified as a controlled, dangerous substance? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, DEAN, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, YALE UNIVERSITY: It doesn't. Not only is the risk of death less than penicillin, it's less than the risk of pregnancy. And let's be clear on what the Controlled Substances Act and this whole idea of scheduled drugs is about. It's about trying to unify federal drug laws to control medications that have high risk of addiction. Mifepristone and Misoprostol in no way, shape, or form have any chance of causing addiction, substance-use disorder, overdose, or any of the other things that all of the other medications under the Controlled Substance Act lead to. So this is pure legislative overreach that has nothing to do with the actual risk profile of the medications at hand. It's yet another example of legislators and politicians trying to get between women and physicians when it comes to allowing women to make the best choices for their own and their family's health.",

And this is just not proven to be that.A group of nearly 270 physicians, health care providers, medical students all signed a letter to the bill's sponsor, Republican State Senator Thomas Presley. And they wrote, in part, \"Neither Mifepristone or Misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\" To your point, Doctor. This drug has other uses outside of abortion. We do know that. I believe it can also be used sometimes in childbirth and in other situations.

We use it to manage high-risk pregnancies, to manage postpartum hemorrhage, which is a leading cause of maternal death. Let's note that Louisiana already has one of the highest maternal deaths and maternal injury or morbidity rates in the country. It gets an \"F\" from the March of Dimes in terms of its infant and maternal health outcomes. This is going to put more regulations in place that will make these medications harder to access, particularly in rural areas for safety net hospitals, thereby putting many more women and children at risk of bad health outcomes.",
