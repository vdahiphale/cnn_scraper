We know that the security situation on the ground has made it hugely difficult in some cases, impossible for humanitarian organizations to actually safely operate on the ground, particularly when it comes to aid distribution. What they're calling for now is for temporary cessation of violence and hostilities in order to allow for this vaccination campaign for more than 0.5 million children in the Gaza Strip to take place. They're focusing on children under the age of 10. The World Health Organization has confirmed that it has released availability to 1.6 million vaccine doses for the Gaza Strip. This is a health emergency, a real point of concern. And what we've heard from the U.N. secretary general is not only does there need to be a pause in fighting to allow this vaccination campaign to take place but he has said that the main, real goal here, the main vaccine, he says, to quell the spread of polio would be an immediate ceasefire.",

On Thursday, Donald Trump criticized the Democrats' handling of the economy in a news conference at his home in New Jersey.

Harris wants to help homebuyers tackle price gouging and work with states to cancel some medical debt.
