Welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world, I'm Rahel Solomon in this morning for Christine Romans. We begin this morning in London where President Biden is set to make his first visit to 10 Downing Street as president. He will meet one-on-one with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.The two are expected to tackle issues like the war in Ukraine, among other things before then heading to Lithuania for the start of tomorrow's two-day NATO Summit. CNN's White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president, and live in London. So, Arlette, what else is on the agenda today for this face-to-face meeting?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, President Biden will arrive here at 10 Downing Street for the first time in president -- as president in just a short while. They literally just rolled out the red carpet for the president's arrival. It will mark the sixth meeting that President Biden has had with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in as many months.The two men are expected to consult and talk ahead of that consequential NATO Summit in Lithuania starting tomorrow. Now, they will be discussing -- included in their agenda is discussions relating to the war in Ukraine. Of course, a hallmark of the U.S. and U.K.'s relationship has been providing that support and assistance to Ukraine throughout this war. But the meeting that President Biden is having here today does come at a pivotal time as the president just approved sending controversial cluster ammunitions to Ukraine. That is a type of weaponry that is opposed by over a 100 countries, including the United Kingdom. Rishi Sunak, just over the weekend had stated how the U.K. has signed on to a ban that prohibits the use of cluster ammunitions. Now, the White House has tried to downplay any type of rift with allies over this, saying that there are different ways that allies can provide support and weaponry to Ukraine. Now, in addition to the conversation about Ukraine today, we also expect the two leaders to discuss climate, technology and also China. And after the president finishes here at 10 Downing Street, he will travel over to Windsor Castle where he will meet with King Charles. This will be the first time the two men are meeting since the king's coronation in May. President Biden did not attend that coronation, instead sending his wife, first lady, Dr. Jill Biden. And as they are at Windsor Castle today, the president and King Charles will have the opportunity to discuss climate issues. That is something that has been a personal issue that King Charles has worked on over the years and President Biden has lauded him for his efforts when it comes to climate change. They will also be meeting with some philanthropists and investors relating to climate issues. And after these meetings here in the United Kingdom today, President Biden will travel on to the NATO Summit, where the future of the alliance will really be on display, as there are questions about when they might allow Ukraine to join the alliance. And also questions about whether Sweden will be accepted into the alliance, as there are some objections being put up by Turkey. But these are all shaping up to be very consequential issues that President Biden will be dealing with at this NATO Summit as he gathers with leaders in the coming days.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel, the stance of President Biden has actually also being echoed by the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg who has said that because in part of Article 5, Ukraine cannot join, well, it's in the middle of an armed conflict. And President Zelenskyy has said that he accepts that.You find that some other mainly eastern European nations are more bullish on this, the Lithuanian President, in fact, the host of the summit had said that he thinks it would actually improve Ukraine's battlefield chances if they were given a quicker path to NATO. The Estonian Prime Minister has said that it should be a question of when, not if, there's a delicate balance, of course, because if you say clearly to Ukraine or if it gets a guarantee that if this war ends or when this war ends, they will be granted accession into NATO. That then sets up an incentive for Russia to try to drag out this war, which is of course, something that no one wants. But Ukraine, the problem for Ukraine, is that really, their status as regards to NATO has been the same for the last 15 years when the alliance in 2008 said it welcomed their aspirations to join. They want some kind of advance beyond that. Some kind of recognition that did not work as a deterrent security guarantees, some clarity on that path to membership. Take a listen to how Zelenskyy approached this in an interview with \"ABC\" that aired on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  It would be an important message to say that NATO is not afraid of Russia. Ukraine should get clear security guarantees while it is  not in NATO. And that is a very important point, only under these conditions our meeting would be meaningful, otherwise, it's just another politics. I don't want to go to Vilnius for fun, if the decision has been made beforehand. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Witnessed these many meetings, the San Diego meeting recently with the Australia, United States, U.K. defense agreement. The nuclear submarine is frustrating. This was a big deal that the U.K. got pulled into that.Remember, for the U.K., they thought that President Barack Obama kind of favored Germany and France more than them. But this took that submarine deal away from France, and gave it to -- gave it to the U.K. So that was, you know, that was a significant thing, I think in terms of the relationship. But it's generally seen as a more stable situation right now. That there's a positive dialogue, that special relationship is still important, maybe not as special as the British would like it to be. And of course, that was something that Boris Johnson and Liz Truss also talked about a lot. But there is a very big and significant military inter-dependence, sharing of Intelligence, sharing of no-how, and working together very closely, particularly on the weapons for Ukraine. So, I think at the moment, it's seen as being in a good place, and I don't get the sense that the cluster ammunitions issue is something that's going to break that up at the moment.",

ROBERTSONbetween two men who clearly have a very common vision on the need to deal with climate change, the need to put into action some of the political decisions and statements that have been made. You know, President Biden was there at COP 26 in Glasgow. Interestingly, the U.K., the government has been judged by its own watchdog to be falling short of the climate change commitment that it has made over the past couple of years, which is an interesting position to be in. King Charles, this is something that he's been doing for many years. Paying an interest to that issue. Obviously, he's now king and he can't get involved in politics. But this is an area where he has a keen interest, so there's a lot of trust over there. So, the meeting will have this flavor of trying to find a way to broaden initiatives out of just government initiatives into the private sector and philanthropists as well, trying to find a way to -- you know, to broaden out, and get more money involved and more movement and momentum involved in dealing with climate change. And this is an issue here, but perhaps the king, and he would never say it, perhaps he's also looked at that reporting of the government's actions so far and feel somewhat let down. That's not something he would ever or could ever say.",

This video has been shared on Chinese social media. And one netizen called the attacker \"hateful, shameless and despicable\". And sadly, this is not the first time that school children in China have been targeted by knife-wielding attackers. In fact, in recent years, there have been a number of knife attacks targeting schools. In August last year, three people were killed and six wounded in a stabbing at a kindergarten in China's Jiangxi Province. And in June of 2020, 37 children and two adults were wounded in a knife attack spree at an elementary   school in southern China.
