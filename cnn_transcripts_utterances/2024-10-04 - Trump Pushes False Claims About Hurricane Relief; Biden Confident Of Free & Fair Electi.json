Also tonight, move over Reggie Jackson, because Mr. October is here. Barack Obama set to hit the trail for Kamala Harris, kicking off his campaign blitz, in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. And Oklahoma is looking to buy a Bible for every classroom. But not just any Bible. One with very specific requirements, actually, that only seem to describe the one Trump is selling. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump landed, in storm-ravaged Georgia, today, and almost immediately began lying about the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm to hit the United States mainland since Hurricane Katrina. As the southeast is still reeling from the deaths of 218 people at least, and immeasurable destruction, the former President falsely claimed there isn't enough money for hurricane relief. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: It's been a terrible response from the White House. They're missing a billion dollars that was used for another purpose. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yet, Trump is claiming that there isn't, because, according to him, that money is already being used to deal with the flow of migrants at the southern border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. TRUMP: We're missing a billion dollars. They gave them to the migrants that came in. And now we don't have the money. We'll do it. But they don't have the money to take care of. That's why they giving you lousy treatment, in North Carolina. Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants. They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank. They've given over a billion dollars to illegal migrants that came in. And now, they have no money. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That means that when Trump was president, he did exactly what he is accusing Biden of doing, taking cash from disaster funds to pay for migrant programs at the southern border. Now, all this is coming after Trump accused the administration of also going out of its way, to not help Republican areas, a notion that was debunked by Republican governors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA): I'm incredibly appreciative of the rapid response and the cooperation from the federal team at FEMA. GOV. BILL LEE (R-TN): There's a 100 percent federal money flowing in. GOV.

But to see other Republicans promoting this and amplifying this, when really it's just the appropriations process, at the end of the day, is quite something. T.W. ARRIGHI, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, VICE PRESIDENT, PUSH DIGITAL GROUP: Well, I think there's two different things here. Number one, a sitting governor is always going to want to keep the money flowing into their state, when their people are in need. Right now, we have 200-plus people dead, countless more missing. We have no idea. There are communities that can only be reached by helicopter. And we have legions of individuals doing it themselves instead of the United States military. And a lot of people are looking and saying, We're throwing all of this money to all of these new waves of migrants coming in, to a lot of different projects, throughout this country, to Ukraine and whatever. We can debate each of those individually, that's fine. But right now, the only policy proposal on the table, from the Harris agenda is $750 a family, and people think that's paltry.

GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LT. GOVERNOR, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think first of all, it's a sobering reminder of where the Republican Party is at right now, and how deep in the gutter we truly are, to think we're going to use this platform to politicize what the Mayor just said is one of the worst storms to hit this region ever, at least in any of our lifetimes.

And that's why he's sucking up to Brian Kemp. That's why he's playing the games he's playing. It's very interesting, looking at this picture here, who was in charge of the agenda today. And that was Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp stayed laser- focused, during that press conference on the hurricane and the relief efforts, and didn't disparage anybody, or -- in the federal government or state government. Donald Trump, at least during his prepared remarks, stayed on, on message.
