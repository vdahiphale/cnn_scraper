Massive crowds packed the streets of Tel Aviv late Sunday, part ofspontaneous protests that erupted after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sacked Yoav Galant. While these thousands of protesters aren't the only ones responding to that move, the Consul General of Israel in New York resigned. In the hours ahead, universities in Israel plan to go on strike, while the country's largest labor union is set to hold a news conference it promises will be dramatic. In a statement just released, Israel's president is calling on Netanyahu to halt the judicial reform process immediately. While Galant was the first member of Netanyahu's Cabinet to voice opposition to the judicial reforms. But now three other ministers, all members of Netanyahu's Likud Party, also suggest halting the plans. While Israel's former prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is also now calling on Netanyahu to suspend the judicial reform and wants him to withdraw the dismissal of the Defense minister.

Maybe he's actually going to take a step back from where he's been heading.But in the end, he basically doubled down and said, yes, I'll be sure to safeguard civil rights, but I'm moving ahead with my judicial reform. I think what we saw last night when he fired Yoav Galant, the defense minister, was basically a decision by Prime Minister Netanyahu. He is moving ahead with the legislation. They plan to bring it this morning to finalize the piece of legislation in the Knesset, the Parliament's Committee, and finalize it and prepare it for a vote on Wednesday when it will be brought for a second and third reading. That's the final voting process in the Israeli Knesset. And the reason to fire Galant, I think, is basically to send a shot across the bow and to create a deterrent to tell any other member of the coalition, if you dare cross me, if you dare violate your commitment to my judicial reform, I will fire you. And that is meant to get other people who might be considering doing this in the Parliament to back off.",

They did not say that they would not, as Galant said, give their hand towards or in support of this legislation. So I have yet to hear of any other possible public dissenter. There are people who are behind the scenes murmurs of opposition within the ranks of the coalition, but those people have yet to come forward. I'm not sure -- I mean, this, you know, the firing of the defense minister could go both ways, right? It could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and gets coalition members to say, wow, the prime minister has really lost it. On the other hand, we know that politicians tend to be concerned about their own future before maybe the future of the people.

Putin added that a storage facility is scheduled to be completed by July.So by the summer, potentially, these small but powerful battlefield weapons could be deployed. But while Putin's frequent references to Russia's nuclear missiles and weapons are alarming for the rest of the world, they don't necessarily mean that we're taking a step closer to Armageddon. Much of this may be for domestic consumption. To show Russians that Putin still has the initiative, when actually progress on the battlefield has been pretty stagnant. Certainly, the U.S. State Department has reacted calmly to the announcement saying they don't see any reason to adjust their nuclear posture, nor any indication that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. Where this Russian decision will be felt though, is Belarus, Moscow's ally in what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Putin made it quite clear that the tactical nuclear weapons will not simply be handed over to Belarus, but would remain under the command and control of Moscow. And what that means is that Russia will likely be stationing even more of its troops there, slowly but surely moving into Belarus, gradually tightening its grip over that country.

China has been aggressively moving in with business deals and investments onto the African continent at the same time that the perception has been that Washington has essentially been stepping back, certainly since the Trump administration disengaging in some places diplomatically, financially. And so this is really an effort by the Biden administration to make good on some of the promises they've made in the first two years, to really re up the relationship level with African countries, to try to drive investment and to try to give Africans more of a voice at the international table where decisions around climate change, debt relief, counterterrorism, where those kinds of decisions are being made.

No, I think at this time, all tactical nuclear weapons are thoroughly far away from the point where they could be used. They are all safely in storage in the storage sites today in Russia, but well, maybe at some point in the future, there will be an additional storage site in Belarus.

Now this is something Beijing would never acknowledge publicly. That's something actually they have accused Taipei of doing but there have been precedents of small and often impoverished countries switching diplomatic recognition back and forth between Taipei and Beijing, depending on who offered them more money. And Taiwan officials have said Honduras had asked Taipei to provide them with billions of dollars in the form of foreign aid and forgiven debts. Now of course, many view this latest news as a reflection of Beijing's increasing clout, economic and political on the global stage. But this is also a sign of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's increasingly hardened rhetoric and policy towards Taiwan, the self-governing island the Communist Party here has never controlled but has nevertheless vowed to reunify with the mainland by force if necessary. It's really one of the most critically important piece in Xi Jinping national rejuvenation plan. But the interesting to hear to notice that even as Beijing intensifies its diplomatic squeeze over Taiwan, the island itself has become a very popular destination for western politicians to visit, especially legislators to show their support as it is increasingly being viewed on the front line in this global competition between democracy and autocracy. And on that front and major test is coming up in the coming days as Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-Wen is widely expected to meet with the U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the U.S. during her stopover as she visits some of the island's remaining allies in Central America.

Petroleum from PDVSA was siphoned off and sold on the black market. Well, the money didn't go into PDVSA's, according to the Venezuelan attorney general. Instead, cryptocurrency was used to line the pockets of individuals. Well, the attorney general says the exact amount of the money diverted is not yet known. But if convicted of the theft, those charged could spend up to 30 years behind bars. Do you know what time it is in Beirut right now? If your answer is no, then you're not alone.

And though no official explanation was given a video circulating on Lebanese media showing a conversation between the country's parliament speaker and the prime minister suggests the reason for the postponement may have been to allow Muslims to break their Ramadan fast an hour earlier.Lebanon's largest Christian church said it would not abide by the government's decision, saying it was made without consultation or consideration of international standards, a view shared by many Lebanese businesses, media organizations and schools which went forward with the time change, though many Muslim institutions still remain on winter time. Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines said it won't change its clocks but would adjust its flight times to keep in line with international schedules.

Board games are a booming business, with one estimate putting global sales at $19 billion a year and growing, but that means more cardboard boxes, more plastic tokens and paper cards.So a group of game publishers, designers and players has come up with what they call the Green Games Guide offering solutions to make the board game industry more sustainable in the years to come. Eric Zimmerman is one of the co-authors of the Green Games Guide. He's a game designer and an arts professor at NYU's Game Center in New York. So great to have you with us, Eric. Now, board games and the climate crisis, not exactly a connection that people might readily make. But explain why board games are not great for the environment. ERIC ZIMMERMAN, CO-AUTHOR, GREEN GAME'S GUID: Well, you're right that it is maybe not a connection that everyone would make. But I think that the climate crisis is something that is really affecting the whole globe. When you look at other forms of design and production if you're talking about the fashion industry or the construction and building trades, there's a lot of initiatives going on in those industries to try and figure out how can we change practices? How can we change what we're doing in order to make our products more sustainable. And in the tabletop game industry, and we're talking about card games and board games that you would play at home with your friends on a tabletop, there really wasn't anything comparable. And so we are a group of, you know, passionately concerned tabletop game players and producers who want to figure out how we can improve things for the tabletop game industry. So the Green Games Guide, it's a publication that's online for free, and it's our first pass at really trying to think about how can we make a difference and how the game industry, the tabletop game industry can change?",

So you're not coding those paper and products with plastic to figuring out hey, maybe I don't need to have little plastic figures. Maybe I can have pieces in my game that are made out of more sustainable materials.It also goes to the design of the game itself that we can think about games that are maybe not gigantic, large, heavy objects that make a lot of -- that have a much bigger carbon footprint in terms of when they're shipped. So it goes to everything from what's inside the box to what's outside the box to the way that the box is designed.",

We had so many wonderful examples of companies that are already very much at the forefront of this and making change.And just to give you a few examples, Clarkson Potter they are the game imprint of Penguin Random House, the giant book publisher. They recently switched to using only FSC certified paper and pulp. So they're really doing all of that stuff that keeps, all of their paper. And they're trying to eliminate plastic entirely from their games. Wingspan which is a lovely game by Elizabeth Hargrave recently re- published the very popular game about butterflies. And they redesigned the whole game to make it much more sustainable. Of course, that game is about nature and it made perfect sense for that particular title. (INAUDIBLE) Games as a game publisher out of Japan, and they are known for doing lovely, beautiful little tiny card games that are exquisitely designed. And they can help us think about flipping the script on the idea that luxury means waste. So I think what's interesting about the Green Games Guide is that we're not just talking about the material science, although that's a big part of what we're trying to do. We're also trying to change the culture of games. We're trying to rethink what does good design mean. Good design doesn't have to mean something that is wasteful. Good design can also mean something that's good for people and good for the planet, is efficient and takes things like social sustainability and labor practices into account as well. So the Green Games Guide is trying to tackle all of that. So far, we've had a really good response. The guy just came out were very excited about sharing it. And I'm working with an amazing group of people to help get this document and this information out into the world.",
