And so now that they have started causing trouble there, you know, what we're seeing Biden do is now he's like, uh oh, we're going to go put the terrorist designation back on them. And now, even if you put the sanctions back on Iran, it's going to take a while to do that. And so our goal should always be how do you prevent war? That's the number one thing.

OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Well, again, she emphasized that the U.S. is not a racist country. I think this is to placate the MAGA movement. I mean, she did admit that growing up as a daughter of Indian immigrants, she has experienced racism. But I think she was trying to cater to Trump's base by saying these types of things. She also catered to Trump's base by saying that she could possibly pardon him, if that was necessary. And then she also explained why he's attacking her at the moment. She says that this is because he's insecure. I think she tried to highlight her strengths that she would be stronger on foreign policy, comparing herself here to Joe Biden. Ultimately, she always does fine in these situations in either the debates or the town halls that we've seen thus far. And she is more truthful than Trump, but sometimes inaccurate and she's trying to make the case that she will attract a wider range of moderate and Democratic voters which Trump was trying to say this is a weakness and she says this is actually a strength and this is how you win.

There's never been a Republican candidate that has lost both Iowa and New Hampshire and then went to go on to win the nomination. And everything is really going for her here. She has a state that has a lot of libertarian and independent voters, and the independents can vote in the primary. There's a lot of well-educated and affluent voters in New Hampshire, and that tends to be or has been her base. It's not a particularly religious state, and she doesn't do very well with evangelical voters. She's got the support of Governor Chris Sununu.

At a high level, the team is arguing that this would disenfranchise voters, potentially unleashing chaos and bedlam if other states and state officials follow this pattern.Now, I will note that chaos and bedlam, those are words that Trump has used in the past that have in part incited violence. The Trump legal team's constitutional arguments are extensive. They argue that this particular section of the Constitution does not apply to presidents because it does not specifically say that it applies to presidents and that presidents are not officers of the United States. Now, they also insist that Trump did not engage in an insurrection. That's interesting because it is highly unlikely that the high court is going to want to take up that question of whether what Trump did in and around January 6 was an insurrection. Instead, it is expected that they are going to focus on constitutional interpretation and providing clarity to the states. Now, they also insist, the Trump legal team, that this section requires Congress to enforce it, not state officials. They also say that it only prevents you from holding office, not running for office. At this point, though, it's unclear exactly how the Supreme Court is going to approach this case. They have not laid out a set of questions they intend to answer, but it is expected that this will probably be a narrow ruling, that the Chief Justice will try to build consensus, especially at a time that the High Court is under such scrutiny for politicization.

Netanyahu, though, is also under his own unique set of pressures, and some of them stem from the fact that his governing coalition is made up with far-right hardliners, many of whom never wanted or supported a two-state solution in the first place. One former Israeli diplomat to the United States, said that look, Netanyahu's comments are catering to a domestic audience, to his core supporters at home. Obviously, President Biden has some options as to how he could respond. He could call Netanyahu out, he could put conditions on American aid to Israel, but so far it seems like American officials are more content just to brush this off and to say that look, Netanyahu has made these kind of comments in the past and he's walked them back to a more neutral position later on and so they don't expect that this is going to be the final word on this issue. We also heard yesterday from the chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, who had a closed-door meeting with the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and he said that, look, he is well aware, he does not deny that there are serious challenges when it comes to the prime minister's position on this, but he thinks that when the dust settles, when the war is over, that there will be more of a clear path to get some kind of a peace. And Kim, I should also mention that Netanyahu, when he made those comments, was responding to a question about NBC News reporting that Israel had rejected a Saudi deal that would have normalized relations in exchange for a path to the Palestinian state.

It's the first U.S. spacecraft to attempt a lunar landing in decades. It's been a setback for NASA and astrobotic technology whose goal was to eventually transport a crew to the moon. Astrobotic posted the last images captured by Peregrine showing a stunning view of Earth with a sliver of sunlight around it. A number of countries have attempted to land on the moon since 2000 with mixed success as you can see there. Joining us now is Sian Cleaver, Orion European Service Module Industrial Manager for Airbus Defense and Space. And her company helped to design and manufacture the legs for the lander. Thanks so much for joining us here. So it never got to use those legs in the end. Take us through what we know about what went wrong.",

But nevertheless, we will fly again on the next astrobotics mission, which is coming later this year, with the same landing system. So at the moment, it's still not 100 percent clear what went wrong on the Peregrine mission, although the engineers seem to think that it was a valve that leaked and caused an over pressurization of the tanks which ultimately led to the mission having to be changed in some way, let's say they, I mean, they weren't able to land on the moon, but I understand that a number of their scientific instruments on board were able to collect data.

And if you talk about going to the moon, especially landing on the moon, I mean, the moon's gravity is about a sixth of what we have here on earth. It's a harsh environment. It's difficult to land. It's a little bit different to Mars where we can use parachutes to slow our spacecraft down. We have to rely on engines when we're landing on the moon.So it's difficult. It's not easy. And yes, you're right. I think the statistics are just over 50 percent of the missions that have gone to the moon have been successful. But don't forget of those six attempted crewed missions to the moon, all of those were successful. And I guess it's a little bit different in that respect. I mean, we're talking here about an uncrewed mission. It was a spacecraft that went to the moon with scientific instruments on board. And it's a little bit different when you're designing and building those. Yes, you have redundancy in your systems, but you don't have quite the level of redundancy that you do have when you're sending a crewed mission, for example, like the Orion spacecraft to the moon. There we have really, really stringent requirements and that's why these things take so long. Safety is our number one priority.",

They managed to redirect it towards Earth and safely dispose of it in the Earth's atmosphere. I think that's pretty impressive.And then of course, like any of these missions, there will be an extensive review phase, looking into all the data, trying to work out exactly what went wrong. And then of course, corrective measures. This is always, this is standard practice in the space industry. We do a thorough lessons learned campaign after or during and after every single mission. And no doubt there'll be a number of changes made, particularly to their next lunar lander, which is due by the end of the year. There'll be significant changes there to make sure that this problem never happens again.",
