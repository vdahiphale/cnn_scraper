What led to this point with the Democrats in trouble, the Republicans looking ascendant? First it was red wave and then things seemed to change. Polls suggested Democrats were surging, I guess, doing better than expected. The red wave talks were sort of overblown. But now it seems as though regular election gravity has reasserted itself.

Then some other issues percolated and it's back to the economy again.That's really the story of the election and I think it's what's going to dominate. While I don't think inflation by itself is going to sink Democrats, it's really a problem they haven't been able to solve. First Biden said inflation was going to be transitory. Now he's trying to blame other culprits -- COVID-19, price gouging, the war in Ukraine. There may be some merit to all of those justifications. But polls show voters are upset. All of this, I think, was exacerbated to some extent by the policies that the Democrats pushed or at the very least some policies they put forward, like the Inflation Reduction Act. It's true unemployment remains low, around 3.5 percent; consumer confidence is still fairly high. So there are some countervailing pressures on the economy. But inflation hits everyone and the majority party is going to get scapegoated and I think that's what this election is going to be about.",

Joe Biden has a Senate that's split 50-50. So any legislation he's going to get through is going to need a compromise. We saw that with some other policies the administration has put forward. But despite that, there's some on the Left that just always want more and they think, well, Democrats hold the Senate, they hold the House of Representatives.We should be able to get through what we want. That's really not the reality. At the same token, some of these big spending items, some of the focus of the administration has certainly angered and, in many cases, outraged Republicans. So they're certainly united against this administration and so, for Biden, that's reflected in relatively low poll numbers and about the 40 percent, 41 percent range.

Democrats tend to have tunnel vision around certain issues -- abortion, voting rights, January 6. I think that's a strategic error. My perception of the Democratic Party is some leaders try to tell voters what they should care about. In this case one of those is abortion. Typically the priorities are those of only strong progressives. They don't represent the views of most Americans. The Republicans seem to be much better at finding out what voters think is salient -- inflation, immigration, crime, et cetera. And that's largely why the tide has turned in their favor.",

There seemed to be a real strategy here that the defense is trying to show his gentler side, when the jury has seen quite the opposite throughout the prosecution's case. Remember, this is the second person to testify in the defense's case. We also heard a new wrinkle from Rhodes about his thoughts on the 2020 election. Prosecutors showed the jury early on this open letter he wrote to president Trump, that anyone could have read at the time before the January 6th attack on the Capitol. In that open letter, he asked president Trump, he basically demanded or begged president Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and not to concede to president-elect Joe Biden. But when Mr. Rhodes testified on the stand in his own defense, he explained it differently. He said that he did not believe that Donald Trump nor Joe Biden won the election in 2020 because, in his mind, he said, the presidential election itself was unconstitutional.
