Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, no more debates. Trump making it clear moments ago that he will not face off against Kamala Harris again. Here's what he said, just moments ago at a rally in Arizona.

Tonight at that rally in Tucson in Arizona, he spent 20 minutes -- actually a little bit more than 20 minutes going over every question- answer from the debate, re-litigating it. And there's a reason for this obsession. The first debate poll is out. No doubt he's seen it. It finds 53 percent of voters, say Harris came out on top. That 53 percent is notable in U.S. politics. But what stands out the most is the 24 percent, only 24 percent say Trump won. And when asked, who stumbled or didn't appear sharp, more than half, 52 percent said Trump which may be because of remarks like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This appears to be more than just the debate, because now when you look among registered voters and the actual support who they're going to vote for an Election Day, 47 percent support Harris to 42 percent for Trump. That is a five-point advantage. Yes, it's tight. It comes to down to the swing states, but five points in American politics is a chasm.

David Plouffe, a senior campaign adviser now for Harris, called Trump chicken man today, right? They're trying to bait him into doing it.Do you think, Erin, that this is a hard and fast no at this point or could he suddenly change his mind? ERIN PERRINE, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  The likelihood he changes his mind a few more times is pretty high knowing Donald Trump and his history. If polls start to move, there seems to be an opportunity, if they continue to goad him, his response very likely could change to yes, I want to have the debate and then go back to no when negotiations move or whatever happen. But however that shakes out, the debate regardless of if Donald Trump does that or not, we're in the homestretch now. And as their crisscrossing into all these battleground states, what we saw come out of that debate right now, we're seeing maybe marginal movement, but you've got to get into these battleground states now and have these conversations with voters, not only at rallies and at debates and on those big TV moment, but at the doors, via text message, on their emails because now it's turnout time and they cant be wasting it, arguing over debates.",

My sense is Pennsylvania is still state she has to win, but if she doesn't, she needs to make up for it somewhere, and it is going to take a lot of resources, both in terms of media, but especially in terms of getting out the vote, paying for the organizational activities you need to need, to make -- to make this come home.

At that point, if she becomes the change candidate maybe you can start making the argument about age that she's -- as she's saying, the new generation of leadership.

And I think the real implications of this last debate is it for the first time, you saw these two candidates side by side, and one was able to very articulately argue the case for Democrats, and really prosecute the case for Democrats, which is something they'd been craving. Donald Trump was simply unable to do it. And so, I really think that people are now seeing a different Donald Trump. Donald Trump is in decline and age only goes one way.
