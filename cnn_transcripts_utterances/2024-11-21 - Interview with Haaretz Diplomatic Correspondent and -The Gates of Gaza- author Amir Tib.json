So, what does this mean for Israel and its regional war? I ask Israeli journalist Amir Tibon. Then, former U.S. ambassador for War Crimes Issues David Scheffer lays out the legal ramifications. And as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 44,000 and civilians there face widespread hunger and disease, humanitarian Arwa Damon joins us from the ground. Also, ahead, a certain idea of America. Author Peggy Noonan tells Walter Isaacson about her collection of columns, exploring the essence of the United States over the last 25 years. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga, New York City, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. In a groundbreaking move, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. The court says both men bear criminal responsibility for causing mass shootings. starvation in Gaza. This is the first time the ICC has targeted the leader of a democratic country and a close ally of the United States. Every member of the ICC, which includes the U.K. and many European countries, are now legally obliged to arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu if he sets foot on their territory. That's more than 120 countries. The court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military leader Mohammed Deif for crimes including murder, torture, rape, and hostage taking. Israel says he was killed during an airstrike earlier this year. The court was also seeking warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh, but they are now dead. Christiane broke in the news of the ICC's plans back in May. Here's what the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, told her then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You hear the leaders of the opposition, Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz, alsodenouncing this decision, and former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett joining rather strongly against the ICC. But the question is, what can Israel do now? And on the legal level, there is an option to appeal. Maybe Israel will try that, of course, by appealing you give legitimacy to the decision. So, that's a big question, if you even want to go down that route, and the chances of success are not very high. The other option that Israel will certainly try is to get the United States to apply a lot of pressure and pain on the ICC. And the United States is not committed to the ICC. And we've already heard senators from both the Republican and the Democratic Party in the U.S. is threatening to put sanctions on the ICC as an institution and on individuals who were involved in this decision, whether it's the prosecutor, Karim Khan, or the judges and others. But there is a question of whether that pressure will actually lead to a change in the result, which is the issue of these arrest warrants and the fact that more than 120 countries are going to respect them. That's a big if. You would need the U.S. to exert a lot of pressure on the court itself, and that could also backfire. The court could say, well, we are not going to let anything ruin our independence. And the other option is that the U.S. would approach these countries individually and tell them, if you respect the decision of the court and you go along with respecting these arrest warrants, there will be consequences to your relationship with the United States. And then, what would happen is that the ICC, as an institution, would no longer be relevant because if the arrest warrant for Netanyahu is not being honored in France, for example, then the arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin, which was issued a year and a half ago, could not be valid in a different country that wants closer relations -- closer relationship with Russia. And I have to remind you, the ICC is also conducting investigations right now regarding Venezuela, Sudan. So, this is a very complicated situation. And whatever, you know, happens next, it's not going to be an easy solution out of this for Israel. Even if you see massive American pressure, it could take time to have an impact and it will have its own consequences on other priorities of the United States.",

And yet, that wasn't enough to have the ICC come up with a different solution. These arrest warrants have now been made public. What does Israel -- what are their legal options in terms of just appealing it?

So, the debate here in Israel, before this news broke out for several months, revolved around the question of how does Israel actuallyinvestigate the war in Gaza to prove to the ICC, and by the way, also the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, in the Hague that there is no need for them to intervene because any reports of potential war crimes are being investigated very seriously within our system. And while the urgency of this was presented to the government by our attorney general and by the head legal officer of our military, you didn't really see action, at the end of the day, to try to convince the world that actually these things were being taken very seriously inside Israel. And you can see, for example, the example that happened, I think, in March, when you had seven workers of the World Central Kitchen organization killed in Gaza accidentally by the IDF. And back then, because most of them were foreign nationals, including, I believe, a British citizen, Australian citizen, and there was a lot of pressure from the United States, Israel immediately took action, two officers who were involved in this incident were removed from the IDF, there was a serious investigation, and that was a case that showed what Israel could do in order to try to push away pressure or criticism around its conduct. The attorney general was really pleading with the government to do much more on that front and to give many more examples like that and to set up a National Commission of Inquiry into the October 7 failure, but also into the conduct of the war, there was a lot of debate about it, and eventually it never happened. So, I think the attorney general will have a bit of a told you so moment in front of the government, but it doesn't really matter at this point because the damage has been done.",

So, that's -- I think there will be some kind of a short-term impact. But I think after that kind of cools down, there will also be a lot of hard questions about how did we get here and did certain statements, certain decisions by our own politicians, especially the more far-right elements of this government contribute to this international attack, you can say, on Israeli legitimacy. And there will be hard questions about the warnings from the attorney general and how they were treated by the government. And in general, I think every Israeli is going to ask, how can -- a year after October 7, the biggest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and after the first few weeks when the whole world really stood up to support Israel and we had just an air train off world leaders coming here all the time, how did we get to a place where today we are so isolated?",

The problem here is that the Gaza war is on the territory of a state party, the State of Palestine, as recognized as such by the court and by, you know, more than 140 countries, the State of Palestine.

We found that in our relationships with those countries that was so damaging to our own national security interests that those sanctions were lifted under the law. There are no longer any economic or military sanctions under that particular law because it was determined it's simply a losing proposition for the United States and all of its many security equities and economic equities that it has around the world. In this case, if there are sanctions, let's say, you know, just as was earlier, you know, years ago against the prosecutor, Bensouda, at the time of the ICC. The problem with doing targeted sanctions like that against individuals, for example, is that so many governments, which the United States is allied to, is a friend to, they will oppose those sanctions and it complicates our interests with those countries. It's a sort of superfluous unnecessary irritant in the relations between the United States and so many countries around the world, which are party to the Rome Statute of the United -- of the International Criminal Court.

We're in a situation right now where the humanitarian sector in and of itself is on life support. And look, we're not going to put our tools down on our own, but we might end up forced into that position quite simply because we're not going to have any tools left. We're not going to have anything left to be able to offer the population here. The U.N. actually sent a letter to COGAT highlighting that insecurity, the lack of supplies, and the impact of Israeli strikes on certain locations right after humanitarian missions have carried out activities. There are dropped off supplies are severely damaging and is strongly urging, you know, Israel to take this very seriously, but it's not -- you know, no one's really all that optimistic that it's going to make that much of a difference, because where do I start to even begin to try to describe this situation if we take even the simplest thing? You know, school books for children, notebooks and pencils. You think that that would be easily brought into Gaza so that we can provide kids with at least basic supplies in these makeshift tents that they're attending, you know, classes in, but we can't. Bringing in a notebook and a pencil is extraordinarily difficult. Bringing in tarps or even finding tarps in Gaza to be able to provide extra protection against the rains that we're all expecting to have coming is extraordinarily difficult and very, very hard to find. And speaking of the rain, we're expecting flooding to happen when the rains do come. And a lot of these, you know, makeshift tented areas in these camps that have cropped up are in low lying areas. So, they're going to get flooded. Only they're not going to just be flooded with rainwater, they're going to be flooded with sewage and waste. And we've been asking the Israelis and locating different alternative sites that, you know, sewage and waste could potentially be moved to, but all of those sites get rejected. There are water wells in Gaza City that could potentially be brought back online. But, you know, organizations are unable to do that because the well also happens to feed an area like Jabalya, which Israel has effectively been besieging, a siege within a siege, and bombing very, very intensely. I mean, I could go on and on and list all of the examples of just how Israel is crippling humanitarian operations here.

He had then, something that Reagan had that Trump does not have, is that Reagan, since the 1960s, actually -- meaning 20 years before he was president, was seriously emerging as the conservative voice of the brand-new conservative movement in America. So, he knew his stuff. He knew what he wanted to say. He knew what quote from the founders he wanted to use. You well know, Donald Trump, of course, has been none of that and has done none of that. He is a man with a completely different background who now and then showed an interest in politics and now and then would go make a speech, but he was not the voice of a real philosophical thing. And mostly his sound. I mean, you have to give credit where it's due, his sound is utterly genuine to him. He doesn't try to hide much in a way, you know, he tells you, this is what I'm going to do. This is why. We'll figure out the details later, but this is what we're doing. He has more the blunt and perhaps uncontexted sound of modern America.",

And what struck me when I read the famous first sentence of his memoir is, all of my life, I've had a certain idea of France. It was so simple. And he explained that it was in one part emotional, and in one part based on rational thought. And I will never forget seeing that sentence and thinking, do you know that's -- not to compare myself to De Gaulle, of course, which I don't, but that was true of me also. All of my life, I've had a certain idea of America of it's for all its problems, all its flaws, all its failures it was a good nation, a unique force in the world, a new thing in the history of man based on a new thought, all people are equal here under the law, and wherever you start does not dictate where you will wind up. And to me, this is not a benign -- a gauzy feeling about America, this is a truthful, factual feeling about America. And I do think -- not to go too long here, I think the balance of our national conversation about our country has, in the past 10 years, skewed more towards the painfully shamed. And I just think, whoa, guys, we got to reorder this a little bit. We got to rebalance here. I feel very protective about America.",

There are a lot of families in America that don't work and are not so successfullybringing up kids with order and love, this has always been true in America. We're an America of displaced people, always pushing off somewhere else. And we've had interesting parenting styles. But when I was a kid in America in the '50s and '60s, coming from a somewhat turbulent family, I always was allowed to have the feeling, Walter, that what is in the family is this, but when I open the front door, I go into America, and it's a good place and it won't be unkind to you based on your sex or your race. It will be accepting of you, and good to you. What I fear is that, in the past, I don't know how long, 10 or 20 years, we have left kids from turbulent homes thinking, I am not safe here. And guess what? I just opened the front door to go out, and I'm not safe there either. It's a rather wicked place. This is actually something that has been on my mind as a working writer for decades. And I feel we're selling those poor kids short and we've got to give them a different vision so that they understand they can have a chance here and they can rise here and they can be accepted here and they can be part of this big project that we have. So, that has been very much on my mind.",

I have a theory about COVID, which is that it turned into a class divide, and there was certain class of people, usually the working class people, who had to go to work and were appalled by all the lockdowns and the restrictions. And then, there was sort of an overclass, a meritocratic class who said, follow the science. And that divide became a political divide as well that was reflected in this election.",

You know, in one I said, and I actually just think this, working class folk who have tough lives and have to stock the shop right and drive the truck, they can be pretty tough about life, you know? In part, because they probably came from a certain amount of toughness. So, they see this terrible germ coming and they know it's trouble and they're wearing the mask, but they're also seeing the lap top class, that's me and you, staying home and, what, being detached from their real lives and detached from their need to simply live their lives, and I think maybe detached from a certain commonsense and attached too much to this sort of, we know the science, we're the superior folk stuff, and I thought it was painful and I didn't like it. And yes, we're still working it out. I think part of the story of the 2024 election, I've never seen it reflected in a poll, it's only my hunch, is that the American people, a lot of them wanted to say, to look at the years 2020, 2024 and say goodbye to all that.
