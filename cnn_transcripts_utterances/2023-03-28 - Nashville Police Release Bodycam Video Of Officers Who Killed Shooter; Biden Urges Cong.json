That was a bit of a surprise for prosecutors because the grand jury is usually it's a prosecutor's show, they call the shots.It was unexpected that the Trump legal team asked for this witness to go before the grand jury. Then they brought one witness. It's unclear if they will bring another one. But we absolutely know from our reporting that they did have concerns following Costello's appearance about how they would button this up. And right now, it's unclear if Pecker is the only witness that they'll bring to rebut that testimony. Watch wait and see.",

You know, starting on December 5, Donald Trump raised the issue with Pence of changing the outcome in the Electoral College. And that pressure continued like a vice squeezing Pence, culminating in the conversation that Paula referenced on January 6 itself.So that is very important proof of the toughest issue in any criminal case, Wolf. President Trump's intent at the time to overturn the election, I think it's very important. Another big win for Jack Smith.",

That's what the Constitution says, but that wouldn't relate to conversations he had with Donald Trump weeks before he showed up in the chair to preside on January 6.I think it's a Solomonic decision, Wolf, and I think it's one that will hold up on appeal if it is as we think, since the actual details remain under seal.",

Now keep in mind that for instance, beginning last September, Wolf, the Russians changed their tactics and were really focusing on Ukraine's ability to generate power, power that provides electricity and warmth to the population during the harsh Ukrainian winters.But the Ukrainians for one thing, their ability, their air defense capabilities have drastically improved and they have also proven very adept at sort of solutions to the situations created when that infrastructure was hit. So now the Russians seem to be changing their focus, focusing on military targets but in the process we're seeing civilians, more civilians are being killed. Now yesterday in Sloviansk, two civilians were killed, more than 30 people injured when there was a strike on that town. Now, it just so happens that the strike also hit a military recruiting center. So they are focusing more on supply lines, military infrastructure, but in the process, many people are being killed. Now, as far as the battle in Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian land forces says that their focus at the moment is try to, in his words, destroy as many of the enemy as possible and prepare for a counter, or rather, create the conditions for a counter offensive. Fighting continues to be intense also in the town of Avdiivka, which is south of Bakhmut. There the Ukrainians say that the Russians are trying to wipe that town off the face of the earth.",

They're using it in Syria as well, so it's not surprising.

Very strong show of support for Ukraine.The Russians, obviously are quite angry about this. And there you're getting, you know, action in the Far East with last week there were strategic bombers. They used cruise missiles coming from a submarine. And I noted that the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Mr. Patrushev, said the U.S. is pushing Japan to militarize just like World War II. He says, and turn Japanese citizens into kamikazes. So this is, you know, more of the same, that it's all the United States behind everything, just as they say that the United States is, you know, trying to militarize Ukraine and use it to attack Russia. It's really, I think, again, it's a signal that they are worried, angry, and the battle is not going well.",
