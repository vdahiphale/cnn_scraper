But beyond hope, the recovery effort will need money and it will need manpower. For money, FEMA needs more. FEMA has told Congress in recent weeks that its disaster relief fund will go negative by September. And as for manpower, federal personnel on the island is now topping 1,000. According to FEMA, that includes more than 600 from the Defense Department and 140 from the coast guard helping with search and recovery efforts. 100 from the Army Corps of Engineers that are helping with infrastructure restoration, and 85 from Health and Human Services to help identify victims. As for victims and the number of those still missing, FEMA declined to update those official figures, deferring instead to local authorities and saying that the numbers remain very dynamic and very fluid in real time. Now, the big question for Washington remains, what it can do, if anything, to blunt the future impact of these extreme weather events?

So, let me walk you through what the normal booking process would look like here at the jail for a newly charged defendant, and that process would involve hours of waiting, simply waiting for their turn to get fingerprinted and get their mug shots taken. Also, there is typically a body search that is conducted by a jail deputy. Although in the past, the high-profile defendants who have voluntarily surrendered have been able to forego that body search. A medical screening also typically happens and a pre-trial consultation to determine whether it's appropriate for someone to be released without bond.
