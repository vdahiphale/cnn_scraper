But what we should have been focusing on here is the fact that these fly-ins of illegal aliens to different countries happening all over. And it's not just at the border, it's the fly-ins.And after 20 million illegals in Kamala Harris didn't say last night. And this is the important thing. Two-thirds of the country think we're going the wrong direction. Kamala Harris didn't say what she would do to stop that, didn't commit to stopping the fly-ins, didn't commit to what we do about the 21 million illegals already here. Here's why it matters. When they're here, Kamala Harris has said in the past she wants blanket amnesty for everyone. That'll bankrupt entitlements, it'll bankrupt health care with everyone getting free health care. And of course, we see with the housing crisis, where are you going to put another 20 million people? That's what Americans care about. It's not enough for Kamala Harris to come in and give the platitudes, she has to say where she's going a different direction. She simply failed to do so last night. If you're an undecided voter or someone who's on the fence, you had to see a willingness to a change in direction. Kamala Harris didn't do it.

Ralph Northam, and again, anyone can Google this, the former governor of Virginia said in the case of an abortion gone wrong, that they would be born, they would bring it in front of the doctors and then the parents along with the doctors would make a decision if they would keep that baby alive. I have the video clip pinned -- excuse me, not pinned, but on my social media timeline @JasonMillerinDC.

Possibly safe to say he may like her music even less now, because shortly after last night's debate, Swift posted to her 284 million Instagram followers that she's endorsing Kamala Harris for president.Swift first got off the sidelines in politics back in 2018 when she endorsed Democratic challengers in Tennessee elections, and then again in 2020 when she supported Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Her post seemed to reference this fake A.I. image that was posted on Trump's Truth Social account. She says, at this moment, quote, \"Brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter.\" And Minnesota Governor Tim Walz last night. was more than happy to accept this endorsement.
