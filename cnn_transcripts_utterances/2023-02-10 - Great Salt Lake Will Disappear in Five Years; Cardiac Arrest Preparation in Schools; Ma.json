They hit record lows in recent months, exposing around 800 square miles of lakebed. But unchecked water use and climate change aren't just threatening the birds and sail boaters. And here the western megadrought threatens a lot more than just snow sports, agriculture and industry. WEIR (on camera): Because this lakebed holds centuries of toxic runoff. Mercury, selenium, arsenic, some of it natural, some of it manmade mining waste. But if it turns to dust and adds to some of the worst air pollution in the country, this is a threat to the lungs of over 2.5 million people. BONNIE BAXTER, BIOLOGIST AND DIRECTOR, GREAT SALT LAKE INSTITUTE, Westminster COLLEGE: We've done this experiment in history before. We - we know about dust storms. We know about particulate pollution. We know about heavy metals and how they're bad for humans. This is an ecological disaster that will become a human health disaster.
