Three U.S. Army troops have been killed and more than 30 other service members injured after what U.S. officials say was an overnight drone attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan. This is near the border with Syria and Iraq. President Biden held a moment of silence during a campaign event in South Carolina earlier today and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Our team is following all these developments. Kevin Liptak is over at the White House for us with more on the president's response. But first, let's go to CNN's Natasha Bertrand who is here in the studio with me. Natasha, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Well, we are learning that three U.S. Army soldiers, they were killed in this attack, this drone attack that targeted a little known U.S. outpost in northeast Jordan right on the border with Syria called Tower 22. And it wounded as many as 30 other U.S. service members. And that number actually is expected to rise as service members continue to report symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury.And what the Biden administration is saying at this point is they do believe this was carried out by an Iran-backed militia. And we don't know exactly which one at this point. Some have claimed responsibility but the administration has not confirmed yet which group this actually was. But we know that several Iran-backed militants have carried out over 150 attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria just since October. So this is not a new phenomenon. But what is new, of course, is the fact that these attacks actually ended up killing U.S. service members for the first time since those attacks began. And so this is prompting obviously a very serious reaction from the Biden administration. President Biden vowing a response. Secretary Austin vowing to respond in a very serious way saying that it is unacceptable that U.S. forces have been killed here. But the question obviously now is what is that response going to look like. Is it going to be narrow or is it going to be broader in targeting Iran itself. The administration has taken great pains to link these attacks directly to Iran over the last several months saying that they have warned Iran through private back channels that they need to rein these groups in. But clearly those groups have not gotten the message.",

We did hear him speaking a little earlier today on a political trip in South Carolina. The president saying that it had been a tough day and saying we shall respond. In that statement he said the response would come at a time and in a manner of our choosing.And the president does now face quite a consequential choice on how he will respond to these attacks. And you have already seen some Republicans call on President Biden to strike directly inside Iran but at the same time there is this imperative inside the White House to prevent this conflict from spiraling out of control and from getting dragged into a direct conflict with Tehran. President Biden was briefed by his National Security team while he was on the road today, including the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan. And you can imagine in those discussions talk about how to craft a response that would be proportional and would deter some of these proxy groups from doing this again but at the same time not causing this conflict to spiral out of control. And at the end of the day this had been a fear among White House officials, that as these Iranian backed proxy groups continue to target troops inside Iraq and inside Syria that eventually it would result in fatalities. And now that those fears have been realized, certainly President Biden does have a decision to make about what to do going forward -- Jim.",

They can overwhelm with their missiles, ballistic missiles or their cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones. They can overwhelm the defenses of anyone in the Middle East, including us. And so we need to be aware of that growing effect.I'm also struck by how clever this attack was from the Iranian point of view. They hit Jordan. You know, the majority of the population in Jordan is Palestinian. It's very sympathetic to the Palestinians in Gaza. So this drives a wedge between the United States and the Jordanian regime. A lot of the population will support it. But it's also right next to the Tanf base in Syria which guards one of the major crossings from Iraq into Syria which the Iranians want in order to build a stronger land bridge from Baghdad to Beirut. So they're encouraging in a sense the Americans to withdraw, in addition to all of the messages about the Gaza conflict.",

So even though I do agree with your prior guest that Trump and co- defendants haven't produced any evidence yet about this improper relationship, there are still two big risks. One is that the motion for disqualification is granted, and although that doesn't result in a dismissal of the case, it results in a huge delay because then there is a state agency that has to appoint a special prosecutor. That could take a very long time. For Jones, the lieutenant government, who won a disqualification motion against Fani Willis 18 months ago. 18 months later there's still no special prosecutor. Even if Willis wins the disqualification motion issue, then Trump and his allies are going to appeal. We've been to this play before, right? ACOSTA: Oh, yes.",
