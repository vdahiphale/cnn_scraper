Donald Trump on social media posting that he will, quote, expose Kamala Harris during, quote, the debate. And that it will be quote, easier than Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. But, again, he called it a, quote, the debate. So, it means, it makes it feel a lot more likely this morning that we are headed towards a, quote, debate. Let's see.Harris, for her part, will have ample opportunity to respond, as she is soon going to be taking the stage in Michigan once again before taking the campaign out west on another battleground blitz. All of this as there's brand new polling, CNN poll of polls coming out finding that there is still no clear leader right now, Trump and Kamala Harris each holding 49 percent support in a head-to-head matchup. CNN's Arlette Saenz traveling with the vice president's campaign today. Okay, Arlette, so there is a debate, we think. What are you hearing?",

The campaign has long argued that it is Trump who has been moving the goalposts about these debates after initially committing to a debate against Joe Biden on September 10th with ABC News. So, we'll see how this debate about the debate plays out over the course of the coming days.But Vice President Harris is back on the campaign trail today with her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. They're here in the battleground state of Michigan before traveling to Arizona later tonight. The two will be out west to really introduce their Democratic ticket to voters and some of the key groups that they are trying to sway our Latino voters. This morning, the Harris campaign is out with a new ad trying to introduce in court Latino voters. And it comes at a time when polling has shown that Harris has actually seen an improvement among Latino voters compared to President Joe Biden. She currently has about 57 percent support from Latino voters. But I want to play for you a bit of the message that the campaign has for Latino voters today as they're preparing to head out west.

Both Harris and Walz will be speaking to rank and file members of the UAW at a union hall a bit later this afternoon. I'm told there's about, expected to be about 100 rank and file members in attendance.It comes at a time when Harris has earned the endorsement of UAW leadership. But she still could have some work to do when it comes to the actual rank and file members within these unions. You've seen former President Donald Trump try to make a play for those types of voters heading into this election. Those voters will be key here in a state like Michigan, which has a large auto industry and relies heavily on union support. So, Harris' focus today is trying to take her message directly to those rank and file members as she's looking to gain more support heading into November's election.",

Thank you so much for coming in and coming in early this morning from there on the West Coast.We've seen this new ad. It is going to run in English and in Spanish targeting Latino voters who, of course, are not a monolith. Why do you think Donald Trump has been able to try and grow support from Latino voters? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA):  Well, I think I'm not surprised that Donald Trump has tried to grow support amongst Latino voters. I just don't think he's actually done it. It was a narrative that we heard in the 2020 election, and it did not materialize. It was a narrative that we heard in 2022, and it did not materialize. And so here we are in 2024, tons of enthusiasm in the Latino community, particularly young Latinos about the Harris-Walz ticket. Sara, it's important to understand that there's projected to be 17.5 million Latinos voting this November's election. That's a growing number, a significant number, many in key states like Nevada, like Arizona. One in four are young people, voting potentially for the first time. So, it's a significant part of the electorate, not just today, but into the future, and there's enthusiasm around Harris and Walz.",

But, yes, border security and immigration in general is a concern to many people.Here's what we know. Numbers of people coming to the southern border, even those seeking asylum, are way down in recent months since a change of policy in the Biden White House. Kamala Harris was part of trying to address those root causes of the number of people coming to the United States. And the numbers are down, lower to where they were at the end of the Trump administration. Those are facts. That's real data. Here's what I know about Kamala Harris. Not only is she thoughtful in terms of a balanced approach, yes, we need to be smart about enforcement, we have to address root causes, but we can't forget about DREAMERs, farm workers, other long-term residents of the United States that have been here for years and years, contributing to the success and the strength of our country. Now, contrast that with the chaos and the fear that Trump has promised. He has said mass deportations beginning on day one. That would strike fear in communities across the country and do damage to our economy. So, the choice is very clear and I think the Latino community, everybody, frankly, is going to respond accordingly with our vote in November.",

So, this is what they're left with.Vice President Harris has not just done interview after interview over the years. She's been doing the job of vice president for more than three and a half years. You know, tremendous chapter in her career after having been a district attorney in San Francisco, after having been attorney general for the State of California, after having served in the United States Senate longer than J.D. Vance has even been in office, all right. So, let's be clear as to where the experience and the maturity lies, and she'll continue to do more interviews. You've got to cut her a little bit of slack for the last three and a half weeks, an unprecedented way to become the nominee for the Democratic Party. She's assembled a delegate to become the presumptive nominee. She has quickly vetted and selected a tremendous running mate in Governor Walz. We're preparing for the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and she's stumping. She's doing the day job and stumping in all the critical battleground states.
