For the first time, the man only previously known as \"employee number five\" in the Trump federal classified documents case is publicly going on the record about what he saw behind the scenes at Mar-a-Lago and how he ended up handling boxes of classified documents without even knowing it or having the clearance to do so. Trump employee number five is a man named Brian Butler. He has worked at Mar-a-Lago for 20 years. He wasn't just any regular employee. We should note. He handled the car service at Trump's Florida resort. Often directly making sure that Donald Trump and all of his belongings were moved from place to place. Meaning, he saw moments and movements and heard conversations that are now part of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Donald Trump. CNN's Kaitlan Collins, and Katelyn Polantz, are breaking the story for us and joining us now. Kaitlan Collins, let's start with you. So you sat down with Butler earlier today. What did he tell you?",

Jake, Brian Butler may not be a household name, but he is someone who is a central figure in the Mar- a-Lago classified documents case because he worked for Donald Trump for the last 20 years since he was 19 years old. And now he finds himself at the center of Jack Smith's indictment of the former president in the classified documents case. And is privy to key parts of that testimony that we read through in those indictments, he provided a lot of that testimony to the special counsel's team about key moments that now will likely potentially go on trial as soon as this summer in this case.One of those, Jake, that you're about to listen to is the moment that we spoke about, where Brian Butler told us about how he was on this day in June 2022, not knowing what exactly he was doing, but he was asked to help load boxes, banker boxes, on to Trump's plane at his airport in Palm Beach, Florida, as the former president was set to go to New Jersey. Now, what he did not realize that the time that was happening, then was Trump's team, his legal team was meeting with members of the FBI at Mar-a-Lago after they had just performed a search of that storage room looking for classified documents, which we now know based on the indictment. Of course, that Evan Corcoran, Trump's attorney, who was looking through those documents, Walt Nauta and others had moved many boxes out of that room. Now, Brian Butler, who is known and reference six times as Trump employee number five in the superseding indictment was asked to help Walt Nauta, who is Trump's body man, turned co-defendant, load those documents onto the plane. Here's what he told us about that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN BUTLER, \"TRUMP EMPLOYEE 5\": And then what happened is Walt left before me and he never goes directly to the plane. He's either in the motorcade when he goes there with the boss, which the former president. And I remember telling him he left the club with I didn't know what he had in his vehicle, but he waited for me at a nearby business. And I told him I would tell him when I was leaving Mar-a-Lago. So I left Mar-a-Lago. I texted him, hey, I'm on my way. He followed me. He pulled out and got behind me. We got to the airport. I ended up loading all the luggage I had and he had a bunch of boxes.",

He's refused to take any possible lawyer that the Trump team could provide him and used somewhat he knew separately as his way of setting him apart. And now his reflection upon this, upon in the past year, the FBI approached him in his driveway about a year ago, just this day, he's saying that Trump is dividing the nation, its divided relationships he's had with others and just now he's putting the puzzle pieces together here.",

But what he felt pressure on was the attorney and the reason this is so critical, there's a very clear divide when you look at this case of who has an attorney that is being paid by Trump world and who is paying for their own, and the divergent paths that they have taken on this.Obviously, Carlos de Oliveira, who was his very close friend that Kaitlan mentioned there, he has an attorney who is being paid for by Trump's world. He is someone who was indicted in that superseding indictment. And I should note that these two have not spoken since then. He was indicted in that for lying to federal investigators about what he knew and what he saw. Brian Butler on the other hand said that he faced repeated requests and attempts to try to keep him in that Trump fold when it came to having a Trump attorney itself. And so I think that is a critical distinction here, Jake, as we've seen, how people who leave this orbit and what happens to them. And one thing that I think is really important is this is just a regular person who was working at Mar-a-Lago for 20 years by happenstance of what he saw, what he witnessed, and what he was asked to do. He has become a witness in this investigation and had FBI investigators approach him and seek him out. And now he has spoken to them on multiple occasions, as he told me today during this remarkable sit down found that Katelyn Polantz and I have with him, he said that, yes, he is willing to testify if this goes to trial this summer.",

He is literally inside the room as Kaitlan just laid out. He's there when boxes are being loaded onto the plane.And one of the challenges for prosecutors here is explaining exactly where these documents were moved and when and by I whom. And this person can give us exactly why. Second of all, he's a person who appears to be unbiased. He doesn't seem to have any reason to have an ax to grind with Donald Trump as Kaitlan said. He's a longtime -- two decades-long employee of Donald Trump and the Trump Organization, just based on the snippet that we just saw. He does not appear to be angry or resentful towards Donald Trump. And, finally, if you look at his testimony and you look at the indictment, he appears to be well-supported, corroborated by documents by certain text chains that are referenced in the indictment and by testimony of some of the defendants themselves, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira. So this is really the kind of witness that you want to build around as a prosecutor.",

And if you look at the indictment, Jake, this guy, Mr. Butler, who's referenced in the indictment as employee five, he's in the middle of others things, too.He's a witness primarily, but, for example, when it comes time to try to check out the surveillance video. Remember, part of this case is that at one point Trump and the other defendants were trying to figure out what do we have on the surveillance video. Can we delete it? He overhears and he's part of conversations about that as well. So I think he's a multifaceted witness for prosecutors.",

In this case, it is his hush money trial currently set to begin March 25th.Today, attorneys for Trump filed a motion asking a New York state Supreme Court judge to delay the start of the case until the U.S. Supreme Court finishes reviewing his claim of presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case. Let's bring in a special guest, Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and author of a \"New York Times\" bestseller called \"Attack From Within: How Disinformation is Sabotaging America\". Barbara, thanks so much for joining us. Trump's delay strategy does appear to be working for him. Of the four criminal cases against Trump, which you see as the biggest threat? And do you think that one that you think is the biggest threat, we will hear before the election? BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, Jake, I think the biggest threat really is the federal election interference case. That's the one that really goes to the heart of his efforts to steal an election yet opposite of what he alleged to be true and his big lie. I don't know whether it will go to trial before the election. I think there is a 25 percent chance if I were to put a number on it and that all depends on how quickly the Supreme Court makes its decision. This one, the Alvin Bragg case, I think its an interesting strategy in an effort clearly to delay things, to say we need to hear from the Supreme Court first before this case can be decided because of presidential immunity. But I think Alvin Bragg has a countermove here, which is only a very thin slice of this case, involves acts occurring while Donald Trump was president. So if he were to simply remove that evidence from the case, he could indeed go forward on March 25th.",

Can she be fair? And there's nothing that we've seen in this evidence that has anything to do with the guilt or innocence of these defendants or in any way suggest that there was a financial motive for her in indicting them.

And holy month of Ramadan is now a key part of that backdrop. Ramadan begins, tensions in Jerusalem's old city are all flaring, wielding batons, Israeli police, forcefully pushing back Palestinians at a gate to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound. It's not clear how this scene began, but on the first night of Ramadan, CNN witnessed Israeli police refusing to allow at least two dozen, mostly young Palestinian men to enter the mosque. Sometimes before even checking their IDs. Disturbing public security is the official reason given over and over for again, without explanation. How am I disturbing public security? What did I do wrong? This man asked the officer. I'm not going back. I want to pray, but the answer is the same. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is the fifth and sixth gate I try to enter from, and they didn't say anything but disturbance of public security and they simply sent us back. My soul is connected to Al Aqsa, depriving me from Al Aqsa as if they deprive me of water. It's very difficult for me to a level I can't even describe. I will go home. May God give you health.",

More than 200 people were kidnapped and taken back to Gaza as hostages. Today, Israeli officials estimate that 99 people are still alive and being held in Gaza, along with the bodies of 31 hostages who were killed. Joining us now are six family members who have loved ones being held hostage. Thank you so much for being here. It's an awful circumstance and we're going to continue to cover it. Moshe, let me start with you. Your brother-in-law, Omri Miran, we've told this story before, he's being held hostage in Gaza. He has a wife, your sister Lishay, and two daughters. You're all in Washington, D.C. today. What are you hoping to hear from American lawmakers? MOSHE LEVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW OF HOSTAGE OMRI MIRAN: I think this is a critical week for the war, for Israel, for the hostages, and, of course, as well for the Palestinian non-combatants. We're hoping to hear this week that negotiations are still in full force, that there is an approach to pressure Hamas through Qatar, through Egypt, through other stakeholders, possibly Russia or Turkey, in order to ensure that Hamas agrees to the framework. As we know now, and President Biden said last week, I met the secretary general, the U.N. who also echoed those sentiments. There is an agreement on the table. Hamas refuses to agree to it, and we have to use all levers. And I hope American lawmakers will do the effort to pressure wherever they can, especially Qatar, to allow Hamas to free the Palestinians from there -- they're also captives of Hamas. And, of course, free our loved ones, my brother-in-law, Omri, and the rest, 133 hostages.",

They've been going through all of these cases that she had worked on. I'll show you some of their key findings. They found that she had omitted material facts in certain records, that she had tampered with DNA testing by omitting some results. She had violated data retention, quality control policies, and then allegedly deleted data to try to cover up that failure. Now, about 652 cases have been impacted. Thus far, authorities are still going back in order to do a more fulsome review. We did get a statement in from her attorney. I'll read you part of that. The attorney says, Woods has never created or reported any false inculpatory DNA matches or exclusions, nor has she testified falsely in any hearing or trial resulting in a false conviction or unjust imprisonment. It's worth pointing out that as its internal affairs review goes on, there was also a separate criminal investigation also going on according to authorities. Jake, you understand this is the nightmare scenario for investigators, for prosecutors, when they're talking about potential convictions that now have to be reviewed. Of course, the big question is there anyone who was wrongfully convicted by her alleged shoddy analysis here. We still have to wait and see and then finally, a significant cost to taxpayers.
