Mr. Biden will meet with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts in Mexico City starting today to discuss among other topics the recent surge in migration.  The President addressed the issue on Sunday when he visited the U.S. border in El Paso, Texas.He inspected the iron fence between U.S. and Mexico and pledged more government support.  He later spoke with workers at a migrant processing center, but notably, he did not appear to meet with migrants themselves.  A senior administration official told CNN that was completely coincidental, and that the center did not have any that day.  Mr. Biden's handling of the border crisis has widely been criticized by Republicans, including the Texas governor who outlined his concerns in a letter to the President. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) I urged him, in a letter, to see the real payoffs when everybody here may already know and that is there were thousands of migrants sleeping on the streets in El Paso that had been cleaned up in the past few days.  And I asked him to go see the areas, where we have these mass migration process and go visit with the people who own property and live on the border whose lives have been totally constructed and I said you have -- Mr. President you have a job to do.

A senior administration official telling CNN that that was purely coincidental that at the time of his visit, there just didn't happened to be any migrants at the center. It is worth noting that at the time of the President's visit to El Paso, there had been a drastic drop in the number of migrants at this border city.

But did Mr. Biden see the real crisis given he didn't actually visit migrants, he didn't talk to migrants on the streets but instead saw a much more sanitized version of the situation at the border, didn't he?AREVA MARTIN, CNN'S LEGAL ANALYST AND CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY:  Yeah, despite what may have happened on this one trip, no doubt, Joe Biden has a very clear understanding about the gravity of the migrant crisis that the U.S. is facing, but I don't think it's fair to try to place all the blame on Democrats with respect to the immigration issues that we currently face in the United States. The Republicans like to complain a lot.  They like to make theater and drama with the immigration crisis like sending immigrants to the vice President's house, sending them to Washington, sending them to New York, sending them to other states.  But they do very little. When they had control of the house, when they a Donald Trump in the White House, they took very little actions to actually do anything with respect to the immigration crisis.  So, I don't think we should blame the Democrats without looking at the blame that should be placed on the Republicans as well. And given how fractured the republican party is at this point we should not expect there to be any efforts on the part of the Republicans to address not only the immigration issues but other issues such as the economy, voting suppression. There're so many issues that are important to the American people. If they cannot elect a leader without 15 attempts and without almost coming to blows on the floor of the U.S. Congress, I don't think we should expect anything from the Republican-led congress.",

It's literally directing a plume of moisture, into the central northern portions of the state. This will not be a 12-hour event, we're talking about 48 hours or more of relentless rain and snow. Weather Prediction Center picking up on that, they have increased their area of coverage of a moderate risk, that's a level three of four to flash flooding, from San Francisco south toward into Los Angeles, and by the way, that extends into Tuesday for Southern California, in and around L.A. About 30 million people impacted by this, with flood alerts stretching from the north all the way to the south, as this plume of moisture oscillates from the north to the south, from Monday into the day on Tuesday.

These buildings being hit because, as you can see from these images, this crater appears to have missed one of the buildings or indeed there being any news of loss of life. And the people on the streets of Kramatorsk, those people who have managed to speak to international media organizations, also say that this claim essentially is rubbish. It's been rebuffed by the Ukrainian army as well. Now, why would Russia do this? Well, it might be a sort of domestic political propaganda play largely because there has been significant ire inside Russia at the admission that 89 Russian troops, conscripts, were killed after they were hit in Ukrainian attack when they were staying inside a vocational school that appeared to been requisitioned by Russian-occupying forces. And initially, the Russian government and defense ministry, defense had actually blamed those Russian conscripts themselves, saying that they'd been targeted because their mobile phone signals had been intercepted by the Ukrainian army and, therefore, their position had been revealed and they'd been struck. That is something that Ukraine says is not true. And, of course, Russia had to roll back on those claims. But that was still drawn some indignation, including from usually pro-Kremlin critics from Russian television. So, this is apparently, it seems, a disinformation game. But more broadly speaking, it doesn't change the fact that, as you were just saying before, there's fierce fighting that is taking place to the east of Kramatorsk and the city of Bakhmut, which is almost 60% destroyed now and continues to be the focus of that Russian defensive. Further down the line, of course, Ukraine and Russia -- Ukraine and its western allies, I'm sorry, is still on tenterhooks waiting for some kind of Russian offensive to start mobilizing perhaps in February and March. And it's for that reason that we're starting to see over the last few weeks more pledges of western hardware to try and help Ukraine push through in places like Kramatorsk and also in places like Bakhmut, but worrying enough over the course of the weekend after that ceasefire that Russia floated, one rebuffed by Ukraine, Rosemary. What we saw was the mercenary group very much focused its attention on places like Bakhmut, saying that that was that group's ultimate target to try and recapture. So, all eyes are on that.",

Their death sentences were upheld last week and activists are very concerned that their execution may be imminent. They are calling on the international community to do more than just condemn and issue these symbolic sanctions. They say that the international community can and must do more to put pressure on the Iranian regime, to try and stop these executions, and to save those who are on death row right now, Rosemary.",

But according to people that I have managed to speak to in the past couple of days, these restrictions have become even more severe, making it very hard for activists and protesters to get information and video out to the world.But speaking to one source inside Iran, he said after those first executions, they did see these protests begin to subside because of the fear that have been instilled in people by the regime. But they say that protests are still continuing in different parts of the country, in the Kurdish region, in the Baluchistan region where the Baloch minority resides in Iran. And, you know, last night, Rosemary, as reports spread that these two young men may be facing imminent execution, we saw a crowd gathered outside the prison where they're being held, along with family members of these two young men, chanting against the regime, just sheer bravery that we are continuing to see. And we also saw some video from different parts of the country of protesters still taking to the streets. So, while the regime is really trying to use the death penalty to crush dissent, Iranians appear to be still determined to take to the streets and make their voices heard and call for an end to this repressive regime, Rosemary.",

So, there are criticisms of all members of the family, particularly Camilla, particularly William, also Charles, also Kate. And certainly, Harry felt he wants reconciliation, he wants the hand of friendship. But that reconciliation, he just does not want a couple of pieces of cake and a cup of tea. What he wants is a big apology from William, from Charles, from everything he has been through. And that, I think, is very unlikely. The royal family is very much (INAUDIBLE) organization. And also, we understand from sources that the royal family are very angry about this, particularly William. He is fuming about this. So, at the moment, I don't see any reconciliation. But certainly, Harry feels that the relationship is so damaged, nothing is going to damage it further. He is going out, he's telling his truth --",

They are going to stay silent about the Netflix documentary. They're not going to say anything. But I do expect more words from sources. And I think, perhaps in a few months or so, we are going to see some kind of way in which some members of the royal family talk about it, whether it is through a journalist on a walkabout or some kind of way in which they express, in which they say that they -- as was said about the Netflix, about the Oprah interview, recollections may vary.
