Coming up this hour, a major attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea. Zelenskyy will address Canada's parliament as he tries to shore up support for Ukraine. And an exclusive CNN report on Russia, China, and the U.S. expanding their nuclear sites. And Megan Rapinoe plays her last match for the U.S. National Women's Soccer Team this weekend. We start with a major attack by Ukraine in Russia-controlled Crimea. Ukraine's military now confirming what it calls a successful hit on Russia's Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. The damaged from the missile attack appears to be substantial. Debris was reportedly scattered over hundreds of meters. And one Russian soldier is missing. Ukraine threatening more of these attacks to come. One Russian official -- one Ukrainian official, rather, wanting Russia's Black Sea fleet could be, quote, \"sliced up like salami.\" Well, the Ukrainian president is said to make his case in a speech to Canada's parliament for more aid to fight his war against Russia. Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a warm welcome from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when he arrived in Ottawa straight from a very busy trip in Washington. We are going to bring in CNN's Paula Newton who is covering all the developments for us from the Canadian capital Ottawa. Good to have you with us, Paula. I want to start, if we can, on that attack on Russia's naval fleet in the Black Sea. Just what do we know about that attack? And just how significant is it?",

      "sentences": "It is quite significant, Lynda. It is an incredibly bold attack, and very much connected to what Zelenskyy hopes todo here on the ground in Canada and what he did in the United States. He knows that the more success that Ukraine can have on the battlefield and prove that he can hit on Russian occupied territory, and hit hard, as you said, this is the Black Sea fleet. To hit the headquarters, it is quite an achievement for Ukraine, given that as he arrives here in Ottawa, he is trying to convince not just Canada, but other allies now perhaps a bit more reluctant to give that military aid to Ukraine, to say, look, continue to stand with us in both rhetorical support, but also material support, and we can win this. And that is the message from Zelenskyy today. In terms of that attack itself, again, if you followed any of the channels from the Russian occupied areas overnight, it was quite a panic for a little while. They actually had told people in Crimea to shelter in place in that area, do not leave. They were unsure. And what does that mean, Lynda? It means that they were unsure of their own missile defenses there in Crimea and did not know if another strike was possible. That is a big victory for Ukraine. A couple of things, Lynda, Zelenskyy I'm seeing right now is arriving at this hour at the Governor General's residence. This will be quite an occasion. He gets a lot of support here in Canada, also because in Canada, there is one of the largest Ukrainian diaspora anywhere in the world. In fact, one of the largest outside of Russia itself. And for that reason, a lot of support what he was looking for, again, is more than a handshake and a pat on the back. He wants, again, defense material. He wants funding, he wants tanks, he wants ammunition. He wants those missile defense systems. To that end, the defense minister himself, the Ukrainian defense minister meeting here with his Canadian counterpart, they'll be having their bilateral in parallel with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Zelenskyy -- Lynda.",

Well, before heading to Canada, Ukraine's president was of course in Washington appealing for more aid. He faced an audience of skeptical Republicans on Capitol Hill, and despite that the Biden administration announced $128 million in new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine as well as $197 million in arms and equipment. Our Jeremy Diamond is covering this for us and joins us from the White House. Good to have you with us, Jeremy. So the reception that Zelenskyy received in the U.S. has been described as frosty, as cold, as mixed at best.

And it is that split screen between the reception that President Zelenskyygot yesterday in Washington versus the one he got nine months earlier when he first came to the United States since Russia's invasion of his country. You know, that contrast was very stark, and it was clear. You know, the last time that Zelenskyy came here, he got a joint session of Congress, a primetime address thanks to the House speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi. All of Washington's leaders, Republicans and Democrats, were standing firmly behind Ukraine, expressing their support for Ukraine. And you contrast that with yesterday, where Zelenskyy still got of course a very positive reception and notes of support from President Biden, from the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer as well as the Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. But it was the House speaker, a new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who didn't even want to be seen in public, in photos with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, showing how much support has waned for Ukraine, particularly in the Republican Party. We've seen that in polling reflected when you look at Republican voters across the country, but you also see it in elected officials as a number of House lawmakers and some Republican senators as well issued a letter in the day before Zelenskyy arrived, making clear that they have questions about continued support for Ukraine and casting doubt on the need for providing Ukraine with additional support. And that of course is notable as President Biden is asking Congress for $24 billion of additional aid. So far House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not committed to bringing that package up for a vote.",

The next in line is Germany that has spent less than half of that. So take us through this latest aid package. We know that you just said that they want $24 billion approved.

He talked about robots taking care of elderly people. He did, however, talk about the Palestinians isolating them, saying in effect, we're on the verge of a big agreement with Saudi Arabia. They worked out other peace deals with other Arab countries such as Bahrain, United Arab Emirates. So that is the Israeli goal. Now this speech also hammered away by Netanyahu against Iran, saying it of course threatens the world if it ever gets a nuclear bomb. And he reiterated again that Israel will do everything in its power to stop that from happening. Each side, Israel and the Palestinians, in their speeches said to the U.N., why aren't you sanctioning them? The Palestinians with President Abbas said, why aren't you going after Israel since they don't live up to the terms of prior Middle East resolutions? While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said the Palestinians or Iran, there are many resolutions on the books, and you're not going after them. The power of sanctions has certainly dwindled here at the United Nations.

So you are having the heads of Warner Brothers-Discovery, our parent company, Disney, NBC Universal, and Netflix.

The writer I talked to also told me, look, I understand that it's going to take a long time because we want those higher wages specifically when it comes to residuals and streaming. And they're asking for it to be humans, the writers to be writing and producing these scripts and not machines. Not artificial intelligence.

And this is an area where we have seen large numbers of migrants crossing from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande over there. And this is the pathway through the river where many of them, thousands in the last three days, have taken. But it has kind of changed dramatically here today. And we are trying to figure out exactly why this might be the case. But in the last three days, we have seen several thousand migrants crossing through here, turning themselves into state and federal authorities after making their way through the river and through these various layers of razor wire. But this morning it has been incredibly quiet compared to what we have seen. So the reasons for that is we don't quite know at this point so we are trying to figure that out. But this is still a cause for concern, especially here in Eagle Pass. It has been the focal point of this latest surge of migrants moving into the U.S. Many of the migrants say they have been waiting for months to be able to apply for the appointment to request asylum in the U.S., and they simply have grown tired and desperate of waiting. That's why many of them came. That gentlemen that you spoke about at the beginning who literally at one point they were able to lift up this razor wire and come through, and that migrant, the first thing he did was apologized for crossing illegally. You know, many of these people don't quite know exactly what will be the long- term ramifications for entering into the U.S. illegally. There are ramifications once you start going through the immigration process here in the U.S., but that could take months if not years to play out for them. So, you know, the magnitude of crossing through like -- through between ports of entry here on the U.S. southern border and crossing through a legal port of entry that can really complicate things for them down the road. But that does not really change the matter at hand right now, where we have seen this just a massive surge of migrants up and down the U.S. southern border. And what many local officials all along border communities are concerned about is that there is a great deal of information suggesting that the push of migrants coming up through Central America into southern Mexico is only going to continue to intensify in the weeks and months ahead possibly. The mayor of Eagle Pass told us that he was in a meeting with federal authorities yesterday afternoon and was told that there are about 50,000 to 60,000 migrants in southern Mexico. The question becomes what happens and what becomes of these large groups of people. You know, they tend to disperse, sometimes they break up, sometimes people give up and don't finish the journey, but it is assumed that many of these people are going to make their way north, and so border communities are trying to brace and prepare for what the situation is going to continue to look like here in the weeks ahead -- Lynda.",

Those are by and large the migrants that we're seeing here at Eagle Pass are from Venezuela. Other people are just simply tired of waiting to go through the proper channels, and they're making the calculation of what is worse, to continue waiting in Mexico at risk of being robbed or beaten or, you know, held, kidnapped, which is what many migrants have been telling us that they've experienced it in recent months. You know, so they're making these calculations.

All three powers routinely conduct military exercises, clearly trying to demonstrate their strength to each other. And it stands to reason that eventually this competition would start to bleed into an area that I think many people haven't really thought about since the end of the Cold War, and that is their nuclear arsenals. CNN has gotten an exclusive look at the serious investment that all three countries, China, Russia and the U.S., have put into their nuclear weapons testing sites. (Voice-over): The world's three most powerful militaries, the U.S., Russia and China, have all been expanding their nuclear testing sites in recent years. The evidence revealed in these commercial satellite images obtained exclusively by CNN. (On-camera): These are the Russian, Chinese and American nuclear testing sites. Novaya Zemlya, a Russian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Lop Nur, a dried-up salt lake in China's Xinjiang region. And the Nevada National Security site in a desert northwest of Las Vegas.

Not being grateful enough for the amount of aid that Ukraine has received from around the world. But as you referred to some of pushback, some of the pushback that he's getting right now, both here in the United States from Republican lawmakers as to when this war is going to end, how much more aide can he expect. There's also been pushback from Poland, whose leader says we are not going to give any more new weaponry to Ukraine right now because of a conflict over the grain deal. Just explain for us where Canadians stand on how much more aid they are willing to give Ukraine, because just before I ask you, I just want to bring up a graphic that we do have that shows the amount of aid that Canada has given. By comparison to some -- off the list right now because it is so far down the list, I think it's number 10 in terms of the number of countries that have given aid. The U.S. of course the most, over $40 billion. Germany, less than half of that at $20 billion. And Canada lags behind at about $1.8 billion. It didn't make that graphic. But talk to us about the support, the handing over more aid right now from the perspective of Canadians?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, look, there's a lot of support for this in Canada no doubt. I will say that what Canadian officials tell me is that if you lookat GDP, so if you look at the size of Canada's economy and then take that against the aid that's been given per capita aid, they actually say it's quite high even if the absolute number isn't quite high. But this is more than a numbers game here right now, Lynda, and Justin Trudeau will be basically -- Zelenskyy will lean on Justin Trudeau to also lean on allies to continue to make the point for them that this kind of aid must be kept up from all allies. I do want to point out as well that Canada at times has been slow to try and give some of that defensive aid. Canada itself lagging behind in terms of NATO contributions, and that has been an issue. I do think it's very interesting when we talk about both Ukraine and Poland when it comes to Canada, Canada not only has a large Ukrainian diaspora, it also has a large Polish diaspora as well. And it is interesting when you speak to these groups here on the ground, in Canada, that they look at the dispute between Poland and Ukraine as something temporary. They believe that it is a skirmish that will blow over. They, the Ukrainian and Polish Canadians here in Canada continually tell me, look, in Europe, you do not have to remind them about the threat of Russia on their own soil. And they believe that these issues between allies will continue to be ironed out. Having said that they don't like to see any fracture in the alliance whatsoever, and everyone is looking closely. A reminder that in Canada there are up to 200,000 Ukrainian refugees that have arrived since the war began as well. Many of them now wondering, Lynda, whether or not they will actually have to make their future in Canada given the war has already dragged on longer than most them had expected -- Lynda.",

This trip ofcourse, Paula, coming at a time when this counteroffensive is well underway. A major attack on Russia's naval fleet in the Black Sea by Ukraine overnight. How significant are those developments on the front lines as we look at the diplomatic talks that are underway?",
