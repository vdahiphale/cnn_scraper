I want to start with Trump's attorney Joe Tacopina, he says he plans to file quote, \"substantial legal challenges to the indictment.\"I mean, sources have told CNN, Trump faces more than 30 counts here related to business fraud. If you step into his world for a moment, what do you think Trump's strongest argument is here? LARRY NOBLE, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW &amp; FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL, FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION:  Well, first, good morning, Jimenez, thanks for having me. You know, I think that's a normal thing a defense attorney would say in this case. I think the strongest argument is probably going to be that one, there was no underlying criminal fraud that was going on which they needed New York to try to boost this up to -- up to a felony. And that, this was not a campaign finance violation. So therefore, they'll call it boot-strapping on that allegation, that, that is not really valid. I think it's a weak argument, but it is an argument. They have a number of arguments they can put forward like that, which will really go to the sufficiency over the evidence and how the law applies. The problem is right now, we don't know what District Attorney Alvin Bragg has in his indictment. We do not know the evidence and they do not know the evidence. So, and we're all speculating now until Tuesday, but you know, they're going to come forward with defenses. Any good criminal lens -- defense lawyer would. And what we've seen from Trump is that he will use every means he can, both legal and outside the courtroom to try to slow these cases down. And to try to, you know, defeat prosecutions.",

But I'm curious, you know, the former president's role or whether the former president's role in a hush money payment to Karen McDougal also plays a part in this, we do not know.

But according to the allegations in the Karen McDougal case, that Trump is going to use David Pecker who is then I guess the publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", and did have her pay McDougal not to talk about the abandoned alleged affair with Trump.And I think that's important because if that's true, it shows a pattern. It shows that because of the   election, they were very concerned about these cases coming out about these alleged affairs coming out, and therefore they were taking steps to try to silence the women by paying them. And I think the Karen McDougal case is just -- it may very well be just another example of that.

It's interesting in this case, one of Trump's lawyers said he had no problem with the judge.He didn't think the judge was biased, which is a good thing for the lawyer who is about to appear before that judge to say. But you know -- but it's really hard to restrain Trump, and I suspect he will continue to go on attacking the judge. I suspect it may very well file a motion.

She was arrested on the very first day of the war, February 24th of last year in an anti-war protest, and spent 10 days in prison, according to court records. So she potentially anti-war, Vladlen Tatarsky, the blogger who was killed in this explosion, obviously very pro-war, part of an increasingly powerful cohort of bloggers who were documenting Russia's war in a much more raw, much more uncensored way than we see from the likes of the Russian defense ministry.
