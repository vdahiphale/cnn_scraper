The suspect behind a triple shooting in Pennsylvania barricaded inside a home in Trenton, New Jersey. Authorities have identified him as 26-six-year-old Andre Gordon. Police alleged that Gordon and killed two people in one home in Falls Township, Pennsylvania before he drove to another home shooting and killing the mother of his two children, who you see here pictured with the suspect. Now, Gordon is also alleged to have bludgeoned her mother with the butt of his assault rifle before carjacking a vehicle and then fleeing to Trenton, New Jersey. CNN's Polo Sandoval is just yards from where the suspect is barricaded this hour. Polo. What's the latest you're seeing on the ground?",

      "sentences": "That house (INAUDIBLE) just over my right shoulder off in the distance. I'll give you the lay of the land in just a few moments, Paula.But first, remember its now been about four-and-a-half hours now since police here in Trenton, New Jersey were notified, the man believed in that -- in those killings that you just told us about was barricaded inside a home. At the time, there were multiple residents inside of that home. Since then, they were able to escape from that home. And now this really gives law enforcement here on the scene that advantage -- the advantage of time. It is on their side as they can potentially wait out the suspect who they believed was involved. That home that I mentioned is just beyond the yellow tape here. There are multiple law enforcement personnel between us and the home. So we're in a relatively save space. But that house in the distance, that red brick-faced multi-story structure is where investigators believe 26-year-old Andre Gordon came after being involved in the killing of three of his relatives in neighboring Pennsylvania just after 09:00 this morning. Police earlier today telling reporters that they believed that after he commits -- allegedly committed those murders, he carjacks another individual who didn't -- he did not hurt and then drove an SUV here to this particular neighborhood before making his way inside that house. For the last several hours we've heard police negotiators outside using a bullhorn PA system asking Gordon to basically help bring this to a peaceful end. Asking that he surrender himself, either pick up the phone, call 911, or step out of the house with his hands up and no shirt on to make sure that he doesn't have any sort of weapons on. And investigator said earlier that he was believed to have used an AR- style rifle, possibly other weapons in the commission of those murders. And so now they're not sure if he's potentially armed inside. We also do not know if police outside of this house have seen or heard any sort of response from the suspect inside. So it's not until they are able to actually gain entrance, which we don't know when that will be, that they will be able to positively say that the suspect is inside. But for the last hour or so, we haven't seen or heard anything except for just a few bangs that we heard coming from an area near the home about an hour ago in addition to a few small billows of smoke. But for now, police outside of the house watching, waiting keeping neighbors away and any of the folks that actually make their way towards -- or near the home. Police are actually providing them with an escort if they happen to live near that home. But otherwise, any folks who may be coming to this particular neighborhood, they're being asked to steer clear as they wait to see what will happen next, Paula.",

      "sentences": "Well, it removes the potential collateral problem of hostages, which is now you've got the suspect on one end of this, the police on the other end, and innocent people caught in the middle. Once they were able to get all of those people out of the house, Paula, it means you can engage the suspect. The suspect has much less leverage than someone who might be holding hostages, which is one of the reasons it was important to get all those people out obviously for their safety, but also so that this could be a kind of a more direct communication.You know, one of the things you brought up earlier in the show is, what do you say to somebody who is, you know, suspected in three murders and other assaults to give them that reason to come out when they're going to be saying, look, you know, my life is over, I'm going to jail. But that's where trained negotiators are going to engage them and say Andre, look, you know, this was about seeing your children and this is, you know, those children are ok. And they're still going to need a father. And you know, this is this is not the time to plan out the whole rest of your life because we don't know how that's going to go. So why don't you, you know, make that step to the door? We don't want to hurt you. We don't want any of our people to get hurt. We want you to be able to, you know, go to court, get a lawyer engaged with your kids and others. And, you know, you try and turn that conversation around. A, to have a direct conversation; B, to give them all the reasons to go forward and not to do something rash, right then. But as you've seen and as Polo has reported to us, this has been a lot of people on megaphones and PA systems yelling into the house. We haven't heard about anything coming back. So at this point, they really have to determine is he still inside? Is he alive? And why does that matter? I mean, we keep saying and it's true, time is on their side especially if safety's involved, but if he's not in that house, if somehow he slipped the perimeter and they say they have no reason to believe he did, it's really important to know that he may be armed and still out there. So at some point, they are going to have to go through the motions of getting in there. As Polo told us, there were some banging noises and some smoke. It's possible they could have used a tear gas agent or something like that to see if they could get him to come out or create some movement in there. At some point, they may decide to go in with a robot or send a team in. But at this point, as polo said they're just using the time to get as much intel as possible and figure out the next move.",

And they will do everything they can to try to save his life. They will talk logic, as John explained. They will attempt to get him to sort of calm down from the sort of pinnacle of stress and outrage that he was experiencing before this happened to a point where he can start to think logically about what his options are. And they'll try to lay out options for them. Even though the average person would think this guy's life is over, that's not necessarily the case. So they want to try to get them out safely. But they're going to protect their personnel. They're going to protect the people in the neighborhood and everything that they do is about very slowly making sure that every step that they take is the best possible option for the safety of everyone involved.",

Ohio's a state that he won in pretty large numbers in 2020. He actually had the most votes in Ohio in the state's history as a candidate. And so he's really here, not for himself, but to boost his endorsed candidate in the senate Republican primary, which is on Tuesday. And that is Bernie Moreno, a businessman who is really locked in a contested, messy primary fight with two other candidates that include State Senator Matt Dolan and Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose. Now Donald Trump's influence in this state is very noteworthy. He was really one of the (INAUDIBLE) reasons why Senator JD Vance was able to come out victorious in his own senate primary two years ago. And Donald Trump is trying to, you know, have that happen again this time around. And one of the things I think is worth noting is that this is one of the only senate primaries where Donald Trump's -- one of his backed candidates, could potentially lose their primary race. And that's something I'm told from his advisers and his allies that they very much want to avoid at all costs. Now, as for his messaging Paula, Donald Trump has focused heavily on the border. This is something that is actually been parroted by many of the candidates in the Senate race, even though Ohio is more than one thousand miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border, it's something they really believe people here on the ground in this state care very much about. We also heard Donald Trump repeatedly attack President Joe Biden as he's really been doing a lot of lately as he gears up for his general election messaging. But he's been really going after him mainly on some of the charges that he is facing claiming that Biden is behind some of the charges. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I have to tell you that as somebody who broke with Trump on day one, when he came down the escalator and said the things he did about Mexicans and immigrants, it makes me angry and it frustrates me that these people, while he was president, were such part of the conspiracy, were such accomplices through all the things he was doing. This is not a new Donald Trump. January 6 was not a new Donald Trump. January 6 was a culmination of four years when he did and said whatever he wanted with impunity.

But there are no genuine opposition candidates on the ballot, leaving President Vladimir Putin set to secure a fifth term, a victory that could keep him in power through 2030.So far, there have been some acts of defiance over the vote, including fires at polling stations and people spoiling valid boxes with dye. CNN's national security analyst and former deputy director of National Intelligence, Beth Sanner, joins us now. Beth, Russian election authorities say individuals detained for damaging ballots will be checked for Ukrainian connections. What do you make of that? BETH SANNER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Wow, you know, Putin has tried to label pretty much anyone who opposes him, who opposes the war, who opposes the idea that there is democracy in Russia with this kind of foreign label, right? Because real Russians would never oppose any of these things. And so, of course, you must be a foreigner. You must be influenced by foreigners. And you know, kind of interestingly, this is the same take that China's President Xi has taken about foreign influence and why they fear these kind of color revolutions. They're of the same mind on this.",

Using the levers of the state, bussing people in, doing all kinds of coercion and things like that. And, but this is the most opaque election in Russia's modern history. And the way that they're doing it, like this is the first time that they've had computer voting, online voting, which I find a little bit ironic in the U.S. political contexts. But you know, so today they showed Putin sitting at his home computer and voting online. So when you have that kind of thing and then you have four districts in Ukraine that are occupied by Russia, where they're literally going door to door forcing people at gunpoint to vote. So you know, of course, none of these things are true. We are -- we already know that the voter rolls in those four districts are elevated by at least a million people. So, yes. Not taking it too seriously, but Putin is, because legitimacy is key here.",

And so every little act of defiance, like putting a bouquet of flowers on Navalny's grave, and knowing that can land you in jail. So we're going to see tomorrow, Sunday, whether Navalny's supporters are people who just want to stand up against Russia, show up for this noon against Putin, and just stand in line. There's already been a threat made by some Russian officials that showing up in this kind of flashmob to stand in line is illegal and people will be arrested.",

I think we sort of have this image of our minds of people going out on the fields, listening to some funky music and maybe light up a joint. But only 4 percent of Americans had ever tried it in 1969. Now we're up to 50 percent. That's a 12-point jump from where we were a decade ago. And look at 2013, only 7 percent of Americans said they currently smoked it. Now it's more than doubled, up to 17 precent. So it's not just folks who are trying it once and then putting it down. They're sticking with it.
