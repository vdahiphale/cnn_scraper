      "sentences": "You're back live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening. We are tracking Hurricane Hilary. The system just weakened to a category two storm with winds of 110 miles per hour. The historic and potentially catastrophic storm is barreling toward the southwestern United States, triggering the first ever tropical storm warning for millions of people in Southern California.The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department just issued an evacuation warning for some areas in that part of Southern California. That's just east of Los Angeles in the mountain and foothill areas. Hilary could bring a year's worth of rain in a single day to parts of California, Arizona and Nevada. Let's go straight to the CNN Weather Center. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam has been following the hurricane's path. Derek, I suppose it's good news that the hurricane is weakening at some point, but that doesn't necessarily mean that people in that part of the country can let down their guards or folks in Mexico as well. We should make it very clear, the folks in Mexico need to be very careful about this storm as well.",

Or you get perhaps some upwelling from a stronger storm system, which is what we've seen over the past 24 hours. This was a powerful Cat four just 24 hours ago. So what it's doing is it's taking the cold water from below.Also, some of the coastal currents that are just off the coast of California, the Baja Peninsula, bring in the cooler water to this area. So all of these working against the storm, it'll help weaken it. That's the positive news because we want to see a weakening storm as it approaches the southwestern U.S. And we believe it will continue to do so. And as it starts to impact or kind of get exchanged with the mountain ranges across this area, it will also help degrade the storm even further. But again, we cannot diminish the flood threat because of so much moisture being associated with the system as it moves onshore. Jim?",

A tropical storm warning has never been issued here. Now, granted, this past winter was a very wet one. And so people are prepared for what to do in flood situations, but certainly usually not in the month of August. So I keep seeing cities and counties issue information about where to find sandbags, telling people to bring all their items indoors, to not go outside and drive tomorrow and Monday if at all possible. We're seeing lots of events postponed or canceled. Three MLB games in Southern California scheduled for tomorrow ended up being moved today so that they could all double hitters. And the U.S. Navy has said that they are moving their ships and submarines temporarily out of San Diego while this storm comes through. So a lot of changes happening, a lot of preparations, including going to the encampments with loudspeakers, making sure those unhoused people, of which there are so many here in Southern California, typically enjoying the dry outdoor weather, letting them know it is time to find a place inside.

Utility workers in orange vests are picking up miles of electrical lines tangled up between the fissures of asphalt.The sacred monuments and reminders of colonial harms have been reduced to ashes. And the response from the usual government and institutional flares have been well meaning but woefully inadequate. So community leaders have immediately filled the gaps with dozens of relief pubs. People led, we're fielding and distributing the outpouring of donations that we're seeing across the island. There's a new leadership among a generation of Kanaka Maoli, Hawaiians emerging as beacons of hope throughout the chaos. Just yesterday, native Hawaiian leaders batted together to great Na 'Ohana o Lele. That's the families of the ancient name of Lahaina to demand that Governor Josh Green pause redevelopment, allow the community to grieve and heal, reinstate government transparency, the Sunshine Law and center the community innovation development process. So right now, there's just a lot of like land grabbers, disaster capitalists kind of hovering above the wreckage like vultures and we got to build long term power, defend them off. We know this isn't going to be a sprint, but a marathon and it's going to take us years to rebuild. So, you know, I've been busy. I finally wept the other day. It was brutal sadness. But it's also tears of joy for the uprising that our people are leading today to rebuild Maui ourselves and the leadership of our generation, especially Kanaka Maoli is really something to behold.",

So today, Kanaka Maoli, there are more native Hawaiians living outside of Hawaii than on our ancestral lands. So this acute trauma is really just like a punctuation mark, an acceleration of decades of injustices that we faced.Native folks, black, brown, immigrants are generally the first and worst hit by climate disasters. But the cruel irony is that we tend to be the keepers of the knowledge of how to build a society that doesn't lead to ecological collapse. So as we look forward, we need to be resourcing efforts like, you know, Na 'Ohana o Lele or Lahaina strong, which is a group of volunteers that are leading our own door to door efforts to help fulfill insurance claims and FEMA applications in order to grow power. Because, you know, two years down the line, when redevelopment is happening in earnest, we need to show up as a community to rebuild schools and then maybe the next day take those same 200 people and testify at city council. That's really the path forward here. We need to be looking at direct relief, adjust, recovery and long term power for the rebuilding of Lahaina. That will cost at least $6 billion.",

There has been movement downwards for one candidate, Ron DeSantis, who's dropped from 28 percent to 16 percent.There is one other candidate, though. You interviewed him earlier this week, Ramaswamy, who wasn't even asked in their February poll. Look where he is now at 11 percent, according to \"Fox News.\" So he is actually closing in on DeSantis for second place. But at this particular point, it is Donald Trump against the field.

But the supremacy clause requires you to be acting in your capacity as a federal employee and acting within the bounds of federal law, doing something that is, in fact, federal. Here we have allegations that these defendants have been working to tamper with Georgia elections, and elections are solely a state prerogative. So I think it's going to be a difficult road for them.

As devastating as the fires are, there are work signs to decipher concerning how Hawaii navigates its future.And that's what we want to talk about right now with climate scientist, Michael Mann. He joins me now. He's the director for science, sustainability, and the media at the University of Pennsylvania. He's also the author of \"Our Fragile Moment: How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis.\" Let's just get right to this, Professor Mann. I mean, how did climate change play a role in what took place in Maui? Is it too soon to put a pin on that? What have you been able to decipher? MICHAEL MANN, DIRECTOR FOR SCIENCE, SUSTAINABILITY AND THE MEDIA, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA &amp; AUTHOR: Thanks, Jim. It's good to be with you. No, it isn't. We can talk about how various attributes of climate change sort of laid the groundwork for what played out. First of all, there's a long-term trend towards drying in that region. It's been getting drier, less precipitation. Temperature has been increasing as it has around the planet. But that means more evaporation of moisture from soil. So you put those two things together, you're going to get worse drought. And so there's a trend towards worse drought. And what we saw, in fact, was extreme drought in parts of the island that were impacted where those wildfires spread rapidly and did so much damage. And there's another ingredient, which is that the winds that helped, for example, knock down those power lines and helped spread the fire, those very strong winds were related to a high-pressure system to the north and a hurricane, a very low-pressure hurricane, that traveled to the south. That hurricane intensified very quickly on very warm waters in the eastern Pacific. That meant that those winds were stronger, that those pressure differences were stronger. The winds were stronger. An estimate that was done that the winds were at least 5 percent to 6 percent stronger because of that hurricane. And that hurricane intensified so quickly because of those warm waters. Those waters are so warm, in part, because of an El Nino event but also because of the large-scale warming of the planet from carbon pollution, from the burning of fossil fuels.",

He'll weaponize the justice system to prosecute opponents. He'll weaponize the spy agencies to potentially spy on political opponents. And he'll certainly ignore the media. I mean, I remember, Jim, when they revoked your press pass at the White House, and they were gleeful about it. That was just the teeny, tippy, top of the iceberg of what they will do to try to make the press, in their words, \"the enemy of the people.\" It's very chilling what folks lay out in \"Blowback\" might happen in a second term.",

Then Donald Trump came and said the quiet part out loud. He's made it clear that's the theme not just of the campaign but, if he's back in the Oval Office, you can imagine, department by department, the goal will be revenge, retribution against political adversaries. And as a conservative, that's not how we imagine government should operate. So I do hope, in the primaries, his opponents actually use that to their advantage.",

It was a record as the entire Republican field took on Donald Trump. So without him on that stage, I think you will see much lower numbers for the ratings. And I think it is really remarkable. You've had the FOX executives going to his club, trying to basically plead that he'll debate. You've had hosts on air trying to encourage him to debate. They've been on hand and knees trying to get him at that debate. In addition, this is a network that has been pushing a lot of Donald Trump propaganda. Not only during his administration, of course/ But in the past few months as he's been indicted time and time again, you've seen the channel's biggest hosts really peddle dark sinister rhetoric aimed at defending him. and still he is refusing to appear at their debate.",
