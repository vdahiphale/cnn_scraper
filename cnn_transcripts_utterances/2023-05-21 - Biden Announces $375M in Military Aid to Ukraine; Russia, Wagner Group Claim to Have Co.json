Let's listen first to India's Prime Minister, who basically perhaps encouraged President Zelenskyy with his words. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NARENDRA MODI, INDIA'S PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The war in Ukraine is a huge topic of discussion for the entire world. Its impacts have been multifold on the globe.

He said he thought that India would participate in this coalition against Russia. How they do that, I think remains to be seen. But certainly when you talk to American officials, they do believe that Zelenskyy believes that when he can get to these leaders face to face, when he can make this in-person appeal, that he does feel like he can have some effect. And as Phil was mentioning, he has done this basically all around the world at this point.The leaders here who are in the actual G7 were very hopeful that those appeals would have some effect on their invited guests. And you heard the French President Emmanuel Macron, say earlier today that this could be a game changer for Zelenskyy in trying to coalesce some support in what is known as the Global South. Now, you mentioned that the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, he did not meet with Zelenskyy. He is one of those so-called fence sitters. That is someone that I think President Biden and the other G7 leaders certainly would like to meet with Zelenskyy. But it doesn't appear as if it's happening on this particular stop. Vietnam is another country that is here that is in the same position. The President Zelenskyy did meet with the President of Indonesia. So that is another place where he could make this appeal. Now, whether any of those make any difference, I think remains to be seen. But certainly the leaders who are gathered here, we're very hopeful that that would make a difference. Of course, they are all leaving this summit sort of with this looming question of how much the support can be sustained going forward. You know, none of these G7 leaders is particularly popular at home. They're facing some political headwinds in a large part because of the economy and the global economy is struggling, in some part because of the war in Ukraine.

And, of course, now that Bakhmut would appear, at least a built-up area in the hands of Russians, it becomes a free fire zone for the Ukrainians.They don't have to worry about what they hit in the rubble there, because anything they kill will, in their view, be a legitimate target in the form of a Russian soldier. So be a very, very dangerous place indeed for anybody wearing Russian uniform for the foreseeable future, particularly as they are. This is the Ukrainians pushing on those flanks.

And it's a call that I think is an absolute necessity at this point.Speaker Kevin McCarthy has asked for this phone call after days of negotiations between the top negotiators for House Republicans and the White House have simply yielded nothing. I'll give you a very technical policy term here. Things aren't great right now at all. In fact, there's no real progress or clear pathway forward. And I think while that is not abnormal for negotiations, particularly very hard- edge negotiations between two sides with very different positions, it's a problem when you only have eleven days until a potential default. And I think that's the wild card here that's so different from past negotiations, all of which I've covered throughout the course of the last decade or so. And I think to some degree, one of the interesting elements of being here at the G7 was talking to advisors, to some of the foreign leaders or some of the G7 member countries who kind of said, we're used to this, right? We're a little sanguine about all this right now because you seem to do this every single time and always find a way out of it. And I think the concern right now is given where things stand in terms of the dynamics, in terms of the very different positions and in terms of the fact that President Biden has been very clear that he doesn't think anything should be attached to a dead ceiling increase, which is completely an anathema to where House Republicans are at this point in time. How do you resolve this and then actually whip the boats to get it passed both the House and the Senate, and get it to the President's desk in 11 days? That's tough. And so I think there's a lot of work to do and I think the hope at this point in time is that the two leaders, the Speaker and the President, talking on Air Force One, could perhaps jar something loose because they certainly need it right now.

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think it's clear after these three days that there is a real desire among these leaders to coalesce around a unified China policy. They're still on their way there. I don't think that the communique and the language that you saw this week necessarily is the final product, but it has been fascinating to watch. You know, until two years ago, China was not a subject for these summits at all. And it was at that summit that the President Biden's first G7 Summit in England that they first mentioned China in their final communique. And it has been a subject that President Biden in particular has stressed needs to be confronted by this bloc in particular. And so what you saw this week was a real attempt to coalesce around some language when it comes to what the United States calls economic coercion. And the phrase that you hear repeated over and over again is de-risk,not decouple. And it's basically an acknowledgment that these countries are never going to completely sever ties with Beijing. It's a manufacturing giant. The trading relationships are too important. And instead of sort of cutting themselves off completely, the desire is really to remove some of the national security risks from the relationship. Things like more resilient supply chains and you've already seen that from the United States putting some restrictions on exports of semiconductors, things like investments, trying to limit what can be invested in China. And so the leaders did coalesce around language there. I think the area where there still is work to be done is when it comes to the security relationship. The situation around Taiwan, the situation in the South China Sea, that has been a potent atmosphere around the summit in advance of the summit, Chinese worships did sail very close to Japan, and so it has informed a lot of the discussions here. The G7 only takes place in Asia every seven years. And so I think it did loom somewhat larger here than it has in the past. But the United States and the Europeans are on different pages somewhat when it comes to Taiwan. You saw that very clearly when the French President, Emmanuel Macron, said just this month that the Europeans should not be a vassal state of the United States, they shouldn't follow the United States blindly into war with Beijing in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. I'm not sure that those differences were necessarily reconciled here in Hiroshima, but certainly the leaders do seem to be in the same page that they need to come up with some sort of agreement on how to confront this threat that is not going anywhere in the years to come.",

And I do want to explain that gender affirming care part of it. First, what this bill would do is prohibit healthcare providers from performing gender transition surgeries for anyone under the age of 19. Now, this is actually rare when it comes to minors. The other part of the bill is that it would essentially restrict access to puberty blocking medication or hormone treatments for anyone under the age of 19. And this is standard care. Now, the other aspect of this bill is the abortion part. And what it would do here in Nebraska is ban abortions, or most abortions at 12 weeks.

They are being brought here from the local bus terminal in hopes of connecting them to the available resources.

And then they are connected with the services that they might need. I want to show you what it looks like inside the hotel. You can see that they've set up different waiting areas and common areas for people to try and get on whatever journey they are trying to get on. Many of the migrants that are being sent to New York City do not intend to stay in New York City. Some of them are trying to connect with other family members or travel to other parts of the country. And the city is trying to step in and help them do just that. But there are also some very real challenges when it comes to sheltering migrants. The city of New York has been running out of shelter space and we watched today as a couple of migrants were removed from this location and sent to another shelter location likely to be given a place in one of the city's local shelters while they wait to resolve their housing situation. That is certainly one of the challenges that the city is dealing with. I spoke with one of the local advocates that has been working with migrants and with the city to try and connect them to services. MURAD AWAWDEH, EXEC. DIR. NEW YORK IMMIGRATION COALITION: New York has welcomed people for centuries from across the world, from Europe, from Asia, from Africa, the Middle East and beyond.

I mean, look, it's taken Moscow if, in fact, they have captured all of it, and it looks like that's not necessarily so. It's taken them eight months to take the city. Putin had set a deadline of mid-December, and here we are approaching the end of May.And maybe they've captured it, maybe they haven't. And in the meantime, according to U.S. estimates, Russia has suffered 100,000 casualties since December. And they are unable they've spent their artillery, they've spent their weaponry, and they've spent especially their human and their soldiers' lives in this effort. So if it turns out to be a, \"Kremlin victory,\" it will be a period of victory.",

You know, India was there. Brazil was there. I'm just naming two countries that have not really taken a position, although in not taking a position, they have certainly significantly hobbled Ukraine in its efforts. You know, Prime Minister Modi was quite conciliatory in what he said. And yet president Lula from Brazil, really, from what we understand at this hour, still hasn't even agreed to a bilateral with Zelenskyy. How important do you think these countries are in terms of trying to bring them on board? Do you think it may materially affect. How this conflict goes forward and how long it lasts?",

When he went to China and talked about, you know, let's have an alternate currency to the dollar, and his refusal to meet with Zelenskyy, it's a really rather shameful performance.

I mean, Kevin, this is probably a level of detail that the President is briefed about, of course, but it, again, materially, perhaps does not affect what is going on now. What they're looking at is how is this going to affect the conflict in the months to come, given the military aid and given the steps in terms of providing that military aid, how far they've come in this summit, the pivotal point., right? Kevin, you said it quite a reversal on F-16s. What do you make of how quickly that happened, really, while you were on the ground there in Japan?",

The President's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, had sort of taken the lead in these negotiations, in these talks with the G7 leaders and with President Zelenskyy's government as well. And so this had been in the works for some time, but it was a reversal on the part of the President. And the way they explained it is they still do not believe that Ukraine needs these F-16s at this very moment. They don't think be effective, but they do believe that down the road they could provide some long-term deterrence measures for Ukraine as it battles this Russian aggression.One thing that we don't know at this point is how long it will take to train up these Ukrainian pilots. There was word from back in the United States that perhaps the training would be a little faster than had initially been predicted. Certainly, President Zelenskyy wants those jets flying as soon as he can. The real caution that President Biden had had initially was the risk of escalation. He certainly did not want President Putin to regard these F-16s as an escalation in this conflict, and he doesn't want President Zelenskyy to end up using them inside Russian territory. The White House has said that any weapons that they provide to Ukraine should not be used in Russian territory. So it was a major reversal, and it was kind of the centerpiece of the Ukraine talks this week. It came after several other reversals on the part of the President when it came to military aid. And you'll remember, he was initially against sending Abrams tanks to Ukraine. He came around and sent them. He was initially against sending longer range missiles. He came around and sent them as well. And so as this conflict progresses, as the situation progresses on the battlefield, it's clear that the President's willingness to go further and further is also progressing. And it will be interesting to see potentially what is next in that eventual progression. But certainly it's something I think the President will probably talk about when he comes out and speaks. And hopefully soon.",

I want to switch gears a little bit, Kevin, talk about something that perhaps is going to give you a little bit of trauma, given everything you've already been through with a debt crisis. We are here, again, a lot of back and forth. You know, they thought they were close to a deal a couple of days ago, and yet we are back down to the wire and into more crisis talks.From what you're hearing from officials, is there some new deal on the table? And I know that the President is going to get on Air Force One and probably get immediately on the phone with the House Speaker.

The big word that's always used in D.C. is that there shouldn't be a blank check. Exactly what that means, many are unsure. But as this debate unfolds, no doubt the spending on Ukraine will become an issue, even if it doesn't form part of these debt negotiations.I want to ask you, though, about President Biden's approach to this, because many will question he at first said that he wouldn't negotiate, right? That this -- you know, for our viewers listening in here, some believe this should just be automatic. You've spent the money, you now have to pay, you have to decide that you are going to pay your bills. President Biden has always said this is the way it should be done. That's what President Trump did. Why can't we just do the same and automatically increase that spending limit? What's been different here about the President kind of going back and forth, at first saying he wouldn't negotiate, and yet now, again, we are down to the wire, staring down a June 1 deadline, and the Speaker is saying, look, you must negotiate with us. This is the only way this is going to get resolved.",

What does that mean in terms of any change of government, if there is one after the next presidential election, given how much can they count on the United States to keep that up.I do want to go back to you, having said that they didn't have to go back to Congress yet in order to basically get more spending or to approve more spending for Ukraine. There was this issue that they actually have more money than they fought for Ukraine, given there was some kind of an accounting error. I don't know exactly how the White House portrayed this and what officials said to you about this, but that's one of the reasons where they continue to fund and come up with more funding, and yet they say it's an accounting error. We actually didn't account for it properly, which means we actually have more money for Ukraine than we thought we did.",

      "sentences": "Right. And it probably delayed by -- I don't know, maybe a few months, the time when they would need to go back to Congress to ask for more money. And in fact, last year, when the President passed the supplemental bill, the amount of money that Democrats who then held the House of Representatives included for Ukraine was much more than the Biden administration actually asked for.And part of the reason for that was because they knew that Republicans were taking control. And so they did build in sort of this pad of money that will allow them to sustain support. And the date I've heard thrown around is in September, when the spending process will have to begin again. And so that is an open question of how many Republicans will come on board with that. And so I think when President Biden speaks today, one of the things I think he'll want to convey to the press, to the world leaders who are listening to this press conference, is that he is confident that this support for Ukraine can be sustained. And I think you'll hearing that from other leaders who are holding their own press conferences on the sidelines of the summit, too, as they prepare to leave.",
