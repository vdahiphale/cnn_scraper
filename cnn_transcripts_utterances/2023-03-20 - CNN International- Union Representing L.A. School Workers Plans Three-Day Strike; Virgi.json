And this is something we've seen these last few days, ever since on Thursday, the government announced the use of this particular parliamentary procedure.Now, it isn't unusual that they should use it. I think the current Prime Minister has used it nearly a dozen time to force legislation through Parliament. It happens when like this government doesn't have the absolute majority it needs as it hasn't done since the last election last year. But to your question, Bianca, they would have to get the absolute majority to get this no-confidence vote in the government through. They have -- they're pretty close to it. The trouble for those who are hoping to see the French Prime Minister go on the back of this, is that they are just shy of it, because of the support of the government of the right Ile-de-France, Valerie Pecresse, the traditional French centrist right party. Now, some of them are expected to vote for the no-confidence motion. Will the half or so of their party members that need to vote, vote to have the government call, that we don't know. We'll know in a few hours' time, Bianca and Max, when the parliamentarians finally vote. Whatever happens in Parliament today, what is almost certain to continue is that discontent that we've seen on the streets. For four days in a row we saw the unplanned rallies.
