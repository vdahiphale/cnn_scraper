More than 600 Harvard faculty members are putting their support behind Harvard President Claudine Gay, signing a petition urging Harvard officials to resist calls to remove Gay from her job. She is facing mounting pressure from prominent alumni, donors and politicians to step down after answers she gave in congressional testimony about genocide.CNN's Jason Carroll is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Where do things stand this morning, Jason?",

Harvard's board of governors, as you know, governing board met yesterday. A regularly scheduled meeting. They're meeting again today. And so the question will be, will they come out with some sort of statement for or otherwise? We're waiting to hear what will happen.As you mentioned, already seeing some support here on campus for Harvard's president. You talked about that petition that was signed by some 600 faculty members. Last night it was at 300. Today it's at 600. But a little bit of context there because some of those faculty members, remember, John, are folks who were actually critical of the president, but what they say is they don't want external forces forcing her out. It's a decision that they say should be made internally. So, there is some support there. But having said that, there are a number of people here on campus who say that Claudine Gay's apology after that disastrous testimony last week simply isn't enough. One of the people who spoke to CNN, Polina Kempinsky. She's a student here at Harvard. She's Israeli. She said, after October 7th she already felt like a number of Jewish students here on campus feeling not safe. She said after that testimony last week it just made things worse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think Jews are kind of treated very differently than any other minority group. And I think there was a great example of that this past weekend. You know, the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee issued a statement, which I think came in response to some Jewish students who had, you know, for the past several weeks been condemning the use of the phrase \"from the river to the sea,\" which we view as an eliminationist phrase, and, frankly, an anti-Semitic one. And their statement said that the charge that from \"the river to the sea\" is anti-Semitic is racist. And I don't think you see any other group that calls out speech they say targets their community and you see other students respond by saying, oh, well, actually, you're the racist ones.And I think - I think this kind of discourse is harmful. I think Jewish students should be able to say that, you know, certain speech is offensive to our community, especially when the implication is that it's, you know, calling for the elimination of the only Jewish state in the world. You know, one where, you know, I have friends and family living. And so I think we've arrived at this kind of very dangerous state on campus where Jews are not viewed as any other minority. And I think part of that has to do with the fact that, you know, Jews have been traditionally successful, but at the same time anti-Semitism is very real and we've been seeing it on college campuses across the country, we see it in rising hate crime statistics and we can't just dismiss it because, you know, Jews have historically been successful over the past several decades.",

And they are hopeful that with this visit here to Washington he will be able to apply some additional pressure on lawmakers as that funding for Ukraine remains stalled up on Capitol Hill.Now, in the afternoon tomorrow President Zelenskyy will be here meeting with President Biden where officials say they will -- it will give the president a chance to once again show U.S. commitment for Ukraine. But he actually starts the morning up on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers. That includes a briefing with the entire Senate, as well as a one-on-one meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson. But right now this $60 billion in funding that the White House has requested for Ukraine still remains held up as Republicans are insisting that there must be changes to border policy before any aid for Ukraine or Israel is agreed to. Now, President Biden, last week, said that he has acknowledged there needs to be some changes to border policy. Officials saying that some things under consideration are changes to the asylum process to enter the United States. But senators have been working around the clock for weeks trying to see whether they can come to some type of agreement to enact these border policy changes. It really remains unclear at this point if they will be able to reach a consensus on that, especially as lawmakers are set to head home for their holiday recess at the end of the week. But Zelenskyy's visit here will give him an opportunity to try to make the case to lawmakers on Capitol Hill of why his country needs more funding as they are continuing this war against Russia. The White House has also warned that time is running out, that this aid for Ukraine is critical as they continue their fight on the battleground -- on the battlefield and they are hopeful that somehow this aid will get passed up on Capitol Hill, though so far there hasn't been a clear path forward on this endeavor.",

Much more ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:51:35] BERMAN: All right, just into CNN, jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is missing from prison. His team just posted that his whereabouts at this point are not known. According to a spokesperson, lawyers tried to get access to two penal colonies where he was believed to be but they were informed he was not there. He's now been missing for six days. Navalny has been in prison since June of 2022. AAA is predicting that the next few weeks could be the busiest holiday travel season on record. One hundred and fifteen million Americans could be hitting the roads and taking to the skies for Christmas and New Year's. Most of them will drive, but airports could see a record 7.5 million passengers going through. More than 40 million people are under flooding alerts from Maryland to Maine. That, of course, includes major metropolitan areas, including Philadelphia and New York. Some areas could even see up to a foot of snow. This is part of a deadly storm system that slammed the south with tornado's over the weekend. Fred.",

This is what remains of a utility poll. It snapped like a match stick under the force of those winds. That is the other portion of the utility polls. And also take a look behind me, Fred. That second floor right there, the very corner used to be a bedroom. Now you can see the bed right there because the force of the wind took away what remained of that wall. And you were mentioning before what happened in Clarksville, about 70 miles northwest of here. That was an EF-3 tornado with winds topping 150 miles per hour according to the National Weather Service, the local office here in Nashville. And here where we are, in the Madison neighborhood of north Nashville, the tornado was an EF-2 tornado with winds topping 125 miles per hour. And yet that tornado in Clarksville, it tracked for 43 miles, and it was on the ground for over an hour, Fred. And that's why those people died, including that 10-year-old boy that you mentioned before. Here in this community we talked to a couple and they said that as soon as they realized that they were in danger, they ran to the kitchen, the only room in the entire house without windows.
