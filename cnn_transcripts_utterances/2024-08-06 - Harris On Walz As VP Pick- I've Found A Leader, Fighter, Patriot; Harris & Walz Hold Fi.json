It's not a hard case to make, but instead it's been name- calling. It's been calling her a DEI hire and these things that are absolutely radioactive with the swing voters they need to win. What I saw from the ticket tonight was this sort of trying to center themselves. Walz is a progressive that's a fact. Kamala Harris is a progressive that's a fact. But the message did not come across that way. They leaned into language that was very deliberate. You and I know this, they said laws countering gun violence rather than gun control. Because that is a buzzword to Independents and to Moderates of, whoa, whoa, whoa. They're trying to lean into a general election message.

They were worried about Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. They were worried he might lose in a landslide and take them all out.Now, there is unmistakable joy in the Democratic Party. Does that mean they will win 90 days from now? No it does not. But where am I? I'm in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Donald Trump carried this county about 54 percent of the vote. But you know, their state, it's your home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania margins matter. There's a hunt club up the street. There's a gun club up the street. there are farms here. A guy called coach, a guy who he hunts, a guy who in congress had a good rating from the can talk to people here. He speaks their language and that's what the Harris campaign is hoping. Not to win Berks County, but to just get a good margin and then run it up in the Philadelphia suburbs where they're talking about health care, and abortion rights, and things like that. So that's the test. Look, people vote for president. But if you have a happy candidate on top of the ticket, as opposed to a candidate who is not out and visible and then you have a vice president who can go into some communities and be a little different, it might help. The one thing I would say about this as in my travels in the last year, we find so many people who don't trust either party. They say all politicians are in suits and they make promises and they don't follow through. So to see a guy who's comfortable in a t-shirt, and a camouflage hat, who can go to a gun club and shoot some targets. Will it work? It's a little different, so, I think that's the test that I think that's the potential appeal of Governor Walz in places like this.",

She's liberal.Tim Walz got to Minnesota and he did all these big government liberal things, they're going to call him a socialist. He hangs out with Ilhan Omar that's what we're going to throw out. What did the Democrats do today remember you remember this well, when Obama was president and Obama Care hurt the Democrats in those first couple of elections because it hasn't kicked in yet. So how did the Democrats handle that when the Republicans say dangerously liberal, you heard governor Walz saying, you mean, I use government power to help poor kids get free meals or reduced price thanks meals. You mean I use my government power to make abortion rights, The Law of the Land in the state of Minnesota. You mean Donald Trump would take away the Affordable Care Act, which is now quite popular, Obamacare, we're going to protect it. So, when the liberal charges come, can a make the case for their kind of government because tax has been liberal, you know, that doesn't work at a place like this.
