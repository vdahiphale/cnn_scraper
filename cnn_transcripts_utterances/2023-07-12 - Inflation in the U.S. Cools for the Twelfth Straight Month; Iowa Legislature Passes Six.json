      "sentences": "They certainly are happy with this report, Dana, and there's good reason for it. I mean, this is just objectively good news for the White House and for the country as well. When you see inflation falling 12 months in a row, the White House is going to be seizing on that. And it comes with this broader Bidenomics pitch that we have been hearing from the president over the last several weeks.The president today putting out a statement calling this new and encouraging evidence that inflation is falling and that the economy at the same time remains strong. And this is all an indication that as I reported a couple weeks ago on this show, that this White House is increasingly confident in the prospects of that elusive soft landing, having inflation come down, jobs market remaining strong, and avoiding the prospect of a recession. Now to be clear, they are not entirely out of the woods. When you look at the fact that housing, for example, still accounts for 70 percent of inflation, the flip side of that though is that housing tends to be a lagging indicator of inflation. So everything seems to be headed in the right direction. The core inflation metric is at 4.8 percent, which is the lowest since October 2021. Now, the broader question, Dana, can -- will public sentiment catch up with this good economic news because, even as we have seen good economic news building over the last couple months, the public still remains so, so negative on the economy and on the president's handling of the economy. And the White House needs those numbers to change for the president's re-election campaign. Of course, Dana?",

      "sentences": "That is the question politically about public sentiment when it comes to people's everyday lives. As you said, you used the objectively good, that's very true. Jeremy, thank you so much for that report.And Iowa's state legislature passed a six-week abortion ban, making it the latest Republican-led state to limit the procedure in the wake of Roe's reversal. But it's not just any state, it is Iowa, the 'first- in-the-nation' caucus state. Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who convened a special legislative session specifically to take up the abortion ban, says she will sign the bill on Friday. That's the same day GOP presidential hopefuls flock to Iowa for a major gathering of evangelicals. Protesters from both sides of the abortion debate flooded the state capital as lawmakers debated the bill, eventually, passing it largely along party lines. Now, it would go into effect immediately and will provide some exceptions for life of the mother, fetal abnormalities, rape and incest. And my panel is back with me now. Mike Pence is -- was maybe the first out of the gate to tweet a thank you to Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor. \"Grateful to see Iowa Republicans and Governor Kim Reynolds standing for life. Pro-life Americans are cheering you on!\" I mean, he is going hard for the evangelical vote. This is something that clearly is important when it comes to the lives and how people deal with this issue inside Iowa, but also to the campaign trail. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Politically, what does this mean? Does this mean if you're Donald Trump, if you're Nikki Haley, if you're any of these other folks who have been a little fuzzy in terms of what they think the actual time limit should be, does this force them to name a time period, a sort of number of weeks? That's the big question. You see, Donald Trump has moved on this a little bit, saying that there is some sort of role for the federal government. Well, is he going to get to the point where he has to say it has to be six weeks or ten weeks or whatever? Because you're right, I mean, the evangelical vote there is so strong. Somebody like Mike Pence, obviously, has a following among evangelicals. Ron DeSantis is doing what he did in Florida. You've had some folks kind of criticize Ron DeSantis saying this is going to -- this would make him a weak candidate in general, and Donald Trump certainly mindful of the politics of abortion. So where does this move folks on the campaign trail?",

Trump's mad and DeSantis is happy and Casey DeSantis is happy. So I think by furthering that alignment, what you're seeing is the important role that the abortion debate may play in raising the stakes in terms of appeasing the base of the party.And that means a couple of things. It means Chris Christie is probably not going to win Iowa for the Republican Party. And it's more evidence of the GOP base kind of doubling down that the 2024 election could be a very big bet. If they are going to voters in the general election with whoever the nominee is and saying, six-week abortion ban or anything close to it, culture war stuff, and let Biden own the Bidenomics argument.",

He has to strike this very delicate balance obviously between showing Ukraine that the U.S., obviously, robustly supports them in their war against Ukraine, but also reiterating that now is not the time for them to join NATO. And so, he has to really strike this delicate balance between empathizing, of course, with what Zelenskyy is going through and with what his country needs, but also of course explaining why now is not the right time for Ukraine to be a member of that alliance.I think what we're going to hear today is very similar to what we heard in his remarks with President Zelenskyy earlier before their bilateral meeting, which is that the U.S. is not going anywhere. Just because they don't have membership in NATO right now does not mean that the U.S. is going to abandon Ukraine. That's the message that he's going to send as he tries to reiterate here that the NATO Alliance, they are united. They first and foremost are thinking about their defense and their deterrence, but they are also thinking about of course supporting Ukraine in any way that they can possibly can. And so, he's going to reaffirm that unwavering support. He's going to talk about the value and having this unified alliance in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who of course thought that he could divide the alliance, when in fact he has actually made it bigger. Of course, we saw that Sweden just joined the alliance. And so, I think that that's really going to be the message that Biden sends, especially given that he has such a trans-Atlantic (ph), right, he values the partnerships that he has with the European allies and of course, that now includes President Zelenskyy and Ukraine.",

Finland and Sweden have both joined and that has expanded NATO's border with Russia really exponentially, dramatically in a way that Vladimir Putin likely did not anticipate.And so, the message that he will be sending is that we are not backing down from supporting Ukraine.

And so, if they were to import this war into the alliance by allowing Ukraine to come in, then the argument is that America would perhaps have to send troops to Ukraine, to the front lines.That is not something that Joe Biden wants to do. He does not want to send troops to defend Ukraine. He does not believe that this is the -- it is the right moment to do that. And so, that is the primary argument here.
