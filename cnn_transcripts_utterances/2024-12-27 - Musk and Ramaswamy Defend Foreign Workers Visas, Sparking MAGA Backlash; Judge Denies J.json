So those are not the jobs that are being offshored to India. Those are more lower skilled jobs, some very important jobs that tech companies do rely on, and we wish they were here in the United States.But that is another issue that Donald Trump, again, ran against. Make America great again, bring jobs back to America. Why don't you invest in unions? If you don't think America is smart enough, why don't you fully invest in our public education system? Unfortunately, under the libertarian aspect of these tech companies and these tech leaders, they want to dismantle all of government, which is essentially what makes this country so smart and so strong. We need to invest in our people and education. We need to open up jobs, protect our labor force, so they don't go offshore, not just at the convenience of these billionaire tech workers who want to take advantage of one small program to their liking.",

And I think this particular attorney and Jay-Z were put in a tough situation.How? You're really given allegations by a litigant who is anonymous. The identity is not known. You have to fight against that. And then it's revealed that significant parts of her story have inconsistencies. Like her father apparently picking her up at a gas station. The father being contacted saying, hey, I don't remember that. Like her naming another celebrity that she spoke to that evening and representatives saying, hey, you know, he wasn't even in the state. He was on tour in the Midwest at the time. So you have to fight against these allegations. Now, generally speaking, what happens, Erica, is that us attorneys don't learn these inconsistencies until the litigation goes forward and you interview witnesses. Because it's Jay-Z and it's so public, there's been interviews of this particular alleged victim. And so the attorney got ahead of it, filed a motion to dismiss the judge saying, hey, it's premature and stop wasting my time. So at the end of the day, the judge will get over it. The case will turn on the facts. It'll turn on what happened or did not happen. And everything will ensue. And if it's right, then the victim, alleged victim will be compensated accordingly. And Jay-Z will be held accountable. And if it's wrong, then it'll be thrown out. And so that'll happen sometime in the near future.",

It remains low. But there is growing concern over bird flu spreading to other animals. CNN's Randi Kaye reports that more than half the big cats at a wildlife sanctuary in Washington state died after contracting the virus.

The video from August was taken at the Wild Felid Advocacy Center of Washington, a big cat sanctuary where Thumper lived.
