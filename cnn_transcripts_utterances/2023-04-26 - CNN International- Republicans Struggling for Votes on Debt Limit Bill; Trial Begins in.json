I just can't get past $32 trillion in debt. REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): Do the math, do the numbers and come out with something stronger.

So, the father of one of the slain Americans has confirmed to CNN that he was contacted by an official from the U.S. Marines, who confirmed that the purported mastermind of the suicide bombing had in fact been killed by the Taliban.

Since the defeat and the collapse of the Western backed Afghan government, Afghanistan always a poor country has been plunged further into penury and on the brink of famine.

The dividing line between the Russians and the Ukrainians. They also say that the Russians have started to evacuate civilians from Russian held territory there. Something that we also saw ahead of a Ukrainian counter offensive last year, which ended up with the Ukrainians retaking the city of Kherson. Now yesterday the Ukrainian defense intelligence or at least a unit of Ukrainian defense intelligence released a video which appears to show a Ukrainian drone strike on what the Ukrainians said was a Russian surveillance complex in the Kherson region. Now CNN has geo located the video you're seeing there to the Russian held side of the river and hydroelectric power plant there specifically. Whether or not Ukrainian troops have actually crossed that dividing line, the Dnipro River, is still very much an open question. On Sunday, the Ukrainian military would not confirm or deny claims circulating -- unofficial claims circulating on Russian social media channels that they had done that. Saying that right now the operation requires information silence until it is safer for the Ukrainian military to see more. You're also seeing in the Zaporizhia region, the Russians saying that the Ukrainians are building up troops east of Zaporizhia. And the Ukrainian, saying that the Russians are starting to again evacuate civilians on the Russian held side of the Dnipro River there around the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant. So, all of this taken collectively seems to point to some kind of a Ukrainian counter offensive that is on the horizon.
