The only problem is this dog is not Cricket. It is a dog named Blue, very much alive. But how did Blue end up as the face of political scandal?Well, our Donie O'Sullivan looked into it and found the picture came from a Reddit user. It was posted more than a year ago. But then it was picked up on Twitter when the Kristi Noem story went viral, and the dog then was identified as Cricket. It spread like wildfire, even published by one of the UK's biggest newspapers. Even though it's been debunked, it still popped up today as Cricket. Thanks for joining us. Anderson starts now.",

Former FBI director James Comey joins us ahead.Also breaking news tonight, a New York Times report on a second controversial flag flown at the home owned by Justice Samuel Alito. The reporter on both stories is here. And Nikki Haley, she called Trump unhinged, but now says she will vote for him. Will the Republicans who voted for her do the same? Good evening. Thanks for joining us. A shouting match erupted today in a federal court in Florida during the first of a series of pretrial motions in the long-delayed case against the former president for mishandling classified documents. There were two pretrial hearings today, bids by the former president and a co-defendant to throw the case out. The classified documents case no longer has a trial date, as you probably know. The judge in the case, Aileen Cannon, has allowed a number of pretrial motions to stack up and delay proceedings. Just last night, we reported on these photos, which we'd not seen before. There are the co-defendant, Walt Nauta, Trump's former valet from the White House, who still works closely with him. The photos show Nauta moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago on June 1st 2022, just before a Trump attorney was supposed to search for those boxes at Mar- a-Lago for classified documents, something he had to do under subpoena. Prosecutors say that Nauta moved the boxes as part of an alleged conspiracy to conceal classified material from federal investigators. Now, the photos were part of a federal judge's opinion, saying that investigators had strong evidence that the former president intended to hide classified documents. She also noted that an empty folder marked \"Classified Evening Summary\" was discovered in this bedroom months after the FBI search. That same filing from last night also included the standard operating procedure for when the FBI conducts a search. Agents, as they always are in such a search, were armed, which has led Trump and some of his supporters to suggest that the agency was out to kill him. Trump actually posted on his social media site: \"WOW. I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\" Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said the FBI were, quote, \"planning to assassinate President Trump.\" They weren't. Again, the agency was following protocol and Secret Service was made aware of the search in advance, and Trump was not there. There's still no trial date in the classified documents case, and based on today's hearing, no indication of when a date will be set. Evan Perez joins us from Florida, outside the courthouse. What was the shouting match about?",

They were arguing that Walt Nauta is the subject of selective and vindictive prosecution.And one of the things that Stan Woodward, his attorney, was arguing today was that he recounted an episode where he said prosecutors were essentially trying to pressure him to try to get Walt Nauta to cooperate with this investigation. He said there was this meeting where prosecutors mentioned the fact that he had applied for a judgeship and the chances of getting that judgeship. Now, that prompted a very sharp reply from prosecutors. David Harbach stood up and said that his interpretation of those events were fantasy. The judge at one point had to tell everybody to calm down because things had gotten so heated during this hearing. These were two hearings, Anderson, that took over five hours for the judge to hear. Again, she didn't rule from the bench, as she usually doesn't, but she did seem skeptical of these efforts by the defendants to try to dismiss these charges, Anderson.",

So in the search warrant documents, in a federal search warrant and I think we have this that we can put up on the screen.

It says, do not use your gun, cops, FBI agents, unless it is absolutely necessary to save a life.

The Times reports the flag dates back to the Revolutionary War and fell into obscurity until it was resurrected recently as a symbol of support for the former president by a religious faction of the so- called Stop the Steal movement, which falsely claims that Biden lost the election. And this follows a separate New York Times report last week about an upside down American flag flown at the Alito home in Virginia in 2021.Justice Alito said it was raised by his wife during a clash with a neighbor who had cursed at her. Both stories come as Alito and the Supreme Court are due to rule on cases related to the January 6th riot, including the question of presidential immunity.   I'm joined by Jodi Kantor, who reported on both stories for The Times, and by Norm Eisen, former counsel to House Democrats during Trump's first impeachment.

But in the last decade has taken on a really freighted meaning and became very associated with the Stop the Steal campaign. It popped up a lot in the crowd at the riot. Now, Anderson, as you know, it's just a baseline kind of bedrock rule that judges are not supposed to have political displays. So the question becomes, what is Justice Samuel Alito doing displaying this flag, which is so politically sensitive, which appears to connote an opinion, although we don't know that much about the particulars of exactly who raised it and why. He didn't want to answer our questions. But he's doing this, first of all, last summer, as the obstruction case that is so key to the prosecution of January 6th is arriving at the court.

But here's the thing, I've heard over and over again people sort of saying, oh, Nikki Haley is getting these large shares of the votes even though she's not in the race. I should point out that four years ago, Bernie Sanders was getting about the exact same vote in the Democratic primaries after he dropped out of the race. So, this isn't something to me that's terribly unusual. The thing that would have been unusual was if Nikki Haley decided not to throw her support behind Donald Trump, then it would've been very interesting to see what happened to that 14 percent of voters.
