Right now, the man who sold Hunter Biden the gun at the center of this federal trial is on the stand. The president's son is charged with illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while using drugs in the case brought by special counsel, David Weiss. Earlier today, prosecutors called Hunter's ex-wife, Kathleen, and his ex-girlfriend, Zoe Kestan, both of whom testified about Hunter's past drug use. Kestan acknowledged that Hunter Biden smoked crack almost constantly in private, though not in public. She also said she helped him by drugs from a dealer she knew. Hunter Biden's defense team tried to poke holes in the prosecution's case today by acknowledging Hunter's struggles with addiction, and suggesting there is no proof he was on drugs the very day he bought that firearm. Hunter Biden faces not only this trial, of course, but a federal tax trial in California scheduled from September. And today while Hunter Biden was inside courthouse, Republicans referred both him and his uncle, James Biden, to the Justice Department, a criminal referral, alleging they lied to Congress during Republicans' impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. First, to the federal gun trial in Wilmington, Delaware, CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse. Paula, how significant is today's testimony as prosecutors begin to try to build their case?",

All his ex-wife did testify that she found a crack pipe in the family home in 2015. She also testified that she never directly observed him doing drugs, but his former girlfriend testified about the time they spent together, lengthy stays and luxury hotels where she said she observed him smoking crack approximately every 20 minutes. She also testified that she observed him smoking crack in September 2018, and that is significant because it cuts against the defenses argument that by that point, he was clean and just using alcohol.Now, she also testified on cross-examination by a Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, that she didn't see him again for September until November. So she didn't see him in October 2018, which is when he purchased this firearm. So, she has no direct knowledge of whether he was using illegal drugs during that month.

Now, she was not on the stand for very long, but once the girlfriend got up there and she started testifying about these luxury hotels they were in, the sketchy drug dealers she would encounter in these fancy dinners -- I mean, they were wrapped, they were very attentive to her testimony, which is good because her testimony about the fall of 2018 could prove to be critical here.",

She had no idea who he was, what she described him as being very friendly, charming. She said he was really chatty. And at one point though, he stepped out onto a balcony in this room to smoke, which she now realizes was crack it. She said he actually blew through that 30 minutes that he had purchased without ever getting that private dance.

Specifically, they're talking about to false statements that Hunter Biden allegedly made, one that James Biden allegedly made. They allege that Hunter Biden testified to a, quote, entirely fictitious account about an apparent text message involving an interaction with a Chinese businessman.Also, they say that James Biden said that his father did not meet with a Biden family associated when they say that they have proved that he did meet with a Biden family associate that apparently counter allegedly happened when Joe Biden was not president of the United States, was actually the was a private citizen at that time. But in this statement put out by these three House committee chairman, they say Hunter Biden and Joe Biden made materially false statements and the Oversight and the Judiciary Committee as demonstrated by the evidence presented in the attached referral, the nature of these false statements is not lost on the committees. Every instance implicates Joe Biden's knowledge of and role in his family's influence, peddling. Now, it's important to point out that Republicans have yet to prove that Joe Biden acted corruptly or did any sort of quid pro quo with his son involving his business dealings or personally enriched himself in any way. Republicans have been trying to make that case for months, really since the beginning of this Congress, and in the fall when they launched a -- formally launched this impeachment inquiry. But this has not yet moved ahead because Republicans simply don't have the support to impeach Joe Biden. They can certainly make criminal referrals, but that does not mean the Justice Department will act on it. We have reached out to the Biden's also for comment.

Is Jack Smith a prosecutor who's able to even bring a charge in federal court under the Justice Department?

How unusual is it for a judge to allow this hearing where third parties unrelated to the case are allowed to come in and argue things in court? VICTORIA NOURSE, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THEN-VP JOE BIDEN: Extremely unusual because the idea in a criminal prosecution, the state brings it on behalf of the people, and they are supposed to speak in the name of the rule of law. And you can't just cede this to other parties. It's not the Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court, you get all sorts of friends of the court briefs. But it's very unusual to allow this argument not only because it's been rejected so often, it's really a kind of caused by some conservatives since Ed Meese has filed briefs on the Supreme Court and immunity case on this. They believe special prosecutors violate the separation of powers and they've used every ton of argument where you hear appointments clause, et cetera, to try to get rid of these special prosecutors.

That should hold us up to the highest level of standards. You know, for me, that is a deeply humbling experience as a son of immigrants, of public school kid gets to work a job whose jobs description is Article One of the Constitution. So I just have to say, you know, I think that people in New Jersey are fed up with Senator Menendez, just tired of this politics that is frankly just embarrassing to our state, and to our country. And we deserve better representation. So I'm really proud that I was able to get past the primary election last night and I will win in November, even if it means that I have to take on both Senator Menendez as well as a Republican.",

It must stop completely. Judge McAfee had allowed work to continue in the pretrial phase while the appeals process was playing out. So that is being overridden now by the appeals according itself, as it sorts out this disqualification issue.

The court of appeals, what they've done is they've granted the appeal of the defendants, Donald Trump and several other defendants motion to disqualify the D.A. Fani Willis, based on conflict of interest.We had a long hearing and try a mini-trial about this a few months ago. The trial court judge, Judge McAfee, found that there were some problems with a conflict of interest, but he said that their remedied by the prosecutor, the other prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade resigning. Now, Donald Trump and other co-defendants appealed that. And this tells me that the court of appeals in Georgia is interests stayed in hearing the issue.

And so, look, this is the appeals court saying, look, the work on this case needs to stop until we can sort out whether or not we agree with Scott McAfee that Fani Willis can remain on this case or if we disagree in that Fani Willis needs to be disqualified, removed, ultimately, in the timeline in for potential trial as Elie said, this makes the chances of a trial happening before the presidential election almost zero when they were already low before. But now, it really throws up near whether trial will happen at all.

I don't personally believe that they made a strong enough showing of a direct financial conflict of interest, as Zach laid out in the trial court and Judge Scott McAfee and the trial court agreed he came to the same conclusion, but I do think its significant that Judge McAfee found that there were significant issues with whether D.A. Willis's testimony was truthful. Judge McAfee said that in his ruling.And he found that Fani Willis had made improper out-of-court statements about this case, including a speech she gave it a church where she essentially called the defendants and the defense lawyers racist and Judge McAfee raised concerns about that. So it could also be that the court of appeals, its concerned with those issues of the case. It may perhaps in addition to or perhaps beyond any financial conflict of interests.",
