Now, these officials are going down with asks, and officials tell me that they include the following: moving migrants South, those being migrants that are at the Northern border now. Also, controlling railways, which are often used by migrants to more quickly get to the U.S. Southern border. And also providing incentives for them not to journey to the border to begin with. Like, for example, visas. Now, as you heard there from the Eagle Pass mayor, border towns are growing restless and placing more pressure on the Biden administration to do more on this. And this is a step that the administration is taking to try to provide some relief. And the U.S. has historically leaned on Mexico in moments like this to stem the flow, but whether they can get a grasp on the unprecedented surge is still unclear.",

But in that meeting at the White House, we've got that key Netanyahu confidant, Ron Dermer, a White House official telling CNN that they did talk about, among other things, the transition of this war, focusing on high-value Hamas targets like Yahya Sinwar or his brother, Muhammad Sinwar, improving the humanitarian situation. And another topic that they discussed: minimizing harm to civilians. That is really crucial right now, along with securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages. More than 100 of them believed to still be alive. But again, they're also going to plan, they say, for post-conflict Gaza. And this is the crucial question that, at least publicly, we haven't heard a particularly great answer to from Israeli officials. What is their plan after they achieve their military objectives? How do they help Gaza rebuild and become prosperous and stable and not just create another whole other generation of people with so much hatred, after experiencing this relentless bombardment, that it's just a whole new crop of terrorists and another attack waiting to happen down the road: If not Hamas, then some other organization.",

Huge majorities of the American people see the border as a real crisis. They think that Joe Biden has failed on it. And so if you were ever going to get most of what you want in divided government, now would be the time. And so I do think there's a lot of Republican constituents out there who don't want to see this drag on. They'd love to see a solution today. They'd love to see Republicans get most, if not all, of HR-2, which is the House immigration bill. So I -- I think that it's been lingering for so long. And the chance to score one here, for the conservatives, is too great, in my opinion, to let it go. And I think that, if I were Joe Biden, I'd be up on Capitol Hill on my hands and knees, begging for anything to sign here, because failure to do so is going to drag him. This is one of his biggest political problems, is the failure at the border. The video we're showing this morning, do you think the American people look at that and say, \"Looks good; looks fine to me\"? Of course -- it's not just his base he ought to be worried about.

With somebody like Nikki Haley, she can step in and she can say, I am calm, I'm collected. I am non-chaotic. I see that there is a crisis at the border. And I can benefit from this, because I have solutions. And I have solutions that are in the vein of conservatism. But also, to anybody watching, anyone who's independent, anybody who is perhaps liberal but, you know, maybe feels deeply uncomfortable with the policies that Donald Trump and the rhetoric that Donald Trump is proposing, she can step in in that moment and say, I have the presidential viewpoint. And I think this is the kind of thing that she's been using when she's been campaigning across the country. And we've also really seen her step it up in advertising, especially in areas like New Hampshire, where instead of, you know, where she's become the frontrunner for the Republican primary and sees herself really -- or is building herself up as a direct contrast, not just to Joe Biden and this idea of decisiveness.
