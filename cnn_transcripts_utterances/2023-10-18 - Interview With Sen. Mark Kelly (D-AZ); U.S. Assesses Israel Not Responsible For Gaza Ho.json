Today, he lost 22.One of the questions that we have been asking is whether, once they gavel this vote, whether David Joyce of Ohio would try to offer a resolution giving Patrick McHenry more powers. My understanding -- I'm just getting a text -- is that that is not going to happen right away. And we will certainly want to hear from Manu and our other colleagues who walk these halls every day. But my understanding is, it's not going to happen right away. In fact, Manu, let me go to you, because I'm just want to tell you this text that I'm getting is that -- and you're probably hearing it from members who are coming off the floor right now, that -- Manu, you're probably hearing from members who are saying that the Jordan folks are very much lobbying many in the Republican Conference to hold off and not vote right now to empower Patrick McHenry. So, what is likely going to happen -- and you telegraphed this earlier -- is that, once this vote is gabbled closed, they're going to go back and talk again, like they have done after every one of these, and that David Joyce of Ohio is going to try to make the case for why it's time to move on for Jim Jordan -- move on from Jim Jordan, rather, and talk about giving Patrick McHenry the power to get the basic functions of the United States government done, at least in the short term. What are you hearing?",

Mr. -- yes, yes, we're on right now. We're actually live right now, Mr. Lawler. Tell us what you think the next steps are going to be here. I mean, if Jordan goes to a third ballot, you're still going to vote against him. Is that right? And if he continues to go in the wrong direction, what's next? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Look, it's clear he doesn't have the votes. Obviously, it's up to him if he wants to put it to a third ballot. I think you will see more folks dropping off on a third ballot. Here, there was a net loss of two. Four people who previously voted for him flipped, and two that didn't flipped back. But I don't -- I don't see the outcome changing here. And so the question for Jim and for the conference is, how do we get back to work? Because that's the reality that we have to deal with. The American people sent us here to govern. They sent us here to focus on the issues that matter to them, from spending, to the border, to the international crises that we're dealing with in Israel and Ukraine. And we have to get back to work. So, if the votes are not there at the moment for someone to be speaker, I think it's imperative that we empower Patrick McHenry to serve, at least for the time being, in that speaker role, so that he can get the House moving again on critical issues, including, obviously, needed additional financial support for Israel.",

He never should have been removed as speaker. And, frankly, I reiterate, it's disingenuous of some of my Democratic colleagues to stand up there and say, for democracy and for the institution, and we're putting people over politics; 208 Democrats teamed up with eight Republicans to create this chaos. So they can act like they played no role here, but they did. And so it is -- it's unfortunate where we are, but we have to get back to work.

Which means that things that should be going on right now when it comes to the wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine, as well as the basic functions of the U.S. government -- we're about to -- the U.S. government is about to run out of money -- are not able to proceed. The House Republicans are not able to pick a speaker. This has now been going on for roughly two weeks. Let me bring in Anderson Cooper, who is in a part of the world that is paying a lot of attention to the fact that House Republicans are not able to get their act together and get 217 votes to pick a leader. Anderson, you are just a few minutes away from President Biden having left Israel, where he was able to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and talk to officials there. But Arab leaders called off their meetings with President Biden directly because of the explosion at the hospital in Gaza, an explosion that there seems to be mounting evidence was not caused by Israel. Again, we were -- we do not have a definitive answer as to who caused it, but there does seem to be mounting evidence that it was actually caused by a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad.",

The president expressed unwavering support for Israel. He also cautioned Israel not to act out of revenge, paraphrasing his words, though he certainly supported Israel's right to defend itself in the wake of this horrific terror attack that occurred on October 7. In terms of the explosion of the hospital, the U.S. has concluded -- the NSC, the National Security Council, had put out a statement a short time ago, saying they believe essentially the account that Israel has also concluded, that the explosion at the hospital hours ago, last evening, middle of the night here in -- actually, earlier in the evening in Israel, was, in fact, caused by a rocket by Islamic Jihad.

They are willing to allow that humanitarian aid across from Egypt through the Rafah Crossing. And I think a couple of takeaways I have had from today, from what we have heard publicly said, is, we're not hearing anything more about Palestinians in Gaza being allowed to go into Egypt. There's been very strong pushback from the Egyptian president, President Sisi, on that. And I think one of President -- one of the things President Biden perhaps has not been able to do as well as he would have hoped to have done if he had been able to meet with President Sisi, with King Abdullah in Jordan, with the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, because that meeting was canceled, that he would have been able to be more persuasive, potentially, face to face to allow that -- to allow to get those countries to allow and push Hamas to get that humanitarian aid into Hamas. Obviously, Israel is saying, look, that aid can't cross the border if it's going to fall in under the control of Hamas. But, also, for the Arab countries around here in this region, they also view the passing through of humanitarian aid not just something that can help Palestinians, but also, in a way, a potential sop for Israel to -- because Israel says let the aid come through -- a potential sop that would allow Israel some cover, if you want to use that language, to prosecute potentially a ground offensive. And I don't think, from where we're at with the discussions and the tensions at the moment, that these nations like Jordan, like Egypt really want to be seen to be in any way giving support or cover for a continued offensive. And we heard that today coming from the Saudi foreign minister, who in Jeddah, chaired a meeting of the Organization of Islamic countries, a very big organization. And they're calling for a humanitarian pause. And we know, at the United Nations today, there was also at the Security Council a call, a motion for a humanitarian pause in the conflict. And it was the United States that voted that down. So there's a real sense here of whose pressure is going to be applied more? If you let humanitarian aid in, then that gives Israel the opportunity to say that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people are being met and, therefore, press ahead with a ground offensive. And that's perhaps one of the only points of leverage that these countries that surround Israel, Egypt, Jordan here, have to apply pressure -- there's another detonation there in Gaza -- to apply pressure on Israel about their situation. They don't have many ways to pressure Israel. But on the humanitarian aid, potentially, that is one of their only leverage points at the moment -- Anderson.",
