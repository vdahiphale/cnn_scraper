Standby to see the video and hear what Ventura's husband is now saying about it.Also this hour, President Biden ramps up his outreach to black voters who could potentially make or break his re-election bid. He's marking the civil rights milestone by warning that Donald Trump and his allies want a country for some, but not for all. And breaking news tonight, the world's number one pro golfer just spoke out about being arrested and charged with felony assault. Scottie Scheffler trying to downplay accusations that he injured a police officer while trying to drive past the scene of a fatal crash. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in The Situation Room. We're following breaking news first this hour, the disturbing video of Sean Diddy Combs obtained exclusively by CNN, and the new reaction just coming in. We want to warn our viewers, the video includes scenes of violence that viewers may find very difficult to watch. CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister broke the story for us. She's joining us now live.

But back in November 2023, Cassie, who is Diddy's ex-girlfriend, and many people know her for her hit song, Me and You, she filed a lawsuit against Diddy.And in that lawsuit, she detailed an incident that she alleged happened in March 2016. And now we have obtained this footage that we are seeing play out right now in front of us that corroborates Cassie's allegations. There you see that Diddy is dragging her in this hallway. He is kicking her. He is shoving her. He -- you know, it's really difficult to watch, Wolf, because it is so violent. Now, as I said, this mirrors her lawsuit. And what's so interesting about it is it's really a play by play of everything thing that she alleged. I want to read you some pieces from her lawsuit, Wolf, in or around March 2016, Mr. Combs became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye. The lawsuit goes on to say that because of that incident inside their hotel room, that she then fled the hotel room, and that is what we see her in the hallway. It says he followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. He grabbed at her, then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator. And he's trying to escape. Now, in that footage, we do see him picking up a glass vase and throwing it towards her. You see right there, back in the mirror, where Diddy is. It's a bit hard to see, but he grabs that vase and he throws it at her. Now, what is interesting about this Wolf is Diddy has denied all of this. You know, there is a settlement with this lawsuit, so he hasn't been able to speak specifically about Cassie, but he has been maintaining his innocence as all of these lawsuits have piled up against him. And now, again, we are seeing this play out right in front of our face quite different than him saying that I deny all of these allegations against me.",

I would not be surprised if some of the lawyers that are representing the other plaintiffs, aren't going to use this video to try to extract a higher value settlement out of P. Diddy and his team, or if these matters do or any of them proceed to trial, we should expect to see a lawyer is trying to introduce this evidence as prior bad conduct evidence on the part of P. Diddy.This could not be more horrible, horrifying, obviously for victims, for Cassie who had to endure this kind of abuse.

And how do you come back from that?Honestly, you know, I've been doing this for a while now as an entertainment reporter, and it was a bit of an open secret in some corridors in terms of the music industry that Diddy and had a temper. People had accused him of being violent back in the 90s. He was alleged to have gotten to a major altercation with Steve Stout and was alleged to have beaten him, and that became a court case. And there were other instances throughout the years where people said that, you know, this is who Diddy is, but he has so much power.

Are there other videos involving other victims? Are there videos actually involving Cassie? And when did those incidents, when did these brutal attacks occur? You know, there are always statutes of limitations that have to be considered when you're thinking about charges, whether there's a criminal case that's going to be filed or civil actions.But, clearly, this video, I think, is going to be a substantial piece of evidence that will be reviewed by law enforcement agencies that are looking at Sean Combs. And this is not going to -- I don't think this is going to end well for him. We've seen this happen with other powerful men. Once the evidence starts to come out, other victims find their voices and they start to come forward as well.

People are concerned about the border, and they're also concerned worried about national security. And this is a factor and a problem that the Biden administration is going to have. And, look Trump is going to capitalize on that. And Frank Luntz, who is a conservative pollster, has done a lot of polling, he says even black voters are looking at Trump as someone that they can relate to as a victim of what they see as an unjust justice system.

But the reason it's salient today, some three years later, Wolf, is because the justices are now considering cases that trace to the January 6th riots at the Capitol, one involving some of the defendants who want to challenge their charges, and one, you know, involving a very momentous case involving Donald Trump and his claim of immunity from any trial for election subversion. And as you know, justices or judges are supposed to recuse himself if there's any appearance of partiality here and not where their fairness would be questioned. And here's what Samuel Alito said though, about the incident in a statement to The New York Times, which first reported it, I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag. It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of an objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs. So, he's suggesting that this was all something that was in his wife's hands and nothing, he's brushed aside any kind of concerns about his own impartiality, Wolf.",

And it takes more than one punch to devastate the very strong proof, which I believe the district attorney has adduced here. It didn't knock Michael Cohen out either. He didn't recant his testimony. He was clearly shaken, but he stood by what he had said. So I thought it was an important moment, but not dispositive in the case. They will redirect by making clear that in context that this call was a brief one, that there was ample time for multiple subjects. You can get a lot into 96 seconds. We do that all the time, Wolf. And finally, that there are other direct calls with Trump, including two on the morning of October 26, clearly placed by Cohen directly to Trump that also substantiate Trump's involvement with a great deal of other evidence.",
