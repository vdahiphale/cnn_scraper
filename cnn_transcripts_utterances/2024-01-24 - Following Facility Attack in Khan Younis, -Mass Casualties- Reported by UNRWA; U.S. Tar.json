The United Nations Relief Agencyis reporting mass casualties after its training center in Khan Younis in Southern Gaza was hit. The director of UNRWA affairs tweeted that a building was ablaze and that access to and from the center has been denied for two days, trapping people inside. He now says, at least nine are dead and 75 injured. The Israel Defense Forces has been intensifying its assault on Khan Younis over the past 48 hours and it says it has surrounded the city. That, after thousands of people have been fleeing further south. We've got Nic Robertson standing by. He's been following the story for us from Tel Aviv.

They're now saying there were 800 people in the shelter specifically that was hit. The U.N. is saying that the building was hit by two tank rounds, and as you say, nine people killed, 75 injured. An eyewitness there at the shelter described Israeli tanks being outside of the shelter, describing seeing people with many shrapnel wounds. Also describing the situation at the shelter whereby they haven't been able to leave the shelter for two days because it's been too dangerous. Now, this falls in an area that the IDF has had an uptick in activity, an area that they have told local residents that they should leave and that area includes two hospitals and a Palestinian Red Crescent headquarters as well. In those hospitals and at the Red Crescent headquarters as well, they've described a similar situation over the past few days where it's too dangerous to leave. That the medical facilities can't operate properly. That there are people who need dialysis, people at the hospitals within hundreds of people with infectious diseases, and -- or infections, rather, and pregnant women. So, it's an area where the IDF now describes that they have encircled Khan Younis. That they are continuing to target terror cells there. That they say that they have rounded up weapons caches in that area. But absolutely, it's been a focus of an intensification of the fight in that area of Khan Younis. And the U.N. now giving us a little more clarity on precisely what happened. There are so many people now desperately seek shelter, many of them in U.N. compounds and U.N. buildings that are absolutely crammed and crowded because they normally wouldn't house and hold so many people. This appears to be one of those buildings. And as we now know, nine people died, 75 injured. Some of the details we can't get to at the moment is, is it safe for those people who are injured there to be taken to the nearby hospitals? These are the very same hospitals that say they can't evacuate patients and the doctors as instructed to by IDF. The IDF has told people in that area to move to one of the safe areas nearby by the coast road. The -- so, it's a very dangerous area, and there are details about this that we're still only learning right now.",

The plane crashed inside Russia, close to the border with Ukraine. A regional governor says, there were no survivors. Details about the flight have been murky. Russia claiming the plane was carrying Ukrainian military members ahead of a prisoner exchange earlier. Ukrainians also said it was transporting weapons. That incident in western Russia happened on the hills of an especially intense round of Russian strikes on Ukraine's two larger cities. Ukrainian officials say, Kharkiv alone came under attack three times on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that nationwide, 18 people were killed and 130 were wounded after missiles hit some 200 sites, more than half of them dwellings. Fred Pleitgen joins us now from eastern Ukraine with more on this plane crash. This incident, where Russia and Ukraine are currently conducting investigations in terms of what happened.

Butsomething obviously changed in the last 24 hours because Orban was saying yesterday that the Swedish Prime Minister should come to his country to negotiate Sweden's ascension to NATO. Now all of a sudden, he is saying that he supports Sweden's NATO bid and will try to push that through the Hungarian parliament as soon as it returns to sitting, which should be on February 1st is when the normal session is expected to resume. Something happened in the last 24 hours. What that was is not clear. We know that there was a phone call from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. What was said in that call is unclear, but Hungary's position has been that it always was open to Sweden joining the NATO alliance. But it's always also made clear that there are some issues that needed to be worked out. Sweden has been very critical of Hungary in the past and some of the backsliding on democracy that we have seen in that country. And so, Hungary's position is that the two countries needed to clear the air. And there have been talks taking place in the background for some time, and perhaps there was a carrot or maybe a stick offered to Hungary to make them come around. When it comes to Turkey and them approving Sweden's NATO bid, this has been going on for 20 months, like it has with the Hungarians. And it was actually in June of last year that the Turks said that Sweden had satisfied what they wanted, but it -- they wanted one more issue, and that was for the Americans to sell them F-16 fighter jets. And that has not happened yet. Now, the full Congress in the United States does not need to sign off on this, but there are some influential people who could block it, including the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, who was asked about this issue yesterday. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN CARDIN, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT:  They have indicated before that they were going to move on this. So, we want to see the accession documents completed.

And we're just waiting for a press conference between Ebrahim Raisi and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the presidents of Iran andTurkey, at a time when dialogue is badly, badly needed in the Middle East. Iran and Turkey, some people have described them as frenemies. They have definitely some things in common. They want to increase economic ties. They see eye to eye on their criticism of Israel. President Erdogan has been extremely outspoken, calling Israel a terrorist state, even comparing Prime Minister Netanyahu to Hitler. But beyond that, that's where things start to diverge somewhat. Turkey has not been willing to match its harsh rhetoric on Israel with actual action, with sanctions, with any kind of cutting off of economic ties between the two countries. I actually spoke with Erdogan's top advisor on foreign affairs last month who said that there are no plans for sanctions because Turkey views economic activity between the two countries as a state-to- state issue. Just today though, you have Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, calling on Muslim nations to cut off Israel politically and economically. The argument there is that, look, Israel's not going to end the war in Gaza on its own. It needs to be pressured into doing so. Obviously, there are other issues at play here as well, Eleni. Iran has been using its proxies in Lebanon, in Yemen, in Iraq, in Syria, to sort of widen this conflict already. Turkey isn't interested in that. They want to see there would be a ceasefire in Gaza and for the temperature to come down. So, we're just waiting to see what the two men say about what might happen next in this very volatile region at the moment.",

But the Republican base is not that general electorate. And that's part of the case that Nikki Haley is making this morning in South Carolina on the airwaves. She has a rally tonight, where she'll make that case as well. You know, she probably will not win South Carolina but will continue to expose what Donald Trump's weaknesses are.

Candidates don't leave because they can't win. Candidates leave races because they can't spend. And if her money dries up, it means that Haley will probably then have to go away. But if she gets a strong result in South Carolina or is seeing some form of momentum, even if that's not above 50 percent, her donors are much more likely to stay in.

Dr. Nicholas Ashton is one of the lead authors of the study. He's also a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg, and he joins us now live from Gothenburg, Sweden. Sir, great to have you with us. And this is fantastic news. You know, creating an easier pathway to test for Alzheimer's, something that I think many people have been, in some way, impacted by in their families.

NICHOLAS ASHTON, PROFESSOR OF NEUROCHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG AND A LEAD AUTHOR OF STUDY IN JOURNAL JAMA NEUROLOGY:  Yes. So, thank you for having me. We -- I think we've known for a number of years, the potential of a blood test for Alzheimer's disease have been several studies and several breakthroughs. What is different about this study is now we're testing a test which is basically commercially available by this company ALZpath. So, we were acted as an independent laboratory that specialize in this area to really put it through the spaces (ph). And what we found is about 97 percent of the time it matched with what our goal standards in our cerebral spinal fluid taps or brain scans. And we actually could determine that through a clinical assessment and a blood test, we could make an accurate decision on patients, 90 percent of the time. So, really, as you've mentioned already, cerebral spinal fluid tests and brain scans, they are very, very rare and hardly anyone actually gets to get one of these.

And for me personally, I feel as though we need an effective intervention when someone doesn't have symptoms but has a positive biomarker test and that intervention doesn't exist yet. These interventions are only more effective or only really been tested when you have mild symptoms and a biomarker test. So, if that intervention comes and those clinical trials are already ongoing with these drugs. So, we will know in a few years whether they're beneficial for people without symptoms and maybe having the drug staves off them ever getting dementia, then the blood test is extremely valuable in that population.",

WHITE:  So, we know that this test, this ALZpath test, which we tried and which we tried in this study is available already now in the United States as a laboratory developed test. And what that means is that an individual lab can validate this test for clinical use. So, in a couple of weeks, basically. anyone in the United States can order this test through their physician, and it will be rolled out to more laboratories across the United States. In the U.K., we have a different regulation. But they are also ongoing here in Sweden, where I am. We also have different regulations and we will approve a test this year. So, each country are dealing with this differently, but it's really a step forward knowing that, you know, someone has really taken the time to make something commercially available.",

And Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film. No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit, and genius. To say that I'm disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.\" But not all of the \"Barbie\" actresses were snubbed. America's -- America Ferrera scored her first Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in the film. And we should note, \"Barbie\" was distributed by Warner Brothers Pictures which is owned by CNN's parent company. CNN's Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy is with me now. Oliver, great to see you.

Youknow, it was really astonishing to a lot of people that Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie did not get nominations in those top categories of best director and best actress. Obviously, \"Barbie\" was the sensation of 2023. It was a top box office performer. It obviously started a discussion in the culture about some of the topics like sexism. And so, for it to be nominated for best picture, but particularly for Greta Gerwig not to get the nod for best director, really didn't sit well with people. And then it's almost like pouring salt in the wound that you see Ryan Gosling, who portrayed Ken, get the nomination. It read almost like a scene out of the \"Barbie\" movie itself, right?

Listen, the Academy has -- you know, it's no stranger to controversy. It has taken a lot of criticism over the years for issues related to diversity. And they have tried to make some moves to remedy this. But I think for a lot of people, this is really underscoring the need for the academy to be more diverse for it to reflect more of America and society, and it's raising that issue again. And it's -- you know, back in 2020 there was a study done, looking at the winners of Oscars, and it found overwhelmingly that men are more likely to win Academy Awards than women. I think in the days, weeks ahead, this is not going to go away for the Academy and you're going to see a larger discussion.",
