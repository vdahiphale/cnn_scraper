Most people have no idea who these state reps are. They're gerrymandered to a hilt, so there's almost no choice or democracy in these places.You know, for example, the Tennessee Republican majority that voted those two out last week, more than half of them didn't even face a contested election last November. They ignore laws in Ohio. They violated the constitution to gerrymander their own districts. If we saw, in another country, all the things that these state houses were doing here, we would literally say, you're losing your democracy. But because it happens here, we really don't pay attention to it. We also get really blinded by Washington. You know, there are hundreds of people just like Marjorie Taylor Greene in office in these state houses, but they're not just on Twitter, they're not just talking like she and George Santos are, they're actually passing laws every week attacking democracy.

You would have done worse as a Republican in a gerrymandered district last week to vote with Democrats not to expunge those lawmakers. That's actually a risk for you to lose your office, but you get ahead by being an extremist. So, in these states that are locked up through gerrymandering andvoter suppression and uncontested races, what you see is all the incentives aligned for the worst behavior, which is why we see this downward spiral towards extremism, against democracy, and pushing forward bills that are deeply unpopular. That's another really important point here. Polls show us that Tennesseans support the very common sense reforms those protesters and those legislators who were kicked out support. So, so much of this activity, done by these right wing legislators - legislators, are done against the majority will of the citizens of their state. So, these are institutions that are locked up and they're advancing an extreme agenda and ignoring the people of the very states that they're in.
