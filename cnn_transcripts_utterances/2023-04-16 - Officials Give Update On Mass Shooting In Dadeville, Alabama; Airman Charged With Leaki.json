I'm Jim Acosta in Washington and at any moment we are expecting a news briefing from law enforcement officials in Dadeville, Alabama, the site of last night's horrifying mass shooting. We are hoping to learn more about a suspect or a possible motive in that shooting rampage in this tiny Alabama town.This is a look at a vigil that's about to get underway at any moment. These are live pictures that you're looking at right now of this vigil that is about to take place in memory of the children, teenagers, many of them who were lost in this mass shooting. Here's what we know right now about this tragedy. Four people are confirmed dead. A spokeswoman for one local hospital says 15 teenagers suffered gunshot wounds and were treated. Another hospital says it received multiple patients. The attack apparently happened at a Sweet 16 birthday party in this community of 3,000 people. One of those killed, the older brother of the girl celebrating her 16th birthday. There you see him right there. A picture of him smiling. Philstavious Dowdell was days away from graduating and going to Jacksonville State University on a football scholarship, we're told by folks there in Alabama. CNN's Isabel Rosales joins us live from Dadeville. Isabel, it is just heartbreaking when you look at the picture of that young man who was lost and we know that there are three others and we'll be seeing their pictures I'm sure in, you know, in due time. There's a picture of him again. It's just absolutely heartbreaking, and it's happened again, this time in Alabama.",

So many people we spoke with in this community know exactly who has passed in this building behind me, a dance venue that was being used for a Sweet 16th birthday party where four people were killed. And I spoke with Michael Taylor, the assistant football coach over aDadeville High School, and he personally knew Phil Dowdell and has known him since he was 9 years old, calls him a freak athlete, said that he was so good at any sport that he touched. He was blessed by God is how he described it. Track, football, basketball. And as you mentioned --",

He was asking for people in the community there to pray because it sounds like it's a very serious situation for those critically injured in the hospital as we speak. Let's bring back in CNN's Isabel Rosales on the scene in Dadeville. Also with us. Juliette Kayyem, CNN national security analyst and former Department of Homeland Security official. Isabel, just quickly to you. It didn't sound like we got much information about how this happened, how it went down, what the motive was.

The newest bit of detail is that they finally have put a number on how many have been injured. 28 people hurt in the shooting, some critical.We know from our reporting earlier in the day from the Lake Martin Community Hospital that they have five people there that are in critical condition. They're asking for patience. That is what the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is asking for, saying that this is a fluid situation, saying that they are not in a rush because they must ensure justice and that this will be a methodical process. They're also asking for anyone who has information to give ALEA a call, and that number they gave was 1-800-3928011, 1-800-3928011 -- Jim.",

So this would mark 147th mass shooting, which we define as four or more victims, not including the shooter, so there's a range of other things that aren't being captured in that number.So just a little bit of context. Dadeville, obviously, as you said, a rural community, not more than about 3,000 identified citizens of Dadeville. You saw therefore the state come in because a lot, you know, essentially there's no police department of any size normally that could handle this. So ALEA will take the lead, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, and I think they were preparing us that the five who are severely injured are so critical that some of them may not make it. So you have a major event, a Sweet 16. Anyone with kids knows this is not right. But was it just not right in terms of kids celebrating on a Saturday night and that's what they were. They were kids. From the press conference, just two takeaways. One is I actually thought that for what they know that it was a kind of press conference you would want to hear in terms of both collaboration with the local and the federal. We know the White House's at least been briefed, but also seeking the community's help. I think that that is just clear that they either suspect who it is, but they can't say yet, and that's what their focus is going to be at this stage is finding who the perpetrator is. And then the second thing just to remind people, you know, in the movies these things settle, you know, in a day. If someone ran or fled, even if they know who it is, they might have had some time to get away. So we'll wait and see for more information about who the perpetrator is, the killer, I should say.",

Today, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed grave concern about the circumstances surrounding the leak. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): I have a lot of questions about why were these documents lying around? Why did this particular person have access to them? Where was the custody of the documents? And who are they for? Those are important questions we could ask in the Intelligence Committee so that we can have stronger oversight. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The access that he was having to this information should have been cut off. He should have never been having access to this level of classified information that could hurt the United States. He had no reason -- there was no need to know for him of the information that he was accessing and the Department of Defense admits in the affidavit that they had the ability to track him.

They could either escape to Russia or take their chances as the war intensified. Many of those who fled toward Russia were encouraged to live and work in the Far East, from Rostov, a 4,000 miles train journey to the edge of Siberia and a town just a stone's throw from North Korea.

CNN reached several of them through a Telegram group chat run by local volunteers, keeping a log of resident requests from baby food and toys to medicine. Anyone dissatisfied with their stay is told sarcastically to take their complaints to Moscow, the Kremlin, Putin. The Russian government has long been eager to populate its resource rich Far East, and the state has tried several experiments to attract settlers, including those from ex-Soviet states. It now promises fleeing Ukrainians cash, housing assistance, citizenship, and even free land, though two people told CNN they were struggling to get the rent reimbursement they say the government had promised. Natalia was struggling to find any housing at all, hardly enthused by her new reality. NATALIA, UKRAINIAN WOMAN IN RUSSIA (through translator): Nothing has changed except the place.

Of course, they are not considered collaborators. They need to get to a third country and address a local Ukrainian consulate. It will issue them Ukrainian documents to return to Ukraine.\" But for those who remain in Russia long term, the future is less clear. By Ukrainian law, people who publicly deny occupation or who call for support for Russian actions are considered collaborators. International law prohibits forcible transfers of people. Russia says more than 5 million Ukrainians have arrived in Russia since the full- scale war began. And while Ukraine says many were forcibly deported, some, like Oksana, said they went willingly.
