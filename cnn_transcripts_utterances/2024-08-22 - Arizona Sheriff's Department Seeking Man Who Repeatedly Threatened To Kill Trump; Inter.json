      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We have a lot more to cover at the DNC but we want to walk you through some of the other headlines we're watching this hour.Canada's two biggest railroads have shut down in a lockout of more than 9,000 union workers. Canadian Pacific, Kansas City and Canadian National are in contract disputes with their workers. The shutdown means that 30,000 Canadians can't get to work. It's also threatening supply chains in North America and that could be an inflationary threat to the U.S. economy. Also, oil giant Halliburton has reportedly been hit by a cyber attack according to the Reuters news agency citing a source. This attack is reportedly limiting business at its North Houston headquarters but the Energy Department tells CNN there is no evidence that it's affecting America's energy supply right now. And journalists are blasting a deal where Google is set to pay $250 million to help fund local newsrooms in California over the next five years. Governor Gavin Newsom supports the deal saying it'll help shore up local journalism but unions are calling it a shakedown that could hurt the industry. It allows big tech companies to not pay for linking to news sites and also uses a controversial initiative that would utilize artificial intelligence. So while the Harris campaign and Democrats prepare to cap off this week's convention tonight in Chicago, former President Donald Trump is in battleground Arizona visiting the border. [154:35:00] He is in Cochise County and that is the same county where officials are now searching for a man who allegedly threatened to kill Trump on several social media posts. They're now asking for the public's help in finding that man. The sheriff's office also says he is wanted on several outstanding warrants stemming from DUI charges and felony hit-and-run and failing to register as a sex offender. We have CNN's Jonathan Wackrow with us, a former Secret Service agent. Jonathan your reaction to hearing this news that a month or so after this attempted assassination of the former president, officials have zeroed in on another person making threats toward Trump.",

      "sentences": "Well of course this is obviously any time that you hear that there's information about threats that are being made towards any Secret Service protectee, it is disturbing right? But we want to understand quickly is you know how were those threats processed? You know what was the assessment around the means, the opportunity, the intent and capabilities of those who are making those threats?So you know I think it's, you know, you want to hear from the Secret Service on how they address that and then from the threat identification it's the management of that. What type of control measures were put into place because of those threats? Was it additional protective intelligence resources? Was it additional members of the detail? More physical security assets? What was done? So it's the, you know, the threat itself is sort of the so what and then the now what is how do we bolster the protection around the protectee once we know that those threats have been made and identified.",

      "sentences": "Jonathan it strikes me that part of the reason officials are seeking this person is because of threats that were made online. Obviously as I noted he has a series of warrants out for his arrest for different reasons but often you see things online that may not necessarily amount to threats. Obviously in this case it appears that law enforcement is taking it seriously enough that they believe this person may be willing to act on them.Is that fair to say and how does law enforcement distinguish that?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so you have to think about you know the three big things here is the motivation. Like does law enforcement understand what motivated this individual to make the threat? That's the first thing.Second is the intent. Is there any signals here of the intent of an imminent attack? So did this person -- are they known to have just purchased firearms or did they take any type of precipitating action in advance of you know launching some sort of direct attack against the against the protectee? And the third part is, you know, this is probably why there's a sense of urgency here is capability. Does this person have the capability to launch an attack right? So that you know those factors there are coming into the calculus that that law enforcement the Secret Service are utilizing and asking you know it tried to seek this person out to get them in custody for questioning and in, you know, further you know further the investigation around these threats.",

Since we passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the 2022 gun bill, urban violence rates in this country have dropped by historic numbers by 20 to 30 percent. We have never seen a two year reduction in violence like we have seen since we passed that bill.So no, that bill wasn't everything we want. But what we really want is not to pass legislation, but to save lives. And we've saved a whole bunch of lives. She's going to talk, I assume tonight about her belief in universal background checks, getting these assault weapons off the streets. And I think this is going to be a decisive issue because both in the cities and in the suburbs, people do not accept the status quo on guns. So she's been a great partner of mine and trying to change the gun laws of this nation. She's got to tell that story of success that what Joe Biden and she did together has driven violence rates down. We're a safer nation. But she's also got to say what the challenge is ahead of us.",

So just further confirmation that we will be seeing The Chicks. And as you said, they, of course, faced backlash back in 2003 for speaking out about then President George W. Bush. They were banned from many country music radio stations. So this is really showcasing a new progressive side of the country music scene. It's not just The Chicks.
