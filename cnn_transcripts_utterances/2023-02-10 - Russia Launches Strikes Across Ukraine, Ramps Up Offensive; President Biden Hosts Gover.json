This is from the Ukrainian government soldier bringing down what appears to be a Russian missile. The Ukrainians say they successfully managed to stop around 60 of the 70 attempted missile strikes. That's in line with the recent successes of air defenses.But when the missiles get through, this is an attack -- a town in the south near Zaporizhzhia. You see the sheer force of that blast, throwing a vehicle on top of a house. But what they have been targeting, as you say is the energy infrastructure -- the civilian infrastructure of this country trying to bring down the power grid. Now overall, the Ukrainians have somehow kept the lights on to a large degree, but there are some parts of the country, particularly in the East, Kate, where they are seeing blackouts. And as you say, both Ukrainians and the Moldovans saying that a missile passed through their airspace. They bring in the Russian ambassador for a dressing down. It was relatively close to the Romanian border. That's a NATO country where Romania diverted at least two airplanes to inspect that possible missile strike. It is certainly an uptick in strikes, as you possibly might see, is spring offensive on the eve of the first anniversary of this conflict, Kate.",

And let's start -- let's start with this -- what I think is really quite scary, which is Russia steering a cruise missile through Moldova to target Ukraine. How serious is that? REP. ADAM SMITH, (D-WA): Now, it's the risk that's been in place for them since this war began. Will it expand to other countries around? I think it's very clear that Russia, certainly the U.S., and NATO have no interest in Ukraine as well in expanding this beyond the truly horrible fight that's going on in Ukraine. But in a fight like that, there's always that risk. And then how will Moldova or you know, in the -- if it happens in Poland, how will they react?

And I -- you know, I haven't met with President Zelenskyy but I've certainly been in conversations with Ukrainian government officials. And yes, they're asking for F-16s but they're asking for a lot of other things as well. And the most important things are that the tanks, the Bradley Fighting Vehicles, so they can be more mobile in their ability to launch attacks, and then ammunition crucially, you -- you know, mentioned the cruise missile attacks overnight, having those air defense systems, having the ammo to keep firing back and hitting those cruise missiles. So, he's asking for a lot.Look, the F-16s -- you know, we should give Ukraine whatever we can give them. My point on the F-16s is they are not going to be particularly effective in the current battlespace. I mean, the Russians have a large number of fighter attack aircraft that have been completely useless in this fight precisely because of those air defense systems. So, the F-16s are not the most important thing that Ukraine is asking for, even though it seems to be what we're focused on.",
