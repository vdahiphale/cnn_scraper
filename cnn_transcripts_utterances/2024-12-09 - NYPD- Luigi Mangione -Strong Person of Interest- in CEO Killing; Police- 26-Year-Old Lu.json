Moments ago, New York Police announced an arrest and they say they found evidence of a possible motive. And these are the first images into CNN showing the full face of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione of Maryland. The New York Police Commissioner called Mangione, quote, \"a strong person of interest who has no criminal record.\"Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, was allegedly found with an untraceable homemade ghost gun, a suppressor, multiple fake IDs, including one that police say appeared to be the one used in New York at a hostel by the suspect and a two-page letter slamming the healthcare industry.

Right now, the engineer is facing charges related to the gun that he had on him, that ghost gun that officials believe may have been 3D printed. It was five days ago when a masked gunman was seen on video using a silencer to shoot Thompson to death outside a hotel in Manhattan. He was a 50-year-old and the father of two.Let's bring in CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, who is at today's presser, along with John Miller, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst.

And, you know, it talks about those parasites had it coming, which is interesting because it is written in the plural where we have a single murder, which raises some questions as to were there other intended victims or was he intended to strike again.And what about the manifesto? Was it meant to be found? Was it something he was going to send in to either law enforcement or the media? He does say in the manifesto, in this two-page letter, if you will, that he acted alone and was self-funded. So basically, he's railing about the healthcare industry. That he claims in the note that we are the most expensive country when it comes to healthcare here in the United States, and yet we're 42 in life expectancy among other nations. Again, I can't vet his information, but he goes on about profiteering and gouging. And it is interesting in that - this document that is allegedly found with him really kind of mirrors very closely another document he wrote some time ago, basically, and stay with me here, as a book review of the unabomber's manifesto. But this is his own words talking about Ted Kaczynski. \"How long until we recognize that violence against those who lead us to such destruction is justified as self-defense. These companies don't care about you, or your kids, or your grandkids. They have zero qualms about burning down the planet for a buck, so why should we have any qualms about burning them down to survive?\" So this is from January of 2024, the beginning of the year, but it shows early on what the profilers would call leakage. He's publicly kind of venting this anti-capitalist, anti-corporate, anti- profiteering and justifying violence as the solution.",

Again, we, you know, typically what you would have is, you know, in a case like this where you have a suspect that is on the run, what they're going to do is start shedding a lot of that evidence along the way. So should they get caught, should they get identified, they're not going to have items of evidentiary value on them.You know, there is a belief that with some of these individuals, they want to get caught. They want to be that martyr. And so maintaining this manifesto and other items related to the crime, you know, could lead into that. But again, it's really early in the investigation. We're not sure if law enforcement is going to have the ability to even question the suspect at this point in time to really delve deeper into what was the motive. We know what the opportunity was. We know what his capabilities were. It's that last part of exactly what was his motive, what was his driving factor, and why did he target this individual on that day.",

These people say they've been waiting more than half an hour, some of them. They're waiting for bread.We've seen lines like this around the city. People are lining up for cash. They're lining up for gas. They are trying to make sure that they have enough food to ride out this transitional period where nobody really knows what's going to happen. Now you can see behind me at the end of the road there, that is the central bank of Syria. Yesterday there was extensive looting there. A lot of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. Then, more rebels arrived in the capital. The looting appears to have stopped. It does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many people who are elated that Bashar al-Assad is finally gone.

We have retired Army General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander with us.Just give us a sense of how you're seeing what has happened here. As you see Damascus falling, the U.S. used B-52 bombers, F-15 fighter jets, A-10 aircraft to strike more than 75 ISIS targets in Syria. What was the objective here? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Big power shift in the region, prevent ISIS from coming back and taking charge. Hopefully get rid of the repressive government in Syria and open a new chapter in the Middle East. Iran is a big loser. Russia's role will be reduced. Turkey is a big winner in this, and the future is unknown because we really don't know who HTS and this man Jolani really is. And he's executed a smooth takeover, and President Erdogan of Turkey said, let's have this happen very smoothly. He's the first leader who came out in support. That's probably because Turkey's been supporting him and grooming him under the radar all along, and it's worked. But now what happens? Because these are Islamist organizations, what are the standards they're going to put in place? What's the revenge they're going to exact on those who have been opposed to them? And what will happen to the institutions of governance? Will they remain in place? Will there be civil servants? Is education going to be changed? The Taliban's pretty happy about this. Why are they so happy about it from Afghanistan? They must think something's going their way in this. So there are a lot of uncertainties, and I know the president took credit for supporting Israel, and Israel has done a big job here. But look, there's still chemical weapons there. There's probably biological weapons there. There's a lot of other hardware that Israel's trying to destroy, but do they know where all that is? Do they get it all? And then what's the impact when the dust settles here? What are we dealing with in Syria?",

HTS, which is designated as a terror group, although as you mentioned, al-Jolani, he's - you know, he's got this narrative, he's making big promises as HTS moves into governance mode.

He's in a critical position to help NetanyahuSo, I think he's going to hold on to that for a while. He recognizes that when he's dealing with Ukraine and Georgia and so forth, the world is watching. It's not just about Europe. It's about China, North Korea, Iran. He's got some big opportunities to make some climactic changes in the Middle East if he plays his cards right. He wants to make America great again. He can't do it by just falling back into the United States because it's not just about the United States. It's about our role in the world.
