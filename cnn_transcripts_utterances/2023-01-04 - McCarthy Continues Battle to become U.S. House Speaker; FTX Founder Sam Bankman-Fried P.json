High drama on Capitol Hill as Republicans failed to elect the next Head of the House of Representatives. All house business essentially grinding to a halt with a high stakes fight continuing today. We're live in Washington D.C. with the latest. Also crypto crunched a high profile warning to U.S. banks not to bet on Bitcoin and other volatile crypto assets following the collapse of trading platform FTX and iPhone grown the market cap of Tech Giant, Apple falling below $2 trillion as recession. And Fed interest rate fears continue to pressure big cap tech. There is a recession or even a slow session. Yes, a slow session. Don't worry we're going to explain in a minute pressuring U.S. stocks on the first trading day of 2023 with both the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ falling about half a percent. The picture meantime today, looking a tad bit brighter, U.S. futures are up across the board. Europe is also higher for second day as well. The global market outperformer so far this year, though, remains the HANG SENG that is up more than 3 percent a third street higher session on continued hopes for Chinese economic re-openings. It's a busy show, as always, but let's begins with the political drama on Capitol Hill. The House of Representatives set to reconvene in three hours at 12 pm Eastern, as Republican Congressman Kevin McCarthy continues his bid to be elected speaker. On Tuesday, he failed to win enough votes three times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-KY): I think at the end of the day, we'll get everybody.",

Now the house as you mentioned, we'll come back and reconvene in about three hours from now and it's still an open question exactly what we'll see, there likely could be two paths. The first path was that they would come in and reconvene but then quickly adjoin and let this negotiating that's been going on furiously behind the scenes. Let that continue to play out rather than it playing out in the public sphere on the House floor, as we saw yesterday, which was pretty messy for many Republicans, or they could vote again at some point, whether it's at noon today, Eastern Time or later in the day. But the question will be math, will the end result for McCarthy be the same or not? And you of course mentioned that Trump endorsement. They came early this morning that was at the request. Republican sources tell us of many McCarthy allies who are panicked overnight, when Former President Trump getting more of a tepid endorsement of McCarthy than they would have liked. So clearly, a lot of wheeling dealing, negotiating going behind the scenes, McCarthy allies trying to make sure that not only Trump puts out his endorsement, but that the question is, will that push the needle and the numbers?

They coined this new word, which is things kind of grind to a halt, but never kind of fall down into negative growth. And here's why Mark Zandi says the shoppers are the firewall in this economy, between a recessions in an economy that can skirt a downturn. We have seen consumers, shoppers doing amazingly well resilient, even with high inflation and so much global turmoil and uncertainty and gas prices that first went up, and then went down. So what you're hearing from Zandi and this is what we've been hearing from him for some time right? He always said, there's a pathway too was also called a, you know, a soft landing in the U.S. economy and there are a lot of challenges for 2023 but don't count out the U.S. economy because the shopper, the consumer, you know, after three years of COVID, wants to spend on experiences, wants to spend on certain kinds of things, and wants to live their life.

And they need to buy a new car, because they didn't buy a new car for a year and a half, because you couldn't find them, or the prices were too high, those prices are coming down. They're going to say the, you know, the world is falling apart, but they're going to buy a new car in 2023. You see what I mean? So there is how people say they feel and what they do? And that's what we're watching very, very closely. Another thing that Zandi and others have pointed out is the job market, you know, it's really kind of hard to fathom a recession, as we know it with the job market. And that is as strong as it is. We're going to get job data later this week. Well, as you will know, but, you know, can you have this slow session where you have the unemployment rate continue to rise, and you have maybe some overall job losses, but it's still historically a pretty tight job market that could happen too. And it might be the overall resiliency of the consumer and the job market, a job market that will soften. But still pretty strong overall that will prevent an overall recession in 2023.",

And among those risks are the potential for fraud, which is the allegation here at FTX. Also, the questions of volatility in the market, which we've seen repeatedly over the years kind of going up and down and also the uncertainty of ownership because of how some of these wallets are structured? The main point that the Fed and the other two regulators are making is about, you know, they don't want the risk associated with crypto to migrate into the banking sector. We've seen that sort of thing before risk in credit default swaps risk in subprime mortgages and that impacting the banking sector. They're warning to draw a line here and shine a light on this to banks to say, you got to pay attention to this. Now, they're also saying that, you know, they're not prohibiting any banks from engaging these activities or discouraging them.

And that they live regulators say that they're learning, you know, every day from this, but, you know, this message does come two months after FTX is collapse.

Further north meantime, the Kremlin is now increasing the death toll in the Makiivka attack to 89 and says that the use of cell phones among Russian soldiers is what allowed Ukraine to track and target them.

It's a pretty remarkable statement to say that, look, the Russian Military has apolicy has rules against using cell phones too close to enemy lines and that is precisely what happened in this case. I mean, we don't know for certain how long the cell phones had been on? If in fact, this is the case, but you can just imagine these Russian troops, perhaps calling their loved ones to wish them happy New Year, since the strike came literally a minute or two, after midnight. The Russians say that whichever military officers ultimately allowed this to happen will be held to account. The Head of the Donetsk People's Republic also says that some Russian soldiers actually managed to escape the blast, the initial blast, get out of the vocational school that they were inside of and then go back in to help some of their fallen comrades actually get out and they were killed in the process. But you mentioned some of the dissent that we are hearing as well. First off, the Russians updated the death toll from 63 to 89. One prominent Russian Military blogger that is very widely followed and very well respected even by the Kremlin said that his expectation is that that death toll will continue to climb as they sift through the rubble and as they find and identify more bodies. He also questioned this assessment from the military that this was simply the use of cell phones, saying that it wasn't convincing and that it was a blatant attempt to smear blame, saying that look, this also could have been Ukrainian drones that were keeping tabs on the area. It also could have been an informant on the ground. And the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Military seemed to perhaps agree with that assessment saying that look, of course, you shouldn't be using your phones near the front line. But he said that wasn't the reason for all of this happening. He says this was the inability of Russia to covertly deploy its brand new conscripts to the frontlines and that's ultimately what led to these consequences. And one of the things I mentioned Rahel, and that is the use of the weapon that the Russian say was used this high Mars. U.S. supplied high mars mobile artillery system that has allowed the Ukrainians to fire deeper behind enemy lines. One pro-Russian military blogger says that it is now undeniable that there is a growing body of evidence that the Ukrainians are not just using this system to target infrastructure and supply lines. They are also now using it more and more often to target barracks and Russian personnel on the ground, Rahel.",

I mean, there's a debate here, do you - China has decided to end nearly three yearsof self-imposed isolation, just as COVID is kind of raging through the world's most populous country? So governments have a choice. Do they view this as a potential tourism windfall as Chinese travelers get back in the air? Or do they view this as a potential public health threat? And the European Union held a meeting on Tuesday and said it's considering measures such as demanding pre-departure COVID tests from travelers from China. And testing wastewater, on planes potentially, and additional measures they haven't quite decided yet but we showed the map before there is a growing number of countries that are imposing different levels, ranging from again, pre-departure tests such as what the U.S. is requiring to Morocco, which is completely closing its borders to any travelers from China. The Chinese government doesn't like this at all. It finds this insulting, but its finding supporters for instance, the aviation industry, the Head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh who came out blasting these restrictions, calling them extremely disappointing to see this knee jerk reinstatement of measures that are proven ineffective? We have the tools to manage COVID-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs. And he goes on to say governments must base their decisions on science facts, rather than science politics. Another government that has opted against restricting Chinese travel is New Zealand. Take a listen to what the New Zealand Health Minister said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AYESHA VERRALL, NEW ZEALAND'S COVID-19 RESPONSE MINISTER: As part of the public health risk assessment officials also worked through scenarios of potential case numbers traveling from China, using our predicted arrivals over the next few weeks. And this analysis confirmed that visitors won't contribute significantly to our COVID case numbers, meaning entry restrictions and required are justified. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
