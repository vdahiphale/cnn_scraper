      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden is issuing anaggressive new immigration policy aimed at limiting asylum seekers at the U.S. southern border. We expect those executive actions to be signed this hour, of course, we'll bring that to you live. Also ahead, the U.S. President suggesting that the Israeli Prime Minister is prolonging the Gaza war to hold onto power. We'll get reaction to that. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims a third term in India, but the win isn't nearly as convincing as some thought it would be. We'll have a deeper look just ahead. But first this hour, we are watching a dramatic shift by U.S. President Joe Biden, the White House has announced executive actions severely limiting asylum seekers trying to cross the U.S. border with Mexico. They will effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers crossing illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Now, the move uses a regulation that was enforced under the Trump administration. And at the time was widely, if you remember, denounced by Democrats. Record crossings at the southern border are a major issue as you all know if you've been watching the show in this year's election. And the White House has reached out to mayors from border areas to have them attend today's announcement about the new restriction. We are expecting to hear from President Biden, I think we have a little live shot, podium shot for you if we can bring that up, there you go. You can see the line there securing our border, when of course, we hear from the White House, we hear from President Biden on these new immigration policy. Of course, we will bring that to you. In the meantime, I want to go to CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro, who joins us live from Washington D.C. Lulu, great to have you back on the show. So, what are we likely here to hear from the President, and how soon do you think this will take effect? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, it's supposed to take effect immediately. That is what we're hearing from the president -- the president and his supporters on this. Let me just say this is a  very controversial action that he's taking. I want to just take you back to sort of set the stage as to why the president is doing this right now. We know that, of course, immigration has been one of the key issues of this election. If you see in swing states in particular among independents, the key constituency that President Biden needs to win his re-election. We know that immigration really comes at the top of the list. And when you poll people, we see that President Trump really is very strong on this issue. People trust him much more than they trust President Biden, and that's because we've seen record numbers of people crossing the border illegally into the United States. If you think that in December, some 200,000 people -- or rather, there were 200,000 illegal crossings across the border. And so, even though that number has been cut in half, it's still a hugely powerful motivating issue. And so, President Biden wants to get ahead of it, wants to get ahead of it, particularly in front of -- ahead of the debates that will happen with President Trump -- former President Trump in the coming weeks.",

He's going to be fighting his own progressive flank, who will see this as a betrayal. They want to see what is called comprehensive immigration reform. So, not just border enforcement, but also a path to citizenship for those  who are here illegally. And then of course, the Republicans have come out swinging. We've seen that almost immediately. They basically been saying that this is too little, too late, that you know, he's only taking this action now because he's been forced into a corner --",

They were trying to actually come up with an actual law that would pass in Congress, because no matter what the President does today, this is unilateral action on his part, and it is almost certainly going to be challenged in court.

He seemed a little dismissive of the announcement. He said that on deportations side, deportations happen all the time. This is nothing new. On the shutting down the  border, he said, this is not going to happen. This is a -- there's no way they can close the borders to the trade --to what it represents for both nations. So, he didn't seem so impressed if you want to say this, but he also didn't explain if he had talked to him what kind of arrangements he made with the Biden administration because there's no way that these announcement happens without checking with him first. You know, the Biden administration or sources prior to the election on Sunday here in Mexico, had said that they wanted to wait not to interfere with the elections in Mexico. Now that they know who the successor is, and it's Claudia Sheinbaum of the same party as Lopez Obrador, it seemed like they can have more buy-in or whatever policy happens to be announced and how it's implemented. The interesting thing is that if the idea right now is to try to stop the flow of immigrants, it might have the opposite effect because we saw that when the COVID restrictions ended, that people rushed the border and that's when we start increasing numbers.",

RAVI AGRAWAL, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FOREIGN POLICY: It really challenges that. I mean, when is a win not a win, it's when you're expecting a lot more than you got, and that's basically what's happened here. Just about 72 hours ago, pollsters in India were suggesting that Modi would come back to power in a huge landslide with a bigger victory than he did in 2019 and 2014. And obviously, that hasn't happened. It is very likely that he will come back to power as Ivan said, but he'll need a coalition partner or two or three, and that means that he will be much weaker --",

All of that is going to have to change at least a little bit. He's going to have to be more consultative. These are things that Modi is not used to doing, not as Prime Minister, not even when he was chief minister of the state of Punjab more than a decade ago. So, we will, I think end up seeing a softer, more collaborative Modi. He's going to be forced into many of those things. I don't think, however, we should overstate what's happened. Modi is still going to govern in terms of the broader agenda that he was looking to push through. I think that's going to remain the same. I mean, he's a business-friendly leader who is very committed to growing India's economy. I think that's still going to be issue number one for him.

We've heard in the last few minutes that this new asylum restrictions are going to come into effect at midnight, and it will basically effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers crossing illegally when a daily threshold of crossings has been exceeded. We heard that the beginning from President Biden said in the weeks of intense negotiation, they had a clear bipartisan deal. So, framing the position right now for him, Republicans, he said, walked away. And when he asked -- when he said -- he stated the question, why? Well, because Trump told them to, and he called it a cynical political move, something he said that was a disservice to the American people that the importance, he said, this border should not be a political issue, he said, to be weaponized. So, he's moving past Republican obstruction. He would, of course, have preferred a bipartisan deal. But now, the legislation, he says, hopefully to fix the migration issue, which he said Republicans have left him with no choice. And he then asked if those who think it's too strict, be patient, he said. Doing nothing is not an option. We have to secure the border and secure it now. So, lots of threads for us to go through. Lulu Garcia-Navarro was listening in and she joins us now. So, Lulu, what stood out to you, first of all, from what you heard from President Biden? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, it was a very short statement. He did not take questions on the issue, and I think that speaks to how sensitive the topic is. But just listening to what he was saying, he's really trying to thread a needle here. On the one hand, excoriating Republicans saying that he has been trying to deal with this issue in a bipartisan way through the legislative branch. Pointing out that Republicans, in his view, have not stepped up to the plate. On the other hand, trying to remind Democrats that he is not Donald Trump on this issue, even though he is adopting, quite frankly, some of his policies saying that he does not describe immigrants, as former President Trump has, as a poison in the blood of this country, reminding Democrats that he is not going to separate children from their families.

So, the timing of this moment right now. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, the timing of it is that, we are quickly approaching an election that is absolutely close, very contested and where President Biden is behind in many key polls, specifically on the issue of immigration. This is one of his weakest issues in terms of how the American public views his performance. And he really wants to try and gain some traction by being seen to do something. And so, it remains to be seen whether this will have that desired effect. I mean, if you think from December to now, illegal crossings across -- on the southern border have gone down by 50 percent, but the rhetoric hasn't changed. The polls haven't moved. And so, this is a very sticky issue for him because, you know, regardless, I think of what President Biden does, there is a narrative on the right, specifically coming from President Trump, but also from all of his supporters and Republicans in Congress that continues to beat this drum that President Biden is weak on this issue, that the Democrats want to encourage illegal immigration and that only President Trump can fix the border.",

So, there's nothing new here, and a majority of Israelis and consistent polls believe that he's putting his own personal politics way above national security, way above the welfare of the wellbeing of how many hostages remain alive. Now, Mr. Biden -- President Biden not only said this in an interview in \"Time\" from which you just quoted, I said, but he's also been hinting to that effect, as did Secretary of State Blinken, as did Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about a month ago when he called for Israel to replace Netanyahu in an election. Now, the second issue is obviously that hostage/ceasefire proposal that you just alluded to. You presented it and you're right, because that's how it was presented as Mr. Biden playing -- you know, presenting or outlining a claim. But the fact of the matter is this is an Israeli plan.

He needs to make -- push came to shove, I'm sorry, he needs to make a decision. Now, this is how it's going to be played out. If you've noticed, Isa, in the last 48 hours, roughly, he's been drawing a distinction between the fighting, which he's OK with stopping or halting for about 42 days, six weeks to be exact, and the war, which he pledges to continue until total victory and annihilation and eradication and destruction of Hamas. OK. Mr. Biden thinks differently. Now, that's the sticking point, because Mr. Netanyahu understands that according to the plan that Israel itself proposed or at least the principles of that Israel presented to the U.S., phase one, which calls for a six-week ceasefire would lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. Now, this is where it's going to play. I know we don't have enough time. He can make that decision at the risk of his government or his coalition falling, which is not a certainty, but a -- there's a lot -- high likelihood that that may happen, but then call for an election. A caretaker government, an interim government cannot be toppled in parliament. So, he has three, four months until an election in which he could do whatever he wants. And the U.S. is getting much deeper into its own election campaign. So, he has cards he could play. But the thing is with him, if you look back at his 15 years of -- as prime minister, he is the ultimate -- the quintessential indecision maker, not decision maker.",

Now, it reportedly happened on Monday near the city of Aleppo. So far, Israel has not responded. If true, this may mark the first time an RGC member has been killed by Israel since a blast, of course, at Iran's consulate for a member earlier this year. Fred Pleitgen has the very latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Massive fires after what Syrian state news says were several Israeli strikes on Monday near Aleppo in Northern Syria. Killing an adviser of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian media says. Identified as Saeed Abiyar, photos of his funeral already posted online. The strikes come just over two months after Israel and Iran came to the brink of a full-on war, after Iran's embassy compound in Damascus was bombed, killing several top Revolutionary Guard commanders. Israel's prime minister then vowing to remain tough against Tehran. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We will know how to defend ourselves, and we will act according to the simple principle of whoever harms us or plans to harm us, we will harm them. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But Iran struck back for the first time from its own territory, launching hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israel, even though most were intercepted by Israel's air defense as well as the U.S. and allied air forces. But Tehran vowing to hit Israel again will should the Israelis strike Iranian assets inside or outside Iran. AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER (through translator): Today, the Zionist regime is melting and ending in front of the eyes of the people of the world. It's ending, and the people of the world are seeing this. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Iran is currently in a transition period after both their president and foreign minister were killed in a chopper crash last month. In one of his final interviews on CNN's \"Outfront,\" the foreign minister had called on the U.S. to rein Israel in. HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, FORMER IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): And I do think that America must pay closer attention and focus on the adventure seeking regime in Israel so that such a crisis will not happen in Gaza.

Farmers frustrated by E.U. red tape and cheap imports, dumping manure in Brussels. A worsening climate with activists attacking cultural gems from Paris to Venice.
