It's 9 am in Washington. Well a Special Counsel Robert Hur will testify about his report on Joe Biden's handling of classified documents. We will find out exactly why he called the President well- meaning elderly man with a poor memory. On the stock markets will open in New York in about 30 minutes from now. The U.S. consumer inflation report for February is just out. It ticked slightly higher. Here's what Wall Street thinks of those numbers at least, so far as futures are concerned.

He was a soldier in the Israeli military onOctober 7th, when he was believed to have been kidnapped by a Hamas, but the Israeli military now confirming that Itay Chen was actually killed on October 7th. His body was taken captive by Hamas and taken into Gaza. He was one of six American citizens believed to be held alive as a captive by Hamas inside of Gaza, but he now joins the ranks of three other dead Americans whose bodies are being held by Hamas. Now his parents have been leading a relentless fight to try and secure their son's release over these last several months since October 7th. They have been doing many interviews. They have met with Israeli officials, American officials. They have been using their voice however they can, including attending the State of the Union address just this past week. I spoke actually with Itay Chen's mother Hagit as they were making their way to The Hague in the Netherlands to press the International Criminal Court to file charges against Hamas's leaders. And she told me about how difficult these last several months have been saying that she could not breathe anymore and saying that she dreams about the day when she would be reunited with her son. She told me that she firmly believed that he would be reunited with her as part of a hostage agreement, as part of the ceasefire negotiations, which we've been covering for weeks now. And she told me that her dream was seeing him repeatedly in a Red Cross van waving to her smiling because she said he always had a big smile on his face and that she would say I'm OK mom, why are you worried so much? I'm OK. Those dreams, unfortunately, today Becky, have been dashed. As we've seen so many times as many of these hostages have been confirmed to be dead. We're also now hearing from the hostage forum here in Israel, which says that his body is just looking at the statement his body is still being held captive by Hamas. Talking about him always being surrounded by friends, a beloved individual they say who drew others to his warm presence, Becky.",

The only successful ceasefire truce to date was mediated here in Qatar back in November. Given the news that we are hearing today, the news of a dead Israeli-American hostage taken into Gaza. We have Queen Rania, they're talking about the need for an immediate ceasefire, and the situation is catastrophic in Gaza. So where did mediation efforts stand at present? DR. MAJED AL ANSARI, OFFICIAL SPOKESPERSON FOR THE QATARI MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well, Becky, as we have been saying, since day one, we need an end to this war as soon as possible. And that can only happen with such a deal, and with negotiations and mediations between both sides. And we've been working tirelessly from day one to secure such a deal. And since the collapse of the last pause, we always knew that we needed a comprehensive deal that would lead to a longer pause and would lead therefore to a more sustainable ceasefire between the parties of this conflict. We are right now engaged in constructive dialogue between both sides. Situation on the ground is very much difficult, and we are nowhere near ideal at the moment, however, we are working day and night to make sure that we have the right ideas going cross between both sides.

Showing that the path to slowing price hikes remains bumpy, fed watchers are saying don't expect to see an interest rate cut as at next week's Fed meeting. And this is what Wall Street thinks of those numbers. Perhaps somewhat pricing in the fact that it isn't unlikely that we'll see that rate cut that they had hoped for earlier on in the year, we'd already got that sort of news priced into the market. Maybe that may be the reason why these markets have taken off, but only slightly today up about a half of 1 percent. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joins us to break down those inflation numbers.

Annual inflation rate is ticking up slightly to 3.2 percent.                 And in the month of February prices rising point 4 percent that was largely expected in February. But I think people want to see the numbers going in the other direction they don't want to see increases. And largely, the February increases were led by gas prices and shelter. So what Americans pay for rent every single month that accounted for 60 percent of the overall increase in the monthly gains that we saw in February? Some good news though, food prices here in the U.S. flat at 0 percent. That's encouraging for folks going to the grocery store, but shelter 0.4 percent in February and gas prices rising 3.8 percent. Here in the U.S. we have seen gas prices rise from about 307 a gallon in mid- January to about $3.40 today. Some of that is because of seasonal changes in fuel blends. We always see more expensive prices in the spring and summer as more people head out on the road. But for everyday Americans, that doesn't feel great, no one wants to spend more at the gas pump. And this is a little bit of a problem for President Biden who has really been trying to drill down on the fact that prices have been cooling since that 9 percent inflation rate we saw in 2022. But people when they see these kinds of price increases and inflation kind of stuck where it is, they're not going to feel great about that. The president though has tried to create task forces to deal with something called shrinkflation that he believes some companies are engaging in. He's also tried to get rid of junk fees and make junk fees more transparent for everyday Americans. And he's also been sending his cabinet across the country, trying to sort of rally the cry that prices are coming down there, so clearly more work to do in this inflation report. But we have certainly come off those really, really very, very high highs that we saw about a year and a half ago here in the U.S., Becky.",

So this is the problem and as well, you know, part of the rejection of Ariel Henry by the gangs other than the fact that they banded together. And it prevented him from returning to his own country is that he has negotiated this deal with the Kenyan government and other governments in the region that would provide troops that will finally get troops on the ground to support the Asian National Police. And that is what these gang members simply don't want, because that threatens other very lucrative cocaine trade, other kidnapping trade, other extortion trade, the businesses that they have set up over the years that have made them very, very rich and their country a more poor and dangerous place. So they are trying to protect their turf and are very clear that they will not accept this Transitional Council, and that they will not accept the introduction of foreign troops. And certainly they have the manpower and the gun power to act on those threats.",

One of our top stories this hour after days of crates dropping from the sky above Gaza for the first time, aid is heading towards the war torn enclave by sea. This charity ship left Cyprus earlier carrying nearly 200 tons of food and the need for this aid cannot be overstated. While countries work to get aid in through air and water routes, Israel continues to heavily restrict entry and delivery by land. Top Gaza health officials say the ground aid entering Northern Gaza is not enough for anyone. This is the UN warns famine is imminent if aid doesn't increase and I quote them exponentially. Well, I'm here in Doha, where the last deal was mediated for humanitarian aid. The release of hostages and a temporary pause in fighting, of course, this time around those involved in the negotiations including the United States are hoping that a pause if achieved will turn into a permanent ceasefire. Well, all involved we're hopeful waiting with bated breath for this, this mediated deal to come before the start of Ramadan. But of course that hasn't happened. And it doesn't look like it'll happen anytime soon. Here's what the spokesperson for. Qatar's Foreign Ministry told me earlier this hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said that he didn't charge Biden because he projects that Biden might present himself to the jury, as an old man with a failing memory. That's prediction of the future about how a defendant might appear in a courtroom that is completely out of Hur's capability of knowing and is absolutely inappropriate for a prosecutor to do. He could have said I elected not to charge Biden, because I felt that I couldn't convict him based on the evidence I have. And that would have been fine. But to predict how Biden might present him inappropriate and me hope he's taken to task on that, because it's not what prosecutors do.",

Remember, he issued a summary his own summary conclusion of what Mueller said, it was inappropriate, his summary and Mueller even objected to it. Merrick Garland said look, to avoid any of the appearance of that sort of stuff, I'm not going to interfere at all, I'm just going to let this go as it's presented to me. And that's how it went that way. If American said, look, I don't want to be Bill Barr. I don't want to misrepresent things.

Because we saw look, in the State of the Union, we saw a very fiery Biden not a person who was going to be a teetering old man with a forgetful memory that could have been well, the Biden that shows up in a courtroom, how dare you charge me with crimes, I've done nothing wrong.
