I'm Becky Anderson comingto you live tonight from Doha, where the historic 2022 FIFA World Cup is now underway. Well, it's the first World Cup ever hosted in the Middle East. Qatar has spent the past dozen years preparing for its moment on the world stage. And we've already seen competition and controversy. A short time ago, England defeated Iran 6-2 in the Group B opener. This was an historic matchup itself. The two nations have never faced each other in an international competition. Well, the match began with a powerful moment of silence from Iran's starting 11. They refused to sing their nation's anthem in an apparent show of solidarity with protesters back home. And seven European club captains say they will not now were the #onelove armbands expressing diversity and inclusion that was after learning that they could be penalized with yellow cards. Well two more matches still to play today. One just getting underway CNN Sports Anchor, Amanda Davies is with me. Now let's talk about the football first because that is ultimately what is going on here. We've had the England Iran match, perhaps not surprisingly, I mean, those were two teams which weren't mismatched necessarily. But one would have expected perhaps England team to win briefly.",

But I think a real awareness that they have so much going on at home in Iran at the moment. There's a lot on those players minds that they're being asked to carry as a football team as well but yet certainly a performance that will boost England's confidence heading in to the next couple of days.",

But yes, it's a really fascinating matchup, USA against Wales, and actually a really tough one to call because it's a really exciting young crop of U.S. players who, a lot of whom now play their domestic football in Europe. They aren't necessarily always in the starting lineup, but they're really talented. And the U.S. has one eye, of course, on the next World Cup 2026 when they're going to be Co-Hosts, with Mexico, and Canada. And so they're going into it saying we're probably not the favorites, but we want to put on a good show to build our momentum. They had that phone call from President Joe Biden, the weekend. He's got their vote of confidence, should we say but they're up against a Wales side, which have waited a long time for this moment. And when we say a long time, we mean 64 years. They have the longest gap between a first World Cup performance and a second World Cup performance in history. It's huge, but they have a team at the other end of the spectrum. A lot of very well established, some would say older, maybe veteran players, Captain Gareth Bale who you know this is - he was going to retire and then his team qualified for this World Cup.

They're saying that they have been shooting directly and deliberately at protesters, they have been shooting into people's homes. And according to Hengaw, they say they documented the killings of at least 42 people since last Houston. In the past 24 hours, they say more than a dozen people have been killed so far. But the number Becky could be much higher than that. They're saying the internet restrictions, the internet shutdown in the Kurdish area is making it very hard for them to get up to date information and to get video and more from people on the ground on what's happening with their thing. The situation is very critical in the town of Javanroud right now, where they say that there is a desperate need for blood donations. This is the latest information they have because of the rising number of casualties. The Iranian regime for its part Becky has been describing what is going on in that region as a separatist terrorist movement. They have deployed more forces into western Iran into the Kurdish region to they say to confront these terrorists and separatists and also at the same time launching attacks yet again, into northern Iraq, semi-autonomous Kurdish region targeting Iranian Kurdish opposition groups there with attacks using missiles and drones. So really the regime pushing this narrative that we have been hearing for weeks right now, but this is a separatist movement and a terrorist movement.

They took control in this game, pretty early on, Jude Bellingham who's just 19 years of age, his first international goal will be memorable and that really set England up, they were dominating this game by halftime, there was a terrific atmosphere. The atmosphere, though, really subsided in the second half because it was over as a contest. Iran got themselves a couple of constellation goals. But they were well beaten. And that now means that in this World Cup, the two most local teams have played in the first two games Qatar, of course, the host, Iran, coming from just over the Persian Gulf. Both those teams have been completely outplayed. As you say, this game was highly anticipated not just for the action on the field, but of all the other drama and the narratives that were going on around it. Let's talk about England first. Of course, Premier League players are known to take the knee occasionally before games, they decided to do it as a team here today as a message of inclusivity. And the relevance of them doing that in Qatar, where human rights and civil rights are often denied, cannot be understated that they did that here today. Of course, you've got the Iran team playing against the backdrop of the demonstrations and the protests that have been going on Iran now into their third month; the response from the government has been brutal, violent, and deadly. We saw some Iran fans here before the game, wearing protest T-shirts, Freedom T- shirts, a lot of those fans didn't want to speak to us, they really did not want to speak to us at all. But we managed to speak to a couple of fans who were born in Iran and now live in California.

And now recession fears some of it though, is Disney specific. There were some PR stumbles under Chapek, the stock has underperformed since he became CEO in February 2020. And just two weeks ago, Disney unnerved investors by revealing mounting losses in its streaming division. Here's how the Disney Chair Susan Arnold explained it last night in the press statement it came out. She said \"The board has concluded that as Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation, Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period\". So in other words, the board decided that they want to ride out this storm in the media industry by going to a trusted hand. And it really doesn't get any more trusted than Bob Iger. I mean, he is a legendary CEO. He's one of the most successful of his time and he did build Disney into a media empire. He's the one who went out and acquired Pixar and Marvel, Lucasfilm's 21st Century Fox. He also launched Disney Plus. And as you can see, Wall Street is loving this CEO change the stock down 40 percent on the year coming into today, but up 7 percent on this news. It is a surprise though, I mean, even Iger himself had been dismissive of this idea of him returning to Disney. Listen to what he told Kara Swisher back in January. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
