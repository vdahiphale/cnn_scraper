And this has become a theme across not just CPAC but the wider Republican Party.

That rhetoric is fascist. Fascism in this country doesn't have to look like the German kind, that's the American kind. I think it's very important to diagnose it and call it what it is. The fact that this was a featured at a major political conference of the American right, I think it's an extremely chilling, it's a huge wake up call for Americans, at the wake for journalists who cover this kind of politics. I want to lightly disagree with Hans in his sort of assessment of Trump looking to the past with the speech. I think he is doing that in part, but I think is very much looking towards the future. When you look at the context in which Donald Trump is going to be running for president, he's probably going to be indicted. He's going to be running for president will under criminal charges for the thing in the past. But the signals he sending here, Donald Trump looking towards the future, already suggested to his followers that if he's indicted, they point to the streets. His allies, including Lindsey Graham, have suggested on television that if he is indicted, that violence would follow.

A third said, people are rip roarin' pissed. This is -- it's funny, actually, in some ways because one would have thought that we would've gotten a lot more of this in the first, you know, two years of the Biden presidency, and we didn't. There was a lot of Democratic unity. And that seemed to have all been exposed by this controversy over D.C.'s crime bill that is also about self governance for the citizens of Washington, the city.

It wasn't like Tom Vilsack, the Agriculture Secretary, was on the hot seat in this way.Buttigieg obviously ran for president and did pretty well. There's a lot of speculation he'll run for something more in the future. And that has made him a target. Made him a target for the right, made him a target for the left even on things that he doesn't really control. And in sitting with him when we drove around in Kansas and Missouri on Monday of last week talking about this you can see the frustration about it coming through. I asked him about that, about the criticism that he'd gotten there and asked him about whether he said -- whether he went to East Palestine because Donald Trump went and people think that that's why he went and he said on the record to me he said that's bull -- but he use the full word that I won't use to keep us from getting any fines.",

He's become the most polarizing member of Biden's cabinet. So what is interesting to me about this is that I think there are a lot of ways that Democrats view Buttigieg's almost like viral cable news stardom. When he goes on Fox News a lot of Democrats who don't even really him in other areas cheer that on but this member seems to think that that was actually not (INAUDIBLE). BARRON-LOPEZ: Yes. I'm not sure that member is representative of a lot of the other Democrats in the party and definitely not within the White House. I mean the White House loves to have Secretary Buttigieg go across the cables especially on Fox. You know, it's something he also did when he tried to make a run for the presidency. And they view him as one of their most effective communicators even in a moment like this when they're dealing with the Ohio train derailment. I also just wanted to point out something when you played that Tucker clip. He used the word \"flamboyant\" and he used the word \"evil\". We know what he is talking about there. He's talking about an openly gay man by calling him flamboyant and evil which also speaks to what we have been talking about during this show which is this larger message from Fox, from Republicans in trying to attack LGBTQ and transgender people as their wider campaign message.",
