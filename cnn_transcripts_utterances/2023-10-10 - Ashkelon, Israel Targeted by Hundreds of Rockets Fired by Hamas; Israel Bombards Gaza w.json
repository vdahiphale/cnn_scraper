I can't think of a scenario where I've been, sort of, looking at rockets that are outgoing, and a colleague, a dear colleague, you, Clarissa, are -- being underneath it, and it's a bad eerie feeling. And I just -- when I see the rockets coming out of there, I want to be picking up the phone and say, guys, they're coming. They're coming. But I know the defense system here is so strong that you'll get -- as I'm seeing them come up, you are getting the sirens immediately. I mean, you're getting those intercepts right over your head there.We're actually -- from where we are, we actually see the rockets aimed and rockets themselves taking off and making those intercepts. And we've been looking -- I know you're trying to figure out and if you can get underneath the cloud of smoke that John is pointing at that cloud of smoke now, we've been watching it get bigger. It was small, a dark cloud of smoke. Now, it's like big and billowing and the smoke's gone kind of gray. But something's on fire there because it hasn't gone out. It's putting out more smoke. When I see those rockets going out there, and the intercepts above your head, I'm just thinking about you and your team, Brant (ph) and Clayton (ph). And I'm hearing -- and I'm hearing small arms fire behind me there, that's the Israeli Defense Force, I believe, will be firing towards Gaza. I don't know if they've seen anything, small arms fire, guns, heavy machine guns, small machine guns. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Yes, Nic. We can --",

They leave craters in the streets. And of course, they have a very palpable effect on the psyche of ordinary people. I think I hear a drone now. Again, drones very common at the moment for obvious reasons. We heard some jets before as well. We had been hearing, pretty much, constant jet activity yesterday, but more so even the day before. And it is this utterly discombobulating sense for people who live here between on the one hand sirens going off, and people are frantically running to try to get to shelters and crouching, and then you hear explosions in the sky. And then five minutes later, everything feels quiet again. You can hear the sea. It's hard to imagine how people can live like this day in and day out. It is extremely difficult to, kind of, find any sense of equilibrium. And we have definitely noticed that the tempo in Ashkelon today, this afternoon, has dramatically escalated, John.",

The answer also to the question is, can the Israeli Defense Force be a hundred percent sure that they have rounded up everyone in all the corner outside of Sderot and other places, and I asked that to the general in charge of driving Hamas out of this particular part of the border area. And he said, no, I can't be 100 percent sure. You don't know what you don't know. You don't know if somebody is hiding in a house for a couple of days waiting to come out and mayhem.But in the, sort of, strict sense, has the Israeli Defense Force gotten control of this place? Do they own the streets? Yes, they do. Might a gunman pop up, it's possible. It's unlikely, but it's not impossible. And you still see. I mean, from where I stand, I see multiple patrols, police patrols, army patrols going through here. No one is dropping their guard.

And you were asking him -- and he speaks to, kind of, the posture that all Israelis need to be in. And right now, you asked him how he was feeling. And he said, it's not a time for feeling. It's time to do.

And he said, no, I haven't slept since Saturday.But the fire in his eyes, for the intensity of the work that his done and what is to come to keep his men safe, to keep Hamas out, to return the streets of Israel to the citizens of Israel, that -- that's right there. And I think that gets to what he was saying that, you know, he's not done. And I asked him the question, well, are you going to go into Gaza? Is there going to be a ground incursion? And he said, right now, all I am looking at is the hundred yards in front of me. And I think that really sums up. I mean, he'll get his command and his orders but he commanded himself out of his house in retirement Saturday morning. He said -- he just said, I'm going. And he went to help. And it's a right that this -- he now has thousands of troops at his disposal. He's cleared out the most of Hamas in the area. So, he is waiting for those next orders. My sense is that, you know, having got those -- that Kibbutz back, that was sort of a pause. But it wasn't a pause to rest back, it's that kind of pause you take before you go to move forward, and he connected to all of that.",

LIBBY WEISS, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  Well, today has just been a day of multiple barrages as, of course, everybody is seeing.

You are seeing all of those boats. This is a fishing area. A lot of people trying to go out to and get their food by using some of these boats. There have been lots of incursions over these boats going out into that waters that Israel is very keen on seeing what they are doing. But we should also note, there have been huge plumes of smoke. And we've actually seen some of the air strikes drop right into the sea there.I want to go become to Major Libby Weiss with the Israeli military, the Israeli Defense Forces. I do want to ask you, we heard -- you have from Clarissa there about what has been happening in Ashkelon, and not sure quite about the things that may have been hit there. And we should try to pull up a picture of Ashkelon as soon we can or show that video of what we saw earlier But we have also heard about what is going on in Sderot, that there has, according to our Nic Robertson who was there just about 10 minutes ago, that we heard some fire that was -- it sounded like it was from the ground, and that it was automatic weapon fire.

There are -- the entire country is talking about not just this war, but specifically about the hostages. And we have just heard some riveting and gut-wrenching comments from some of the families who have -- who are American, who have their loved ones, they believe who have been taken. And one of the things that they said was, we have heard nothing. Not a word from the Israeli military, from Israel officials, or from U.S. officials. Can you give us any update of where, how many hostages Hamas has taken and what is being done? What is the plan to try and get them back to safety? WEISS:  Well, first, I have to say on a personal level, we are all just devastated and horrified. And the sense of sadness and devastation that we are all feeling here is overwhelming, and it is something that the entire country feels nonstop. In order to try and get more information and to better understand what is taking place with their wellbeing, and their status, the IDF has two generals who are now working both within the military and with the families to try and get as much accurate information as possible. Of course, it's complex. The battle is ongoing here within Israel and we want to be sure that we're able to bring accurate and vetted information to families. But I do have to say that the fastest way for these hostages to return safely is for Hamas to do that, and that is something that could be done right now without any conditions, without any terms. And that would be the single fastest way for them to come home. But the entire country right now is focused on bringing them back, and we are all thinking about them constantly.",

And the point of that is just to stop Hamas' capability of being able to continue to attack us as we have seen.The operational reality is, of course, a very, very complicated one. And we are committed and thinking constantly and working constantly to bring back those hostages. But of course, the call here is to Hamas to release them immediately.

But they also have no regard for their own.And we understand that, of course, they have long placed their assets within civilian areas in the Gaza Strip. We are doing, at this stage, the maximum that we can operationally in light of what is taking place to minimize the impact on civilians. But again, we understand that this is a very complex operational reality on the ground. And we need to make sure first and foremost that Hamas does not have any capability to be able to continue attacking us, whether that's an attempt to infiltrate, whether it's all of the rockets that you have been seeing, whether it's by other methods.
