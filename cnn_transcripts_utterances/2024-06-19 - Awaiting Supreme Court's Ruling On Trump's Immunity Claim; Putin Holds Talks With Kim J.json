It's one of the most highly anticipated rulings this year and it has massive political implications. Trump's arguing that official acts should be immune from prosecution, which he says includes his alleged role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Now, I caught up with a few Republican members of Congress to get their thoughts on the pending decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  He doesn't -- he doesn't deserve the persecution he's gotten from the Biden administration. So we'll see -- we'll see what comes out with the Supreme Court decision. But this persecution of a political opponent -- the prior president -- is wrong. I'm going to respect the Supreme Court decision. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  Well, no. Nobody thinks he deserves absolute. It's -- the question is what counts as an official act. So he should get immunity for official acts. Every president should. That's long been the position of the (INAUDIBLE).",

Elsewhere in sports this morning, it looked like the Oilers were destined for disappointment after falling behind three games to none in this series. But now they have hopes of snapping a three-decade Stanley Cup drought for Canadian teams. Check it out last night. After winning game four in an 8-1 blowout, Edmonton jumped out to an early 3-0 lead thanks in large part to their captain, Connor McDavid. A three-time MVP had two goals and two assists to become the first player in NHL history to have back-to-back four-point games in the Stanley Cup Final. McDavid's last point was an empty net goal just seconds after Matthew Tkachuk made a spectacular save to keep it 4-3 at the time. But the effort here -- what you're watching all for naught.
