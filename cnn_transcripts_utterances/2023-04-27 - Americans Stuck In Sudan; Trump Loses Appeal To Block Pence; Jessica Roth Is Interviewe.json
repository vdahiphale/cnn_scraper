A 72-hour cease-fire that had only marginal effect is about to expire completely. Supplies, including food, water and medicine, they are running out. More than 500 people have now died in that violence, including two Americans.CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the State Department this morning. You know, Kylie, John Kirby, from the White House, told Kate yesterday there were only many dozens of Americans who were trying to get out of Sudan, but these people who are trying, what are they saying this morning?

When we talk to the family members of these Americans who are in Sudan right now, what they say is that it is an incredibly delicate, frustrating situation that they're trying to maneuver. Not to mention, you know, the safety ramifications that they're running into. So, we spoke with a number of Americans, particularly whose parents are in the country and trying to get out right now, and what they described was, quote, shock and disgust when it comes to the U.S. government's lack of support for the safety of these citizens.Now, we know that the U.S. government has said that they are in close connectivity with these Americans, that they are helping to facilitate their way out of the country, but that isn't the story when you talk to most of these American families who are essentially trying to figure out, you know, the quickest way out, but also, in their words, making life or death decisions as they determine which pathway might be the best for their family members who are in the country. And as you've said earlier, this happens as there's been this cease- fire that was struck earlier this week. It's about to run out. But it hasn't even necessarily held across the country. So, when that expires, the question is, will it get even more violent? And here are some of the Americans that we spoke to in the U.S. who described the conditions that their family members, Americans in the county, are facing as they try and get their way out of the country.

She's been on the stand accusing Donald Trump of rape and defamation. Yesterday she became emotional when giving a detailed account of the alleged sexual assault, saying at one point, I'm here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen. Also testifying, quote, he lied and shattered my reputation and I'm here to try to get my life back.This is a civil lawsuit and Carroll is suing Trump for battery and defamation, alleging that he raped her in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman back in the '90s, and then attacked her character when she eventually spoke publicly about it. Joining us right now for more on her testimony, what to expect now, is former federal prosecutor Jessica Roth. It's great to have you here, Jessica. Thank you for coming in.
