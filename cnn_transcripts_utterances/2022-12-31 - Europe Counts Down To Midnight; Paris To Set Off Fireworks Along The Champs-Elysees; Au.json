I'll be with you for the next four hours for our New Year's Eve Special Broadcast.And we have a star studded lineup of guests. From the bright lights of Broadway with the cast of \"The Beautiful Noise,\" the highly anticipated musical based on the life and music of Neil Diamond, to a New Year's toast with Theo James, the star of the Emmy winning show \"The White Lotus.\" And we are just minutes away from New Year's Eve in Mombasa, Kenya and at the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul, Turkey. CNN's Scott McLean is in Istanbul while our Larry Madowo is in Mombasa. Good to have you both with us. Happy New Year. I want to start with you first, Scott.

They are lined up here on the waterfront. They are packed several deep.You can see really they're up on the planter boxes there. They're up on any kind of height that they can find to get their heads above this massive crowd. Just literally five minutes ago we had all the space in the world and now suddenly as we get close to midnight, we have no space at all. Obviously, Lynda, like many countries in the world, Turkey has had a pretty rough go in 2022, with inflation biting particularly hard energy prices. The currency has really taken a hit as well. [16:00:10] And so, when you talk to people in this country, I can't say that there's a whole ton of optimism in 2023, but people are definitely hoping that people will better off in 2023 than they were in 2020. And it seems like we're just about midnight. Yes, we're just at midnight right now. Fireworks haven't started but I think it's 2023 right now in Istanbul. So happy New Year's from Turkey, Lynda.",
