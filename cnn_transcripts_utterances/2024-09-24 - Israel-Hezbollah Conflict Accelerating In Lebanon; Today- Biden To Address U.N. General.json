Hezbollah firing a barrage of rockets from Lebanon into Israel overnight, targeting the northern port city of Haifa attacks coming one day after Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon killed nearly 500 people, including dozens of women and children and wounded 1,600 others, making it the deadliest day of Israeli strikes in Lebanon in nearly two decades. The moment of one of those airstrikes caught on camera as a journalist prepared to go live on the air. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)",

There are an estimated 60,000 and Hezbollah claims its up to 100,000, including reservists of armed trained troops that could attack Israel, but what it could do is degrade the large numbers up to 150,000 rockets and missiles that Israel believes are in placed in those various northern villages pointed south.Many of the sophisticated missiles, however, they're supplied by Iran so Hezbollah has been hesitant to use them. Some of them cruise missiles that can reportedly reach every major populated area in Israel are supposed to be Iran strategic defense. In case Iran gets threatened or hit by Israel or the U.S. or anyone else in future. So Hezbollah has its hands tied, its got all of this weaponry stored in southern Lebanon some of it ready to go, and some of it deeply embedded underground and that is a target for Israel. I think the fact that some of it is deeply embedded underground means were going to see at least Israeli raids, if not a full ground incursion to dismantle and displaced a lot of it.",

I mean, he, he -- I don't want to say in voluntarily it was his decision but in some ways it seems to be a punctuation mark on all of these broader trends that we've been looking at.",

That's being challenged now, most notably by Russia but with the support and alliances effectively with North Korea and Iran. And in the background, China, it's really China that has the card to play here.China wants to play a bigger role on the international stage. And I think that's going to be the ongoing debate now as the Chinese economy grows and particularly if the next president wants to step back from the world stage and creates a gap really for that to happen. So there are these fundamental lines in geopolitics really forming here and President Biden has seen his role as an international policeman. Let's see if the next president does the same. I think the view in the past has always been all see that Donald Trump would step back from that position, will wait to see how he treated if he wins. Kamala Harris should expect to play things in a similar vein to Present Biden, of course.",

The offer includes a 30 percent raise over the next four years, but union leaders say there will not be an immediate vote on the deal. The strike is now in its second week, it has brought production of commercial jets at the company to a near standstill. Today, House Republicans look to bypass growing rejection in their own ranks of the three-month government spending bill present and to by House Speaker Johnson, a procedural floor move would rely on Democrats to help pass the legislation and avoid a government shutdown. They will need a two-thirds majority pretty to get it done. All right. A hurricane watch now in effect for parts of Florida, the southwest coast, preparing for the arrival of the storm system currently over the Caribbean. It is expected to become a major hurricane in the coming days. Let's get straight to our meteorologist, the weatherman, Derek Van Dam, to help us understand it. Derek, good morning.",
