Many people have been displaced multiple times.I am currently in the south of Gaza in Rafah and you walk down the street here and you just see haphazard -- you can't even call them tents they have sticks with tarps over them trying to where families are desperately trying to provide shelter for their children. You have toddlers walking down the road with containers waiting for water trucks to try and get some safe drinking water for their families. We know there has been a fluctuation and a very severe shortage of food, medical equipment. The healthcare system across Gaza has been decimated. People are actually not sure where they can go to receive medical treatment because they never know which healthcare centers or which hospitals will potentially be open and functioning and able to provide that kind of service. They don't know if they have the supplies. It has been a consistently deteriorating situation and people are exhausted. They don't know where to go next and they don't have any security or safety.",

We meet with them. I have met and spoken with some of the families of these hostages and their pain is tangible. You can feel it. We are continually working and we reiterate that we are working as one of our top priorities to see these hostages reunited with their families and of course we are always ready to play that neutral intermediary role and facilitate the release and transfer of those hostages back to their families in Israel and in some cases around the world. But it really is such a heartbreaking situation to have 12 months of being ripped apart from your family member.

We know that people have been living in these makeshift tents, these haphazard shelters for months and over the summer the sun beats down on this. This causes the deterioration in the tents. With winter coming it unfortunately brings rain and there is not sufficient drainage in these areas where people, so many hundreds of thousands of people are displaced and this is a huge concern for us. There are already sanitation and hygiene concerns. There is already not enough latrines, toilets, bathrooms for people in these areas and so the flooding can bring more health, public health impacts. We are of course continually assessing the situation and responding. We have a field hospital close to where I am. We have water wells and similar but it is a very, very concerning situation going into winter especially with the weather. People don't have the clothes. Children are fast outgrowing what they do have and families simply can't afford to provide more even if they could find it in any kind of market here.",

It was on these burned up computer screens that Roni and her colleagues told their parents they'd seen worrying signs from Hamas, including accounts of fighters testing the fence line. The Israeli military ignored other warning signs as well, including these training videos Hamas posted openly online in the months before, and earlier intelligence since uncovered by Israeli media about Hamas's intent to attack Israeli communities and even take multiple hostages.
