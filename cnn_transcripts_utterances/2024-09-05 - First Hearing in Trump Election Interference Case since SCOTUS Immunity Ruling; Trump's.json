Right now, his lawyers are hundreds of miles away representing him in a federal courtroom in Washington as a key hearing in Trump's election interference case gets underway. It is the first hearing since special counsel Jack Smith revised his indictment following the U.S. Supreme Court's historic ruling on presidential immunity earlier this year. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider is live in Washington for us. Jessica, good to see you. I want you to do take us through this hearing and what we're expecting today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this case has been on pause for quite some time.The last time we saw hearing this case was last October. Of course, all of this on pause while the Supreme Court sorted out whether or not Donald Trump would be immune from some or all of the charges. The Supreme Court in July said that he is immune from any prosecution as it regards official acts taken while he was president. But that really didn't give a clear indication as to how this will proceed. So Judge Tanya Chutkan at the federal court will be deciding either today or in the coming days how to move this case forward. So today's hearing will allow Judge Chutkan to really hear arguments on both sides who -- how they'll propose this case proceeds. So we saw the revised indictment that was filed by the special counsel in the case last week. Jack Smith's team actually left all four criminal charges in place. But they adjusted the set of facts to take out certain interactions that could be considered official actions by the president. And then late last week, we saw both sides lay out how they believe this case should proceed. It's really interesting, the divergence and how each side wants to go. Jack Smith wants immediate briefing and then he left the bulk of the scheduling to the discretion of the judge. Trump's team, though, saying they plan to challenge still every aspect of this case, including the validity of the special counsel's appointment. And they really don't want much action in this case until well after the election, pinpointing the bulk of the action to start in early 2025. So this could be a really contentious hearing that's just starting probably in the last minute or so. We're expecting it will last anywhere between one and three hours. It's important to note Donald Trump is not in court today. He's not required to be. And he has already entered a not guilty plea on this new indictment. And this hearing today will also serve as an arraignment, where his lawyers will enter that not guilty plea. So it's a little bit of a technical, procedural hearing. Probably not a lot of fireworks. But it's going to give us a good glimpse as to how this case is going to move forward. We will not see a trial in this case before the election. And of course, if Donald Trump is reelected, it is quite possible this case is just wiped out by his Justice Department. So we will see. There's a lot up in the air now, we'll see how the next few hours go.",

The appeals court in Georgia has to decide whether or not that case can proceed because of issues with the prosecutor there, Fani Willis, and whether or not the challenges to her actually overseeing the case. So that one's on a real pause while the appeals court even determines if we'll move forward. And then we had that classified documents case, remember where Donald Trump allegedly took the classified documents after he was president, refused to give them back to the U.S. government. The charges resulted but then the judge down there, a federal judge, dismissed those charges. Jack Smith is now appealing to the appeals court, the 11th Circuit, to try to get those charges revived. So really the only case that is moving forward here that's not at a standstill because of an appellate review is this one in D.C. And even this one is riddled with technical glitches about how it's going to proceed. And Donald Trump's team promising they are also going to appeal every step of this as well. I mean, you got to -- you got to say about Trump's legal team, they have been very persistent and very, very, very lucky, very successful in delaying all of these cases. And this is one of them.",

      "sentences": "Yes, sure. Glad to be with both of you today. This indictment that the special prosecutor has now placed beforethe court is just a pared-down version of his first indictment. And what he did is he tried to remove references in the indictment to the former president Trump and he's now calling him candidate Trump. And he's doing that in response to the Supreme Court's decision, which said essentially that a president has certain immunity and they have protections. And so he's tried to remove any type of lens that the court might view Trump as a president at the time these acts were committed. He's trying to repeat, he's trying to fix that in this indictment. Whether or not he's successful, I don't know. I think he's going to have some problems with the indictment. I think he's got some issues when it comes to how he references the former vice president, Mike Pence, and the interactions between Trump and Pence. But these are things that Judge Chutkan in the court that is having a hearing today will be weighing through and deciding whether or not in fact that conduct was immune from federal prosecution. And if so, did the fact that that conduct may have been placed before a grand jury for this indictment, this second indictment, did that in fact spoil the entire indictment?",

      "sentences": "Yes, sure. The Supreme Court basically has told her and told the parties in the case that certain conduct of the former president cannot beconsidered. And so my belief is that she's probably gone through the indictment. She's compared the old indictment, that it was the first indictment and the new indictment, the pared-down version, to see if some of that conduct or references to that conduct was removed. I think she's also likely reviewing the law on the appointment of special counsel. Remember that if Trump and his team are known for one thing, it's that, when the going gets tough, they attack the prosecutors. Some of those attacks may or may not be justified but that's what they do. They go after the prosecutor. They've done it in Georgia is they've gone after Fani Willis, saying she should come off the case. They did it in Florida in the doc -- classified documents case, saying that Jack Smith was not lawfully appointed and he had no authority to bring the indictment on those charges against the former president. And they're doing it now. And that motion is actually pending before Judge Chutkan. But they will be attacking  Jack Smith's appointment under the constitutional provisions. And especially given some of the comments and references made by certain members of the Supreme Court as it related to whether or not the special counsel appointment was appropriate. So I'm sure she's looking at the law, those things, to decide if she agrees with the Florida court or if she just takes a different view than the Florida court. If she does, that makes an issue right for appeal. But these are things that she's probably digging into the law. (CROSSTALK)",

And so if they get a casewhere they take it down the Supreme Court, ultimately, they're going to have at least one judge, we know one justice, Justice Thomas, who seems to be very sympathetic to that argument. And if he starts bearing down on some of his conservative colleagues on the court, my guess is that you might see at least some tailoring of the authority given to special counsel. Remember the issue here is that the special counsel was not confirmed by the Senate in the case as you have in other special counsel situations. Sometimes you have a former U.S. attorney or a former Department of Justice high-ranking official, who comes in and they've been confirmed by the Senate in their role. That's not the case with the special counsel here. So those are issues that she's going to have to grapple with. The fact that she may decide differently simply means that now there is a diversion in opinions between two federal judges or two federal courts in different districts in the country. And so that's the kind of thing that appeals courts typically weigh in on. And certainly those are things that the Supreme Court might be interested.",

Thiscase has been pending for much longer than the 60 days. The fact that they're moving on at this expeditiously -- and I think so some of that is because of setting by the court report back dates for those types of things -- you know, that's just the way the court system works. I think the reality here is that there was this big push that somehow people believed that somehow this case was going to be tried before the election. And so there was a self-imposed gas pedal that was pressed down to get the case moved. And early on, there was no way this case was going to wrap itself through the justice system, through the court system, through the appeals process and actually have any finality before the election. So some of the things that they did, I think they could have avoided the criticism that there will be at the Justice Department by not trying to make it look like they were rushing this up so that this could come and somehow have an impact on the election. They could have held back. They did not do that. But as far as this policy, this 60 days, it is a policy. Basically what it does is it keeps federal prosecutors from coming in by the dark of night and indicting a candidate right before an election and trying to sway the election one way or another. But remember this case has been pending for a long time in this court with this judge, has been through some appeals issues. This is simply a continuation forward with a cleaned-up version of the indictment.",

She's already had some briefing from both sides about how each side thinks the case should move forward. Some people think it should move forward with a lot of briefing, a lot of appeals. That would be the Trump team. Jack Smith's team has said, no, we can just write a brief. We can tell you what the evidence is and we can move forward at the Court's pleasure. And so she'll find some balance there. But again, now that this sort of self imposed, expeditious process has been removed and is no longer overhanging this trial, I think you'll see the schedule slowed down a little bit. And there won't be this urgency to get things moving. You already see that. You already see it in some of Jack Smith's response. As the special counsel said, we're, you know, we don't -- we don't have to have it. So she'll listen to both sides and she'll make a decision on whether or not she needs to actually have a evidentiary hearing and receive evidence about what the government expects to present at trial, what evidence was presented to this grand jury, how they fashioned the restructuring of the allegations in this case. And then she, at the same time, frankly, could just have them argue that in a brief. Federal judges are not known for having multiple hearings in these types of matters. They rule typically on the pleadings and on briefings in a case. This case is unique and everybody ought to just know this is a one-of-a- kind case. And so it would not surprise me at all for her to say, look, we're going to do this a little different. We're going to put your evidence on because we've got to get a record before an appeals court. I want everything on the record. I want to have testimony. I will have sworn testimony as opposed to just briefing about what you expect to say. That sort of makes it, I think while it may drag the process a little bit, again, we don't have to rush to have it before the election. So that type of tedious process and that type of tedious hearing, I think, had actually proved that official to an appeals court as they review whether or not the indictment in fact addresses all the concerns with the recent Supreme Court immunity decision.",

First of all, they're going to talk about the scheduling in this case, how it should move forward. But the bigger issue that they're addressing actually right now is the immunity issue, because the Supreme Court gave a road map, saying that official acts by the president are immune from prosecution. But then there are some that may be in a gray area that prosecutors might be able to charge that they can overcome some issues. So there's a lot to be determined as to what in this even new indictment can be allowed to move forward, based on the Supreme Court's decision. It is very muddy. It is very legal and technical and that is what they have to sort through. So now they're proposing how exactly do they sort through that? Prosecutors are saying, look, we want to go first, we want to file our brief, our papers and argue why we believe that everything that we put in the indictment is within the parameters of the Supreme Court's decision. We're going to hear next from Trump's legal team. And presumably, based on their previous filings, they're going to challenge even that initial course of action. Donald Trump's team has said, no, no, we actually want to go first in filing our papers. We want to challenge this new indictment as a whole. We also want to bring up discovery issues, things we might be entitled to get from the government. So the Trump's team is going to challenge everything prosecutors are saying. Right now, prosecutors are standing up before the judge. Saying, Judge, it's simple. We want to -- we want to lay out our case as to why everything we've put in the indictment is sound under the Supreme Court's ruling. And then we should be able to move forward with Trump's team challenging that. They are sort of laying out a schedule in and of itself there. They're saying to the judge, we should be able to have our brief, prosecutors, in about two to three weeks. Judge Chutkan saying, OK, that would put us the end of September. So she's really got two things she has to worry about. She has to worry about how they're handling the immunity issue, which sort of things can still be included in the charges in the indictment. And then she has to figure out how do we even move this case forward? Remember, Judge Tanya Chutkan, she's a -- she's an appointee of President Barack Obama. She has been running this case before it was halted on a very tight ship. She wanted to keep things moving along. She's been forwarded it in that for many months now. But she does keep things very tight, very on schedule. So she said she's not going to make any decisions today. But now prosecutors are arguing, you know, what they want. And actually now it looks like -- now it looks like Trump's team is up and they're proposing how they want things to move forward. So we're watching as this plays out. But again, like I said, a bit technical, a bit procedural. And this is something that could play out for at least another hour or two",

And so that's going to be a real question. Whether or not they are certain, if you're having a conversation, the president, and you're having a conversation with the vice president do you have to analyze the conversations sentence by sentence? Do you have to say, well, I was speaking to him as the vice president here. But then on this side, I was speaking to him as the president of the Senate under the Constitution. Does the Constitution say that he's a member of the Senate or does it say that the vice president, in his role as vice president, which is in the executive branch, also does something in the legislative branch? But he's still always the vice president. I just don't know that you're going to have an appetite. You may have, Judge Chutkan may find this but I'm not sure if the Supreme Court, that they're going to have an appetite for going through and dissecting each sentence of a conversation that takes place in the same location. About whether or not those comments were from a candidate, from a president or to a vice president or to a president of the Senate, how those things work. It makes it sort of an unwieldy process and that may be a bridge too far. That's a real issue. In this case. And then this new indictment on the back, that Jack Smith, who did those allegations -- remember, he pulled out of this new indictment some of the discussions and allegations relating to Trump's conversations with Justice Department officials. But he left in this indictment conversations that the former president is alleged to have had with his then vice president. And so the question will be, under what circumstances, if any, can those conversations be deemed to be outside of the cloak of immunity? And that's what Trump's team is going to be pressing. You've already seen in some of the feed that's going on on screen, that Trump's lawyer raised this issue, like, look, the Supreme Court has decided this. And Judge can said, no, they sent it back to me to talk about. But remember, she's not the ultimate decider because the Supreme Court's already paved the road for this appeal and for a reconsideration or a consideration of any of her decisions later in the case.",

I think that's exactly the kind of thing the court has to clarify. It is an important part of the case that Trump really was, you know, at the point of his supporters threatening to kill Mike Pence, trying to convince the vice president to really undermine our electoral process. Getting that clearly as part of something that's relevant to the case, it's not an official act, it's something that can be prosecuted, that would be terrific if we could get that clarified up front.",

      "sentences": "Yes.I mean, I know, Corey, you've been asking the question that we are seeing in real time, the importance of the immunity ruling, the SCOTUS ruling. Give me a sense of how this ruling actually can be implemented in what were seeing in the hearing today and the task of Judge Chutkan and what she's dealing with to try and ensure that the indictment, the papers, everything that she's hearing today is, in line with that SCOTUS ruling. Well, she of course, has to comply with the ruling. But it is important to note how outrageous the ruling itself was. Never before has the Supreme Court said that former, not sitting, former presidents are immune when it comes to their official actions. So now the lower courts have the obligation to try to implement that. But any common sense, any legally sound implementation of the ruling has to have a very narrow sense of what an official act is that constitutes immunity. Almost by definition, when presidents are acting in a criminal way, they're not acting pursuant to their official duties. They're acting pursuant to their self-interests in the narrowest, worst way. That's what a criminal violation is. And so the task here, there is an argument that the Trump team has, which is anything, any attempt to lobby the vice president is an official act. That's how they'll put it. And I think the response here is, no, not lobbying the vice president to violate his oath of office to undermine our election system and to engage in a self-coup. That's not an official act, that's the kind of crime that's certainly is not immune -- immunized even by this quite radical and dangerous Supreme Court opinion.",

And the election has been looming over this case ever since it first went into the courtroom more than a year ago. I'll read you some of the exchange you saw on the side of your screen. But Trump's lawyer basically saying it is incredibly unfair that they were able to put -- they being prosecutors -- a lot of this evidence into the public record, meaning the superseding indictment. And then Mr. Lauro, the attorney, said, it's too close to the election and the judge said, ah. Because repeatedly, Trump's team has come back to this idea of Donald Trump being unfairly prejudiced with this case as we lead up to the election. And the judge said, I understand there's an election in pending. But she said quite clearly, this court is not concerned with an electoral schedule. And again, Eleni, this is something that we've seen Judge Chutkan repeatedly return to. It was about a year ago back in October at the last in-person hearing that we saw in this case, that Judge Chutkan said, this trial would not yield to the election cycle. That was back when they had actually tried to set a trial date of March of this year, which has long since passed. Obviously, with the challenges and waiting for the Supreme Court but Donald Trump's lawyers not missing an opportunity to get that mention of the election into this hearing within the first hour of this hearing and making sure that the judge is aware that they are still -- they still believe that this could unfairly prejudice Donald Trump.",

Donald Trump's lawyers were very stern in recommending that theyneed to deal with the legality of this indictment first. They don't want to deal with some of the immunity issues right off the bat that the prosecution wants to deal with. I mean, there's a real clash here as to how to proceed. Donald Trump's team essentially saying that they believe that the grand jury process was flawed. Because remember, there was another grand jury that was seated and heard this evidence that led to this new indictment that was issued last week. Trump's team is saying that that grand jury heard evidence of things that would be immune from prosecution. Namely, these communications with vice president Mike Pence. So they're saying because of that, because the grand jury heard this evidence that should be immune, that the whole indictment should be dismissed. Because under the Supreme Court's ruling, the grand jury should have never heard that that evidence in the first place. So that is the broad argument from Donald Trump's team. Whereas prosecutors are saying, let us lay out to you first, Judge, in a brief, in papers to be filed in the next few weeks, why we believe that, under the Supreme Court's ruling, everything we presented, everything we've laid out in this new indictment, it falls within the parameters of the Supreme Court's decision. That none of, this none of the actions that we've laid out are immune from prosecution. So there's a real clash at the bottom of this case as to the foundation of this case. Trump's team still believes it should be dismissed outright, whereas Judge Chutkan even seems to say, wait a second. If the case was to be dismissed outright, don't you think the Supreme Court would have said that rather than laying out this sort of road map as to how I, as a federal court judge at the trial level, should be proceeding here? So again, there's this core clash of how this case should move forward. And it's still something we're dealing with, nearly an hour into this hearing. The prosecutors now back up to argue their stance yet again, Eleni.",

And just -- that's just the reality of it. To suggest somehow that the election is not playing a role in this case is -- would mean that you have blinders on. This case has moved quickly, frankly, and lay the blame, if there is to be blame laid at the timing of the prosecution, this case could have been brought two years ago, could have been brought immediately after January the 6th. It could have been brought just like other people were charged at that time. But instead, there was a delay in the deployment (ph) of the special counsel and ultimately the case was brought here just a year or so before the election. And that, in a complex case, that period of time of 12 to 18 months to 24 months in a complex case is nothing in the federal system. And it's not unusual for those time periods to be extended. The courts typically do it so that there's not a rush and the defendant's right to a speedy trial is typically waived. So this case has moved at a pretty quick clip, frankly. But it could have been brought and we could have been having these discussions about appeals and looking at second indictments a year or so back, had the case been brought earlier. Now that may have just been a factor of getting evidence, I don't know what that reason was. And frankly, you know, at this point, it's kind of crying over spilled milk. But it seems to me that there's no reason, at 60 days out from the election, to keep trying to play this game o trying to get a hearing again or rush something in. The easiest thing the judge can do is she says -- I saw on one of your little notes that popped up on the screen to the public, was that the judge said, I'm not going to be dragged into the election. You know, the easiest way to do that is wait 60 days and call everybody back to court. A federal judge can wait 60 days and, frankly, in a federal system, that's no time at all. So that would remove this cloud and these continued efforts and arguments about rush, rush, rush, frankly play into the defense's hand and to Trump's hand by making it appear as if there's some motivation, some political motivation as opposed to simply getting to the facts of the case, getting to a sound basis to analyze the Supreme Court decision. You know, this argument that the judge has said about, look, the Supreme Court could have thrown the indictment out, that's not the Supreme Court's typical role. They needed to be a fact-finding. There has to be some basis to look at and to review by a trial judge to say these acts are in and these acts are out. And so that's why they sent it back to the court, to have that happen. So the fact that the only indictment wasn't dismissed, I think, misses the point a little bit at this -- at this stage.",
