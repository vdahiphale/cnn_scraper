      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Ukraine still on high alert as it reelsthrough a massive Russian strike which the Kremlin says was retaliation for a cross-border attack. We'll speak to one of President Zelenskyy's advisors for the very latest. Then an American citizen being held in Iran's notorious Evin prison is speaking to CNN from behind bars. We'll have more on that remarkable and exclusive interview. Plus, tens of thousands of Israelis take to the streets, angry at controversial judicial reforms. But, first this evening, dawn brought fresh grief for Ukraine on Thursday, after a massive barrage of Russian missiles killed at least 16 people. Now, Ukrainian officials say Russia fired a total of 84 missiles and 12 drones right across the country, as you can see there, using an unprecedented array of weaponry. Five people died in this strike in Lviv. Ukraine's president says Russia attacked critical infrastructure and residential buildings, saying Moscow means to intimidate as well as terrorize civilians. Russia fired several different types of missiles including six nuclear capable Kinzhal ballistic missiles. Ukraine says it has no capabilities to counter them. They are urging the West to send more defensive weapons, and to impose more sanctions to stop future attacks from killing even more civilians. I want to get the latest now from Melissa Bell who joins us this evening from Kharkiv. Melissa, what we've just laid out just shows that the largest barrage, I think of strikes so far on Ukraine this year. Just talk us through the damage across the country including where you are in Kharkiv.",

      "sentences": "Of course, as you mentioned, Isa, the most tragic, that loss of life, mainly around Lviv. But of course, as yousay, these are strikes that are intended as President Zelenskyy says to continue to keep Ukrainians under pressure. It's been about a month since we'd had such a large series of missile strikes. Most of them coming over the course of the night. Here in Kharkiv, it was critical infrastructure that was hit, about 15 of those more than 80 missiles you mentioned landed in the greater Kharkiv region, and perhaps you can see behind me, all you'll see are the cars on the street there because the city is practically entirely without electricity at all. So inside the homes of people, there is no electricity, there is no heat, there is no water as a result of those critical strikes. And that is the point to put people in a maximum state of discomfort as regularly as they can, and keeping them in a sense of uncertainty, because no one knows when these strikes are going to come. Beyond the overnight strikes that you mentioned, Isa, there have also been -- there's been an uptick of activity all along the frontline, not just around Bakhmut, say Ukrainian authorities, but in other key flash points to the north of that along the frontline In places like Lyman and around Kupiansk. But also to the northern border, to the north of where I am here, what the Ukrainian authorities are saying tonight is that they're seeing an uptick in engineering activity. And what we've seen over the course of the day since the overnight strikes have been artillery, mortar barrages, all along that northern border. So places like Chernihiv, Sumy region here, Kharkiv region. The fear is, we've just been hearing the air raid sirens again, Isa, the nationwide one, but also the more local one, warning of those S-300 that come across the border, that just are not very long range, but that managed to make it here to Kharkiv. The fear is that some of that pressure on the whole of Ukraine might continue. Isa.",

We should commend that in some sense because remember, our ultimate objective here is, unfortunately, to stop Russia from having the resources to divert their resources from being able to wage this war effort, in order for them to focus on their domestic issues, rather than on their foreign policy issues as they see  them, right? In terms of this war. So it's no question that, you know, life is not going to get better in Russia over the medium run with this sort of government, with this sort of regime. And the fact that things are starting to get out of hand is unfortunately in the situation, something that we should welcome.

U.S. citizen Siamak Namazi was in Iran on a business trip in 2015 when he was wrongly convicted of cooperating with a hostile government, presumably the U.S., and he has been left behind during multiple U.S.-Iran prison exchanges in the year since. Well, Evin prison sits in an ironically scenic location in the hills of northern Iran, with the harsh conditions many prisoners face have made it really an icon of an autocratic regime, bent really on crushing anyone it deems an enemy. It is from inside Evin's high walls seen here during a controlled media tour that Siamak Namazi spoke with our Christiane Amanpour, pleading with the Biden administration to finally bring him home. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIAMAK NAMAZI, IMPRISONED IN IRAN (via telephone):  The very fact that I've chosen to take this risk and appear on CNN from Evin prison, it should just tell you how dire my situation has become by this point. I have been a hostage for seven and a half years now. That's six times the duration of a hostage crisis. I keep getting told that I'm going to be rescued, and deals fall apart where I get abandoned. Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden to finally hear out -- finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. And I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures.

Like all the other previous releases. And that lands firmly for the United States on the table of President Biden, which is why he specifically asked me to be able to directly address President Biden, which he did. And of course, we actually reached out, as you mentioned, to the administration. Just going to read you their comments, and then we'll discuss a little bit further. But they said \"Iran's unjust imprisonment and exploitation of U.S. citizens for use as political leverage is outrageous, inhumane, and contrary to international norms. The United States will always stand up for the rights of our citizens wrongly detained overseas, including Siamak Namazi. Senior officials from both the White House and the State Department meet and consult regularly with the Namazi family. And we will continue to do so until this unacceptable detention ends and Siamak is reunited with his family.\" So Isa, the truth of the matter is that, he is a pawn, that's what everyone including the U.S. government describes him as. And it is going to be some kind of deal to get struck. But what kind of a deal, especially in this very highly charged moment of very negative relations between Iran and the United States --",

What we know so far from emergency services is that three people were shot  and wounded, one of them is in critical condition, they have all been transferred to the hospital. We are hearing (INAUDIBLE) reports from Israeli police that they may have as you noted shot at least one of the attackers, say that there may have been more than one attackers. Now so far, authorities are calling this a suspected terror attack. I should remind you that not only was this -- did this take place on a very busy going out, with bars and restaurants were likely completely full of people, but it also happened not far from a similar attack that happened last year during that initial wave of terror attacks that sort of prompted the recent Israeli authorities operations in the West Bank. That attack last year on a bar killing three Israelis. But it's also happening on the same day of these massive anti-Israeli government protest against the planned judicial reforms. So when the shooting took place, there were likely hundreds, if not thousands of Israelis protesting not far away on the streets of Tel Aviv, the continuation of the protests that we've seen all day long.

But you remember, recently it was the police after a numberother officers were killed and tortured by the gangs and couldn't even recover their bodies for several days. It was the police that demonstrate against their own government because they say, they are simply as you said, outgunned, don't have the resources. The United States and Canada have promised more weapons, more armored tanks, armored trucks, that kind of thing to help the police. But of course, the Haitian government has asked for actual boots on the ground for the militaries to come in and assist our police. At this point, no country seems to be willing to take that step of sending troops to restore order. And for the moment, at least, it seems like the gangs will have the upper hand and the government here is just overwhelmed by this problem.",
