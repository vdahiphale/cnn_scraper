How badly damaged is Cohen's credibility in the eyes of the jury. Hurricane force winds and torrential rains lead having four dead in Houston. Parts of the South now facing life-threatening flooding and power outages. And the defense strategy in the bribery trial of Bob Menendez coming into focus. The embattled senator blaming everything on his cancer- stricken wife. (MUSIC)",

      "sentences": "All right, 5Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. Wonderful to have you with us. Developing story right now in Houston, Texas. Hurricane force winds cutting a deadly path through the area, leaving at least four people dead and nearly a million people across the region without power. Wow, those wins taking down powerlines, trees, and residences in the city. Downtown Houston hit hard. So you here, the Wells Fargo Plaza where debris and remnants of buildings are still swirling. We're going to get much more coverage from our weather team coming up in just a few minutes, but stay safe out there this morning if you are in the Houston area. All right. Let's turn now to law and politics because there was a pivotal day for Donald Trump, and it might have honestly been his best day yet in the course of his hush money trial. The prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, faltering on the witness as Trump's attorney Todd Blanche needled him over inconsistencies in his previous testimony. Earlier this week, Cohen testified to an October 2016 phone call with Trump on his bodyguard's phone in which Cohen said they discussed the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. On Thursday, however, defense lawyer revealed text messages that Cohen had sent to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, immediately before the call. Those texts asking for help with a teenager who had been prank calling Cohen. Blanche then asked Cohen, quote, on Tuesday when you were under oath and testifying, you were certain it was accurate, you had a phone call to President Trump but now you're saying you're not certain it was accurate. Cohen responding I believe I also spoke to Mr. Mr. President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on. And it's going to be resolved. Blanche firing back: We're not asking for your belief. This jury doesn't want to hear what you think happened. Outside the courtroom, Trump was joined once again by a crew of Republican allies eager to defend him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA):  This is a crooked sham trial to try to hurt the nominee who's going to be the president United States, whether or not they like it. REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO):  This is a scam. It is a sham, it is a show. And we are here to expose every bit of it. Mr. President, we stand with you. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  We're here of our own volition because there are things we can say that President Trump is unjustly not allowed to say. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it goes to show how risky it is when you are resting most of your case on someone like Michael Cohen when someone who has a history of lying under oath and the jury is going to take that into account. And what we saw yesterday was a very aggressive effort by Trump's attorneys to, you know, bring into question Cohen's credibility and poke holes in this anterior point and actually raise real questions about whether what he's saying -- whether what he's saying about Trump being involved in knowing about these hush money payments is actually true.And again, this is so reliant on Cohen's testimony. Everything about this, he is the one person connecting Trump to the other evidence we've seen laid out so far in this trial. And so to have any kind of questioning about his credibility could be a huge moment for Trump moving forward.",

So let's talk about the politics of this. We showed those freedom caucus members who were the ones we showed calling this a sham trial. They said that they went up their of their own volition. That was Matt Gaetz's phrase.They were not -- the Trump campaign didn't pay for them to be there, which we have seen in other instances, they have the Trump campaign has brought people in. They did not do that in this case. What, what do you think this particular crew doing this says? And isn't any sort of statement that the Trump campaign didn't ask for these guys to go, that they just kind of showed up.",

These are also many of the same members who are part of the oversight committee who have made attacking the justice system, attacking the department of justice central focus of their efforts on that committee and so even the fact that they were in New York yesterday delayed so a hearing and a vote on holding and content attorney the attorney general, over these -- over Biden's classified documents case.So this particular group of people isn't surprising, but it is notable that we have now seen so many Republicans make this move. We saw Rick Scott, we've seen other senators kind of make the voyage to show their solidarity with Trump. This is clearly becoming a theme and something that Republicans feel like they need to do to kind show that they're on the former president's side. And this is all within the context of 2024 elections.",

According to reports, the suspect was armed with a knife and an iron bar and was shot when he moved toward police. Fire damage inside the synagogue described as significant. All right. Now to Gaza where it's just past noon and where desperately needed humanitarian aid is being delivered at this hour through the floating pier built by the U.S. military. Central Command says trucks have started moving ashore with international aid and the maritime corridor is entirely humanitarian in, in nature. Part of an ongoing multinational effort to deliver more aid to Palestinians. Officials say, no, U.S. troops went ashore in Gaza. CNN's Max Foster joins us now live from London. Max, good morning to you. This pier, a step in the direction that Palestinians need, but still so that invasion of Rafah is -- seems to be ongoing, if not escalating.",

So it's getting the -- you know, keeping up with them, getting the aid to them but all the aid workers are suffering from the same problems, of course, as well because they're having to move around.The big issue currently is obviously see that the Rafah crossing is closed and that's where much of the aid was coming through. That's not possible, which is why this is seen a such a lifeline then just thinking. And, you know, just thinking about what you said there, Kasie, about no U.S. boots actually touching the beach there. They don't want to be seen to be going in or being involved in this invasion, but they've managed to build a $300 million pier in stormy seas and actually get it connected to the land without actually touching the land. So all credit to the U.S. forces involved here and they're hoping to get 90 trucks a day into Gaza. It's not enough and they're going to struggle to get out to the people, but it's positive news for Palestinians, at least.",

You've seen in Georgia, people in a lead is being accused of being dictators and also in other countries as well around the area, had this assassination, didn't we, as well, this assassination attempt.There's this idea that to be a strong leader, to be in inspired by Donald Trump, you have to be autocratic. I'm not -- I'm not trying to imply anything on Donald Trump here, but there's a movement that he's inspiring is seen by many protesters, at least to be undermining democracy. So, the scene is undemocratic and dictator-like. I'm not sure that's how it intends it. I'm not sure that's how he wants to be, but that's how it's being interpreted in parts over here.",

Look at them in the dark as those storms blew through. We had wins upwards of 84 miles per hour at the airport in New Orleans at two miles per hour at a different airport, a couple of wind gusts already over 75, 80 miles per hour over parts of Texas will need to survey the damage in Houston to figure out what those wins speeds were there. This is the storm system as it continues to progress east. It does have a weakening trend here this morning, though it does pack a lot of lightning just south there, Panama City and some heavy rain as well right now, no watches in effect. But we'll continue with the severe threat along the Gulf Coast as we go through the day today. Here's that level two out of five slight risks. There you can see in the yellow from New Orleans to mobile up towards Montgomery damaging winds, large hail, additional tornadoes, all still on the table, as these storms can continue to fire up and progress eastward, an additional line of storms as we go into Saturday morning as well for hard hit New Orleans areas, and then along the Florida panhandle. All of this coming with excessive heavy rain, we have that moderate level three out of four risk for heavy rain and a lot of this area is already so saturated, the ground simply cannot take any more, Kasie.",
