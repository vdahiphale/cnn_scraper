And get this, she gets to exactly 270 electoral votes.Now you mentioned of course, the seventh, there is that Sunbelt pathway that she's hoping for. So let's say she loses in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, she could win in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, which of course Trump won last time around the reason that the Harris campaign believes they can be competitive there is because she's doing better with Black and Hispanic voters. And if in fact she is it opens up this pathway, which to be perfectly honest, the Joe Biden campaign had given up on.",

We do know that he was the strongest Dem statewide in 2022. But for my money, for my money, Mr. Smerconish, I would choose this gentleman if you're trying to deliver a state because the fact is, Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes, Arizona only has 11. You put those 19 in your column, that shrinks the GOP's possibilities and Donald Trump's possibilities much more than if let's say the 11 go over to the Republican side. That's not as nearly as an impeachment as much as if Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania. It's going to be awfully difficult for Kamala Harris to win this election. Still possible, but difficult.",

Why are you interested in particular in the Midwest? WHIT AYRES, REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANT &amp; POLLSTER: It's great to be with you, Michael. We're interested in the Midwest because of what your data just showed that the upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania could be absolutely critical. It's interesting to see the Harris impact on this. She is doing much better than Joe Biden among non-white voters. There's a Wall Street Journal poll out this morning that showed her coming from 51 percent for Biden up to 63 percent for Harris. But does it cost the party among the white voters of the Upper Midwest where Joe Biden was still doing very well. That's one of the reasons those states were closer with Trump than the Sunbelt states. So what Harris may do is make the Sunbelt states closer, but make the upper Midwestern states more difficult for the Democrats.",
