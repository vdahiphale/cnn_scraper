As part of the deal, mothers are supposed to be released with their children, but there seems to be some mothers missing on the list today. Israel considers this a violation of the fragile deal.",

Israel is making its stance clear, if more hostages are not released, military operations will resume to take out Hamas.We are also learning from the hostages that have been released about what they have lived through for nearly seven weeks. The aunt of Roni Kriboy says her nephew was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival, taken to Gaza, and then at one point managed to escape captivity in Gaza, only to be recaptured by Hamas days later. He was finally released to Israeli officials just yesterday. Kaitlan Collins is standing by in Tel Aviv as we wait to when and if today's hostage exchange is going to happen.

We've seen that the policy from the U.S. government is that they would contact the family members of the hostages if and when they safely get out of Gaza. So, there is a privacy and a respect for the family's piece of this.But there's also just the issue of how much U.S. officials have been careful in talking about the American citizens and really just unwilling to predict whether any of these hostages might be able to get out. And until these women and children are safely out of Gaza, the White House has been very careful to not comment in any shape or form. I think that just goes to show you how fluid these negotiations are, how tenuous the circumstances are. And again, of course, to emphasize, the White House very much would like to see this truce, this pause in fighting to be extended because there are additional American hostages unaccounted for, people that are in Gaza that the White House would very much like to see get out.

And I mentioned Abigail there. She was reunited with her family yesterday. She was four years old -- turned four years old while she was being held by Hamas in Gaza. And since her return, and that of so many other hostages, we have seen incredibly emotional videos coming out of Israel's hospitals as these families are being reunited with their loved ones for the first time, not knowing that these reunions were ever going to happen. They were in captivity by Hamas in Gaza for weeks. Here in this video, you can see nine year olds Emily Hand. She's being hugged by her sister there. Of course, no one can forget the searing interview her father did with Clarissa Ward, initially believing that she had been killed in that October 7th attack, and then later finding out she'd actually been kidnapped and taken into Gaza. She has been reunited with her father, as so many other families have. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The malnutrition that we talked about a few moments ago, because of her age, it affected her tremendously. And she is getting all the help she needs and all the help she can get, but remains in critical condition at the hospital. Her son says he tried to send her medicines through the Red Cross but was unable to, criticizing the Red Cross for not being able to do what they're supposed to be able to do under international law, and that is visit hostages. Of course, that criticism directed at Hamas as well. We have also learned more about the story of Roni Kriboy, the Israeli- Russian citizen who was released basically by a favor that Hamas did for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who requested his release. According to his aunt who spoke with Israeli radio, the house he was in was bombed, he managed to escape and was on his own in Gaza for four days until she says he was recaptured by Gazans and turned back over to Hamas until he was just released.",

These are people who have been rounded up by the Israelis. They haven't been officially charged. They're being held in six-month renewable periods. And, basically, the way administrative detention works, they do not have access to the evidence against them because that's considered state secrets. Now, the remainder, the 13 are, or rather 16, have been convicted. Some of the convictions are things like stone throwing, throwing Molotov cocktails, assaulting police, and what's called nationalist incitement. It's worth noting, however, that an NGO that monitors the Israeli military justice system in the occupied West Bank has noted that 95 percent of the cases that go before these military courts end up in convictions.
