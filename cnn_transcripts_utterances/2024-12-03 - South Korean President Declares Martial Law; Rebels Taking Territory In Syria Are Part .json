Natasha Bertrand, live for us at the Pentagon.Let's talk a little bit more about this with retired General Wesley Clark, who's the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Sir, what are your concerns here? Because there's so many reasons to be worried when you consider that a stable Korea is certainly important to a very stable American presence or power in the Asia Pacific region. And then you also have tens and tens of thousands of service members, their families, contractors, etc. there. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Well, that's the -- the first thing, is the safety of the American soldiers there, the civilians, the contractors and their families. But the major installations are outside Seoul. There may be a few people in there, but we're south of Seoul. We shouldn't have a lot of people involved in it. And right now, it's four o'clock in the morning there. There shouldn't be any Americans on the street working with this. We've always been concerned about a certain North Korean influence underground in South Korea. We always knew that they could summon out tens of thousands of demonstrators in the street on certain issues. And we don't know how much of that is at play here. But our relationship with the South Korean military is built on many, many years of shared exercises, shared schooling, working together day and night. So we've got a very, very solid relationship with the South Korean military. We know them, they know us, and we work together very closely. We don't see that in jeopardy at this point. Real question is, what's happening here? Why did we -- why did South Korea feel there was a need to declare martial law? How is this going to be resolved? How is it going to be resolved peacefully? And then we got to get into the bigger questions about what it means for foreign policy.",

In result, I believe we still have General Wesley Clark with us.General that certainly is a reassuring notion that there haven't been any considerable changes to North Korean posture and that U.S. forces are considered safe at the moment. No posture changes there. I do want to ask you about the U.S. presence there moving forward, specifically in the incoming Trump administration, Donald Trump, who as recently as this summer talked about South Korea potentially being a money machine and asking the south to pay billions of dollars to maintain that U.S. presence there. Given the strain in relations among South Korean leaders, how do you see the U.S. influence playing out in the region, given that the Trump administration, at least the first Trump turn, saw that relationship as largely transactional?",

A third of the world's commerce, Shipborne, goes through the South China Sea. That's to Japan, that's to the Philippines. Of course, it's also to China and Korea. So our forces are there. We're part of geopolitical stability in the region.And we've pledged to maintain that because it's in America's interest to have that stability. We don't want the supply chains interrupted. We don't want conflict and putting a few thousand troops, leaving them in South Korea, another several thousand troops in Japan, principally air force in Japan and then training exercises and some bases we can go in and out of in the Philippines. It's -- it's cost effective because the interruptions in and conflict in that region would devastate the American economy and the American consumer. So keeping those troops there working for stability, it's a bargain. The Koreans know it, the Japanese know it, and, and they're paying part of the cost of those troops there.",

And we were pushing her on what she thought of these recent allegations, some of which you just detailed in the intro. And you know, she argued that these are things that she does want answers on. These are things that may come up in her conversation with Hegseth. She said that she would need to talk with him first before knowing exactly what she thought of some of this new reporting out there. But that really does contrast with other Republicans he's met with. He met with several Republicans last night. There were about a dozen Republicans meeting with him and his wife in the Capitol. And we were told in that discussion that these issues didn't come up at all. So that just gives you a sense, Brianna, of different ways that different lawmakers are looking at these accusations. I should note that there's just a narrow number of Republicans that it would take to tank this nomination. We are not talking about 10 Republicans here. We are talking about Republicans not being able to lose any more than three members. So that means that if there are questions from just a handful that could really derail this nomination. But Brianna, obviously watching very closely, some of those meetings happening this afternoon on the Hill.",

It started with those allegations of sexual assault back in 2017. Then it was the police report. Then it was the news that they had reached a settlement and there was a payoff involved, and now, this New Yorker article. So the question is how much that Trump and his allies put up with (inaudible) they turn their back on Hegseth. As we still know, again, there is a narrow margin.
