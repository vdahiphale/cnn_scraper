And here the dispute is over the Genocide Convention.South Africa is alleging that Israel has committing genocide and or failing to prevent a genocide, documenting that in an 84-page statement that has 30 pages of details of acts, details like the war on children. Now 9,600 children killed in three months, an average of 100 each day, what the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has described now, Gaza, as a graveyard for children. In response, Israel is saying that this is just the gruesome outcome of war. And I think, here, these implications are not only implications for Palestinians and for Israel, but really for the future of the world. If Israel can actually commit genocide and call it mere warfare or an exception, then the rest of the world is at severe harm and danger. So even if the International Court of Justice cannot impose an immediate ceasefire to prevent Israel from continuing a genocide through an enforcement mechanism, it still sends a very significant signal on the one for starters. It continues to isolate the United States and Israel politically on the global stage. And more significantly, it empowers other states that are ready to hold Israel to account to prosecute, accuse Israeli war criminals within their own national courts under universal jurisdiction, as well as to impose boycott, as well as to refrain from continuing to sell arms to Israel.",

We've seen him talking a lot, explaining his case, which is specifically against the Russian Justice Ministry and relates to the rules around how many religious texts, religious pieces of literature prisoners are allowed.He's used this platform to make sort of multiple different complaints. One he says that current rules are not being adhered to. He says he should be able to have two pieces of literature, including religious. He's only getting one. He's saying that the prison service discriminates against Muslims by cracking down harder on people who want the Quran. This is something that the representative of the Justice Ministry has described as political statements. And he's also used this as a platform to expose the conditions that he faces. He talks at one point about how he's only given 10 minutes a day to eat. And you know, you have to eat hot food and drink boiling water in 10 minutes. He says it turns something that would otherwise be a relatively pleasant experience into something hellish. At one point, he also describes how, you know, people in a punishment cell, which is quite a cold place, would choose a newspaper over, for example, the Quran if they were Muslim because they can use the newspaper to cover themselves and keep warm. And he directly addresses the judges saying, you know, you are clever, intelligent people on the Supreme Court. Surely you can see that these rules are absurd. And that is the point here, not to necessarily change the rules. Navalny has launched multiple cases and never has one gone in his favor, but to really try to use this to get this kind of coverage, to expose the ills and the abuses of the Russian justice system under Putin. Now, of course, his team, his supporters have all said that the current conditions he is in, the fact that he was transferred to Siberia in December is no coincidence. It comes, of course, just as President Putin announced his own bid for re-election, a foregone conclusion, very likely, but still, something that would, they say, increase the level of repression in Russia and the crackdown on Navalny himself.",

Our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London.U.S. President Joe Biden has met with the sister of Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia for more than five years. Whelan is serving a sentence for alleged espionage, which he denies, and Washington considers him wrongfully detained. The White House says Mr. Biden spoke with Elizabeth Whelan on Wednesday about the ongoing efforts to bring her brother home. Late last year, the U.S. said it made a new proposal to Russia asking for the release of both Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is also detained there, but Moscow rejected that plan. In Ecuador, prison officials say at least 139 guards and staff are being held hostage by gangs inside five prisons right now as drug gangs wage a war against the government. Ecuador's president says the country is fighting more than 20,000, quote, \"terrorists\" after a wave of violence, kidnappings and prison riots stunned the nation. President Daniel Noboa said on Wednesday he sympathizes with the families of those kidnapped and vowed not to give in to the terrorist groups. Military and police operations are underway nationwide to root out the gangs behind this week's attacks. The military says it has arrested nearly 330 people belonging to so-called terrorist organizations since Tuesday and recaptured dozens of escaped inmates. The head of the armed forces insists that peace will come, but can't say when. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAIME VELA, HEAD OF JOINT COMMAND OF ECUADORIAN ARMED FORCES (through translation):  I cannot offer that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or in the next 30 days. We will finish and deliver peace to the Ecuadorians. The moment I offer something, I become a slave of offering and I cannot do that. So, the only thing I can tell the Ecuadorians is to be patient.
