This is the consequence of what can happen when you spread falsehoods that injure people's reputations, that damage people emotionally and that have factors and facts that can actually harm people. And so I think by the verdict, the jury was saying that this is unacceptable in this climate, in any climate.

And there was a lot of concern that there would be a replay of what we saw on January 6, 2021, in terms of violence.That didn't happen because there have been so many arrests of people who invaded the Capitol, who attacked the Capitol, who rioted at the Capitol, and who were disruptive to an official proceeding. And a lot of people saw that as a deterrent from future behavior. So, this does raise the question of will this be something of a deterrent from people spreading disinformation, spreading lies about people? These were not public figures.

For the past three hours, hundreds and hundreds of people have been snaking their way through the streets of Tel Aviv, starting at the defense ministry, essentially Tel Aviv's Pentagon.And what we learned from the IDF earlier today was that three hostages, three young men who have been kidnapped on October 7th were killed in Northeastern Gaza, in the area called Shejaiya, where the IDF has been fighting against Hamas militants. Their names are Yotam Haim, Alon Shimriz and Samir Talalka. All of them, I believe, in their 20s. The IDF called this a sad and painful incident. What happened is these men were near a group of IDF soldiers who saw them, who thought that they were militants, who thought they might have been terrorists. They were fired upon. The soldiers then went over. They saw the bodies. They grew suspicious. They then confirmed in Israel that these were the bodies of hostages. Wolf, there's an investigation underway. There are all kinds of questions. Did the men have their hands up? Were they speaking in Hebrew? The IDF did speculate that perhaps they had been released or escaped from captivity, that maybe the militants had left them behind because they had been pushed out. But in either case, it is obviously a profound tragedy that they were on the cusp of getting rescued after more than two months in captivity, and instead they were shot and killed. Wolf?",

I spoke with a former general, Noam Tibon, who told me, whatever it takes to bring them home. I said, even if it's the worst Hamas prisoners in Israeli prisons, he said, whatever it takes, this country needs to bring these people home.

Again, without speaking to the specifics of this event, Hamas absolutely wants to hide behind innocent humans, including hostages.So, it's just a reminder. It underscores the very difficult challenge that the Israeli Defense Forces have before them as they go after these leaders of Hamas. It's not like they can separate the battlefield innocence to terrorists. It's all commingled because Hamas wants it to be commingled, because they want to make it more difficult for the Israelis to go after that leadership network.
