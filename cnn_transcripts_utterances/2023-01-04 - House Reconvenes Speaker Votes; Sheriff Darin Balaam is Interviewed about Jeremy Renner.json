And, you know, even though going into yesterday we all were told over and over again there was no plan b, I kind of, in the back of my mind, was wondering, well, maybe there is some plan for when, not if, for when Kevin McCarthy lost. And there really wasn't. His plan is just to stick it out. And that is what has been really fascinating in talking to so many members of Congress, particularly those who are in the only Kevin camp. And that is, they are as entrenched and as dug in as those are against him. Maybe even more so. And the determination is, yes, for McCarthy, but it seems to me, in talking to these members, it's more against the chaos caucus. It's more against those now 20 rebels to say, enough is enough.",

Right now it's 218. But if there are fewer people actually there voting, that means the threshold is lower. And it could mean that they could get McCarthy. Now, the only problem with that is that you have to have Democrats not voting because if you lower the threshold enough by Republicans, it means you have more Democrats voting, and Hakeem Jeffries is the speaker. I mean these are the kinds of things that nobody even thought would be considered or talked about in any other way, shape or form because any other potential speaker coming into a mess like this would have seen the writing on the wall and said, I'm out, and McCarthy won't.",
