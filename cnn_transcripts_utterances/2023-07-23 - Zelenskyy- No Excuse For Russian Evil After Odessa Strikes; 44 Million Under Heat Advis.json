I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin in Ukraine where Russian forces are once more launching punishing attacks on the port city of Odessa. Officials say at least one person was killed, 19 others wounded including four children. Ukraine's military says residential buildings were hit in the attacks, but officials there report, Russia's main targets were dozens of architectural monuments in the historic city center, including this iconic Orthodox Cathedral. It was originally built more than 200 years ago. Ukraine says several UN World Heritage sites were also damaged in the attacks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the strikes Russian evil. Also today Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko. Belarus says it is planning to conduct military exercises near the Polish border with troops from the Wagner military group. CNN senior national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt is with us now from Kyiv. Alex, what's the reaction not just to today's strikes, but the attacks that we've seen in recent days?",

At least 25 different monuments damaged according to a local military official after 19 missiles were fired at Odessa.Some of the most damage was seen at the Transfiguration Cathedral. It is one of the most famous churches here in Ukraine. It was destroyed back in 1936 during the Stalin era and then rebuilt once Ukraine gained independence. President Zelenskyy now calling for more air defenses for Odessa and other Ukrainian cities saying that Ukraine needs what he calls a full- fledged sky shield of red. Now, Fred, this comes as Ukraine is struggling to make progress on the battlefield during the counteroffensive, which is very much ongoing, modest gains. We got to spend time recently with the 47th Mechanized Brigade, right at the tip of the spear. We saw some the new equipment that they'd gotten including American Bradley fighting vehicle. And of course, we spoke to a number of soldiers all of whom told us how difficult this fight is. Take a look.

You mentioned that meeting today in Russia between the presidents of Russia and Belarus. We heard President Putin saying that this counteroffensive has been a failure. We have spoken with Ukrainian officials and heard from US officials who do acknowledge that it is behind schedule and not progressing as well as they would like. President Zelenskyy has said that this was supposed to be a spring counteroffensive. It was supposed to have started months ago, but it was delayed because Ukraine didn't have the weapons, the training, and the equipment that it needed to launch the offensive. And rather than rush it, he said it was better to wait. But in that time, Russia was able to build up its defenses, dig trenches and lay mines, which has made this fight so difficult -- Fredricka.",

We're obviously also a major agricultural producer, but it takes time to grow grain and to realize that you're going to have a market for a more substantial crop. So, I think this is something you know, again, the UN needs to keep a very close eye on and really give some serious thought about how Putin is prosecuting this war.

But there are many people that simply can't be inside or have to work outside and those people are also being reminded, look, go take a water break, stop, go in the shade and try to wear the appropriate clothes. Try to stop working if you start feeling dizzy, or if you start feeling some of the effects of the heatstroke, for example.And so it is important to point out that these heatwaves also have significant impacts, for example, hospitals. There are many that are reporting an increase in the number of people that they're seeing with heat related illnesses, and then, there is also the economic impact of these heatwaves. Recent studies have shown that just the impact of the heatwaves, the extreme heat could cause the US about $100 billion a year and that is only in productivity loss. So some of the most impacted industries are agriculture and construction, but really, there is no business or industry that is immune to this, especially in these areas where you're seeing 110-120 degrees. You have to keep in mind, there are people for example, that work in a food truck, and so being in a hot kitchen in an area where it's 120 degrees is impossible. Think about the pets and animals that are at the zoo. The people that actually work at the zoo and even people that work indoors, but have to deal with going to work.

The first is where mourners gathered after Till's death. The second is where his body is believed to have been pulled out of the river. The third is where an all-White jury acquitted, Till's murderers. So all of these sites carry significance and will mark his life, again with this proclamation that President Biden was signed on Tuesday.

They said: \"This designation reflects the Biden-Harris administration's work to advance civil rights and commitment to protecting places that help people or help tell a more complete story of the nation's history.

That's what got them to that point.So that's always going to be first and foremost, I think with me, something that I'm going to do my best and my coach would also do a good job of emphasizing. We need to keep this stuff the priority. But yes, I think it is a bit -- it is pretty cool to, like you say, to have people talking about you. And you know, in terms of someone who can maybe do another deep run in the tournament, maybe possibly win a tournament, you know. So all of that is cool, that's great, but as long as I continue my process, and I stay giving a hundred percent when I step foot on the court, whatever the result is, it is. You're not going to find me complaining about it too much as long as I can honestly look at myself in the mirror and say, I did all the stuff that I was supposed to do, today just didn't go my way and then we'll move on.",
