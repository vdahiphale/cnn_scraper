Judging people by the color of their skin, rather than the content of their character.Similarly, university speech codes and cancel culture have become ways that the left censors or restricts that most cherished of liberal ideas, freedom of speech. One simple way to think about the lessons of this election is that liberals cannot achieve liberal goals, however virtuous, by illiberal means. Go to CNN.com/Fareed for a link to my \"Washington Post\" column this week, and let's get started. In 2016, when Trump won the first time, much was made of the fact that Hillary Clinton actually won the popular vote by two percentage points. The electoral college may have chosen Trump, but the majority of Americans didn't. In 2020, he lost the popular vote to Joe Biden by more than four appoints and he lost the election. But this year, he is projected to have narrowly won the popular vote. If projections hold, it will be the first time a Republican has won the popular vote in 20 years. I'm joined now by two very smart people, \"The New York Times\" opinion columnist, Ezra Klein, the author of the book \"Why We're Polarized,\" and David Frum, a staff writer at \"The Atlantic\" and a former speechwriter for George W. Bush. Ezra, so, you know, first, fundamentally, how much of this was incumbency penalty that seems to have affected every election in the last 18 months, and how much of this is something special that we should analyze?",

Was it a time lag? Was it that inflation matters a lot more than we thought it would? DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC: If Donald Trump had presided over this economy, as he soon will, he would have said again and again, this is the greatest economy since the 1960s, things are great, unemployment. The Democrats are inhibited that if there is someone in America who is sad, it is impossible for a Democratic president or a Democratic administration to speak positively about what they've done. It is a -- I'm not a Democrat. I marvel at this. Because they are so -- there are so many veto points in the party. And this creates a very dangerous situation now. What do Democrats love on this earth more than soul-searching? I don't know. They love it. Maybe mutual accusation, a mutual recrimination. That's the one thing they like more than blaming each other. They hate each other, it's a very messy coalition, and they're now about to turn each other. Should we have gone left on populism? Should we blame this part of our coalition or that part of our coalition? And meanwhile, the emergency is going to start immediately. Donald Trump is going to come to all this and immediately pardon the January 6th criminals. He is immediately going to abandon America's commitment to Ukraine. He is already signaling to the Chinese, Taiwan is yours if you want it. And, of course, the floodgates of corruption are going to be massively opened. How will he pay the half-billion dollars he owes in civil judgments? Will he sell Truth Social to somebody? The Saudis, Elon Musk at some giant markup?

Those have always been protected by agreement among the leadership of both parties. There are things you don't do, like try to overthrow the government if you lose an election.

Democrats have this midterm election in 2022. They win unexpectedly. The red wave never crashes ashore. In retrospect, it would be much better for them if they had gotten annihilated in 2022, as they'd expected. But because they didn't, the unusual thing that happens with Democrats is instead of having a pivot after the midterm defeat, as you did in 1994 and 2010, to think about the voters you were losing, they instead pivot to think more seriously about the voters they are winning. Why are they overperforming in midterms? Why are they overperforming in special elections?

He's the founder and chief economist at American Compass, a conservative think tank. Oren, welcome. I'm so glad to have you because you really have been in some ways laying the intellectual foundations for kind of Trumpism. So let me start by asking you, is the Republican Party now firmly a kind of working class party? Because it does seem to get the majority of working class votes. And yet, you know, the big thing that Republicans do whenever they come into office are these massive tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich. If you look at the transition team that Trump has appointed, it's two billionaires, one from Wall Street, they're talking about extending the Trump tax cut, which is $2.5 trillion over 10 years.

I think the best way to understand it is it's the majority of Americans who still don't have a college degree and experience, especially the economy and also the culture through that perspective.They have turned away from the Democrats. They find President Trump's message much more appealing. But then, as you've said, if you look at the institutional Republican Party, the think tanks, certainly a lot of elected officials, certainly Donald Trump himself to some extent, there are still significant parts of it that are the legacy of what I would call the old right. So I think you're seeing a transformation in progress. And maybe, you know, the best marker to think about is the distance from Mike Pence to J.D. Vance, right? That's a very good concrete marker of -- the transition isn't complete, but it has clearly come a long way.",

But what was their main focus? It was for giving student debt while doing nothing to actually reform higher education. They talk about industrial policy, but the vast majority of their industrial policy investment was on fighting climate change. And so I think -- and then certainly, if you look at the Harris campaign, it obviously struggled mightily. I mean, I think it's especially interesting to look at its attempts to reach young men, you know, their outreach to -- their opportunity agenda for young black men.

I think at this point, the Republican Party is united on tariffs and against free trade. But it feels to me like the two big issues are going to be the tax cut and the deportations. So let's first talk about the tax cut. That's two and a half trillion dollars added to the debt.If you take Social Security, which he now says that he's going to exempt from taxes, that's another $2.5 trillion.

And so I think there's going to be a lot more negotiation.There's going to be a lot more, okay, what's in, what's out? And actually, that's where tariffs become potentially a big part of the discussion because one of the things that tariffs do is they do raise a lot of revenue.

A big part of the picture here is just actually telling employers, if you are employing people who are here illegally, we're going to crack down on you.And so I think that'll absolutely have an effect on the labor market, but I think it'll generally speaking be a very positive one. Tight labor markets are labor markets that are good for workers. And, you know, what we saw in the first Trump term, for that matter, is when you do have a very tight labor market, the result is not inflation necessarily, it's rising wages and ideally investments in productivity.

Europe needs to come together to support Ukraine if Donald Trump ensures that the United States doesn't. Europe is way behind on the cutting edge technologies of the world, AI and so forth. Europe is in a real mess and it's been sleepwalking in this mess.But if you look at what's happening in European politics, the day that Donald Trump was elected, there was a crisis in the German government which is now going to have elections. French President Macron is completely impotent. He made a big mistake last year calling an election. Probably, the strongest leader in the EU right now is Giorgia Meloni. And I think Europe, Europe has always come together in a crisis. We saw that again and again through the euro crisis. Maybe this time, it will. But as of now, unfortunately, I just don't see it. And I really worry that Europeans will sense that they have to do something and they just won't do it fast enough. Because with Ukraine and with Putin there, there is real pressure, time pressure to do something fast.",

But I think there is also there too. So broadly, yes, they are welcoming it, but they feel a little scarred by the transactionalism and unpredictability too. And so I think the Saudis will be looking to get a defense deal signed as soon as possible. This could mean that there's going to be movement, I think, in the Middle East. I think it's -- it could be a contrary to what many people think. I actually think Donald Trump could push Bibi towards doing something that will allow the Saudis enough to have a Saudi defense deal.",
