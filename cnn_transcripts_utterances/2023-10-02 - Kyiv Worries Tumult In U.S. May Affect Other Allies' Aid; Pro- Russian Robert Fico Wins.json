And certainly they do rely very heavily on U.S. security assistance. And we've seen it on the battlefield here in the east of the country and in the south as well, pretty much in all facets. It starts with rifles, it starts with bullets, but then you also have larger cannons, ammunition, and all the way to surface to air missile systems. So the U.S. is by far the largest provider of arms to the Ukrainians that they then use on the battlefield so that's very important to them.But there's a second facet to this as well and that is the possible chilling effect that any sort of cut in U.S. security assistance could have on the U.S.'s partners who are also giving weapons to Ukraine. There's two big examples. For instance, the Germans gave multiple rocket launching systems to the Ukrainians but only did so after the U.S. also gave MLRS to the Ukrainians and also main battle tanks. The Germans allowing other countries to give Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine doing the same as well, but again only after a deal was reached with the Biden administration for the Biden administration to provide Abrams main battle tanks to the Ukrainians. So certainly it could be a huge deal if the U.S. decides to curtail their security assistance for Ukraine or stop it altogether. Again, the Ukrainians very much aware of that. It was quite interesting because a spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry came out today trying to put a good face on things, saying that, look, in the end he hopes that they will be able to work with the Biden administration to make sure that any future budget will beneficial for Ukraine.

He's in terrible shape economically.He's only surviving by cannibalizing the 60 percent of the economy that he now controls. He's basically burning the living room furniture to keep the blaze going. But the other thing he has is he's counting on attrition. He's hoping that by January 20, you know, 50 -- 20, you know, 25 that Trump is back in there and that we'll see a weakening of the resolve of the allies, but that's all he has is propaganda and a war of attrition. The allies have to hold together and not believe this insidious campaign that he's running to try to weaken it. But it's very effective.

      "sentences": "Well, a man who blames Ukrainian Nazis and fascists for provoking Russia into war has won Slovakia's election. On the campaign trail, Robert Fico had pledged to cut off military aid to Ukraine if he won. Slovakia has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since the outset of the war, sending helicopters, artillery, and air defense systems. But Fico's basic argument is that sending weapons and ammunition only prolongs a war in which Russia will never accept defeat, and that is an appealing message in a country that is struggling with inflation and the cost of hosting more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.Fico's party won by a more comfortable margin than some polls had predicted, but he will still need a governing partner in order to govern the country. And he had not ruled out pairing up with a far right party that broadly shares his view on Russia and Ukraine. But that party didn't quite make the 5 percent threshold needed in order to take seats in parliament. So it is more likely that he will now aim to work with the Halas party, which has been more vague about Ukraine, on the one hand, arguing that Slovakia has given all it can afford to give. On the other hand, it says that Slovakia should continue to manufacture ammunition for Ukraine, which is ultimately good for the economy. So Fico's policy toward Ukraine and Russia is likely to be moderated out of political necessity, and he has been prime minister twice before, so he has a track record of being pragmatic in order to govern. Voter turnout, by the way, the highest that it's been in 20 years, but it will likely take weeks before Slovaks ultimately find out who will be part of that coalition government.

It hasn't worked so far, but in the third term, it's possible that they would try to lessen those tensions. On Ukraine, everybody in the Polish political spectrum is strongly pro-Ukrainian, very much in favor of sending weapons and acting as a major shipment point for weapons to Ukraine.

Milei is leading in the polls since taking the local political scene by surprise this year. But Argentina has been largely dominated by the two main political groups for the best part of the last 20 years. But Milei is notorious for his rallies, where he sometimes brandishes a chainsaw in the streets of Buenos Aires and other Argentinian cities. This chainsaw represents, according to Milei, his intention the cut to public finances that he intends to apply when in government and also to symbolize his intention to break up with the status quo.
