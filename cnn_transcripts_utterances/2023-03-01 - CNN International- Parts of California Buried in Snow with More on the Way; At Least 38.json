The first two carriages catching a light and you can see the devastation, mangled metal. You've got cranes and you have metal cutting machinery to try and cut through those two first carriages. And that's the fear that more people are trapped and the death toll rising now to 38.When I was last on air, it was 36. You've got 66 people that are injured, seven of whom are currently in intensive care. You're seeing lines of people waiting in Larissa waiting to donate blood. So, the big question is, what happened here, how did they collide. The national broadcaster reporting that at some point the passenger train changed lanes and was traveling for quite some time on the same line as the cargo train. And then of course that resulted in a collision. The question is, is it technical fault? Is it a human error? You know, who's going to be taking responsibility for this. Investigations are currently under way. We know that the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is on the way to the crash area. But in the meantime, what we're hearing from the hospital is that parents, family, loved ones and people traveling on the train have gathered to try and identify the dead. The issue is that it's difficult from what we hear from authorities to identify some of the people because the injuries were absolutely so severe. We've also heard reports from some passengers that they were being thrown around in the carriages also as the fire broke out, some people were burned. So, we're talking about a very traumatic severe experience. And as we, you know, go through search and rescue, it's almost 12 hours since the accident occurred. You are seeing major response from international communities, specifically Europeans, the European Commission are coming out and extending condolences, so too the EU. Council president as well, various countries in Europe, but in the meantime, Greeks are waiting to see how this happened, Max, and importantly why.",

It says, quote, a Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly but began a takeoff roll instead. The pilot of the JetBlue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet cross the intersection.

I want to pull up a map -- again, I said it's not strategically important but I want to show you where it is, it's just this 36 miles of territory that lies between Donetsk and Luhansk -- the separatist regions, of course, Russian backed regions. So, for President Zelenskyy, he feels it is important to win this territory symbolically of course, because he's promised to win everything back but also he feels that if Russian forces are able to enter Bakhmut, that gives them an opportunity to expand in those Russian controlled areas. Now Western officials have been saying a very different thing. We understand from sources, Western sources including in D.C. that U.S. officials, U.S. partners, the Western allies that are providing the weapons to President Zelenskyy say that maybe he should back down from Bakhmut again because it is not strategically important.
