A bipartisan group of lawmakers has reintroduced legislation, which is designed to expand the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.It's a federal law that was passed in 1990 to help those exposed to radiation while working in uranium mines or were affected by nuclear testing. But that act, notably, does not cover people living in the vicinity of that 1945 Trinity atomic explosion in New Mexico. In fact, the state wasn't included in the original law. Joining us now is one of the lawmakers behind this push, Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico. It's good to have you with us this morning. I think a lot of people would be surprised that New Mexico wasn't initially included. As you've been working along with your colleagues from New Mexico -- again, this is a bipartisan effort to expand the scope of this act. I was struck by what Tina Cordova said. She has been fighting for this. She is the co-founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders. She called this an over-glorification of the science and the scientists in terms of the film -- said that to Axios. Here is what she told our affiliate. Sorry, we may not have that sound. What she said is how disappointed she was that this film had not addressed the broader issue and the fallout of this testing. She said she hadn't heard anything from the film company. We reached out. I'm curious. Have you had any discussions with Universal? REP. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ (D-NM):  We have reached out to Universal because as we tell this story about the brilliance of Oppenheimer -- the destruction that was caused by this atomic bomb -- we need to remember the people who were affected right under the area of the bomb -- under that radiation cloud that continued for miles. There were probably 500,000 people who had direct effects from the testing of the very first atomic bomb.",
