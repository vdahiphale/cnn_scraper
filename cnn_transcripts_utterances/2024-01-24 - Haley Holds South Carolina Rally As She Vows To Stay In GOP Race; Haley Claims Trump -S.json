And later, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, an exclusively reporting that the House Ethics Committee has reached out to the woman he allegedly had sex with when she was a minor.   Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with Nikki Haley speaking for the first time since losing New Hampshire with the case she is now making for staying in the race, at least through her home state primary in South Carolina a month from now. We'll have that for you shortly. Governor Haley is speaking tonight in the wake of her second-place finish in New Hampshire, or a crushing defeat, as the former president put it last night in social media, where he's also referring to his former UN ambassador as Nikki Birdbrain Haley, which is certainly of a piece with his victory speech last night complete with a fashion critique.

He underperformed his margins of 2016, and he showed that he is radioactive in a general election. He is bleeding moderates and he is bleeding independence. So to Jamal's point, we live in an unpredictable environment. I think this time, four years ago, COVID was just coming to the country. We don't know what the next year is going to look like.

As for who he thinks he's going to face in November, he left no room for doubt in the statement he made last night as the results in New Hampshire came in right up front in the very first line. He says it is now clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee.If, in fact, that comes to pass, the question is what will a Biden- Trump race look like? There's some new information gleaned from the Iowa and New Hampshire results that may show how it could look different from their last match-upstream. So John King is at the magic wall where he's been for the last 28 hours or so. We're only two states into the nominating process, although Trump and Biden are looking towards the general. Obviously, where do things stand today?   JOHN KING, CNN HOST: Right, and things stand, obviously, Governor Haley is still in the race. We should respect that. We'll see where it goes. But even if she were the nominee, this is where we ended the last campaign -- 306 to 302. Joe Biden wins. Since the census, they reallocate some electoral votes. If they had that same outcome today, state by state, it would be 303 to 235. But this is the state of play where we start, what could be the longest, forgive me -- let me remove that one off -- the longest general election in our history, too long for most Americans. Forgive me while I stretch this out. If you look at the polling, Governor Haley is right when she says she's a stronger candidate against Joe Biden right now. She's absolutely right. But Donald Trump and Joe Biden run about tie. No clear leader, slight Trump advantage there, but that's a no clear leader poll. The problem is Republican voters aren't listening to her because they think he can still win. And, Anderson, here's where we are. If you look at the polling in the states, you talk to smart people in these states, this was the map two years ago. There -- most people would tell you Democrats might argue publicly, not privately, that -- and that are almost definite across the Sun Belt states, Trump would win. And yes, that auto workers endorsement might help. But I was in Michigan just a couple of weeks ago. Young voters are mad at the president. Arab-American voters, a lot of them in Michigan, they are furious. So for now, do that. If it were tomorrow and it's not, Trump would win. I don't think there's any question about that.",

Nikki Haley got six in 10 of the votes. Donald Trump 39% of the votes. Now, again, it's New Hampshire. People will say, well, it's a particularly, you know, peculiar election just to that state still. Fifty-eight percent of independents going to Nikki Haley. That's good news for Joe Biden in November. A lot of independents in these states that are close to 50-50 don't want Donald Trump without a doubt. Here's another one we saw. And again, factor in, yes, it's New Hampshire, but follow me as we go through here. Is he fit to be president if he's convicted of a crime? This is among people voting in a Republican primary last night. Forty-two percent said no. Now, again, this roughly matches the Trump-Haley horse race. So it's easy to say these were Haley voters. They're in the fight last night, so they said no. It's probably right to a degree. Let's assume that number even comes down, though. If it's 5% or 10% of Republicans in a state like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, that's a liability for the president of the United States.

Ukraine denies that claim and it has also stopped short of acknowledging that it fired on the plane. Matthew Chance has more.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the moment the Russian military transporter plunged from the skies. An eyewitness gasps as a huge orange fireball bellows from the ground. Russian says the aircraft was shot down. And while Ukraine hasn't confirmed it, this Russian border region is an active war zone. I was clearing the snow when suddenly there was a loud bang says this Russian eyewitness on local TV. There was an explosion in the sky, he says, and I got scared. Across the frozen crash site near the Russian city of Belgorod, twisted metal debris strewn across a wide area (inaudible) with human remains. Ukraine says the plane had a cargo of missiles heading to the frontlines. But Russia insists the aircraft was carrying 65 captive Ukrainian soldiers on route to a prisoner exchange. CNN can't independently verify either claim. I feel pity for everyone says this Russian woman who saw the plane go down. My own grandson is fighting in our special military operation, she says. And all of those on board probably had people waiting for them too. In recent weeks, Ukraine has been stepping up attacks across the Russian frontier. Hitting an oil terminal near St. Petersburg with a drone strike last week. And earlier, taking out a strategic Russian long-range radar detection aircraft flying near the border. In the Russian controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, local officials say at least 25 people were killed last weekend in a Ukrainian bombardment. Meanwhile, on Russian state television, commentators have condemned the latest shoot down, saying it was Ukrainians killing their own. This was yet another premeditated criminal act which does not surprise us, says this former Russian general. It's now routine behavior, he says, by the Kyiv regime. But Kyiv says if Ukrainian prisoners of war were on board, ahead of an exchange as Moscow claims, they were not informed, and that Russia may have deliberately put their lives in danger.

Three years ago, her 23-year-old son Chinyelu, who was working as a security guard, was shot to death. And in 2007, her two-year-old son Jakobi Ra was killed in a hit and run.What is remarkable about Mama Shu, one of the many things, is that she has turned her loss into love and as she says, her grief into glory. She has dedicated her life to transforming a rundown street in Highland Park, Michigan into a vibrant community called Avalon Village. She was one of CNN's top-ten heroes of 2023. And I spoke with her on the podcast about how even though her sons are gone, she still has a relationship with them. She still is their mom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
