Although there are fewer attacks today, due to the deterioration of the weather. The number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high. The second topic is energy: restoration of networks and technical supply capabilities. Demining of power transmission lines, repairs, everything goes on around the clock.

CNN has geolocated the videos to the outskirts of Makiivka, a recently-liberated villages [SIC] -- village in the East Luhansk region. The edited video purports to show a group of Russian soldiers lying face down on the ground with their hands over their heads. More soldiers are seen emerging from a building and lying down next to the other troops in the yard. A man can be heard shouting, \"Come on out, one by one. Which of you is an officer? Everyone come out.\" A short burst of gunfire is then heard before the video cuts off. A second clip, shot from a drone, appears to show the same men dead on the ground, surrounded by pools of blood.

Developing countries have been fighting for 30 years to have a fund, to have recognition of the losses and damages associated with climate change. But if you look at the report card of these climate meetings in Egypt, it's decidedly mixed. Of course, there is that loss and damage fund.
