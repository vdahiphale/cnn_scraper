CNN's Delia Gallagher has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In many respects, Benedict XVI was the Pope who got a bad rap. Nearly 24 years as Pope John Paul II's doctrinal enforcer and a German childhood lived in the shadows of Hitler's Nazi regime, he was often unflatteringly referred to as God's Rottweiler, or the Panther Cardinal. Years of negative publicity caused many of his accomplishments to go unnoticed. He was the first Pope to go green, making the Vatican the first country in the world with a zero-carbon footprint, putting solar panels on its rooftops and bringing in electric vehicles, including a hybrid Pope mobile. He was cardinal and Pope during the years when the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals came to light and he spearheaded the Vatican's efforts toward a zero-tolerance policy. It was too little, too late for some, but it was Cardinal Ratzinger who organized the Vatican's response to the scandal, including creation of a special office at the Vatican to handle cases extending and, in some cases, eliminating the statute of limitations for victims, and as Pope publicly apologizing.",

The bells of St. Peter's ring, and it summons the people here.People weren't -- this is not an -- it's not an unexpected death, but nonetheless, it is sad for a lot of people. A lot of the conservative, traditional people in the Catholic Church never really stopped believing that Pope Benedict was their pope. You know, he had a very cordial relationship with Pope Francis. Pope Francis would visit him often inside the monastery, but they were two very different figures, and they represented two varying aspects of the Catholic Church. And so you've got sadness here, but it's not unexpected. We've known for the last three days, I guess, when Pope Francis called for prayers for Pope Benedict earlier in the week, saying that he was not very well if people were prepared for this. He was a 95-year-old man, and he retired 10 years ago because of his failing health. And as Delia said in her tribute to him, you know, he was influential all the way to the end. He gave interviews, he did writing.

I mean, Benedict XVI, in his own biography, in some ways, summed up the great themes of the Catholic Church for virtually the entire 20th century. And we're talking about a pope who grew up in the shadow of Hitler and Nazi Germany, who came of age during the period of the Cold War, who was a central figure at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, kind of the defining 20th century event in Catholic life.Who then, for a quarter century, was the intellectual architect of the papacy of John Paul II, and then himself presided over eight deeply turbulent years as Pope marked by the clerical sexual abuse scandals, financial scandals. And then, for a decade in retirement, served unintentionally as a sort of counterpoint to the progressive papacy of Pope Francis in the eyes of Francis' conservative and traditionalist critics, So, you know, no matter where you stand on the spectrum of opinion about Pope Benedict XVI, the truth of it is, the Catholic Church, the whole world today, has lost a titan.

And then I had the opportunity of being in his presence several times when he was pope.I will tell you this, he would be my nominee for the 20th century public figure who had the greatest gap between his public reputation and his private personality. You know, in public, Benedict XVI was seen as this aloof, authoritarian, kind of draconian figure, sort of Darth Vader and a Cassock, you know? But in private, I am telling you, you would never meet a nicer guy. I mean, he was the kindest, sweetest, humblest, gentlest figure I've ever met in my entire life.

I was very -- of course, of the pecking order and the pyramid of the hierarchy. She was a friend, but she was so much way ahead of me that all I could do was really admire her, take all her -- you know, mentoring and do with it what I absolutely could. She was incredible, she was inspirational for me even before I actually became a journalist, before I ever started CNN, you know, more than 40 years ago, I had seen her incredible reports because they traveled overseas not just in the United States. We saw her in the U.K., we saw her all over the world when I was growing up. And so, she was the very first iteration of what one could be. There was this woman on television, highly successful, groundbreaking, pioneering, and I thought, well, wow, you know, that's something to aspire to. And I would say, not just in terms of her personality, but in terms of the incredible hard work that she put in to get where she was in terms of the incredible range that she was able to pull off throughout her career, whether it was politics or you know, art or the human condition or entertainment. She got everybody. And in the end, it became a badge of honor for the interviewees to be interviewed by her.

Federal and local prosecutors now investigating the incoming congressman who's set to be sworn in next week.(on camera): So, some of the responses we received somewhat varied, even that Jewish community leader that we spoke to in the synagogue, even though he told us he wouldn't vote for Santos again if given the opportunity, he didn't call for him to outright resign. What we know, though, what seems pretty consistent in communities like Manhasset, in Great Neck, in Oyster Bay is, there seems to be widespread disappointment. This is a very wealthy district, but maybe one that doesn't receive a whole lot of national attention, and it is because of the many lies of this congressman-elect that are bringing the communities, these communities into the spotlight. I should note the third district also includes parts of Queens as well. Eva McKend, CNN, Manhattan, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
