I've seen passengers here with tears in their eyes. They are dealing with a lot on the phone trying to figure out what they're going to do.And this is what we're seeing. Just these massive lines. Folks like inching forward because even if their flights have resumed, we know that all major carriers were grounded this morning. The problem is with checking them in. They are being manually checked in. We see right here, airport staff actually calling them out by their flight number, by the city, and that is how they're being checked in, prioritized based on when they're leaving.
