Steve, good morning to you. What a twist. I mean Disney quietly stripping the new board of its authority before the state takeover last month. How'd o it?",

Even if it's putting a clause in there that says that this new board can't use any of Disney's characters, like Mickey Mouse, in any of its promotional materials. So, the new board came in, and they discovered all these existing agreements were already in place, and now they are scrambling to figure out what exact power they have over this giant entertainment complex.",

They put out their own statement too last night telling me, quote, all agreements signed between Disney and the district where appropriate and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's government in the Sunshine law.

But this trend, you guys, has been stubbornly low. And I say that, how can it be stubbornly low, you know, jobless claims. These are layoffs essentially. They have been very, very low in this economy, and that is something that has translated into some concern among Federal Reserve officials and economists, frankly, because this kind of a tight, tight labor market can be contributing to inflation. And so it's one of those stories where you keep hearing consternation that the Fed or economists would be rooting for some more layoffs or rooting for job loss because that would be one of the ways you could cure inflation. So, it's one of one of the sort of undercurrents of the conversation right now that when jobs numbers are -- are so strong like this, that can be a problem on the inflation front.",
