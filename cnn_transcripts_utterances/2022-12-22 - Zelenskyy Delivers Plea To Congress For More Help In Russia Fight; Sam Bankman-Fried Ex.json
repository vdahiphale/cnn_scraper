The red carpet was rolled out for Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as he arrived at the White House yesterday after leaving his country for the first time since Russia invaded. Zelenskyy and Biden warmly greeted one another later in the Oval Office. The Ukrainian leader in his olive green military shirt and boots as Biden was in his signature blue suit.The hero's welcome that Zelenskyy got stood in stark contrast to his relationship with the last U.S. president. Donald Trump, as you know, was impeached in 2020 for withholding military aid, in a White House meeting, from Zelenskyy, in an attempt to pressure Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden. It all started in April 2019. That was the day Zelenskyy was elected president of Ukraine. Trump called Zelenskyy to congratulate him on his win. And with Ukraine's ongoing conflict with Russia, Zelenskyy very much wanted the United States' support. In that first call, Zelenskyy invited Trump to his inauguration. Trump, instead, sent a delegation. It was supposed to be led by Vice President Mike Pence until, according to Rudy Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas, Trump told Pence to cancel the trip when Zelenskyy refused to announce that investigation he wanted into the Bidens. A few months later, on July 25, that's when Zelenskyy and Trump had their second call -- the infamous one -- when Zelenskyy was hoping for a White House invitation. He got one -- kind of -- but only after Trump urged Ukraine's new leader to work with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and the U.S. attorney general to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Trump raised unsubstantiated allegations that Biden sought to interfere with the Ukrainian prosecutors' investigation of his son, Hunter. And according to the transcripts, Trump said, quote, \"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son -- that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that. So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\" Behind the scenes, Trump and his allies continued to pressure Zelenskyy to announce an investigation and Trump ordered a hold on military aid to Ukraine. On September 25, 2019, that's when Speaker Pelosi made a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions, which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed a dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.

Because Churchill had also come to the White House and come to the joint session of Congress at Christmastime, it brought out -- And I'm so glad to hear in so many television discussions the reminder that in World War II, we faced a similar situation where England had come needing America's help. They had needed it even before Pearl Harbor and America had given them the tools that they said would finish the job, much as Zelenskyy has talked about us. Then Pearl Harbor happened. Churchill came, and an extraordinary address to the joint session of Congress, similarly standing ovation -- great. And it cemented the fact because Churchill was worried at that time -- Pearl Harbor had happened -- maybe America would focus on Japan. He needed them to focus on Hitler. And that really solidified that alliance between the two. They talked to each other the way you would imagine Zelenskyy and Biden, who had that chemistry when you saw it in the joint session of Congress. I mean, Roosevelt says it's fun to be in the same decade with you, and Churchill says it's a great hour to live. That's an extraordinary sense of a bonding.
