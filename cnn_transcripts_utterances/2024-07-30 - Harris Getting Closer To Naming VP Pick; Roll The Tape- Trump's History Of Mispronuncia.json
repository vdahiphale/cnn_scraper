Vice President Kamala Harris is set to hold a campaign rally in the key battleground state of Georgia later today.These are images moments ago from her departure at Joint Base Andrews as she heads to the Peach State, a state that President Joe Biden flipped in 2020. The first time in three decades the Democrats have won there and where Harris campaign officials say they're seeing renewed enthusiasm. Enthusiasm they'll need to once again capture Georgia. The campaign is also targeting a key voting bloc. Disaffected Georgia Republicans. Citing former President Trump's attacks on top Republicans in the state and Nikki Haley's strong showing during Republican primaries, even after she had dropped out of the race. The campaign stop in Atlanta comes as we're learning that Vice President Harris is going to travel to a series of battleground states next week with her newly chosen running mate. CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten, joins us now. Because, Harry, we've been talking about this all week, and that is the impact that a potential V.P. contender can have on the ticket. So walk us through the track record here, the V.P. math.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Let's walk through the V.P. math. Who will Vice President Harris choose to be what she hopes to be her vice president?So let's take a look because, you know, the fact is I believe past is prologue when it comes to V.P. selections. That is, how did they perform amongst the voters who know them best in their home states? So there's a pretty good way to understand that. How much did these gentlemen outperform Biden's 2020 margin in their own election in 2022? And I want you to look. There is a clear runaway winner on this metric. It's Josh Shapiro from the state of Pennsylvania. He won by 15 points in a state. Joe Biden won just by one. He outperformed by 14 points. Look, Mark Kelly, in Arizona, not too bad. In fact, he was the best running Democrat statewide in Arizona in 2022. But he only outran Biden by five points. And then Tim Walz has been getting a lot of press, at least on social media lately. The idea perhaps you want to choose someone from the Midwest. But he, in fact, didn't really outperform the baseline very much in 2022, just by 0.6 percentage points. Again, compare that to Josh Shapiro, who outran Biden by 14 points. And I'll also note, in 2020, when he ran for attorney general, he was the top vote getter for the Democrats in that year as well. So Josh Shapiro, the clear runaway favorite, at least on this metric.",

You might be sensing a theme going on here.But also Pennsylvania is likely, or at least the most likely state to determine who wins this election. So the chance that one of these states put someone over the top -- look at this. Pennsylvania a 30 percent chance, a 30 percent chance that Pennsylvania is the state that ultimately puts a candidate over the top. You compare that to Arizona. It's just 4 percent, right? Minnesota is less than 3 percent. Why is this the math? Well, Boris, it's the math because Pennsylvania has 19 electoral votes. Arizona has just 11 electoral votes. She would much rather add that 19 electoral votes to your column, Mr. Sanchez. And you combine that with the fact that Josh Shapiro has done so well in Pennsylvania and currently has -- get this -- a 61 percent approval rating in the state of Pennsylvania. It's pretty clear to me where the math does point for Vice President Harris. It's Josh Shapiro.",

I want to go to CNN's Matthew Chance, who has been tracking the story from London. Matthew, what else are you hearing? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, I mean, obviously, these are the images that we're seeing now from that suburb in southern Beirut, which is a -- an area which is strongly associated with Hezbollah. That group in southern Lebanon that has been so aggressive in its attacks over the course of the past several months, really, stepping up its missile strikes on northern Israel. But particularly, the attack of last weekend in which 12 people in northern Israel, or rather in the occupied Golan Heights, in that northern an area, we're killed on a soccer pitch. There we're -- there we're children. There they were teenagers. And the aftermath, you can see there, is the damage that was done by the missile strikes. The attacks carried out, which the Israeli say they carried out against the Hezbollah leader that is responsible for those killings and for other attacks against Israelis. You can see the devastation there that's been brought by these missiles that were fired. It's not clear how there we're delivered. Lebanese media are saying it was a drone attack that fired three missiles. That hasn't been confirmed by -- by the Israelis yet. But, you know, we could see that the casualty figures start to come in shortly. I haven't seen them yet. The figure who was targeted, there are reports in the Lebanese media and the Iranian media as well that that figure survived, that he -- that he is not dead. But that's not yet been confirmed either. What we're waiting for, of course, is whether there will be a significant Hezbollah response to this, which could spiral the region into more danger and into more conflict.",

He said he went to the scene of the attack, which is something the director previously, who -- who stepped down, she didn't do before her own hearing.
