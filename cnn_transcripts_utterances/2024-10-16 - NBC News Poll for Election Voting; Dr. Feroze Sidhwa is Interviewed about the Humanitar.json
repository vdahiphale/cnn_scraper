It's Me Too.As it relates to the issue of sexual abuse of children, et cetera, taken a lot more seriously. And so to your question, you look at this and you say, you know, if the core reason or the criminal justice system, when someone is found guilty, is punishment, rehabilitation, and deterrence, could they be rehabilitated, have they been rehabilitated, and what will the DA now do? Will the DA now say, hey, let's go before a judge. Will the judge set them free if the DA decides to do that, saying they've been rehabilitated enough. Will the judge say, we'll impose a sentence, whether you only serve a little bit more time or will there be a new trial? I doubt there'd be a new trial at all here.

This comes as the U.S. is putting pressure on its ally, demanding Israel improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza if they want military aid. With me now is Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, the trauma surgeon who worked in Gaza from March 25th to April 8th of this year. You penned an article in the \"New York Times\" titled, \"65 Doctors and Nurses: What We Saw in Gaza.\" You worked with the \"New York Times,\" gathered the folks that had been there, the doctors that had been there, and nurses that had been there. First to you, what did you witness in those couple of weeks that you were, I think, in Khan Younis in hospital? DR. FEROZE SIDHWA, WORKED TWO WEEKS AT KHAN YOUNIS HOSPITAL IN GAZA THIS YEAR: Correct. Yeah, I was at European Hospital on the southeastern edge of Khan Younis. When I was there, that was probably the best-resourced city block in the entire Gaza Strip, and it was still an absolute and total disaster. While I was there, on average, I saw one kid shot in the head every single day. Every day we had mass casualty events, mostly from bomb blasts. The hospital was completely overwhelmed. There were 10 to 15,000 people sheltering on the grounds of the hospital itself, and even within the hospital. So when you're moving a gurney through the hospital, there's tents on both sides of the hallway. You're trying not to run a little kid's fingers over. There, the hospital had inconsistent water, inconsistent electricity. The only supplies we had were what we brought in with us. And it was a 220-bed hospital with 1,500 people admitted to it, half of whom were severely injured children. So it was a very, very difficult situation.",

We ask their families what happened, of course, and they would say that they were shot by the Israelis. But it's very hard to infer intentionality from our data in this case or that case or that case. That's not what anybody should take from this. What they should take from it is the overall pattern.How can it possibly be that in the catchment area of every hospital in the Gaza Strip for an entire year, internationals have seen children shot in the head on a regular, if not, like in my case, a daily basis.

In that spirit, the IDF makes great efforts to estimate and consider potential civilian collateral damage in its strikes. The IDF is fully committed to respecting all applicable international legal obligations, including the law of armed conflict.\" You talked about taking pictures, and you did take some, and we've been looking at some of those pictures from your experience there where you say that you didn't even have soap sometimes to wash your hands in this devastating situation. There is also another picture that was published. It's one of the first things you see, and it's very disturbing. And here is that picture. It shows three children. I think it's a CT scan.

It's part of my daily work.There is absolutely no reason to doubt the authenticity of these pictures at all. Any doctor who says they are is either not a doctor or is lying to you. And I just want to be very clear about that. I've seen the CT scan itself. What you're seeing is a CT scout image, which is like a two-dimensional picture so that you can set up how high the CT scan is going to go and how low it's going to go. I have the full video of the CT scan, in particular of that child that Dr. Saeed took. And I also have a picture of her forehead. Her eyes are closed.

So that's devastating.A lot more have been taken, tormented, tortured, starved. Their own families have been killed. They're all displaced. They're all homeless.
