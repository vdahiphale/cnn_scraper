      "sentences": "Thousands of protesters are, once again, here in Jerusalem just outside of the Israeli Supreme Court and across the country, both against this judicial overhaul legislation that is currently being debated in the Israeli Parliament.There is a protest in Tel Aviv that is for the judicial overhaul. These protesters are saying this reform, as they're calling it, is sorely needed. But for many of these protesters here in Jerusalem today, they are terrified of what this legislation could mean for the independence of the Israeli judiciary and for what it could mean for the power of the Israeli government. Because the legislation being debated right now in the Israeli Parliament would strip the ability of the Israeli Supreme Court to declare government actions unreasonable, saying they just wouldn't be able to say that a government action should not be able to take place. Now, the coalition government, led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they want to take that ability away. And this is just one part of this massive judicial overhaul package that the Israeli government is trying to push through that would completely reshape the Israeli judiciary. And that's why you have these protesters who have been out for six months now on the streets, but their protests have really ramped up in recent days, because this legislation is now officially on the table. If this legislation passes, it will be the first part of this overhaul package that will finally, and officially, pass and could potentially turn into law. The protests here in Jerusalem have been ongoing for days. They even marched from Tel Aviv into Jerusalem. And then they actually have set up a tent city in one of the largest parks in Jerusalem, where they say that they will camp out until, and for as long as necessary, until this legislation is off the table. But the governing coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu are showing no signs of backing down, saying that the vote will take place. This, despite the pleas, not only from these protesters, but pressure from the U.S. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, returning from the United States and going, actually, straight to the hospital, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hospitalized, because he's been fitted with a pacemaker. All of this happening, of course, at the same time, in the middle of the night on Saturday night, the prime minister's office announcing that the Benjamin Netanyahu was being fitted with a pacemaker for a heart problem. That doesn't stop politics here, and the Israeli president driving straight to the hospital to have an emergency meeting with the prime minister to try and convince him to slow down the legislation, to come to sort of compromise. But all signs are pointing that this vote will take place on Monday, and it could be the beginning of the complete reshaping of the Israeli judiciary. This, of course, also happening while thousands of Israeli military reservists are threatening not to serve if this legislation passes. That could have major implications for Israel's military readiness. A lot happening in politics is Israel right now, all at the same time. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So for Sanchez, it's reaching out to the sort of cluster, one can call it, on the left-wing-leaning parties. But the likelihood of reaching that magic number of 176 -- the legislature has 356 seats -- is a complex ones and would involve, most likely, somewhere around four to five political parties, which, as you can imagine, Michael, makes for very difficult coalition talks and also, ultimately, a very fragile government, should they come to the and with some kind of conclusion or agreement.",

So that, for example, the immigration debate is no longer exclusively the terrain of the far-right. And, this has been compounded by the fact that conservative or reactionary parties have been willing to kind of remove the stigma around these parties and entertain coalition agreements. In some cases, in Germany, this has taken place at their local level, but I think that in American politics, when you see the shifts in the Republican Party, when you saw the debates play out in the Conservative Party in Brexit, in the U.K. between far-right fringes, this is the kind of pattern moving forward. So, yes, in this particular case, I think they underperformed, but when you look at the range of ideas they were pushing forward, you could argue that their underperformance comes from the fact that so many of their ideas are now mainstreamed in European politics, Michael.",

Also notable, the companies have agreed to try to make a watermarking system to identify A.I. audio and images. You know, we've seen a raft of A.I. images that are really only, at this point, we're able to detect with our eyes and our ears whether something is an A.I. audio or A.I. video. Notably, though, they don't agree to, in this agreement -- there's nothing on text. OpenAI obviously is ChatGPT. We've seen in schools and universities students use ChatGPT to create essays. And there is no real good way to identify that. This agreement with the White House does not include text. Now, what are the next steps? The White House says they're prepping executive action later this summer. There's a whole host of bipartisan bills being written. It's unclear which ones the White House will support. And then the FTC has signaled they are taking an aggressive approach to A.I. It's been reported that they are identifying that they are investigating OpenAI. So, right now, a first step, but many more to come. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
