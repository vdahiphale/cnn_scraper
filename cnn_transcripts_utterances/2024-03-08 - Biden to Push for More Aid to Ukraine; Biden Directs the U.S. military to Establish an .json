So, Natasha, as we say, a fiery political speech, really different from previous State of the Union speeches. What's that to you?NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROF. OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Well, you're right. It is different than State of the Union speeches, which are mostly about recommending legislation to Congress. This was the speech of Biden's life. He really had to prove to the American public that he's fit to lead for another four years. And he had to show a lot of energy and he had to be quick on his feet. He had to strike the right balance. And I think he did a fantastic job last night. He was able to touch upon the key points that he needed to. And he was able to joke a little bit about his age. But I think you saw throughout, he didn't have any major gaps. He didn't have any hiccups. He stayed really focused and he surely delivered at least what the campaign wanted him to do. As you mentioned, he didn't call out Trump by name, but he had some really key points of illustrating how dangerous a Trump second term could be by goading Russia, for example, to go after U.S. allies, U.S.-NATO allies if they didn't pay up. And I actually think the best line of the speech was you can't love your country only when you win. That's really key to understanding the basics of democracy, that democracy isn't always about winning. It's about understanding to be tolerant of the other side. And he pointed out that the Republicans and Trump were rewriting history about what happened on January 6th, that this really was the biggest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.",

But the evidence last night was pretty clear that he is still quick on his feet and that he actually, I think, relishes getting into these little back-and-forth with Republicans and going off script a little bit.[03:10:06] And I think that for the Democrats, they'll have to focus on the major issues of the campaign and not get caught into defending his age. That's going to be dangerous for them if the age thing is the entire thing, what the next campaign is about in eight months to come. They need to focus on the fact that Donald Trump is the biggest threat to U.S. democracy. He's an autocrat. We need to take him for his word. He has, through his Supreme Court justices that he's chose, personally picked, seen the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Women's reproductive rights in most countries are improving. In the U.S., it's one of few countries that it is not improving. And also, I think he did a good job of calling out Republicans on the immigration issue, which is a major issue for Republicans, that there is a bipartisan bill that they could sign if they wanted to, but they're not basically because Trump doesn't want them to and is ordering them not to, because then that takes away the biggest issue of the campaign. So I think it's important for the Democrats to stay focused on the issues and to get away with, to get away from focusing on Biden's age.",

It definitely energized the Democratic base, energized Biden supporters, and it possibly could change the mind of those that are undecided. I mean, there were times during the speech you could see some Republicans nodding their heads, either in agreement or just couldn't really disagree with what Biden was saying about, in particular, the immigration bill and a few other issues. There are other times, as was mentioned in the report in the split screen, they weren't applauding. And that, in some ways, does look unpatriotic. And for those that aren't members of the Trump base, like, why do you want the U.S. to lose right now? Why do you want things to not go well in the U.S.?

Now, Hamas and the health ministry there and also eyewitnesses saidthat Israeli forces had opened fire on the Palestinians trying to get aid, which is so desperately needed, especially in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The IDF has now put out its findings from its initial review of what happened. And it says that IDF troops did not fire at the humanitarian convoy, but did fire at a number of suspects who approached the nearby forces and posed a threat to them. And this is something they've more or less been saying since the beginning. In terms of some of the more details, they say a crowd of about 12,000 Gazans gathered around these aid trucks in this convoy and says that they then started looting the equipment that was being transported and that during the course of the looting, there were a number of civilians that were harmed in the crush. They say that later on that dozens of Gazans advanced towards nearby IDF troops up to several meters from them and say that they therefore posed a threat. And at that stage, the forces fired warning shots as the suspects continued to advance. The IDF says the troops fired, in their words, precisely towards a number of the suspects to remove the threat. And they say their investigation is continuing. The United Nations, for its part, has called for an independent investigation into the events surrounding what is perhaps the biggest single loss of life since the war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th.

Now, one of the sticking points appears to be Israel's demand for a list of those hostages that are still alive, something Hamas says it cannot provide until such time as there is a ceasefire. So, things are at a bit of an impasse there. President Biden, the Biden administration for its part, has said the onus is very firmly on Hamas. Indeed, in the State of the Union address, President Biden saying that all Hamas has to do to end this war tomorrow is to release the hostages, to lay down its arms, and to hand over those responsible for the October the 7th terrorist attacks. That's clearly not something that is going to happen.

The foreign minister, Wang Yi, slammed the U.S. for a bewildering level of trade curbs. And Wang Yi also said this.Let's bring up the quote for you. He said, \"if the U.S. is obsessed with suppressing China, it will eventually harm itself\", unquote. The U.S. under President Biden has been limiting China's ability to access sensitive, high-end technology like chips over fears that such technology could be used by the Chinese military and bolster the PLA. The U.S. has also used sanctions against a number of Chinese entities over a host of issues, including allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the illicit fentanyl trade, as well as support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, Wang did concede that, yes, there has been, in his words, some improvements in the U.S.-China relationship, especially since that summit that took place in November in San Francisco between Biden and Xi Jinping. And we have seen evidence of improvement. High-level military communications have resumed between the U.S. and China. A working group has been set up to curb the flow of fentanyl to the United States. But tension exists. Just last month, Wang Yi called on the U.S. to lift sanctions. So that, along with the tough language that we have heard this week, both in Beijing and Washington, all underscore the tension that is there. Back to you, Kim.",

If enacted, the measure would give the social media platform about five months to divest from its parent company ByteDance, which is linked to China. Now, if it doesn't, TikTok would be banned from U.S. app stores, including Apple and Google. Lawmakers are concerned that Americans' personal data collected by TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government. But TikTok is pushing back, saying the government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their constitutional right to free expression. It also says the move will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country. But one of the bill's co-sponsors in Congress says that response proves his point. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): The pressure campaign that TikTok put in place today, where they forced a pop-up on the app that called members of Congress and also told a lie that we were forcing an outright ban, which this bill is not, proves the danger. They sort of proved the entire point. Imagine if those lies were allowed to spread on topics like our election or a foreign war. So that's what we're trying to guard against. And in our construct, users can continue to enjoy the app so long as we fix the ownership problem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And earlier this week, the Malaysian government said it may renew the search for the doomed flight.In the early hours of March 8th, 2014, Flight MH370 was heading to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. But about an hour into the flight, it dropped off radar and vanished. Aviation experts tell CNN improved detection technology could help them find out what happened. Now let's bring in CNN's Anna Coren, live in Hong Kong. Anna, many families still searching for closure. Is there a greater chance now that they might actually get it?",

This is one of the greatest aviation mysteries of the world yet to be solved. But for the families of those victims, you know, this has been an agonizing search for answers and the truth. There have been multiple searches spanning hundreds of thousands of kilometers in the Indian Ocean that -- that have turned up empty handed.That's all that's been discovered is really just a few dozen pieces of debris mostly washed up on the east coast of Africa. But now there are talks of renewing search efforts for the wreckage thanks to pressure from the families. The Malaysian government has said that it is committed to finding MH370 and the search will go on. We heard that from the transport minister last weekend. It has said that it will engage in talks with Ocean Infinity. Now, this is a U.S. marine robotics firm that ended its last search back in 2018. But we have spoken to world renowned aviation expert Richard Godfrey, and he is certain that MH370 can be found but not where Ocean Infinity will be looking. He says he has four pieces of information, information from Boeing, information from Inmarsat, the satellite company that tracked MH370 every hour it was in the air. He has data from oceanographers and finally, whisper data. Now this is new technology using radio amateur signals and he has said all four different data align. And that's why he believes that there is now an accurate crash location. He said, however, that the black box that it must be recovered to establish exactly what happened so that the world can obviously learn the lessons for the future and safety of the aviation industry, remembering 10 million people around the world get on a plane each day. But most importantly, for those families so that they can learn the truth and finally, you know, get the closure that they so desperately want and deserve, Kim.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting because you may remember that in 2014, when Anwar Ibrahim, the current prime minister, was about to go back to jail, he actually told me that he did not believe for a minute that we could have lost this plane. And I remember him telling me that he signed himself the order for the very good radar that Malaysia was equipped with. So now, 10 years later, the roles have changed. Najib Razak, who 10years ago was the spokesperson of what I call the official narrative, which is indeed that the plane, you know, did a U-turn, went up the Malacca Strait and then went down in a ghost flight and crashed in the Southern Indian Ocean. So, Najib Razak is now in jail. And we have the person as a prime minister who 10 years ago was questioning this official narrative. But so it's very good that he's for relaunching the search. As far as I'm concerned, I think I have demonstrated, actually demonstrated that the plane never ended in the Southern Indian Ocean. So I'm not against them doing one more search, as long as, and I have two caveats, as long as they do this search in good faith, and as long as what they find at the end is not just one or two trophy pieces, but the actual field of debris. Because you may remember AF447, which is a very interesting case to compare. It was the flight between Rio and Paris, and it crashed in June 2009. And it took two years to find the field of debris, same kind of depth, you know, 5,000 to 6,000 meters. Eventually, 90 percent of the plane was recovered within a square kilometer. So just finding a few trophy pieces won't do. And everyone, public opinion included, must be aware that the only credible evidence they could give us that the plane actually crashed there is the whole field of debris. And I don't believe they will find it.",

And when they joined the party, if I may say, you know, two years after the Australian tried to find a plane without success, they suddenly had means which were 10 times more powerful and they could search in a matter of weeks. Altogether, they first gave themselves a few weeks and then theyextended it. And they searched way more square kilometers than the Australian search had done previously. So it's not a problem of means and of, yes, resources. Keep in mind as well that Ocean Infinity is not a good Samaritan who's going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every day for this endeavor. Their job is to look for wrecks. They are salvagers. They look for wrecks that maybe have gold or silver. And they got access to the mapping of the ocean to do the initial campaign. So they also have their own interest in doing this. And I'm not confident, I'm not sure that all they want to do is just find MH370.",
