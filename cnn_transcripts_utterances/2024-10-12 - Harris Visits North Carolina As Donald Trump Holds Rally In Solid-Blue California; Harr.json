We are exactly 24 days from Election Day in America.Vice President Kamala Harris has arrived in North Carolina with plans to step her outreach to Black voters as the campaign continues to hone in on swing states that will decide this election. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is opting to spend crucial time in a solid blue state for presidential politics for a rally in California's Coachella. CNN's Kristen Holmes is there. Kristen, big crowd behind you. What are we expecting to hear from Trump?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and also a big crowd to the side of me as well. I mean, the big hope here for Donald Trump was to draw as many people as possible, even though it is a blue state. Remember, one of the things that he's trying to do is turn out the popular vote, even though we know, of course, that doesn't matter in the end, and there is no real -- it is really zero percent chance that he could win a state like California.But part of what I'm told he's going to talk about today is the fact of Kamala Harris's record. He has gone after her for the state of California, blaming her for crime in various areas. He'll go after Gavin Newsom and we talked to senior advisors about why he is here in these critical final days. They say they believe it doesn't really matter where he goes to give his message. We asked why he wasn't in swing states, they said that this is a national media campaign that when he does these kind of events, when he's found the stage, that the national media will cover it. But in addition to that, they're really trying to reach low propensity voters ahead of November, meaning people who don't generally engage with politics in the typical way that others do. They believe that clips from these kind of events can reach these people on podcasts or social media, and might even have more reach than, say, a traditional rally in a swing state. Now, that's not to say that he's not going to these swing states. We know he was in Nevada yesterday and today, he'll be in Arizona tomorrow, but they don't really feel like he has to do just that. Now, when we talked to a number of Republican operatives who disagree with this, they think the race is just simply too close, that he should be spending every waking moment in one of these critical battleground states, like Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, as he is tomorrow, but they say again, this is a new strategy that they are taking. We'll see if it pays off, but we really won't know until November. Now, Jessica, one of the things that we're going to listen to carefully here is he continues that really dark rhetoric when it comes to immigration and the economy. I'm told by people close to him that he's going to double down on that messaging ahead of November. He believes, Donald Trump, that it helped propel him to the White House in 2016 and it could help him again in November.",

It is a margin of error race, and that's why I'm out here and will continue for the next 24 days to be traveling around our country, talking with folks about the issues that matter most to them, and offering them what I believe to do, solutions.

One could say that it is a typical thing for the Democrats to feel this way. And I think ultimately, anyone who tells you that they know what's going to happen in this election really is making it up, because the polls have been all over the place. It is going to be a margin election. It is extremely close, and it is going to depend on who shows up to these polls. And these polls have been showing different things at different times. You know, Pennsylvania alone you saw -- you've seen Harris up and Trump up; in Arizona, the same things have been swinging pretty wildly. The fact is that everyone at this point has to be on their A game. That's Donald Trump, that's Kamala Harris, and that's why you see them just, you know, pushing out to in as many places as they possibly can.",

There's still a lot of disaffected Republicans who are on the fence about voting for him. They might come home come November, but they very well may not.And so everyone, again, is trying to figure out who they can get to the polls. Who are going to be the people that are going to reliably show up and vote for their candidate? And we really don't know if there are, you know, who these new voters may be, how they're going to vote. I mean, I think that it comes down to, as everyone's been saying over and over again, a few hundred thousand people in a very few states. And so those are the people that matter.

Iran and Hezbollah have vigorously denied these claims.In a statement to CNN, Iran's Mission to the United Nations, said: \"While Doha stationed Hamas officials have themselves stated that they too had no prior knowledge of the operation, and that all the planning, decision making and directing were solely executed by Hamas' military wing based in Gaza, any claim attempting to link it to Iran or Hezbollah, either partially or wholly, is devoid of credence and comes from fabricated documents.\" Ronen Bergman, one of \"The New York Times\" reporters who broke this story, joins us now from Tel Aviv. Ronan, thanks so much for being here with us. I just want you first to walk us through this report and what points toward an attempt by Hamas to coordinate with Iran. [18:20:07 ] RONEN BERGMAN, REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": So we're talking about 10 documents, 10 minutes of meetings that took place between July 21 to August -- 7th of August, 2023, so exactly two months before the war started, before the Hamas attack on Israel. This is the only forum, it is called a small (ph) military council, so basically, the supreme form of Hamas, chaired by Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza and the mastermind behind the attack. This is the only way they spoke freely, because they were sure, and with all good reason, as proven because Israel intelligence only got these after the attack. They were sure that nobody is listening, and they spoke freely about the decision making, the conclusions, the preparations and their attempts to bring in, to convince Iran and Hezbollah to participate. And with my colleagues, Patrick Kingsley at Adam Rasgon, we examine these protocols, verified and vetted them, and then one of the things that we -- that clearly comes out of the protocols is that the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar is saying, If we attack by ourselves, we could cause significant damage to Israel, but if we attack with the whole front, so the Axis of Resistance -- Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, the militias in Iraq -- we could collapse Israel instead, or at least take Israel many years backwards. And they're trying to convince them, first in 2022 and when they were not successful, they delayed it to 2023. A series of meetings in Beirut between a hiring official from Hamas, his name is Khalil al- Hayya, the deputy of Mr. Sinwar and a senior Iranian official, they discussed the details of the plan and what Hamas asked the Iranians and Hezbollah to do, for example, to bomb, to attack some sensitive sites at the beginning, at the first hour of this surprise attack.",

Well, we know what the Iranians, of course, talk about this, about the massive help in financing Hamas, supplying them with knowhow, sophisticated military equipment and others. What these protocols reveal is that, unlike the claim from Israeli intelligence that this was a well-kept secret between only six people in Gaza, which of course, makes the Israeli intelligence failure slightly lighter or smaller, the Hamas shared this secret of the coming attack with Iran, with Hezbollah.They understood from Iran that Iran will help if Hamas attacks, though not the promise to join them in the first minute, as it did happen, Hezbollah joined the war on October 7th, but they also shared these secrets with people from the political bureau of Hamas. You said something about the nature of the deception, Hamas orchestrated a very sophisticated campaign of deception to convince Israeli leaders, as they say in the protocols that Hamas is interested in economic welfare, in prosperity, and in calm, while in fact, they were planning what they call the big project, that's their code name for the attack. So for example, they make sure -- they made sure that they do not join rounds of fighting between Israel and the other Palestinian jihadist movements, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, because they wanted to show Israel that they don't want war, and when you look at Israeli Intelligence document, you see that they fully fall into the trap. The Israelis believed that Hamas is deterred. They believed that Hamas doesn't want and cannot execute such an invasion.

I've proactively received a lot of calls from Democrats who really aren't the nervous type saying I'm nervous and here's why. And I've gotten a lot of those. I've sensed that shift kind of happening in the last week or so because they see how deadlocked and stubborn these numbers are. And they're trying to see how they can shift this race. They think they should be so much farther ahead, even though Kamala Harris has said from the beginning that she is the underdog. They're saying, look, we're running against a convicted felon and we're not gaining traction. And we need to figure out what we can do in the final weeks of this campaign.",

They're pointing to the fact that the race isn't moving, that nothing is really picking up in favor of her. So they want to kind of shift gears.

And they look at Hillary Clinton's numbers and they say Hillary Clinton was ahead with certain demographics at this point going into that election and she said she lost, of course, and they don't want Kamala Harris to be in that boat. And there is misogyny. A lot of I'm hearing from Democrats that they're worried that misogyny is playing a big factor in this race.
