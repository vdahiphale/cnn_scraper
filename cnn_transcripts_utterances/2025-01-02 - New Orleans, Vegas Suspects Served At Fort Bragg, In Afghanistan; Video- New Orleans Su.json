      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextShocking new details in two deadly attacks. The New Orleans terrorist armed with remote detonators for his bombs, and the man who blew up a Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas, a decorated active duty Special Forces soldier. And exclusive new video taken just hours before the attack in New Orleans. A doorbell camera capturing the attacker unloading his pickup truck at an Airbnb next door. The resident who has that video is our guest. And a 25-year-old among the victims. His family having dinner together hours before the attack on New Year's Eve. His parents begging him not to go to the French Quarter. They will be our guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news this hour, new details on the two deadly attacks that have Americans on edge tonight. Two large vehicles used as weapons in both New Orleans and Las Vegas. Both suspects had served at Fort Bragg. Both had been stationed in Afghanistan in 2009. Both had been decorated for their military service. But officials say there is no indication at least yet that they knew each other. In New Orleans, the FBI just releasing this new poster calling for information for the public -- from the public about the New Year's Eve attack, in which 14 people were killed. This poster that you're looking at contains two new images of the suspect. Shamsud-Din Jabbar from an hour before the attack. Now, what's interesting here, as we look at this picture, long, light brown coat, almost like a work type coat, dark buttoned down shirt, blue jeans. And what the FBI says. And this stands out to when you look at his feet, what appears to be brown dress shoes. The poster also has this image of one of the coolers containing an IED, which they say Jabbar placed near the attack. And officials now say he was, quote, 100 percent inspired by ISIS. New surveillance video from the night of the attack shows him speeding down Bourbon Street. That point narrowly missing pedestrians. Of course he did hit many of them. And 14 people are dead. At the beginning of the video, though, you see the truck going over a barrier that actually was down, and that video was taken just moments before police killed Jabbar, in that exchange of fire. We now have obtained exclusive video of the suspect just hours before the attack as well. This is the Ring camera video I mentioned a moment ago. It's from a neighboring home and it shows Jabbar unloading his rented truck outside the Airbnb where he was staying. And I'm going to speak with the man who shared that video with us in just a moment. And we are also learning new information at this hour, though, about the suspect behind the explosion of a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Matthew Livelsberger was an active Special Forces soldier, the winner of five Bronze Star medals, including one for valor in combat. Officials now say he shot himself in the head before the explosion. They say his body was burned beyond recognition. We have both of these stories covered in depth tonight. Anderson Cooper is in New Orleans. Natasha Chen is on the ground in Las Vegas. Let's start with Anderson. And, Anderson, as you are there, what is the latest that you're learning from officials on the ground?",

The photo of which you showed they now know it was him who actually set down those coolers, but they are trying to appeal for any information that anyone may have, not just here in New Orleans, but anybody who may have had contact with this guy over the last year to get an understanding of his radicalization and what actually led him to this point, to be here three hours after the stroke of midnight.",
