And just moments from now, Harris will be responding live. And the veepstakes. Right now, rampant speculation over who Kamala Harris will choose. New details we are learning this hour about who it will, and now, we're learning who it won't be. And Donald Trump's nephew is OUTFRONT, speaking out, talking about Trump's comments that he made to him about his disabled son and his use of the N-word. And now, he's breaking with the family going for Kamala Harris. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump asking, quote, is she Indian or is she Black? The former president during a combative appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference went after the Democrats' presumptive nominee, questioning whether the first Black president -- vice president of the United States is, in fact, Black.

So I've known her a long time indirectly, not directly, very much, and she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.

And at his rally in Pennsylvania, the campaign showed headlines that identify Harris as an Indian American. Well, Trump's appearance was 35 minutes at the NABJ of nonstop insults. It was a packed room. Hundreds of journalists were there. He faced questions from three moderators, from the ABC News reporter Rachel Scott, Harris Faulkner of Fox News, and Kadia Goba from \"Semafor\", who is joining us in just a moment. But first, you know, Trump went off the rails almost immediately in this room, which by the way, he was there by choice. And no one forced him to be there. He chose to be there as President Harris was not there, he chose to go. And here's how it went from the first question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, J.D. Vance talks about that and he says, look, that is where my comments should be read. That's the context in which they should be read. The problem that Vance is having, which a number of commentators, both in the Senate and he ran on the left are pointing out is Republican Party policies overall haven't been very conducive to helping people have kids, raise kids and be able to take care of them.
