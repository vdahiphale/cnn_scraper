What would you do? Tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.Well, you know that saying, if these walls could talk, well, the walls are talking (ph). Imagine what the workers at Donald Trump's Mar-a- Lago resort might have seen and might have heard, and what will they say if they are asked? Well, federal investigators do not have to imagine what that would be like. CNN is learning exclusively that some workers have already spoken to investigators, in some cases multiple times, about security at Mar-a-Lago, or the lack thereof, and how boxes of classified documents were kept there and whether they could have been seen by visitors to the resort. And the former president is reacting exactly the way you'd probably expect him to react. If you had ballistic on your bingo card, well, bravo, you just won, because that was indeed his reaction, according to a source, when the maid who cleans his bedroom suite was asked to speak with investigators. But wait, there's more, as they say. There's the woodworker who installed crown molding in his bedroom and noticed a stack of papers, according to sources, though he didn't know what they were and later said what he said might have been maybe a movie prop, he thought. There was a chauffeur who was questioned about business people, including foreigners, who visited the club as VIP guests. There's a plumber who worked at the property for a few days a week for years, and several other maintenance workers are also among the potential Mar-a-Lago witnesses. Now, just think of the range of work I just described, and now the range of all the places documents or these conversations may have been or taken place. And this, as you know, is far from the only case on Donald Trump's crowded legal calendar. He's facing 91 charges across four criminal cases. And he is exactly reacting again how you might expect. Tonight, he tells Noticias Univision he could use the DOJ to go after his political opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The word is \"disambiguate.\" I think it's very important, if we're going to make progress, to disambiguate, to remove the ambiguity from the current situation.And by that, I mean the following: The Palestinian people have been the doormat of the Middle East for a century. And they deserve better. They deserve better from their own leaders, they deserve better from their Arab brethren and other Arab nations, they deserve better from Israel, and they deserve better from us. They do. Now, here's the word that disambiguates. However, that admittedly complex, nuanced, difficult dynamic that needs to be addressed has nothing, I repeat, nothing to do with what happened on October 7th, 2023, when Hamas made the decision to murder (INAUDIBLE). We have to bifurcate the truth because conflation is the enemy. When you start to conflate a clear act of murderous terrorism with an admittedly complex and difficult issue, you begin to obscure the truth of the matter. So, the only way forward, I think, is the following: Can we all agree that what Hamas did was morally repugnant and wrong? And can we all see how they are trying to flip the script? And by that, I mean, attack Israel and murder, force Israel to defend itself and respond, hide behind innocent Gazans, behind them, and underneath them in tunnels, 300 miles of tunnels below the ground, and then use the death of those civilians to claim that you, the perpetrator, are the victim, and the real victim is now the victimizer. If we can at least agree that what happened was wrong, morally repugnant, then we have a conversation that we can actually have. But if we conflate what happened on October 7th whit the other complicated issues in the Middle East, we will make no progress and it will be a race to the bottom. My tragedy is worse than your tragedy. We have got to separate these two issues. That's the only way, I think, we can address them one at a time.",

The rest of the country and the rest of the world have their relationship with him. But my relationship is a relationship where he judged me by the color of my skin and not by the content of my character in a country that says that you are innocent until proven guilty.My hope is that he gets the opportunity to have the law applied to him in a way that it was never applied to us. And by that, I mean, we see what happened. There's proof in what happened. Now, I'm not going to say that we're going to supersede the law, but the beautiful thing about it is that we get the opportunity to see the law work in the way that it's supposed to work, and hopefully, the outcome will be an outcome where that word that I said a little while ago, and I just tweeted the word \"karma,\" becomes a reality.",
