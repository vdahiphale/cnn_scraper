      "sentences": "Good evening.We begin tonight with a single frame of video from the war in Ukraine that captures the stunning reality and brutality of this war. This is the image. What you are looking at is the precise split second before a Russian missile explodes next to a team of aid workers including an American tending to a wounded civilian in Bakhmut earlier this month. It may be hard to see, but we've circled it in light. The missile is circled, it is flying parallel to the ground. It's an anti-tank missile, which means that someone had eyes on the target, which is the vehicle driven by the aid workers to the left of where the missile is about to go, the vehicle, they are standing right next to. One of the men killed is Pete Reed, a Marine Corps veteran. In January, he went to work in Ukraine with the aid organization Global Outreach Doctors, it's called and on the second of this month, he was killed. Tonight, we also have stunning information about a systematic program run by the Russian government to take Ukrainian children and re- educate and indoctrinate them in camps in Russia and Crimea. Some of the kids are believed to have been given weapons training and others had been sent to live with foster families or even put up for adoption in Russia. There is a new report documenting a network of camps, 43 of them in all across Russia and occupied Crimea, where thousands of Ukrainian children have so far been taken against international law. So there is a lot to get to tonight. We begin with the story behind the missile attack on the aid workers and we warn you, some of the video you'll see is hard to watch. CNN's Matthew Chance did the reporting. He joins us now. What more can you tell us about this attack?",

First and most critically is registration. Going back to Bosnia, Kosovo, many recent conflicts, having a clear internationally monitored registration system is the first step to reuniting families. Second, communication. The phones of these children when they had them have been taken in many cases. Reestablishing a means for them to call home, call mom, call dad is a critical first step. And the third thing is we need international monitors in there from the United Nations and other international government organizations because right now, it is only Russia's word and that's not good enough.

The Justice Department tends to not compel people to testify that they're going to go on and charge with a crime. And here is the big problem with doing so, what you've done is force him to testify against his wishes. It is really hard then to sort of to charge him with a crime after that, because you've already got testimony from him.You know, we don't make people testify against themselves. That's a little tricky, hard to see what they do there. Now, with respect to executive privilege, we should talk about what we mean and what that stands for. And Alyssa got into this a little bit. We expect then as a country that the President of the United States is entitled to a measure of protection for the conversations he has with his senior staff. That's not a bad thing. But that can't extend to wrongdoing or concealing crimes. If the President were to say to his Chief-of-Staff, hey, let's go rob a bank tomorrow, no one and no Court would ever say that that statement ought to be protected. So look, Meadows will, I think likely try to challenge this on executive privilege grounds. Some of the conversations he had with the President might be protected.

But I think that the momentum behind that may have shifted when it came to light that many former Presidents and Vice Presidents had had classified documents. I think there was a little bit of a sense that there was a sleepiness on January 6th, and this puts kind of new life into it, that probably the senior most person other than third most senior after the President, the Vice President has also been subpoenaed, now, Mark Meadows has. It shows that the Special Counsel is looking into January 6th, and again, this was an extraordinary historic moment that took place and the actions leading up to it.

But there was a really key moment with the investigator told Alex Murdaugh that they had already determined that a family-owned weapon was used in the murders, and he really had no reaction to this. Alex didn't ask, \"How did you know that, or where is that weapon now?\" He also told the investigator that Maggie Murdaugh had wanted to come to the house that night, but her sister had testified that Maggie told her that Alex had asked her to come to the house that night, along with their son Paul. And there was one really disturbing moment, Anderson, where Alex asked the investigator how far apart Maggie and Paul were when they were shot, and if one knew the other was dead.

That was the (INAUDIBLE) Carl Vinson that actually flung me out there to perform surgery on a little girl named Kimberly. But the thing that struck me today, talking to the captain of the ship was, look, there's all these aftershocks and you put in a field hospital, they can be vulnerable to these aftershocks.
