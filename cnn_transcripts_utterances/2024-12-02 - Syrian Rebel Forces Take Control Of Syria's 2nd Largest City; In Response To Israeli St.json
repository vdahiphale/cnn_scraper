      "sentences": "Well, make no two ways about it, Dana. These are the most significant gains that we have seen the rebels make in eight years to be in full control of the city of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, the center of commerce, is a huge deal. It's something that the rebels were never actually able to entirely pull off.And a big part of why they weren't able to do that was because Syria had the support of Iran and Hezbollah and, of course, crucially, Russia. So it may be that the rebels could see that Russia was distracted with Ukraine, that Israel has been fighting Hezbollah and Iran, and that now was the moment to try and pull off this offensive. But it is gathering pace, Dana. They are now also telling citizens in the city of Hama, the central city of Hama, that they should be careful, that they should stay away from the regime. The expectation is that there will be some kind of an offensive there imminently. They have managed to entirely take over Idlib province. But they are now coming under heavy airstrikes. The White Helmets, the civil defense group that monitors what's going on in those areas, saying that at least 25 people have been killed in the last couple of days, some of them women and children. A hospital was hit in Idlib. So, a lot of anxiety now as everyone waits to see what this portends and what it means for the future of Syria's notorious dictator, Bashar al-Assad, Dana.",

Hezbollah releasing a statement basically saying that after continuous violations from the IDF, it felt it had no choice but to retaliate. Those two projectiles were fired into an area that's known as the Shebaa Farms, which is controlled by Israel but is viewed under international law as actually being a part of Syria.And I want to be very clear, though, Dana, that there have been continuous violations since the ceasefire took effect early Wednesday morning. CNN spoke to a U.N. peacekeeping source who says that Israel has violated that ceasefire about 100 times. But there are many people on both sides of this border who are desperately hoping that this doesn't escalate further and that the ceasefire prevails, Dana.",

His family was told that Omer was one of the 254 hostages taken during the brutal Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7th, 2023. But they just received the tragic news that Omer was actually killed that day and his body was taken to Gaza. I spoke with Omer's parents, Ronan and Orna Neutra, on October 7th of this year. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) ORNA NEUTRA, MOTHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE OMER NEUTRA: We really hope that Omer is keeping up hope, that he's strong. He's a very social person. He's a connector. We pray that he's not alone. And we pray that, you know, his strengths hold up until we are able to save him and get him out of there. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

      "sentences": "First, thank you for having me. And, obviously, I'm not a household name. I am starting as the outsider in this race. That's very clear. But I'm also starting as the candidate who best knows how to win, especially on difficult terrain. And that is all that we should care about as a Democratic Party. And that's all that the next DNC chair should be focused on.Look, we've gotten into the habit as a party of lecturing voters as opposed to listening to voters. I've spent the last four years, and I represent a district that isn't blue or even purple. Trump won it by 12 percentage points, while I just got re-elected by 14. And the past four years, I've heard from voter after voter the issues of public safety, of the economy, and especially affordability. And for the better part of those four years, our national party and members of our party have labeled any Democrat that has tried to raise the issue of border security as racist, has tried to peddle Brookings' white paper talking points and trying to convince voters that the economy is doing well, when, in fact, they go to the supermarket and see clearly that it's not doing well. And so, I will do, as DNC chair, what I've done in a tough, tough district for the past 12 years, and that is show up everywhere, speak to people where they are, go on every outlet, not just those outlets that have been traditionally friendly for Democrats, and start to rebuild the once big tent and repair the frayed edges that are on both sides, the middle and the left, and build this coalition so that we're a dominant party once again.",

Obviously, we need to scale that. I'm able to have those conversations.But the most important piece here is reorienting how we spend that money. I have talked to DNC donors who have told me point blank they will not give another red cent to the DNC unless it is a completely restructured organization. And I'm well situated in the sense that I will not owe anything to the D.C. consultant class or the cocktail circuit in Washington. And one of the first things I will do is direct that all of these vendor contracts at the DNC be allowed to expire. Let's rebid them. No more friends of friends of congressmen being given seven and eight figure business because they're well connected at the DNC. And let's move those investments to the boots on the ground, the state parties, the county parties. We need a 30 to 44 county strategy, not just a 50 state strategy. New partnerships with organized labor. That's where the crux of our spending needs to be focused on.",

There are some exceptional candidates, including one of my colleagues, State Senator Zellnor Myrie already running for mayor.I believe that our nominees are stronger through the Democratic primary process. I wish President Biden would have stepped down sooner. I think that an open primary would have strengthened Vice President Harris's nomination.
