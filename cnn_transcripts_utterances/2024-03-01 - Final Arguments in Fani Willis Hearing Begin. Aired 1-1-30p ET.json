I'm Boris Sanchez alongside Jessica Dean in Washington.And in just moments, we're going to see some pivotal arguments in the Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and his co- defendants. Attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants are going to deliver closing arguments in their push to disqualify the person who brought that sweeping case, Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. They claim that Willis financially benefited from her romantic relationship with one of her top prosecutors, Nathan Wade.",

But, first, let's take you to Zachary Cohen, who is outside the courthouse in Atlanta, and also here with us, CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates. Zach, let's start with you.

      "sentences": "Yes, guys, any minute, we expect defense attorneys for Donald Trump and his fellow co- defendants to enter this courtroom and lay out for the judge in this case, Judge Scott McAfee, why the evidence that they have put forward so far warrants disqualifying Fani Willis, the district attorney here in Fulton County, from the Georgia election subversion case.And, look, they're going to have to meet the burden. And one of the things we're looking for from Scott McAfee to clarify today is what that burden is exactly. Now, it amounts -- whether the evidence amounts to a conflict of interest, they have argued that the evidence shows that Fani Willis financially benefited from her romantic relationship with Wade. Or even if the burden is the appearance of a conflict of interest, that could radically change sort of the calculation into whether or not the Scott McAfee is likely to ultimately disqualify Willis. But, look, the lawyers for the district attorney's office are going to have a chance to push back and make their own case as to why Fani Willis should remain on the case. And I don't have to overstate the stakes here for you guys. It's a pivotal moment in this case. Sources have told me for weeks now that if Fani Willis is disqualified, people inside the district attorney's office fear that that means this case itself is effectively dead, because nobody else in this state will want to pick it up because of the political taint that would be on it. And now, look, we're also looking to see more from Scott McAfee if we will offer any clues as to where he might be leaning. Coming into this hearing, all -- a lot of questions coming in, but we're hoping that we could at least get some clarity in whether or not we might be headed toward a resolution over the question of whether or not Fani Willis remains or is disqualified here.",

So that's the most important part here. We haven't touched the allegations against any of those co-defendants. There has been no credible evidence to undermine any of those allegations as of yet. The focus is that. But the idea that she could be disqualified is not just her. It'd be the entire office.

I don't necessarily give you the benefit of the doubt in the same way. That's a problem. But, again, we have not touched the actual meat on the bone of the case. And we have some time between now and if there is a trial, amnesia sets in like you wouldn't believe in a lot of cases. And, remember, this is the actual site of the allegations where people's votes were likely affected or sought to be impacted. And that could actually overrule one's irritation with the more salacious. But make no mistake about it.

Likely not, but remember as well, here's what's interesting. You have to fight to get that in through an expert that can be qualified as an expert to say what you are presenting it as is actually intended to go to the meat of the matter. It's interesting to figure out how cell phone data works, but the defense who raised the motion got too cutesy. When they didn't ask precise questions, they said things like, did you spend the night, did you sleep over? I have prosecuted sex crimes.

Is $100 enough? So I think it's not necessarily the amount of the money. It's the fact that she received it, and it's not insignificant. And I don't think your order has to say, because she received $9,200, she's disqualified. I think, if we go back to the 20,000-foot level, where's the -- what's the appearance here? Is this fairness to the defendants? Is -- does it appear that she is interested in this prosecution or does it appear that she's disinterested? She took the stand. You can tell, she's not a disinterested person when it comes to this proceeding, but we also argue she's not a disinterested person when it comes to the prosecution as a whole. I'm going to leave for -- I will resist the temptation to defend my wife and who I believe to be an excellent lawyer and a member of the bar for 20 years in good standing, but I will say this, Judge. You don't just evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. You evaluate the credibility of the lawyers. And Mr. Abbate stood up here in open court in front of national news and the national public and called her a liar. I need to address that for one minute. The text messages that are now part of the record, which now are substantive evidence for you to consider, prove everything that she put in that motion, everything that she tried to elicit for Mr. Bradley was absolutely 100 percent true. Not only was it true. She verified through the witness himself that the motion was accurate before it was filed. So for the state to get up here and impugn her credibility, it's not only improper. It violates Berger v. the United States, which is a case that says, the state can't just get up here and make any argument it wants. And I encourage the court to call him out on it when he steps up here. We have to have candor towards the tribunal. You cannot lie to the court, cannot lie to the public, cannot lie to the jury. And I think that's what he did. So there's other corroboration of our view that she was in this relationship. I think, frankly, based on Mr. Bradley's testimony, Your Honor can separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to credibility, but he -- Mr. Bradley had two chances to correct information that he suddenly developed amnesia about, but he just didn't do it.",
