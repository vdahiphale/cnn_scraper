So, that takes off some of the pressure, some of the work that the county clerks are going to have to do tonight.We just got an update from her office, and 3.3 million voters in Michigan cast their ballots before Election Day. That makes up 48 percent of registered voters in the state. That's a pretty big chunk, Kate. But we should also note that voting is obviously happening here today. I want you to listen to two voters that we spoke with here at this church in Kent County, Michigan, who told us why they're voting for Harris and why they're voting for Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, not as big as you saw four years ago because we were in the pandemic, but - but still larger in Republican areas that I think a lot of people anticipated. So, we're encouraged about that.But the truth of the matter is, and the reason I pushed early vote traditionally the last two years is Republicans, and I've been blunt about it and outspoken about it, Republicans can't, you know, keep going into Election Day 100,000 votes behind and expect to make it up in 13 hours. It's just simple in my mind. Simple arithmetic. So, the truth of it is, we're seeing big turnout, early turnout throughout the state on mail-in and early vote. We're seeing - I'm hearing anecdotally a pretty big turnout from around the state. I've been traveling. I was with the president twice last week. I was with J.D. Vance yesterday in - in Lacrosse. So, we feel good, but I - we - we've had 12 races in 24 - this gives you an idea about why we're a blue wall state. We've had 12 races in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes. So, it - turnout's important.",

A they're - a lot of them are shifted out, thousands of them today, also thousands of poll watchers, who people literally watch and observe, and a couple hundred lawyers.
