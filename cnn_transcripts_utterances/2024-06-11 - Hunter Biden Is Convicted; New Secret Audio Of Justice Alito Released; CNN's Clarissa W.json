I'm Jim Acosta, in for Laura Coates on this busy Tuesday night. For months, Donald Trump and Republicans have tried to make the case that there is a two-tiered justice system, one system of justice for Trump and one for everybody else. Their attacks go something like this, that the Justice Department is being weaponized against Donald Trump and Donald Trump only at the erection of President Biden, never mind that Trump and his allies are also claiming that Biden is slipping mentally while at the same time orchestrating that conspiracy. Set that aside, just consider the Trump world allegation that Biden is behind this plot to persecute the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we had a good conversation.I'd gone initially because of ProPublica's reporting on Clarence Thomas. So, I thought at the time, you know, will he be there? Will he not? Who knows? But the reporting is it's like one of his favorite dinners. So, I thought there was a good chance. He was not there, Harlan Crow was not there, to my knowledge, but Justice Alito was, and so I had a conversation with him about how do we repair this partisan rift in our country. I didn't say partisan, rather, sorry, how do we repair the polarization in this country? And at the time, he responded in a really un-newsworthy way. It was, I don't know, I don't know, that's not really our role. So, we didn't publish that audio.

So, this is this is a matter that I'm deeply concerned about.

Maybe it has kind of started in the early 70s, but it has been consistent since 78.It has really been a competitive contest since 1997 when Major League Eating first sponsored it. And that's when we really started seeing the crowds and those competitive eaters. You know, sometimes 40,000 plus people turn out to watch this thing.
