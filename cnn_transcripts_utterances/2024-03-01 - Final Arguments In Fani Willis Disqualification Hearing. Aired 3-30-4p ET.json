He was asked to take -- or he was asked to fill the position that Mr. Wade is currently in, which is the lead prosecutor.It was said in that way as well, as it relates to the testimony of Mr. Barnes, so I think it would be very clear. My recollection is that he said lead, but what I can submit to the court that I know he also said that he was asked to fill the position that Mr. Wade is currently filling for the state of Georgia, which is the lead prosecutor.",

He said he had mouths to feed at his law firm, and that he also didn't want to live the rest of his life with bodyguards, because he had lived that for the years in which he was the governor of Georgia. Furthermore, he confirmed the qualifications of Mr. Wade, which I still find it quite interesting and confusing as to attacking Mr. Wade's qualifications. In that, it's almost as if Mr. Roman's counsel is asking that the state put a prosecutor on the case that she sees to be more qualified to attempt to convict her client. It's an interesting argument, and it's one that makes no sense. Furthermore, if you were to believe the claims and allegations as it relates to Ms. Willis' personal stake in the prosecution, the receiving of financial benefits and gains, then you'd have to believe that she was also dating Roy Barnes, the former governor, and Gabe Banks, in addition to Mr. Wade, if she has this grand plan scheme in order to profit off of the prosecution of this case. Because that's what they're saying. Or they're saying that she telepathically or prophetically was able to know that Mr. Barnes and Mr. Banks would turn down the position so she could then hire Mr. Wade. It's ridiculous, it's absurd, and it's desperate. It's a desperate attempt to remove a prosecutor from a case for absolutely no reason, Your Honor, other than harassment and embarrassment. This slide, and we've been through a lot of the testimony.",

We use them routinely, but we use them with an expert, and they're always challenged.",

They were not -- it's clear from the state's review that the normal practices that are used to check the use of which kind of data is being used.In reference to the two specific dates, I believe it's September 10th and 11th, and November 29th and 30th. The affidavit that is used to say that Mr. Wade remains at Ms. Willis' -- or in the area of Hapeville. because again, during the hearing, the address for the Yeartie condo never came out. It was just that it was the Hapeville condo. The actual phone number for Mr. Wade was never established. And the documents that were provided to the state that were certified business records did not have a subscriber page. So we have no idea that the number belongs to Mr. Wade. Now I understand your Honor wants to look past the foundational issues, and I can appreciate that. But the foundational stuff is very important as it relates to the admissibility of the records.",

      "speaker": "ABBATE",
      "sentences": "Yes, I do, and I will skip forward. So I don't -- so what's interesting is that the records that were provided were for -- they start in January of 2021, and they go, I believe it's to November 30th, I think is what the, of 2021, the span of the records. And you heard from all of the witnesses, including Ms. Yeartie -- that Ms. Willis did not move into the Hapeville address until April of 2021. That was the testimony from all of the witnesses. April of 2021.And that she lived in her South Fulton home from when she met Mr. Wade in October of 2019, up until when she had to move. And the assertion by defense counsel is that Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis began a relationship right after they met in October of 2019. What's interesting and what's telling is that Mr. Wade's handset doesn't once appear in anywhere near the area of her South Fulton home. But they're dating, but they're in a serious relationship. And if you were to believe what the defense counsel says that they have been in a relationship from October of 2019 up until she moves in April of 2021, so a year and a half or so. But he never once enters the area of her home. They want you to believe that that's a lie, which is why counsel for defense continued to press District Attorney Willis and Mr. Wade as to whether he had ever been to that South Fulton home. Well, this corroborates that that was not a lie, that he had never been to that home. And it's more than suspect if you've been in a relationship, as they claim, for all this time, but never once went to the house. So I think that's telling. What I would also bring to the court's attention in the state's initial review of the records, that from January of 2021 to March of 2021, those times when Ms. Willis did not live, again, at the Hapeville Address, she didn't move there until April of 2021, that his handset appears in that area 23 times.",
