So, he -- this is -- this is a -- doors he will be walking through more multiple times.ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR (voiceover): And, Karen, all the people in this hallway at this point.

There will be at least two tables, one for the prosecutors and their staff, and then one for Mr. Trump and his lawyers. There will also be room for the Secret Service. And the court officers and the court clerks will be -- there will be a court clerk who will be sitting behind a desk and that is the person who will arraign Mr. Trump and he will -- he will be given an indictment number. So, they will say calling docket -- or I'm sorry, indictment number 12345, which will be calendar number one today on the calendar. The people of the state of New York versus Donald J. Trump. And the clerk will read him the indictment -- the charges, he will arraign him on the charges, and ask him, Mr. Trump, how do you plead and he says guilty or not guilty. He said he will plead not guilty. And the next thing that happens is the judge asks the prosecutor whether they have anything they want to file with the defendant and serve on the court. Those could be oral notifications that they file or written filings that they can do. And is there any other -- is there any other information that the prosecution wants to give? They also give it to the defense attorney. And then they pick a date for -- you know, for motion practice. And the case gets adjourned for motions. And motions are the time when his lawyers would make the arguments, raised the arguments of things like the statute of limitations has passed, or as Adam Kaufmann was just saying that the federal charges that bumped this from a misdemeanor falsifying business records to a felony aren't the appropriate charges to be relied upon. Or also in the state, you can challenge the grand jury minutes, which is something federally isn't typically done. So, there are several motions that his lawyers might choose to make.",

And I assure you, Alvin Bragg understands just how much attention will be on this case.And this is the debut. This is when we in the public get and scrutinize their case. And so, if I'm in that position, I'm putting in as much evidence and as much detail as I can. And another thing I'm doing is trying to refer to specific pieces of evidence. For example, if there are important quotes, in texts, in e- mails, and documents, I would put that in that indictment so that we in the public and the media can see that. And so, again, this could be quite a lengthy document. We -- Alyssa knows Donald Trump better than any of us. I mean, if he's being read page upon page of accusation against him, I'm not sure he's the type of guy who would just sit there and nod and say, let's get this over with.

You don't -- if it's not in there, the defense attorney could make the argument that this is -- this is a prior bad act. This is an uncharged bad act. And so, it's overly -- its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.And so, you want to put it in there to make sure that you can get that evidence in at trial. If there -- if Adam's right and there is no conspiracy because there's no object crime -- there's no crime that they agreed to commit that counts. Although I think there is -- if Adam's right, I think that the district attorney will also file a statement of facts in this case so that the DA's office, unlike Donald Trump is really bound by what they can talk about. All your -- all your speaking should be done in court and it has to be about things that have been done on the record. It's actually inappropriate for them to -- and it can be an ethical violation to talk about a case and to talk about something that is not in the court record. And so, I think the DA's office will want to put as much as possible into the record so that it can be -- they can talk about it publicly. And so, I think if we don't have a speaking indictment, per se, with a conspiracy charge, we will at least have a statement of fact filed with this indictment.",

But in long-term investigations, where you're in the grand jury and the indictment comes first, the law actually makes -- has that indictment. That's called an NA indictment or a no-arrest indictment. And the law provides that that indictment is sealed until the arraignment and until it's an -- or unsealed by a judge.So, that's why this particular indictment is unsealed but others might not be before the Supreme Court arraignment. And Supreme Court, by the way, is the lower trial court in New York State. It's the lowest-level trial court. It's not an appellate court. So, this is where they are right now. They are in the Manhattan criminal court building. It's the name of the building. And in the criminal court building, you hear both felonies and misdemeanors. And the felonies are heard in Manhattan Supreme Court. And that's where they are right now. ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (voiceover): And this is presumably the first time that the former president is you know, reading the indictment and actually seeing what the grand jury had voted on. And I have to imagine having briefed him previously, whether it was you know, news outlets reporting allegations or legal documents that we've received, he's somebody who's going to want to go through all of it. He's somebody who's going to want to push back and explain to his lawyers how he wants to respond to it, even though that's not part of this specific process. So, this could go on for an amount of time knowing that Donald Trump is going to want to go through each of these allegations and be prompt with his attorneys.",

That's not in the indictment. That hasn't been said in court. Now, prosecutors know how to do this. Prosecutors are aware of that restriction. And so sometimes, we will put more detail in an indictment for specifically this purpose. But I think that all indications are that there will be quite a bit of detail in this document. And that's why 2:15 is already not holding and it may be a bit. VAN JONES, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voiceover): I'm very curious to see how Alvin Bragg acquits himself. He's been talked about.

He's very effective in court, I think we'll see he's very effective behind the podium. He's determined, and he has a backbone. But he does not fit the stereotype of the prosecutor in a lot of ways. He is not a fire-breather. He's careful, he's deliberate, and he's modest. And I think we'll see that when he -- when he -- when he takes the podium in an hour or maybe a little more than that.",

Not to seek bail in cases. And a bail reform law was on the books that was new at the same time. So, he kind of made his entrance saying, not -- here's all the things I'm going to go after but here's all the things we're not going to do. And by doing that, I think what he was saying was, I am going to be a leader in criminal justice reform in New York City. This put him on the bad side of many police officers, some other prosecutors, a lot of politicians. So, he's stirred up a hornet's nest. This case is on the far other side of that -- of that universe, which is it's a white-collar crime.
