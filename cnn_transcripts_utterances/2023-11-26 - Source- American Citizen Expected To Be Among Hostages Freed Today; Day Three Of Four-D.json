Thank you for joining us.We're starting this morning in Israel and Gaza where a third group of hostages is due to be freed this morning. And we're now three days into this fragile truce between Hamas and Israel. We've just learned this, from an Israeli official, that an American citizen, one American citizen, will be among those released today. Thirteen Israelis, four Thai nationals were released yesterday, but only after an hour's long delay threatened to upend the exchange. The freed Israelis range and age from 67 all the way down to 3 years old.",

We're learning that for the first time since this temporary truce between Israel and Hamas began that an American citizen is expected to be on the list of the third group of hostages that are set to be released today.Obviously, something that comes with a lot of caveats given it hasn't happened yet. Yesterday, we saw that there were hours of delays before that second group of hostages were actually handed over by Hamas over their complaints that an enough aid was not going into Gaza and Israeli complaints that it wasn't the exact number of hostages they were believed were going to be on that list that were ultimately produced by Hamas. But what we are learning is something that the White House had been anticipating for some time. What we do know is there is at least one American on this list. We don't know how many in total could potentially be on today's list. The White House has been anticipating that up to three Americans would fall into this category of women and children who are eligible to be in this group of 50 hostages that are set to be released as this four- day truce is going on. And so this will obviously be welcome news for these White House officials that we are still waiting to see once this exchange actually happens and tracking to make sure that it goes forward. Based on what we've heard so far, it does appear that they are on track to have this third set of hostages exchanged from Hamas today released, of course, here to Israel and that in exchange for those Palestinian prisoners who are also set to be released after the hostages have been turned over by Hamas. We are obviously still waiting to watch all of this very closely. I want to bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann. Because obviously, Oren, yesterday, we saw -- I mean hours of delays in this as it was potentially not clear that that deal was actually going to continue to go forward. What are we expecting today now that we do know Israeli officials have this list of the third group of hostages?",

It means the whole thing could fall apart, which means we see the truce fall apart, humanitarian aid that's so desperately needed in Gaza. And then, of course, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners that too falls apart.But the country stepped in, the U.S. stepped in and we're able to keep this moving forward. As of right now, and that's the key caveat here. As of right now, it looks like we are on pace for hostage released later today. But then again 24 hours ago, we thought we were on pace for hostage release as we saw it earlier yesterday. So it shows you how fragile this entire process is and how much care is going into trying to make sure it keeps moving forward because of how critical it is for all the parties involved and that's not just Israel and Hamas, that's the U.S. that's Qatar, Egypt and others as well.",

Their condition appears to be pretty good from what we're hearing from the hospitals. The biggest physical issue we're hearing is malnutrition. They didn't get a lot of food.

The other major part of this truce that has been struck that nearly potentially derailed it yesterday was the aid factor. There's a surge in humanitarian aid going into Gaza. Hamas, yesterday, disputing whether or not enough of that aid was going into Gaza. They waited to release the hostages until more trucks had made it through that Rafah Crossing. Not just into Gaza, but into northern Gaza, where, of course, we've seen the worst of the destruction. CNN's Larry Madowo is in Cairo tracking all of this. And, Larry, obviously, this was a key sticking point in the release of these hostages yesterday. So we're keeping a close eye on it today. But we've heard from, you know, humanitarian officials that they say, you know, they delivered more aid into Gaza that they have since October 7th happened. What are we seeing as of right now?",

The largest convoys on Friday, the largest convoys on Saturday and now aid coming in to northern Gaza.But after Hamas delayed the release of hostages wanting more aid, I think, a lot of attention will be on, can many trucks get in? Is it a faster processing? And then going to get distributed. Because we have seen people queuing up for hours trying to get fuel, trying to get cooking gas, trying to get something. There's a scramble sometimes as the trucks make their way across this roadways into the resettlement camps, into IDP camps, just because people have had lots so much. There's 1.7 million people displaced and there's not enough aid coming in, Kaitlan. COLLINS: Yes. And to finally see what they have gone for so long without these basic supplies, clean drinking water, fuel to cook. We'll continue to check in with you, Larry Madowo, given what a sticking point this was yesterday. Larry Madowo at Cairo. Joining me now for analysis, former state department Middle East negotiator, Aaron David Miller. And I'm so glad that you are with me today, Aaron, because obviously this is a really sensitive truth that we are navigating here between Israel and Hamas. We saw just how sensitive it was yesterday when it came close to, according to some Israeli officials, being derailed. You saw the president had to get involved calling the Amir of Qatar. Now that we are on day three, I mean, what did you pick up from how Hamas was handling that yesterday, how they were purposefully delaying the release of these exchanges and essentially using it to enforce this agreement?",

Hamas may also not have control of all the Americans. So we really don't know. It's really opaque. But I think the broader game here is absolutely clear. Hamas' trading hostages dribbling them out over time in order to gain time in hopes. And you're there. You know what pressure is building in the current Israeli government from the families. The more hostages are released, the more those who are not released are going to become pressure points in order to push the government of Israel to delay, constrain its looming ground campaign in southern Gaza. Add to that what I think will be a growing divergence between the United States and Israel on the issue of how the Israelis may operate in the South. And the Israelis really face a cruel dilemma.

But I'll point out one more thing, there's reportedly a six-page document, which lays out in some detail exactly what each side has agreed to. And I'm just wondering that document has not appeared, maybe for obvious reasons. And I'm reminded and equipped by the Hollywood mogul, Samuel Goldwyn and Mayer, who said that an oral agreement isn't worth the paper it's written on. Remember, you're dealing with two parties who aren't negotiating directly, not only is there no trust, but it may well be in a few days that Hamas and Israel will be back to trying to kill one another.

And remember, they're under huge pressure at home and from the international community as the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza worsens to figure out a way to deal with that. I think they also see it as a transition to try to figure out a way to get to a ceasefire. That's a stretch right now.

They advised the children not to be touched without asking their permission. That they should not be overwhelmed with questions or a lot of words.

SALTZ: It's really important -- actually, not only for children, but to some degree for the adults as well. The people -- the children who are most at risk of these issues that I spoke about earlier, it is important to let them move at their own trajectory so that you can essentially re-traumatize them. That's why it's important for media to stay away. For them to be able to tell their story or play their story. When they are ready, as opposed to having it imposed upon them, which can essentially retraumatize them by forcing them to tell you what happened. So, letting them do it at their own time. You don't know. Of course, we don't know, right? Have they been touched while in captivity? Have they been threatened in some way that they felt fearful so much of the time? And again, you don't want to retraumatize them in any sort of way. So, letting them move at their own pace, letting them come to you, letting them tell their story or play their story when they're ready. All these things will be very important. To some degree, that's important for adults as well. It is important for them to be able to relay what happened to them. But only when they feel ready. So, we've learned that sort of compelling a person or a child to tell it, is actually turns out to backfire essentially and make it worse for them. That's why they're saying these things. And we don't know really what happened yet to them while they were away. And we also don't know what happened to them during the kidnapping process.

One thing that is concerning is helping children and adults for that matter, with basically survivor's guilt.
