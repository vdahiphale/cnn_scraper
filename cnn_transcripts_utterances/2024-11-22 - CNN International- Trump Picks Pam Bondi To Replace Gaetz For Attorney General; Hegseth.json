But, on this very busy Friday, we also have some breaking news at the top of the hour here regarding Donald Trump's hush money case. The judge in that case, Judge Juan Merchan, has now postponed the sentencing for Donald Trump indefinitely. Merchan granting Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss the case, ordering them to submit paperwork by December 2nd. Prosecutors must respond by December 9th. The judge did agree to hold off on issuing his decision on presidential immunity until after he reviews the filings from both parties. Judge Merchan did not set a new sentencing date, nor make any further comments about the delay. We'll continue to follow any developments there, obviously.Meantime, President-elect Donald Trump not wasting any time when it comes to naming a new pick to run the nation's top law enforcement agency, nominating Pam Bondi to replace Matt Gaetz for U.S. Attorney General. Gaetz withdrew yesterday, saying he was unfairly becoming a distraction. That, of course, amid growing bipartisan pressure on a number of points, including the release of that House Ethics report into allegations of sexual misconduct. Democratic Senator John Fetterman offering this colorful response upon hearing the news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): Holy (BEEP). I didn't see that coming. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Live pictures for you there. Of course, it's going to come down to a numbers game on the Hill. Those cabinet picks must be confirmed by the Senate. Gaetz was facing some headwinds, though, from a number of Republican senators, and that's raising some new questions today about the confirmation chances for some of Donald Trump's other controversial picks. CNN's Alayna Treene and Laura Fox -- Lauren Fox are across all of these developments for us. Alayna, I'm going to start with you. So, not too long, really, just a matter of hours after Gaetz withdrew, initially, we were told he didn't have a backup, and then all of a sudden, there was Pam Bondi, who had been nominated to be the new AG. That seems like a fairly quick shift from there is no one in second place to we have a winner. Walk us through what was happening behind the scenes.",

Even back in 2020 before he had lost the election to Joe Biden, he was already talking about wanting to fire FBI director Christopher Wray, and that still remains true. Now, the question is, who will he replace him with, and who would be also the number two there?Now, there had been some talk of potentially wanting to have someone like Mike Rogers, a former congressman, a former FBI agent, who really could potentially be the right fit for that role, to kind of quell the concerns of people who were worried about people like Matt Gaetz and others who might be too much of a firebrand for Republicans in the Senate. That's where Kash Patel comes in. He is a true Donald Trump lawyer. He is seen as a conservative firebrand. Some people have misgivings about what he could do if in charge of the FBI. But, I will say, we did see this morning that Dan Scavino, one of Donald Trump's longtime aides, runs his social media, but was also recently named as a new incoming Deputy Chief of Staff for Donald Trump, he really, I think, put an end to the talk around Mike Rogers becoming an FBI director. He had said that he had spoken with Donald Trump. I can read this for you. He said he \"Just spoke to President Trump regarding Mike Rogers going to the FBI. It's not happening. In his own words, quote, \"I have never even given it a thought\". Not happening.\" Now, I will say we know from our reporting that Donald Trump had given it a thought. Mike Rogers has been at Mar-a-Lago in recent days, and last week, I know he was there as well. But, there was a much concern among some of the people who really want Donald Trump to kind of disrupt the FBI, who want to get rid of the establishment, who want to have a key figure in there. They didn't like the thought of having Mike Rogers in that role. They want someone like Kash Patel. So, there is some of this contention happening behind the scenes. I do think with Dan Scavino sending that post, I will note, Scavino would not have issued something like that, kind of killing Mike Rogers' chances if Donald Trump was not supportive of that effort. I don't think he is going to have a chance now in a certain role like that. Erica.",

Take a look, hovering right now around $98,000 -- $98,500 or so. The crypto currency has seen astonishing momentum this year, more than doubling in value. In fact, it's up about 45 percent just since Donald Trump's election victory November 5th. The President-elect has promised to make U.S. -- the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet. And this is interesting here too, because that may include his social media platform Truth Social moving into the crypto space. For more now, I'm joined by Matt Egan, who is here with me in New York.

Bitcoin is having a great year, and then the election happened, right? And it really has gone almost straight up since then. You see on that chart, up more than 40 percent since Election Day. Investors were betting that the President-elect is going to be much friendlier to crypto currencies than the Biden administration. It's sort of ironic, because not that long ago, Trump was bashing Bitcoin, and back in 2019, he said it was based on thin air. Even as recently as three years ago, he called it a scam against the dollar.But, like some on Wall Street, Trump has turned around, and he has s really embraced crypto. He has made a series of promises, including to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet, to create a national Bitcoin stockpile and to replace one of the biggest enemies of the crypto industry. That's SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Just yesterday, Gensler announced that he will be stepping down on Inauguration Day. That's not a big surprise. There is a tradition for the SEC Chair to step aside when there is a change in power. But, Erica, this is another reminder that very soon Trump is going to be in a position where he can install his own regulators, and they will likely be much friendlier to the crypto industry.",

This indicates that they're exploring potentially getting into cryptocurrency payment processing, digital wallet, digital asset management, digital asset trading. Now, we don't know yet if Trump Media is going to actually get into crypto, but this certainly indicates that they're at least thinking about it.And to your point. Erica, this is also another reminder of the thorny conflict of interest issues that are being raised by this election and Trump's sprawling business empire, because he is going to be in a position where he is installing regulators and presiding over a government that is making decisions that could impact his own financial interest. I talked to former George W. Bush ethics lawyer Richard Painter, and he told me, presidents are not criminally liable when it comes to conflict of interest, but he said that there is obviously an appearance and an ethical issue here, and he suggested that President Trump ought to do what every other President has done, divest personal assets, Trump Organization assets, everything that creates a conflict of interest with his official duties, and that includes Truth Social and crypto.

Of course, this is a weapon that the Russians, according to the U.S., have not actually used in combat before. It has not been used outside of testing. But, they also say that the implications of the use of this missile on the war in Ukraine really can't be -- can't be overstated. Essentially, what they're saying is that this is an interesting data point. It is obviously a sign that the Russians are trying to engage in nuclear saber rattling here, because, as Nick said, this is a weapon that was designed really to carry multiple nuclear warheads. This one did not. It carried conventional warheads.But, ultimately, the U.S. does believe that they only have a few of these in their arsenal at the moment, and that Ukraine has actually withstood missile attacks from missiles with far larger payloads than what that missile had yesterday. So, this is a concerning development, of course, and something that the U.S. is watching and analyzing very closely, particularly as it relates to how if things escalated even further, a missile like that could be used against NATO, against those eastern flank NATO countries, but they are not overly kind of reacting to this at this point. They also say that, look, I mean, the Ukrainians have been able to withstand far worse at this point. Now, when it comes to the North Koreans, obviously, that is the main reason why President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use these long-range missiles inside Russia proper. But, you can see that this is all kind of escalating in a way that the U.S. obviously does not necessarily want to see at this point. Erica.",

The ICC, of course, does not have its own police force. Mr. Netanyahu and Gallant do risk detention, though, if they travel to ICC member states. The Netherlands, Italy, Canada and Spain are among those that said they would comply with the order. Israel's biggest ally and arms supplier, though, is criticizing the court.

So, Nic, as you and I were talking yesterday, there was some initial response, obviously, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. You had been hearing some more from Israelis there on the ground. How have things progressed at this point, 24 hours in to these arrest warrants? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yeah. I think Israeli officials have said what they're going to say on it for the time being. They've been very clear, an absolute, universal denouncement of the ICC's decision, and an articulation very clearly that this is something that undermines the security of Israel, that it's not right indeed antisemitic to claim or essentially they -- officials here say, look, this puts us on the same level as Hamas. That's not right. That's not reasonable, and they're going to ignore it. So, I think the sort of situation in terms of the response here has evolved to that point. I don't think there is any surprise that that's the conclusion that the government would come to. How it affects them? Well, we're seeing some indications of that, because the French yesterday were quite quick to say they would, in fact, arrest the Prime Minister, the former Defense Minister, if they came to France, and send them to the ICC. Now, France was involved as part of the mediation efforts around the ceasefire effort, talks that are going on at the moment between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Israeli officials here have said, well, for that reason, now we're not going to include the French, because we don't think their position is friendly enough towards Israel. In essence, that's what they're saying. We've seen a reaction to the position the Dutch have taken. The Dutch have also said that they would hand over Netanyahu or Gallant to the ICC. The Dutch Foreign Minister was supposed to come here on Monday, and we've heard from the Israeli Foreign Minister now saying, well, that's not going to happen. On the other hand, we've also heard a congratulatory message from the Prime Minister here to the Prime Minister in Hungary, Viktor Orban, saying his principled stance rejecting the ICC is welcomed by Israel. But, by and large, we've heard more responses from European countries. Nuance from Germany. They'll keep supplying weapons. And if the Prime Minister were to announce a visit, then they would decide what they would do. The British saying they would follow international legal obligations. The Italian saying, yes, we would hand over either of these two people to the ICC. But, the Defense Minister in Italy also saying he thinks it was a flawed decision by the ICC, which is what the Austrian Chancellor is saying, a flawed decision by the ICC, and therefore he said Austria wouldn't turn them over. So, we're getting more of this response. Outrageous, is what President Biden said. Yet, just north in Canada, Justin Trudeau said, no, we stand by international law. We would turn them over as well. So, we're beginning to sort of see that picture fill out. But, one thing that emerges very strongly and very clearly, condemnation from with inside Israel and continued strong relationship with the United States.",

She'd spent several days fighting for her life on life support in neighboring Thailand, only to pass away. She'd been traveling with her best friend. The two 19-year-olds had been on a backpacking trip through Asia.What we now understand happened, and this is according to the Associated Press, the two young women were at a hostel in this very popular town with backpackers in Laos when they were given free shots by the hostel owner before heading out to go to bars on the night of drinking. They then spent 24 hours in their rooms before being found and taken to Thailand. Both now confirmed to have died. They're just at the latest. In all, what we understand, Erica, is that six foreign tourists have fallen victim to what is suspected to be methanol poison because, for the time being, no official cause of death has been confirmed by the authorities in Laos. But, we've been hearing from the consulates of some of the countries involved. And we're talking here not just about the two Australian women I mentioned, but a British woman, two Danish nationals, and an American citizen, who have, we understand, died as a result of this suspected methanol poisoning. What it is, is tainted alcohol, essentially, in which this extremely toxic substance is found used instead of ethanol in what you would describe as Moonshine (illegal alcohol), and in this case, an outbreak that has taken six people's lives. We understand from some Western consulates that there are other travelers who may have been affected by this tainted alcohol, and certainly a lot of warnings about the extreme caution that has to be taken whenever anyone is handed a drink that they don't know the provenance of, Erica.

Shameful failure of leadership, absolutely heartless. That's Oxfam and Action Aid weighing in on that. The text is an absolute embarrassment. It's the equivalent of governments handing the keys to the fire truck to the arsonists. That's from an activist group, Oil Change International.Just for context, back in 2009, rich countries agreed to start giving developing world $100 billion a year to help them brace for the impacts of the problem they didn't create. Those payments were supposed to kick in in 2020. They didn't start until 2022. They came to this COP in Azerbaijan, a petro-state, hoping to get $1.3 trillion a year, a big increase, but not nearly enough, given the scope of the global problem right now. And the latest draft language puts the floor of that at $250 billion a year. And so, some like the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in India, one of the spokesman there, says that is -- won't even account for inflation by the time those payments start kicking in, the $250 billion, in 2035. Inflation will have aided away till it means nothing. So, the overall tone of this is just a middle finger to the developing world from those in power. And it's worth noting, the United States, obviously Donald Trump is promising to pull out of this, but Russia is not there. China is playing this as a developing nation, even though they're dominating the world in renewable energy. Just from perspective, China is installing 67 percent of the world's solar and wind energy to date, the United States, seven percent. So, the global dynamics playing out right now is leaving those island nations, those developing countries, already feeling the brunt of this, just holding the bag, and so you can understand just the real politic of this, how it's going to erode trust between even allies.",

CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, skipping what has long been a key part of preparation for confirmation, which is an FBI background check, and making these decisions so quickly may have led to an early constellation that looks more like a reality TV show casting call than serious and credible proposals for cabinet.

Look, we've known for some time that Donald Trump does put a lot of stock in how someone performs on television. He wants someone that he sees as a good communicator who can get his message out there. That being said, there is some criticism that perhaps that is too much of focus. What are you learning?BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL ANALYST, &amp; AUTHOR, \"NETWORK OF LIES\": We're all having to readjust to 2016 and 2017, because this former President, current President-elect is a product of TV, the creature of TV. He thinks like a producer. He monitors TV all day long. And that's exactly how it was four or five, six years ago. With Biden in office, things kind of reverted to a norm in American politics, and now we're having to get back to use to this new normal again, which is a President-elect who hires from Fox News, who hires from right-wing media, who stocked his cabinet with made for TV picks. And -- so, on one level, like it makes all the sense in the world, Erica. He wants these candidates to be camera ready. He wants them to be spokespeople for the agencies. And there is some logic to that. One of the critiques of the Biden years is that Biden put people in charge who knew what they were doing, who were very effective, who achieved a lot, but didn't communicate it as well and did not message it very well to the American people. Clearly, a lot of Americans didn't buy what the Biden administration was selling. So, there is some logic in hiring television stars in the cabinet. But, as I said, it's also kind of an adjustment for everybody, including reporters covering this, that we are back in an environment where the President of the United States is going to be watching television and hiring his favorite people right off the tube.",

First, burglars often conducting extensive surveillance, going so far as too often pose as delivery drivers or grounds keepers to get a lay of the land, to determine the comings and goings of residents before actually staging these burglaries. And oftentimes, they'll scale walls in order to try to get to a master bedroom or closets to get money, to get jewelry and the like.

He eventually had federal charges brought against him. But, that didn't affect Ohtani one bit on the field.
