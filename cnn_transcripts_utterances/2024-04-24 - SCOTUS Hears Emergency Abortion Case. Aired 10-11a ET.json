      "sentences": "Yes, they're really deciding whether the federal law preempts this state law that bans most abortions.And this is really the Supreme Court wading back into this abortion issue two years after they overturned Roe v. Wade. We've seen the ramifications across the country. So the arguments are about the federal law and then the state law that the Biden administration argues conflict. The federal government here says, look the federal law should preempt this Idaho law. What the Idaho law is, it's a near-total ban on abortions. It's currently in effect. It makes it a felony to perform or assist in an abortion. The only exceptions are if a woman's life is in danger or if the woman is a victim of rape or incest. So the Biden administration is saying, Idaho, your law conflicts with a federal law. It's known as EMTALA. It was enacted in the 1980s. And what it does, it requires emergency room doctors to step in and to offer some stabilizing treatment when a woman's health is in danger. So even if her injury isn't life threatening, per se, this law says the doctor should offer all necessary treatment. And the federal government is saying that includes abortions. Idaho has come back, saying, wait a minute, there's nothing in this federal law that says anything specifically about abortion. And this law was really only enacted with the intent that emergency doctors would have to treat patients, regardless of whether or not they're able to pay. So in these arguments, that should start any minute now, we will likely hear a lot of talk, maybe boring talk, about the text of this federal statute; you know, the intent of Congress when they passed this law. But the ramifications, when the Supreme Court eventually decides this, likely sometime in June, it could be widespread because there're just about two dozen states that severely now restrict abortion two years after Roe v. Wade was overturned. And if the court were to side with the Biden administration, which is probably unlikely, given the conservative makeup of this court, it really could essentially overturn many of these states' abortion bans in the context of emergency room care. So Erica, there's a lot on the line here because this doesn't only affect Idaho; this could really be widespread in limiting the type of abortion bans that we have seen pop up all over the country in the two years since Roe v. Wade was overturned. It's a bit technical on this issue of whether federal law preempts, overrides state law but it does come down to whether emergency room doctors, when women present to them with not necessarily life threatening injuries but severe injuries nonetheless, whether they can take all the medical necessary steps, including abortion.",

These are abortion rights activists, who have gathered here across the barricades from where we're standing. I don't know if you'll be able to see it. But there are a group of anti-abortion activists as well who have gathered. So there are these dueling programs happening right now, a pretty large crowd as it gets underway. But look, we have already seen a pretty tense clash between the two sides. A couple of anti-abortion activists came over to this side. They were chanting, they were yelling. And they were immediately surrounded by organizers from these various reproductive rights groups who are here today, who tried to block them from being seen by cameras, who were trying to drown them out with their own chants. And then yelling at them. And there was yelling back and forth. A lot of tension. And so it'll be interesting to see how that tension carries over, over the next couple of hours, as this really gets underway. We will see and we'll keep you updated, Erica.",

They feel like they can rule on these things now and it suggests to me that they are likely to continue their restricting of the ways that women can get reproductive health care in this country. I don't know exactly what the reasoning will be or what the vote will be. But the fact that they're doing this on the emergency applications docket, not waiting for the merits, suggests to me that they are likely to side, at least in large part, with the State of Idaho here.",

The federal government has plenty to say about it in this statute. Now you're right. Now there's a question of what's the content of this stabilization requirement. And as far as I understood your opening remarks, you say, well, you this is left to the states. But if I'm just looking at the statute, the statute tells you what the content of the stabilization requirement is. It's to provide such medical treatment as may be necessary to assure within reasonable probability that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to occur if the person were transferred or didn't get care. So it tells you very clearly, it's an object of standard. It's basically -- you know, it's a standard that clearly has reference to accepted medical practice, not just whatever one doctor happens to think. But it's here -- (AUDIO GAP)",

So it's not the case that states have complete freedom to do whatever they want in the healthcare space. So they basically got him to agree to that. And then Justice Kagan starts talking about the content of the law, saying it's actually not at all unclear what the law says stabilizing care means. In fact, right in the statute itself, it talks about what stabilizing care means. It's an objective standard. It has a definition attached. So they're taking him down the path of where he wants to say, well, you have to look to Idaho state law to figure out what stabilizing care means. They're saying no, you don't. You look at the law itself, EMTALA. It tells you what stabilizing care is. And it is a preempting force here. And so you have to go with that. Well, of course, here, other justices, likely the more conservative justices, tried to push a different way to view this case. But this is where Justice Jackson and Justice Kagan are going.

JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Counsel, the problem we're having right now is that you're sort of putting preemption on its head. The whole purpose of preemption is to say that if the state passes a law that violates federal law, the state law is no longer effective. So there is no state licensing law that would permit you, permit the state to say, don't treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills, metformin. And a doctor looks at a juvenile diabetic and says, without insulin, they're going to get seriously I'll. And the likelihood and I don't know what that means under Idaho law, we'll get to that shortly, because I don't know, we believe this is a better treatment. Federal law would say, you can't do that. Medically accepted, objective medically accepted standards of care require the treatment of diabetics with insulin. The medically accepted obligation of doctors when they have women with certain conditions that may not result in death but more than likely will result in very serious medical conditions, including blindness for some, for others the loss of organs, for some, chronic blood strokes. Idaho is saying, unless the doctor can say in good faith that this person's death is likely as opposed to serious illness, they can't perform the abortion. So I don't know your argument about state licensing law because this is what this law does. It tells states, your licensing laws can't take out objective medical conditions that could save a person from serious injury or death.",

Congress discussed that topic in the Affordable Care Act and explicitly said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act shall be construed to relieve any healthcare provider from providing emergency services as required by state or federal law. Medical providers have told us that for decades they have understood both federal law and state law to require abortions as stabilizing conditions for people presenting serious medical risk.

But the stabilization requirement only exists up until transfer, right, until transfer is possible? So it's hard for me to see how, with a mental health condition, that couldn't be stabilized before needing to transfer, right?
