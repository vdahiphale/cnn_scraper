In Ohio, Issue 1 would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution and block six-week bans now being considered by the Ohio Supreme Court. Abortion rights also a huge factor in Virginia where every seat in the state legislature is on the ballot. Democrats and Republicans believe it's possible they could win control of both chambers. It could go either way. And there are two notable governor's races. Popular Kentucky Democrat Andy Beshear hopes to hold onto his job in that deep red state.

In Virginia, for instance, Governor Glenn Youngkin wants to have some kind of record of a pathway for Republicans to address abortion that he can apply to the national level. At the same time, in Ohio, this is something -- this is a red state or a state that's trending red that Democrats are hopeful that discussion of this topic will reverse the trajectory or the lean of the state in the coming weeks and months.

They want something that relieves the pressure on civilians. Prevents civilian casualties. The death toll has now surpassed 10,000. And we heard quite strong language, for instance, from the U.N. Secretary-General describing Gaza now as a graveyard for children. So there's a gap on what kind of pause ceasefire is desired by folks outside this country and the Israeli leadership. But there's also, frankly, a gap on really the way forward on this. Not just the ceasefire but for how long. Whose responsibility it is. And you wonder how you're going to bridge that gap because you also have a gap on what the demand is. Because the Israeli prime minister is demanding the release of all hostages before there's any ceasefire. That just does not seem to be -- while understandably desirable, does not seem to be a realistic option in the short term. The negotiations -- as they were carrying out with Blinken and the Jordanians in Amman, and others -- was, for instance, releasing women and children first as a step forward. It doesn't seem that anyone involved in those negotiations believes that all the hostages will be released in any short time period. So you've got a gap on what kind of pause you're willing to carry out, and you've got a gap on what the demand is prior to any ceasefire like that.",

But they were all holding onto the fact that Aaron Rodgers might triumphantly return from his torn Achilles this season and they're going to go on a playoff run. And A. Rodgers -- he was out there on the field pregame doing some light throwing. And the Jets could have certainly used him.They went three and out to start the game and then Derius Davis returns to punt 87 yards to the house (ph) for the touchdown. That's all the Chargers would actually need on the night because the Jets' offense was just awful. They lost three fumbles. Zach Wilson had two of them, and he was also sacked eight times on the night. The Chargers win 27-6, so both those teams now 4-4 on the season.
