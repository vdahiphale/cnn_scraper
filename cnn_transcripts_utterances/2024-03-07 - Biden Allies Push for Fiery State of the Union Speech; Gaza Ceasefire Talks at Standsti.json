I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Tonight, President Biden will deliver what could be the most consequential speech of his presidency as he looks to sell a second term to the American people and contrast his message with Donald Trump's vision of revenge and retribution. Tonight's high-stakes State of the Union comes as the president trails his GOP rival in a slew of recent polls that indicate some nagging anxieties about Mr. Biden's age. The big question, will the president take some of that uneasiness head on with a fiery performance, leading Democrats say that is long overdue, telling CNN the American people who need to see the real Biden who behind closed doors called Putin a crazy SOB, that's a quote, curses Trump and blasts MAGA Republicans as extremists. And joining me now is Neera Tanden. She is the domestic policy advisor to President Biden. Neera, good morning, happy State of the Union Day. Good to see you as always. Let me ask you. I mean, this is the president's final State of Union speech before this upcoming election. What are we going to see tonight?",

But it continues to be a thorn in the side for many Americans. I'm sure you've seen people putting on social media how much it costs to get a burger at Five Guys and so on and prices are still high.

This administration has been more than anyone in history, any president in history to lower the cost of prescription drugs, $35 insulin, giving Medicare the power to negotiate ten drugs in the first year.And he's going to talk about how he wants to dramatically expand that to 500 drugs over the next decade to lower costs for seniors. But he also is going talk how we need to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 for a prescription. He's going to talk about it. He's going cap costs for health care and prescription drugs, $2,000 for all Americans. And so that's a way in which he is really focused on ensuring that we're lowering costs for All Americans in an area where we know it's high concern. Health care costs have been one of the top concerns of American people, and he'll really outline his agenda there.",

It was also the same day we saw Donald Trump down there at the border. And, I mean, obviously, he's going to want to call some attention to the fact that there was a bipartisan deal sitting in Congress, Republicans in the House and the Senate balked at even though some of their more conservative members negotiated it. Are we going to see the president call out Republicans on that tonight and might we see president talk about taking some executive action on that issue?",

He had a plan with Republicans that was secure, secure the border and also was fair and humane. But it took strong actions and, honestly, was only stopped for politics.And I think the president will really lay out why stopping progress on a real problem for the American people only because of politics is wrong. That's not the way he conducts as presidency, that's not what the American people want and that is also one of the choices we have, whether we are going to put politics above progress.",

And we also know this because Republicans had called for it for years. And when they had a solution on the table, they chose to ignore it only because of politics. So, that doesn't stop us from doing everything we can at the border, but the president has been acting.Now it's time for Congress to act. It's time for Congress to put people and our problems over their petty politics. And that's what the president will talk about tonight.",

When it comes to women's reproductive rights, when it comes to whether we're going to have a strong democracy or really cede to autocratic forces.And I think that really means that he will say, and it will be clear to everyone, why it's important for people to be engaged and why these issues really matter. Because, fundamentally, it's about America's future and Americans' future, and he knows that and has to lay that out tonight.

I think a lot of Americans were probably surprised at what took place down in Alabama, where that option basically was no longer available because of the local politics in that state, stemming from the Dobbs decision, of course, to some extent.Is the president going to address that tonight, this anxiety over IVF being available to Americans?",

We are happy to have a full, robust number of people in the box with the first lady, and one of the people in the box is a woman who really is -- who her life has been upended by what's happened in Alabama. And this is a woman who wants to start a family, desperately wants to get pregnant. And because of the ideological opposition to Roe and the ideological agenda of some people, she no longer has that ability.And there's a lot of chaos in Alabama now. Women are really faced with desperate choices, and that was part and parcel of what taking down Roe meant, and I think the stakes on that issue will be clear as well. A lot of people talked about this before Roe, before the Dobbs decision. A lot of people said the natural challenge, there will be natural impact on IVF, and many of us were poo-pooed when we said that. And I think what the president will say today is this is the kind of fundamental freedom that is at stake right now. We can actually protect women's dignity, we can protect -- we can restore Roe, or we can leave women to the chaos of various state actions to undermine their ability to control their reproductive freedom, and even decide when they can start a family.",

The president has done that. That's a foreign policy issue. I'll defer to my foreign policy colleagues. But most, fundamentally, it's critical that the president understands, and he does, he understands the anxiety and concerns of all Americans about what's happening in Gaza and what's happened with this war.And so he's taken a variety of actions. I'll leave it to my National Security Council colleagues to answer, to discuss those.

But for some there is nothing more to be done. Three-year-old Mila (ph), who had been suffering from acute malnutrition, now another victim of this merciless war. She was healthy, there was nothing wrong with her before, Mila's mother says, then suddenly everything dropped she wasn't anything. We had no milk, no eggs, nothing. She used to eat eggs every day before the war but now we have nothing. Across Gaza too many are feeling the pain of this deepening hunger crisis, small children emaciated and malnourished. These were little Yazan's (ph) final moments. His tiny fingers gripped in his mother's hand. He, like Mila, would not make it. Others are still just barely holding on but there is no telling how long they will survive. Standing beside Mila's body, Dr. Ahmed Salim (ph) says many children at this hospital are now dying due to a lack of food and oxygen supplies. With limited aid getting in, many have grown desperate, searching for food wherever they can. Nine-year-old Muhammad (ph) says he walks for about a mile every day to collect water for his family. You seem sad. Why? This journalist asks him. Because of the war, he says. It is all too much. On Tuesday, U.N. experts accused Israel of intentionally starving the Palestinian people in Gaza, noting that the Israeli military is now targeting both civilians seeking aid and humanitarian convoys. Israel has denied targeting civilians and says that there is, quote, no limit to the amount of humanitarian aid for civilians in the Gaza. But the reality on the ground paints a very different picture. There is no food, no water, no flour, cooking oil or anything, this woman says. Death is better than this. According to a senior UN official, at least a quarter of Gaza's population is now said to be just one step away from famine. With aid agencies facing overwhelming obstacles in getting the bare minimum of supplies into Gaza, and as Israel's ground offensive threatens to push further into the strip's densely populated south, time is quickly running out. While international efforts to airdrop humanitarian supplies have provided some respite, it is simply not enough, with stalling negotiations leaving a little hope for an end to the suffering and hunger of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

Then you have to get to the U.N. security zone where again they will be moved sometimes once again to track. Then those trucks need to be rich in camps, warehouses, kitchens, and what you find sometimes is people in need that they use get all over the trucks and they start getting the food so those trucks are not able to deliver to have a normal functioning of the humanitarian system.Imagine, this only in Rafah. Imagine when you are trying to reach the very north. That's why very often we hear that during days, sometimes weeks, no humanitarian aid reaches the north, that's where you see those images. World Central Kitchen, obviously we have 64 kitchens with community organizations, plus one more on our own. We have a plan to build a total of 100 kitchens all the way to the north. But in order to fulfill all the food needs that those kitchens need to keep making sure that every kitchen needs to have to feed the people surrounding that kitchen, we need a constant flow of food, constant flow of water and this, unfortunately, is not happening.
