It involved at least 21 derailed and overturned train cars, three separate trains that collided on Friday night here, less than 48 hours ago. So, the sheer amount of wreckage here is massive. And the -- I think, what is remarkable is that you have hundreds of workers out here in brutal, ferocious heat. They have heavy equipment, but they're also working by hand, digging, using pick axes and shovels. Even manually tying new railroad rails, huge beams of metal to try to lay them down on the tracks, as the authorities say they want to get this stretch of railroad open again, as early as Wednesday morning. That said the scale of the loss of life, I think, has really stunned people, in a country that depends very much on trains for everyday life. More than 13 million people move around India every day on trains. And that tragically also has a lot of history of deadly accidents on India's railroads. But just to give you a sense here, we're in a rural part of Eastern India, of Odisha state. And the accident took place after sunset on Friday. One of the survivors is a woman whose own daughter died in one of these crowded train cars. Take a listen to what she had to say.

You can't do any of it if you don't win. There is no substitute for victory. And we need to dispense with the culture of losing that has beset the Republican Party in recent years.

First, in Special Counsel Jack Smith's probe into Trump's handling of classified documents. Sources tell CNN that Trump's lawyers were unable to locate a classified Pentagon document about plans for a possible strike on Iran.A document where Trump was recorded on tape claiming was in his possession in 2021. The special counsel subpoenaed Trump for the document in March, not long after one of his aides in that meeting, Margo Martin, appeared before the grand jury. Well, Trump's lawyer provided some documents in response to the subpoena, they could not locate the classified document that Trump was referring to on tape. It's unclear whether if that document had already been returned to have the government, if it's still missing, or whether it was even in Trump's possession in 2021. Importantly, though, Trump on the tape appears to acknowledge that the document was still classified. Now, in Georgia, the Fulton County district attorney is seeking information from two firms hired by the Trump campaign tasked with investigating claims of voter fraud after the 2020 election. Both of those firms found allegations of voter fraud to be false or offered information to the Trump campaign that refuted Trump's claims of election fraud. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. Her efforts to obtain information from these research firms comes as she is eyeing potential racketeering charges in her investigation. The firms could help establish a pattern of failed attempts by the Trump campaign to find voter fraud after the 2020 election. Willis is expected to announce in August whether anyone will face charges as part of her investigation. CNN, Jeremy Herb, New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What we understand is early this morning, after two Israeli soldiers who were manning a rather desolate outpost along the border, when they didn't respond to a check-in, other soldiers went to check on them, that's when they found their bodies. And then in ensuing manhunt is when more soldiers encountered this Egyptian security officer, engaged in a gunfight, and both the Egyptian security officer and another, a third Israeli soldier were killed in that incident. Now, Israeli officials believe that this Egyptian security officer breached the border fence. Now, we do have an image of that border fence. You can see, and this is being explained in Israeli media, this is an emergency small opening that's used sometimes when needed to cross from one to the other. And Israeli media is saying that it was just secured with zip ties, which means that the security officer may be cut it with some sort of knife or something to cross over. Now, the Egyptian military is saying that this officer was chasing drug smuggling agents. Saying that he breached the security barrier and exchanged fire with Israeli security personnel. Another thing we're learning from the IDF is that those two -- first two soldiers who were killed, they did not fire their weapons, which means that, essentially, they did not engage in any sort of gunfight with the security officer. This is still being investigated exactly what happened because as we're hearing from the Egyptians, they say that their officer was chasing drug smuggling agents, but we haven't heard about any other officers that were with them. There were drug smugglers caught or drug smuggling stopped a few hours before, but it's still being seen as a very unusual and isolated incident. And there's very clear indication from officials from both Egypt and Israel that there is no desire to turn this into anything bigger than a potentially isolated and very unusual incident. The Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant has already spoken with the Egyptian minister of defense. We've also heard from the IDF's chief spokesperson, who says this is a very unusual incident that does not represent the relationship and joint action between the militaries. Egypt and Israel often coordinate and cooperate on security in the area. But Paula, this is also an indication, and it's being portrayed as this, in Israeli media, as a major failure by the Israeli military. How did they not notice somebody crossing the border and those two soldiers in that outpost they should be -- they should have been checked in on once an hour, that was not done. Paula.",

Yevgeny Prigozhin took aim at the factions inside the Kremlin which he accused of destroying the Russian state. He also railed against the current state of the war, blaming Russia's defense minister and the chief of the general staff.Prigozhin said that if defense officials don't stop the incursions in Russia's Belgorod region, Wagner units will go there unilaterally to, \"Protect our people.\" The Wagner Group has been fighting for Russia for years, most recently during the months-long campaign to take Bakhmut. By Yevgeny Brogozhin -- by Yevgeny Prigozhin's own admission, pardon me, his mercenaries have suffered heavy losses there. CNN's Melissa Bell has more now on the man who seems to have free rein to criticize other members of Putin's inner circle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  For months now, Yevgeny Prigozhin has been leading the charge in Ukraine and stealing the limelight. YEVGENY PRIGHOZIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator):  Guys, don't bully the Russian military. BELL (voiceover):  The taunt, typical, as he announced the withdrawal of his Wagner mercenaries last week after claiming the first Russian advance in Ukraine in months. Power on the ground that has translated into far more open political confrontation with Moscow. Long-known by his nickname as Putin's chef, the oligarch shared the Russian president's humble beginnings in the tougher neighborhoods of St. Petersburg. Reportedly a former convict, he used Putin's rise to build a vast catering empire. As Putin set his sights on Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, Prigozhin's forces were there. The Wagner Mercenary Group that he founded became known as Putin's private army, operating on his behalf, but in the shadows across the Middle East and Africa for years.",

California Governor Gavin Newsom says they were transported from Texas to New Mexico before being flown to the California state capital where they were left at the door of a local church. California's attorney general said the migrants had documentation purporting to be from the Florida state government.Now, in Florida, meantime, this week, Thursday was dubbed a day without immigrants. Activists and migrant workers held protests against the state's new immigration law which goes into effect July 1st. It limits social services for undocumented migrants and expands verification requirements for employers. Governor Ron DeSantis called it the most ambitious such legislation in the country. Some farmers though are concerned the new immigration law could lead to a shortage in workers, especially since they rely on foreign nationals to do agricultural jobs Americans don't want. CNN's Gary Tuchman has their story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GARY TUCHMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  It's 7:30 a.m. in humid north Florida, the beginning of a long day.
