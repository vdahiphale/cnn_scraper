A senior U.S. official says the sanctions were in the works and are now being supplemented in the wake of Alexei Navalny's death. Vladimir Putin met with his defense minister on Tuesday, suggesting Russia should expand on its recent battlefield success after the fall of Avdiivka. And he mocked Ukrainian forces saying they fled the town in chaos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The leadership of the Ukrainian armed forces issued an order to withdraw its armed forces when they were already on the move and leaving the settlement. As I understand, that was done for political reasons in order to cover up the move and give it the appearance of an organized withdrawal. We see and know that was not the case, that it was in fact a runaway in the literal sense of the word. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is, of course, one area where we are watching to see if his death and the emotion around that will galvanize any kind of protest vote.And separately, we have his mother, who has taken on this now public- facing role, releasing a video message on Tuesday calling on President Putin to release her son's body. We now know that she has filed a lawsuit with the city court in Seligard, which is that regional center near the prison where he was being held. According to state media, the complaint is over, quote, \"illegal actions\". But the head of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation said this was because of inaction of the investigative committee, which is, of course, said to be investigating his death. That will be a -- there will be a hearing, according to state media, on March 4th, which will, perhaps in keeping with the total lack of information around Navalny's death, be held behind closed-doors. So, as I said, the family are continuing to push, are keeping up this fight, even as it's now clear that the Russian authorities are willing to keep putting the pressure on them.

Secondly, the charges that have been filed against her under the criminal code for treason, incredibly serious. That is a charge that carries, it was actually upgraded last year from a maximum sentence of 20 years to life in prison, potentially. So, extremely serious. What she's been accused of doing, according to a statement from the FSB, the Russia's Internal Security Service, is basically providing funds to Ukrainian organizations, which were allegedly then used for battlefield equipment. And the second thing, which is particularly notable, is taking part in activities in support of the Kyiv regime, which the charges specify actually happened outside Russia, in the United States. So, I think that tells you the level of scrutiny, the level of oppression where Russian nationals are being scrutinized for actions not only in Russia, but outside of Russia. She has not been granted bail. I think that's a measure of the severity of the charges against her. But, of course, this will be closely watched.

They flew from Vladivostok to Pyongyang on a vintage Russian plane operated by Air Koryo, North Korea's only airline. I've flown it more than a dozen times when Westerners were still allowed in. Diplomacy with the U.S. collapsed in Hanoi in 2019, when observers say Kim made a strategic pivot, bolstering his nuclear arsenal, prioritizing ties with Moscow and Beijing, both protecting Kim from fallout at the United Nations for his unprecedented missile testing binge. Russia is reportedly releasing millions of dollars in frozen North Korean assets, facilitating access to international banking networks. The \"New York Times\" reports, setting the stage for a new chapter of Kim's nuclear ambitions, possibly with the help of Russian rocket scientists.
