He just didn't believe in the banking system. He's the son of immigrants. You never know what might happen was essentially what he said. What he did not get into was the other people in that caption, including his wife. It's not the U.S. v. Robert Menendez. It's v. Robert Menendez, et al, including his wife, who is listed as having done some very damning things with him in that indictment. And he didn't touch on any of that, alleged efforts to pressure prosecutors to go easy on some of his business associates or their employees, efforts to maybe sway who he was nominating to become a U.S. attorney in New Jersey. There's a lot that's discussed there, including those famous gold bullion, those gold bars that literally have the serial numbers of one of the businessmen who are alleged to have bribed this family, the payments that were made to pay for their Mercedes-Benz. He didn't touch on any of that. And he didn't have to, obviously. But I want to hear a whole lot more about that. The general posture of saying, I'm being politically persecuted is one thing, but that's not really what's in the indictment.

He's begging the government to do an unexplained wealth analysis to put up there what he makes as a Senator, what his investments bring in and property he has, et cetera, and then explain how he has that kind of cash just sitting around the house. But Errol is right. If it were just the cash and you didn't have the treasure trove of text messages and e-mails and the Mercedes-Benz and the no-show job and the bank account they set up to take that money, maybe you get somewhere.

They bought the Mercedes-Benz for them, effectively. And then as soon as they got a visit from authorities and they knew that they were under investigation, they tried to paper it over and say, oh, it's just a loan. We're going to pay you back for that Mercedes. So, they just have so much evidence this time, and it's without the muddying of what happened last time, which was that the person bribing Menendez last time was actually a close personal friend of his with a preexisting relationship, which I think the jury kind of confused, was he doing what he did for him because of the friendship or because of the bribes?

That has been a demand of the far right. And the hope is that that will build some goodwill with those conservative hard-liners and that they eventually will rally around a short-term conservative plan to keep the government open. But there are a couple hurdles with that plan. First of all, it's unclear whether Republicans even have the support to pass either long- term or short-term spending bills. And, second of all, even if they do, those bills are dead on arrival in the Senate. And, meanwhile, now you have former President Donald Trump openly calling on Republicans to shut down the government if they don't get everything they want.
