I'm Kim Brunhuber.It's Thursday, March 28th, 4 a.m. in Baltimore, Maryland, where investigators will be back at work today analyzing the voyage data recorder and interviewing the crew of the container ship Dali. It crashed into the Key Bridge early Tuesday, causing it to collapse. The bodies of two construction workers have been recovered. Four others are missing and presumed dead. Investigators say the Dali was carrying 56 containers of hazardous material. Some were breached in the collision. Others fell into the harbor. They also say the bridge, built in the 1970s, was in satisfactory condition when it was inspected in May of last year. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER HOMENDY, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD CHAIR: It's just utter devastation. And when I look at something like that, I am thinking not about the container ships that are coming through, not about traffic getting back up and running on the bridge. I'm thinking about the families who've lost loved ones and the families who are waiting to reunite with loved ones and what they must be going through. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The officials say Israel is returning fire amid increased activity on the border. On Wednesday, at least 16 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on several villages in southern Lebanon.The Israel Defense Forces says its fighter jets targeted terrorist cells in those areas. Hezbollah says it responded to the initial Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon by launching dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Israeli officials say most of the rockets were intercepted, but at least one person was killed in that attack. Meanwhile, in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Palestinian health officials say at least 11 people were killed in Israeli strikes. Officials at one hospital say those strikes hit a home where families were sheltering and say an 11-year-old child was among the dead. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reports that residential buildings in other parts of Rafah were also targeted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country has no choice but to move into Rafah as its, quote, very existence is on the line. Now those comments came as he hosted a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Jerusalem. He claims victory in Gaza could come soon. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But when you hear the comments from the Israeli prime minister, I don't think he really understands the damage, the destruction, the death that Israel has wrought upon Gaza. We are now on the 174th day of this war. The death toll is at least, at least 32,500. Nonetheless, the Israeli leader seems to think that they can avoid further massive casualties if they do launch into this offensive in the city of Rafah, where there are more than a million and a half people who have taken refuge. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is very difficult to move around Gaza.In fact, people who have tried to move back north to their homes in Gaza City, for instance, have come under fire. Therefore, and there already is a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Whether they go ahead with this operation in Rafah or not. So it appears that the Israeli Prime Minister seems to be utterly indifferent to the situation, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, as he pursues this war that doesn't seem to have an end and where, despite what he says, victory is not in sight for the Israelis.",

Now, certainly since the 8th of October, there have been almost daily exchanges between Hezbollah and other militants and Israel along the border between the two countries. We've seen, according to Lebanese official statistics, at least 90,000people have fled the south of Lebanon and a similar number of Israelis have fled the area along the border as well. Now, there was a brief period at the end of November when the guns went silent. There were no rockets fired. And that was when there was a brief truce in Gaza. Hezbollah has made it clear that if there is a truce in Gaza, it will also fall silent. It will stop firing into Israel. But it doesn't appear that a ceasefire is in the offing at this point. We're hearing that discussions are ongoing, but no progress is being made. So this danger of a widening of the war is still very much there. Now, it's questionable whether Israel can handle a two-front war, one in Gaza and one with Hezbollah, considering that Hezbollah is considered to be militarily far more capable, far better armed, far better trained than Hamas in Gaza. So this idea of copying and pasting the experience of Gaza onto Lebanon is worrying if you're Lebanese, but questionable if Israel would be willing to do it. And if, for instance, the United States, which is such a great backer of Israel, would like its name on a repeat of Gaza being imposed upon Lebanon -- Kim.",
