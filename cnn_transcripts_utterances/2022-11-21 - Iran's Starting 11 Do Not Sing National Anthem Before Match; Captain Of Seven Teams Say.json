A citybuzzing with the excitement of hosting the biggest sports show in the world. The 2022 FIFA World Cup. We are here all this week bringing you the ups and downs on the pitch, as well as all the drama off the pitch. Day one here in Doha has already seen its share of competition, controversy and symbolism. England taking on Iran right now. It's just one of three games today on this first full day of competition. A moving moment before that match, Iran's starting 11 remained silent during their country's national anthem. It was an apparent show of solidarity with protesters back home. And seven European club captains say they will not wear the one love armbands designed to show diversity and inclusion after learning they could be sanctioned for doing so. Although FIFA has said all 30 captains will have the chance to wear the armbands during the event. Well, CNN Sports Anchor Amanda Davies is with me now. First day of the World Cup always full of drama, never short of controversy and has to be said not least this Qatar 2022. Let's talk about the football first though. Big game going on. England versus Iran. It has to be said England or out of the gate here, aren't they?",

As you mentioned, group B has kicked off. England's against Iran. There weren't too many high hopes behind England's heading into this one after six games without a victory despite that semifinal in Russia in 2018. And then the final in the European Championships. It was almost their former dipped on the wrong time. But they are out here. And they are certainly putting on a show. A six-one in the 92nd minute with 10 minutes of time added on against Iran. And so many of the players who has such a tough time, they've been subjected to so much of that social media abuse after missing the penalties at the European Championships. The likes of Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, they're both on the score sheets and really the youngsters putting on a show but you have to feel for Iran because they've had so much going on in the background and at home in the run out today.",

Not kilometers, but just meters away. And so it's obviously very, very dangerous situation. And so far, I guess that they've been lucky because there hasn't been any leak of radiation. There hasn't been any serious damage done to the critical infrastructure to keep that power plant safe. But that's just really, you know, coincidental given the extent of the bombardment has been taking place in the region around it is right smack in the middle of the war zone. Now, both sides accuse each other of carrying out the strikes against the power plant. The Russians say it's Ukrainian artillery, the Ukrainian say it's the Russians. The Russians are in charge of that area, they've occupied that area. And so, that's another obviously a bone of contention. But whoever it is the U.N. nuclear watchdog saying that all sides should stand back, they should really take into account the serious consequences of what would happen. What could happen if a shell lands in a critical part of that nuclear power plant. And there's a release of radioactive material and declare the area, you know, kind of a sort of fire free zone.

The atmosphere, though, really subsided in the second half because it was over as a contest. Iran got themselves a couple of constellation goals. But they were well beaten.

She fears for her life. After taking off and burning her headscarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers. They choose the women who were pretty and suited their appetites. Then the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller private room. They would sexually assault them there.
