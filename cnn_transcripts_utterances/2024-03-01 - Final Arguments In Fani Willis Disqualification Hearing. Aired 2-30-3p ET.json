Asking what message he thinks would be sent if they were not disqualified. They, being the district attorney, Fani Willis, and the entire team, Nathan Wade, included.

      "speaker": "SANCHEZ",
      "sentences": "Yes, so initially, a big part of the discussion that we heard from the defense team had to do with the question of whether there was an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of conflict of interest.The defense there, at one point, John Merchant, part of the defense team for Mike Roman, seemed to argue that they didn't need to prove actual conflict, but rather just the appearance of conflict of interests. What did you make of those arguments, of the arguments overall? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, first, on the arguments overall, qualitatively, what a different experience this afternoon has been compared to the sort of meandering, trying to figure out what the theory of the case was going to be earlier. A lot of testimony, a lot of back-and-forth. This was a streamlined approach based on what they would like the judge to know. Now, remember, the most persuasive arguments are based on primacy and recency. The first thing I told you and the last thing I told you. But don't forget everything in between. And they're going to come here at the last part talking about the idea of forensic misconduct. You heard that all day today. What does that mean? Well, there's two primary ways to disqualify somebody. Either you had a financial benefit that makes it such that the defense cannot have an actual fair trial or you have a personal stake in the outcome of the case. They are suggesting that this is a blurred line, on one hand, that she is financially benefitting, that they cannot be considered to be truthful at all, and the judge cannot, what they say, credit their testimony, that they are lying somehow. And therefore, you can't believe anything they have to say. Even going so far as to say they concocted the whole cash theory. We're going to figure out how to make this case go away. Then there's the idea of the personal stake, meaning whatever the outcome of this is, I'm so deeply invested based on my personal or political ambition. But there was this huge moment that I thought was so fascinating. And that was coming from the attorney for Donald Trump, Mr. Sadow. He went right into the idea of the church speech.",

When Fani Willis went to a historically black church and she spoke about and intimated the reason they are focusing on Nathan Wade as but one member of the team as opposed to all others, was because he was a black man.They want to disqualify him. They wanted to undermine his credentials. They wanted to mask him professionally. This was a moment with the actual attorneys took high interest in. They suggest that she tainted the jury pool by making that statement. And they play out the timing of this. Forget their relationship. The timing of when she made these statements. She had not yet responded in her pleadings to the judge to the other filings in the motion. She wanted to have this moment. And the judges -- or the judge is asking the question, is the ethical allegation that you were raising enough to disqualify. They want them to believe it actually is. (CROSSTALK)",

And here was a moment. They've been focusing on a relationship. They want to suggest that they were being cutesy. They were -- it was Wade and Willis who wanted to focus on sexual interactions as distraction to win romance actually began. But remember, this judge asked a really important question. He asked, well, what is the personal interest? That was a first question out of the gate, which made me think to myself, well, if the judge is asking after all your arguments, what is the personal interest, you've got a problem. The second really important one was about immateriality. Remember that point? He said, is there an immateriality requirement? This was the gum part. This was the gum part.",

Materiality goes to the idea of, OK, is what is being exchanged or given enough to disqualify you because the defendant can't have a fair trial. A stick of gum, come on, a coffee, come on.

How can we road trip to Nashville? I know were going to indict the former president of United States and 17 other people. That's what they're trying to suggest. But make no mistake.

But, Harry, quickly, your impressions of these arguments from the defense? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes. They are just very long on accusations of romantic activity, but very short on what they need, either financial conflict of interests. It's an interesting point that Laura just raised about this $100. But that's not the same as what you need to say there's a bona fide financial conflict of interest and that's why they're doing it. I think Laura's discussion just -- just showed why that's so tenuous. And then otherwise, in some way, what if you don't have confidence in her, Judge, or maybe you don't credit everything she said, that also is not the standard. So I think, basically, they've -- they've been very salacious and tough on Fani Willis, but haven't presented anything to really give McAfee a reason to actually disqualify her, which is a very extreme move obviously.",
