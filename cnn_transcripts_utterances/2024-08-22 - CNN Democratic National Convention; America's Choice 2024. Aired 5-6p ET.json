A source telling us it is done, although she is still perfecting her delivery, and that her main goal tonight is to, they say, let the American people know she will fight for them every day. That's what they want people to take away from this.And they say there will be three major themes in the speech tonight. She's going to tell her personal story, Wolf, of being raised by a single middle class mother. Also plans to contrast her optimistic vision for America with Donald Trump. And then third, she wants to reclaim the banner of patriotism for the Democratic ticket, which is an interesting one, that they want to include that and make that stretch.

That's been about a month or so. And of course, President Joe Biden stepped aside and she immediately vaulted to the top of the ticket. She's been working on this speech in her hotel here in Chicago, working with advisors. But she is going to make the case for who she is. I'm told this is going to be a personal speech, talking about her history as a prosecutor. And you'll remember four years ago when she sought the Democratic presidential nomination, that was a different time, that was controversial. In the party now, she believes that is one of her strong suits, one of her selling points, if you will. So she'll be talking a lot about her time as district attorney of California, as attorney general of California, but also talking in personal connections about her middle class upbringing. We've heard this in speeches that she's been giving, which have been drawing huge crowds across the country about her middle class upbringing, how she remembers when her mom was able to buy her first house. She's going to talk about policies to an extent, but not much at all. And then I'm told she will draw a contrast with former president Donald Trump, and really raise the stakes for the importance of this election. So all week long, this has been her convention. We've heard her biography, really, in every speech along the way here. That is by design. But tonight is an opportunity for her to put a finishing touch on that. And freedom, of course, is her central theme. Wolf, one question, though, hanging over this convention, there's been speculation about that freedom message. Beyonce, of course, is the -- her song, \"Freedom,\" has been the anthem of the Harris candidacy. Will she be in this hall or not? Convention officials are being tight lipped about that. She may not be, but there is anticipation for another special guest here tonight. There's no doubt, this is the vice president's night here. She'll be giving the biggest speech of her life, and then it's off to the races.",

And she told me the story of how many people came up to her in 2016 after the election and said to her, I'm so sorry I didn't go and vote because I thought you had this one. I took it for granted.

Vice President Harris, her turn to make the argument for herself.

And now we get with, you know, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz presidency, the opportunity, especially with Voto Latino, the communities that we reach out to, an immigrant story, a working class story, you know, people who really, truly believe on the issues around affordable housing, LGBTQIA issues, woman's right to choose, like someone who fortifies in this space whenever you look across her track record, as well as his, policy that can actually be put in even with a slim majority. I think people are very, very excited about the possibilities of what we could be voting for versus what we are voting against in this particular election. And, you know, I call this the, you know, unbridled joy-vention (ph), in stark contrast to the Republican con- vention (ph).

People crave the authenticity that Governor Tim Walz and his family is bringing to the ticket. And when they were talking about that, when someone is emotional, he's talking about fertility care, something that millions of Americans use to have families. And it's just weird to me that Republicans are attacking it.But once again, it's backfiring because they're just so out of touch. Young people see that moment, they're like, I can get behind that. That's somebody that resonates with me.",
