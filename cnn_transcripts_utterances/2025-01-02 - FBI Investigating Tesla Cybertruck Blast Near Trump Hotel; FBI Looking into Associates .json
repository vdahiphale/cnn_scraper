And we begin with breaking news in two separate attacks here in the United States on New Year's Day.U.S. President Joe Biden says investigators are looking into whether there is any possible link between a ramming attack that killed dozens of people in New Orleans by a suspect with apparent ties to ISIS, and a Tesla truck explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Multiple law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspects in both incidents had military backgrounds. Now, in New Orleans, police now say 15 people have been killed, more than 30 others injured in the truck ramming attack in the city's historic French Quarter. The FBI says it is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. We do want to warn you much of the video from the scene is graphic. It happened just after 3:00 a.m. local time Wednesday as people were still celebrating the new year on Bourbon Street. Investigators say the suspect plowed through the crowd in a large pickup truck. Video shows the white Ford F-150 making that sharp turn, you see it there, on to Bourbon Street, past police barricades and at least one police cruiser, and on to the sidewalk. The driver continued down the street for several blocks, mowing down dozens of pedestrians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And authorities say the driver rented the cybertruck in Colorado via the Turo app before driving down to Las Vegas. A video released by law enforcement shows explosives that were contained inside the truck, which included fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel, and all of that was connected to a detonation system that was controlled by the driver. And the sheriff pointed out, which is really incredible how the cybertruck actually contained the explosion. The way that it was built forced the explosion to go upwards instead of outwards, which meant that the glass from Trump Tower was not broken, and seven people nearby were injured, but with minor injuries. All of them are OK. They've all been released from the hospital. The driver did die, and Las Vegas police believe that this was an isolated incident. They are not yet willing to say if this was in fact connected to what happened in New Orleans, but it is quite unusual that both the drivers in these incidents rented their cars from Turo. We do have a statement from Turo, and they said they're cooperating with these investigations, but they also said that neither of the drivers had criminal backgrounds, which would have flagged them as security threats.

So the assumption, I think at least the working theory until proven otherwise is either they were working in concert or they were both radicalized to answer the call of jihad, which as law enforcement has put out recently as believers to foment attacks in the United States and Western countries over the New Year's Eve holiday.",

And yes, you can probably do that easily by yourself, but did they? That's the question. So there are many, many ways and many avenues that investigators are going to be able to look at. They're going to look at first communication. Everyone has a cell phone. Everyone has a computer. Unless these were destroyed. Well, in any case, a lot of this stuff is going to be available online through providers. They can get some indication as to who, if anyone, he was in contact with prior to the incidents. Both individuals in fact. So they're going to be looking at that. They're going to look at cameras. They're going to look at the movements of these individuals over the last few months.

You have large vehicles, not just a single patrol car that will block an exit, which in this case, they tried to do. And what did the suspect do? Just drove right around it.And if you look at what is done in New York City, they used garbage trucks, for example, to build barriers that cannot be driven around or through. So they could have done that. And quite frankly, look, the further we get from an incident like this, the less of a concern it is. And, you know, it's -- I guess it's a failing of human nature. But we have to be vigilant 100 percent of the time. You know, any success on their part is a home run. We have to be so much better than they do. We have to prepare every single time, without exception, without any sort of, you know, cutting corners. And unfortunately, I don't know what the decision making process was like in New Orleans, but they certainly could have done a better job. The idea is physical impediment makes something you can't drive around, you can't drive through.

So how significant would it be if authorities actually confirm that the alleged attacker did not act alone? What does that mean for national security going forward? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: It's a big variable. And I think part of the confusion right now about sort of his status, and in fact, the city's status, is it safe to advance, is it safe to have, say, the Sugar Bowl tomorrow night, is what do we mean by his associates? And I think there was honestly some confusion earlier. Did it mean people who had planned with him, who had helped him put out IEDs or helped him, you know, manage and rent and do all the horrible things that he did? Or was it people, say, on social media or others who may have known about the event but were not, you know, sort of, you know, aiding and abetting in the sense of making this more likely? And I think we still don't know the answer to this question. I believe in the last couple hours it is more likely that he is someone who got radicalized. There may have been people online or elsewhere. Maybe he met people abroad who were pushing him, but that he acted alone. And that's why the city sort of is feeling more confident about saying, well, we can move forward, just don't come to this area that had been attacked. It's been a bit confusing over the last couple hours. That's to be understood. But that's a big differential. There were a bunch of people planning a major terrorist attack in a U.S. city.

And those of us who know New Orleans know that Mayor Landrieu several years back, the former mayor, had looked at what was happening in Europe, what had happened in Berlin, what had happened in France, and with these terrorist attacks using vehicles and had put up sort of more security on Bourbon Street, which is really exists, you know, for the party atmosphere. It's a residential area. But for those who have not been there, it's sort of where everyone goes to walk on the streets. And there was a lot of security.

Seven people were injured in the blast, and the body of the driver was found inside the Tesla Cybertruck, along with gas tanks, fuel and a detonation system. Now, the agency believes it was an isolated incident and, at this time, not connected to the deadly incident in New Orleans, where a driver rammed a truck into a crowd during New Year's celebrations. At least 15 people were killed and dozens injured in that attack, which the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism.

If it had continued up into here, there would have been -- I can't imagine the count of people who would have died in that circumstance. It hit that large red cranes type device and stopped. Nonetheless, this is one of the reasons that we need clarity on whether or not people can simply grieve this terrible event and look for answers, or whether they need to be concerned about somebody else being out there. Because look at all the other areas so close by: Jackson Square, Cafe du Monde, right down here. So many people have visited. It's right up in here. So many people have visited that. That's merely blocks away. Preservation Hall, a great tourist attraction. Pat O'Brien's bar. So many young people go to there. Canal Street over here, we mentioned. Huge, a lot of Mardi Gras parades there. They had a parade for the Sugar Bowl in this area just before this all happened. And of course, the Superdome right over here. You could walk from here all the way over here to Jackson Square in 30 minutes, easily, in a very relaxed fashion. And this is a town that has lots and lots of people around it, and they've taken security seriously. They've been aware of threats. There are very serious questions now as to what maybe wasn't done right here. First of all, we have the Sugar Bowl. That's happening right now, 75,000 people may be inside the Superdome, maybe more. Watch parties all over town. Mardi Gras technically starts next Monday with the first parade. That will go on for about two months. About a million people will come to town for that. Jazz fest will get a half million or more in town. That's coming up a little bit later this spring. The Super Bowl in just a little over a month. These are huge events, all of which, if there is a threat out there, are all in a position of having to be concerned about it. And in fact, the NFL put out a tweet saying, \"Deeply saddened by the news of this devastating event in New Orleans. Thoughts are with the victims, the community and all those involved.\" And the NFL and the local host committee have been working collaboratively with local, state and federal agencies the past two years to develop a comprehensive security plan.
