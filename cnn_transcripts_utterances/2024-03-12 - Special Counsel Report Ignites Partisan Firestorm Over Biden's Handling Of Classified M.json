But he's saying, I can see in another year or two, and if this does go to trial, he's going to get older.And this is what a jury is going to perceive, right? In my opinion, as a prosecutor, this is what a jury is going to perceive. And he's shown his work. And this is what I did not move forward for. And he's putting his thinking down, as Paul said, he's giving his reasons. And he showed up today to kind of clear the air, get his reputation straight, because he's not, he's an umpire here. He's not a Republican. He's not a Democrat. He was a great special counsel in this case, calling balls and strikes.",

The Republicans wanted him to say that Biden was guilty and he got off because it's a senile old man that they couldn't convict at trial. Democrats wanted him to say that Biden was completely exonerated by his investigation.So the truth lies somewhere in the middle, which is what the report says. There is evidence suggesting that Biden kept and held improperly held classified information and that he knew he had at least some of it. But it didn't get to the point where he said, I could bring this case and win this case, and so we shouldn't prosecute. And that's where it ended up. That's where the report started out. And so I think Hur did a good job of kind of mostly keeping his cool and just sticking to the four corners of the report, left both sides unhappy, as Paula Reid was saying down in D.C.

      "sentences": "There's something here for everyone. There's something here for Republicans to love and Democrats to hate and vice versa. And I do think it's important to point out two consistent overstatements that I think need to be fact-checked. First of all, Republicans time and again suggested what Biden did and what Trump did, one and the same. How could one be charged and not the other?There are substantial differences, the most glaring one being that Donald Trump obstructed. Joe Biden mostly, not perfectly, but mostly cooperated with the investigation. That's not necessarily determinative, but that's a big factor. But Democrats and the White House, frankly, overshot as well by trying to claim this was a complete exoneration. It was not that. They tried to claim there was no evidence. And it's really important people understand, because I think sort of normal viewers at home may be thinking, well, how could there be evidence but not a charge? There is a broad gulf between the evidence you need to bring a charge as a prosecutor and no evidence whatsoever. And I think Robert Hur has made it very clear there was some evidence. It was substantial. He even said on questioning by Representative Kiley, Robert Hur said that a reasonable juror, could have convicted. So that means there's evidence that a prosecutor could have decided to charge. But in his exercise of discretion, which I think was sound, he decided it was not worth it because he wasn't confident enough. You could go to a jury and get them all unanimously.",

This is about five to seven different sets of classified documents, which made their way through various homes and offices of Joe Biden's in Virginia, in Delaware, in D.C. One of those sets involved handwritten notes. And Robert Hur said, I think, pretty clearly in the report and today that that would be tricky to charge for exactly the reason you say, Anderson. That there is a tradition of people keeping their diaries, keeping their notes. So that's one of the sets where the evidence was weaker.But there's other sets of evidence where the evidence was way stronger. For example, the tape where Joe Biden says in February 2017, I just found all the classified document classified materials downstairs. That relates to marked classified documents about Afghanistan. So, they're not all one in the same. And I think Hur was careful. And you see Democrats cherry picking from the weaker ones. And you see Republicans cherry picking from the stronger ones.",

We conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter. First sentence. And that is repeated throughout the report. Unfortunately, the coverage of this report got muddied, I believe, because of throwing in of information about Mr. Biden being old, a sympathetic man. With a poor memory.

They think, from looking at the transcript, that there's a more nuanced view of President Biden from those five hours over two days last October when he sat down with Rob Hur.But one of the also remarkable things is that you've seen the Justice Department stick by Rob Hur and his findings, everything that he found in here. You know, they defended, certainly, when the White House was trying to push back on some of the language that they find objection to, Jake.",

So those are some of the political battle lines, of course, that we saw sort of a snapshot of during the hearing so far today. That we are certainly going to see continuing to play out as we get closer to November.",

When we come back, we'll talk more about this testimony and hearing today.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER (?): The heard hearing is just resumed. Let's listen in. REP. GLENN IVEY (D- MD): I have to note that there are, I think, over 90 transcripts that are being held by the majority here at the Judiciary Committee and Oversight Committee for interviews that we all care about, they all go directly to issues with respect to the alleged impeachment inquiry. You know, it's kind of the pot calling the kettle black, it seems to me, as an understatement. And I noted, too, that when the ranking member requested the majority release the transcripts, the chairman objected. So, I hope that we can move forward in the mode of cooperation and sharing of information. I think it's just reasonable to do. Mr. Hur, I wanted to thank you, again, for the work you did. I did not agree with everything you wrote in the report, but that's the nature of the business, I think. But I did want to ask you about this. I know you started off with in the first line executive summary, we conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter. And I take it that's still your position today.",
