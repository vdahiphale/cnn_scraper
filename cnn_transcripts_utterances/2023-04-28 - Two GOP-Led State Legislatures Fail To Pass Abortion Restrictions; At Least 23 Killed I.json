In Nebraska, Democrats cheered after blocking a bill that would have restricted abortion after six weeks of pregnancy.

So what then led you to team up with not only the other two women there with you now but also the only other two female state senators, one of whom we should note is a Democrat, the other an independent, to help stop this bill? GUSTAFSON:  Well, first of all, thank you for having us all on your show today. We knew as we discussed with each other that this bill, this house bill would not stand up to scrutiny under our South Carolina Supreme Courts. If it can't go past the courts, then we can't have it implemented. So what good is it? We knew that our Senate bill was the better bill and the one that most of our constituents in South Carolina supports, so we had to move together towards that effort to make sure that this bill did not pass with all the issues and problems and the other one still has a chance to pass.",

They no longer have control over anything. Doctors and women know better about their bodies than 170 legislators in the state of South Carolina.

We had a 12-week abortion bill and they wouldn't let us introduce it. Back to the question you asked me -- yes, I think it will have an effect on us. The people in South Carolina are getting younger. They're moving here from all over the country because South Carolina is a beautiful place to live, and people are moving here. We have jobs. We have all the things people want. So we have a younger population. And people have different values than they had in 1940, and I think it's going to make a difference at the polls.

There's not a career qualification date. Is it when they qualify for the ballot in New Hampshire, or is it when they qualify for the ballot in Florida, or when they're the party's nominee and qualify for the general election ballot.

Now, Democrats are saying this is a provision that helps one person, Ron DeSantis, and they said that, look, if you're the governor of the third largest state, you shouldn't be also going around the entire country trying to become president at the same time.

They'll be talking about this January 6th debacle.

Would the five of us have done that to ourselves? It's quite implausible. And after that, Justice Alito does insinuate that he believes the leaker was likely someone who did not want Roe v. Wade overturned. So, this was all part of an extensive interview Justice Alito to \"The Wall Street Journal\". It was conducted just a few weeks ago, in mid April. Justice Alito also talks about how the leak itself has created this atmosphere of suspicion and distrust at the court that's kind of gone away in recent months, and he talked about how each justice now has 24/7 protection because of the threats they faced. Justice Alito basically saying he's being driven around in a tank now with full security. And Justice Alito really lamented about the attacks on the court's legitimacy. He said this, he said this type of concerted attack on the court and on individual justices is new during my lifetime.
