A major step coming as concerns spike that we will see a massive influx, a bigger one of migrants at the U.S./Mexico border. This, after the Title 42 immigration program ends next week. At the same time, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced they are going to meet. One week from today, they will sit down at the White House to discuss the debt ceiling. That face-to-face comes as the clock ticks towards what could be an economic disaster if they don't come to an agreement. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the U.S. will be out of cash in less than a month if the two sides do not agree to raise the debt ceiling, as they've done dozens of times before. And today, more than 1,100 film and TV writers are on strike. This, over compensation for their work, specifically on streaming services. You will likely notice the impact on late-night television first. Sources tell CNN that Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert will be airing repeats until further notice, starting tonight. Boris?",

First, a 50-year-old man at a nearby Central Park. That was on Thursday. A U.C. Davis student at Sycamore Park on Saturday night. Police have made no arrests and have not named any suspects.

      "sentences": "I can tell you I just left the press conference that's still going. It started about 15 minutes ago.I've got to be honest, like you said, there are Muslim leaders in New Jersey and Mayor Mohamed Khairullah in that press conference right now. And they are very upset because they believe genuinely this is an example, as you said, of racial profiling. And they are calling on the White House from getting away in using any sort of watch list or no fly list in this country. Let me rewind for a second and just explain to viewers how we got to this point. So yesterday, there was an event at the White House to celebrate Eid and the end of Ramadan. There were, according to the White House, almost 400 people in attendance at that event and many of them Muslim and elected leaders who are also Muslim. But then Mayor Khairullah, he said, just 30 minutes before the event, he got a phone call from the White House saying the Secret Service barred him from the event and he was no longer able to attend. The Secret Service did confirm to CNN that he was told that he was barred for this event. The Secret Service nor the White House offered any explanation as to why. Pretty much right after that, in New Jersey, where we are right now, they released a statement, calling this an affront to the Muslim community. And the mayor said on CNN this morning that this is an example of targeted harassment of Arabs and Muslims by the federal government. His explanation, his thought is that the belief is he was put on a watch list back in 2019, when he was questioned at the airport for maybe having contact with terrorists. He said obviously that's not true. Listen to what he said in the press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR MOHAMED KHAIRULLAH (D-PROSPECT PARK, NJ): I have no reason to believe that I am an unsafe person to any elected official. I have been around with elected officials from a national level all the way to school board level and I have supported many of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israel military said four of the rockets were intercepted and 16 of them falling in open areas injuring at least three people. The rocket bombardment comes after the death of a Palestinian prisoner who died inside an Israel jail after a long hunger strike. In the meantime, in Nepal, an American climber died while trying to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Expedition organizers say that Jonathan Sugarman, of Seattle, began to feel sick and passed away. He's the fourth person to die on Mount Everest this year as authorities in the fall issued a record number of permits in 2023 for climbing hoping to scale the world's tallest peak. And take a look at this dramatic ocean rescue just off the coast of Tampa, Florida. Manatee County deputies pulling a father and his young son from the Gulf of Mexico after they were swept away from shore by strong rip currents and had to be rescued more than 100 yards away from the beach.

That warning comes amid important new data from a nationwide survey of registered nurses, many thinking about leaving the profession altogether now. They say their work is much less satisfying and much more stressful. CNN senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, joins us now. Elizabeth, we've been hearing about this. We hailed them during the pandemic. They worked so hard. And they really put their lives on the line here. But it just seems exhaustion reigns now. Tell us how we got here and what the data shows. DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jim. This was really a problem. Nurse morale was really a problem before the pandemic. And it got much, much worse during the pandemic. This is a huge survey of 18,000 nurses. Let's take a look at what they found. They found that 30 percent of them said they are likely to leave nursing and they really blamed the pandemic for that because of the workload and the way they were treated by many patients. They also said 40 percent of the patients said that they felt burnt out. This is terrible news for nurses and also the rest of us because they rely on them -- Jim?",

That mantle and also the gold tunic you see, which actually goes under the mantle, very glitzy. Both of those often reused for coronations.
