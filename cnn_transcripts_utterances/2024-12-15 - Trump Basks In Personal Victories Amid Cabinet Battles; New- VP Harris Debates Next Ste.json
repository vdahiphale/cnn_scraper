Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. With 36 days until he takes the oath of office, Donald Trump spent part of the weekend with the top Republican leaders in Congress and making a public show of support for one of his most embattled cabinet picks, Pete Hegseth. Yesterday, Trump took in the annual Army-Navy football game with Hegseth, along with Speaker Mike Johnson and the incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune. The goal for Trump is simple: try to ride out this honeymoon period as long as possible. And judging by his social media, it's clear he knows a swell of good luck he's enjoying. But even with single party rules soon coming to Washington, it will undoubtedly be rocky. The only question is when. And Trump, for his part, continued this weekend to select his most loyal allies to serve in roles in his administration. Yesterday, selecting a controversial former congressman, Devin Nunes, to serve as an intelligence advisor and appointing his former acting director of national intelligence, Ric Grenell, to a presidential envoy position. It's all part of this breakneck pace of Trump's transition. And as he rang the bell at the New York stock exchange late last week, he said he's learned something from the last time he was in office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think I like it better this time, actually, because. But we did a good job. We had a great first term despite a lot of turmoil caused unnecessarily. I said, you know, I've never done this before. I didn't know anybody. I got to the oval office and I'm picking all these big positions, and I didn't really know the people in Washington, but boy, did I get to learn fast. And now we do. And I think we have an incredible staff behind me and others that aren't here. And we're going to do a fantastic job. This is a great honor and ringing the bell will be fantastic and go out and get them. We're with you all the way. Thank you very much. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, so let's talk about the optics of yesterday. This was Pete Hegseth just a couple of weeks ago. It looked like he was. Could have been Trump could have pulled the plug. He could have walked away amid all these controversies that have come out about his alleged misconduct. He's denied all those allegations, of course. But still, the question is, did he have the votes and did Trump want to go through it? He clearly wants to go through it.

I think what we saw yesterday was a show of presidential power, because he's the president elect, has revived the Hegseth nomination, along with some help from, as you were saying, the conservative media friends.

You had a lot of pictures -- photo opportunities with the speaker of the house, President-elect Trump, and the incoming majority leader, John Thune. Those three have not really worked together. There was a different set of leaders. The last time he was in the White House, and they're, you know, showing, smiling, sitting together.But behind the scenes, there are some divisions in terms of strategy about how to move forward. They want to do the same things, right, border security, address inflation, cut taxes, renew Trump's tax cuts. But there are differences of opinions about how to move forward. I imagine that probably came up at the game. I'm sure the speaker is happy. His son is a midshipman and they won the game yesterday. But I do think there was a lot of, you know, soft lobbying going on in that box last night. RAJU:  No question about it. Let's just take a step back about to see how the transition is going overall. Overall, the American public, they do view things as going favorably. They tend to give grace to the new incoming administration after what's usually a pretty bitter and vicious campaign. Trump has about 55 percent approval rating. Look, its about positive numbers for most other presidents there other than Donald Trump in 2017, as 40 percent, he took a much different tack back then. He was campaigning a lot, doing rallies and the like. Obviously, the public doesn't prefer that, 55 percent now looking favorably. But now what's been interesting is the people that he selected through this administration, we talked about the loyalty test that has been very clear. Then Trump loyal allies have been all throughout the cabinet and different administration posts, but also big donors as well. Our colleagues at CNN reporting about this just yesterday, about securing big roles in the administration and just a staggering amount of money that some of these people have given towards Trump or Trump's super and allied outside groups. The Elon Musk, of course, at the top of the list in this new government efficiency advisory role, $262 million, but all the way down, even Linda McMahon winning 20 -- donating $21 million and winning the post to be the secretary of education. And they're not alone. There are many others, according to this reporting. People may say, well, this is the way Washington works, but this is more than we've seen before.",

Mitch McConnell, who is a polio -- childhood polio survivor, of course, the Republican leader. Still, he's outgoing Republican leader, but he still has a vote in the United States Senate, still as influential in the Senate GOP conference, put out a statement in the aftermath of that report, going on to say that anyone seeking to -- seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.

Because you're going to have Democratic governors who also want to run for president, presumably. They're going to be the tip of the spear, at least until the midterm elections, in the resistance to Trump.

A big red flag for Democrats that showed for the first time in modern history, the perceptions of the two political parties has actually changed.Now, the majority of Americans believe that the Republicans best represent the interests of the working class and the poor, and Democrats are the party of the wealthy and the elite. That is a damning indictment on our brand and something we have to fix. You know, the reality is, if you look at our policies our policies are very popular throughout the country. They're passing in wide measure through -- through up and down the ballot and ballot initiatives, minimum wage increases, paid family leave, abortion protections, you name it, they're passing. Those same people are moving down ballot and voting for Trump and the Republicans. So clearly we have a branding issue. We have a messaging issue that we have to fix.",

People of color view Trump more positively about how he may handle things going forward.
