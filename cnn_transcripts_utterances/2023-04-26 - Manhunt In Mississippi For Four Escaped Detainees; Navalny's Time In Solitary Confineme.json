We have not been given details.But it does come as four detainees are on the run after they escaped from a Mississippi jail. It sparked a huge manhunt. Officials say they believe these four men, Dylan Arrington, Casey Grayson, Corey Harrison, and Jerry Raynes broke out of their cells on Saturday night. Police believe they climbed onto the roof of the Raymond Detention Center, likely splitting up to make their estates. Then in Jackson, Mississippi, police found a body and they believe that Dylan Arrington shot and killed that man and then stole his truck. Another stolen car was spotted in neighboring Rankin County. Investigators believe two of the suspects may have been headed there. And more than 400 miles away, in Spring Valley Village, Texas, officials found an abandoned public works truck. It is the same truck that was seen crashing through a gate on Saturday night. CNN's Amara Walker is following all of this now. There are so many new details, and we are hearing right, that there is something going on potentially with this case right now. What can you tell us?",

So, that's their view of the legal process.And then you have his day-to-day life, not just solitary confinement, but Dasha told me yesterday that they now understand his food is being limited in prison. And that is a great concern to them because overall, they continue to be concerned about his health as his weight has been dropping. Have been listening to what she said to me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DARIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S DAUGHTER: One of my dad's attorneys have confirmed that according to the new rules that they specifically drew up for my dad, he is now legally limited to the amount of food that he can purchase in the canteen, which is -- which doesn't seem like this big of a problem but the food in the Russian prison system was bad. And my dad has had some problems with losing weight. And now the situation has gotten so ridiculous that he buys the food which is you know, oats. It's nothing -- it's nothing luxurious. And he buys the oats, that oats are brought to him -- shown to him and then are just destroyed. So, he can't eat. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
