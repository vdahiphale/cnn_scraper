First, we are learning that there's evidence of a potential crime in the special counsel's probe of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Sources are saying that a federal judge is convinced that Trump may have used his own attorney to break the law when federal agents were trying to retrieve top secret files stored at his private club in Florida. That attorney may need to testify again and face questions that he previously refused to answer by claiming attorney-client privilege. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is going to break down the reporting in just a moment, so stand by for that.But here in New York, the grand jury in the Stormy Daniels hush money case set to reconvene today. We are waiting to see if they make a decision to indict the former president. We have exclusive reporting, CNN reporting, that Trump's lawyer is coming under new scrutiny for emails that he exchanged with Stormy Daniels years ago. Straight now to the big news in the Trump classified documents case. DOJ responding at 6:00 a.m. Kaitlan Collins, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, important to note this is the classified documents case given we are talking about so many different investigations right now, including what's happening with Stormy Daniels here in New York. This is focused on classified documents.And while you were sleeping overnight, there were a flurry of deadlines for both Trump's legal team and the Justice Department when it came to this effort by the Justice Department to get one of Trump's defense attorneys Evan Corcoran, to testify, piercing that shield of attorney-client privilege, basically not being able to sight it when he has asked questions by those attorneys. Now, this is all up to a D.C. circuit court. But at midnight, Trump's attorneys had to essentially make their case for why they believe that Evan Corcoran should not have to go and testify without attorney- client privilege, why it does not mean that threshold. The Justice Department also had their own deadline at 6:00 a.m. for prosecutors. Both of those deadlines were made overnight. And now this is all in the hands of the D.C. circuit court, this three panel of judges who are going to be making this decision. And the reason this is so critical here and it could be so could have such implications for where this case goes next is basically what we are seeing is that a judge has ruled that she does believe prosecutors met the threshold for the crime fraud exception. But what we've learned that's new here is they believe that it is Trump who potentially committed that crime. There has been some gray area whether or not it was Corcoran they were going after or Trump himself. Now it is clear that they are referencing Trump here. The judge has ruled that prosecutors met that burden. The Justice Department, according to that judge, has the evidence to back up that decision. Some of that could be the surveillance tapes from Mar-a- Lago. We know that is something that prosecutors subpoenaed. They got those surveillance tapes regarding those areas where the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were being kept. So that is why that is so critical here. And so what it means and what we could see next is that Evan Corcoran, this defense attorney, may have to go testify again. He's already done so previously for about four hours. But this time he would not be able to cite attorney-client privilege when being asked questions, which we know from our reporting he did the last time he testified. So they are still seeking this testimony. They also want this, it could be critical to the probe. When it comes to obstruction. We don't know if this goes forward what Evan Corcoran would have to say. What we do know is that he was ordered to turn over some of his own notes and audio recordings of notes that he made to prosecutor -- or to the judge here, so that could be significant as well. But what we don't know is what we're waiting for, this decision by the D.C. circuit court, which we could learn potentially as soon as today.",

Does a judge decide that these communications merit some kind of attorney client privilege and conflict of interest that would limit Joe Tacopina from being able to actually represent Trump or even disqualify him from doing so?And when you ask about what is the importance here, it's about that confidential information. We know that Stormy Daniels was looking for an attorney. Did she give Tacopina and his law firm confidential information in this case that would give them a leg up in this case but could actually impact Daniels herself. Let's say this goes to trial. Could any information that she gave them be used against her in a cross examination? So that is what the judge will have to look at and determine when he sees if these communications amount to a conflict of interest? Of course, Stormy Daniels' attorney turned these over because he believes that there is confidential information that was shared with Tacopina and his firm. And as you noted, Tacopina has said that there was no conflict of interest, that he never met or spoke to Stormy Daniels. But then there is the tape where he essentially said that some sort of attorney-client privilege had been established. So again, this is in the judge's hands, and that will be the ultimate determination as to whether or not there was a conflict of interest and if Tacopina can continue forward representing Trump.",

And what they're gearing up for is preparing this new normal. How exactly are they going to run a campaign under this indictment? And they're not operating with a lot of information, as all of us are, in terms of timing and what that would look like. I had one aide talking to me about that trip to Texas in particular saying, OK, so if the indictment comes down on a Friday, Saturday we just go to Texas? There's a lot of unknowns here.

And it's hard to argue, oh, you can't look at this or you can't look at that. So yes, if there's an issue with that payment to Stormy Daniels being that it was made on behalf of the candidate, OK, and it was not declared, that's fair game. That a lawyer took out a home equity loan with his own money, paid somebody that he didn't even know on behalf of a client who, by the way, had the wherewithal and the money to afford $130,000, and, by the way, didn't tell the client about the settlement agreement. It's an illegal agreement as to fraud, if that's in fact, the case. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't pass the straight face test. And quite frankly, if that is what happened, we have a potential campaign finance issue. Does anyone actually believe -- anyone, left, right, middle, whatever, that that if someone else were accused of paying hush money to avoid a public sex scandal in the manner that Donald Trump is alleged to have avoided the public sex scandal, they would be prosecuted? The answer is on 100 percent no. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's OK to take a different position or put a different position out in the press.The real question is. Did he represent her? What did he learn from her? And does that mean that he now cannot represent Donald Trump? And the judge will sort all that out. Usually in these cases, they don't actually disqualify the person. Courts do like to honor a criminal defendant's choice of council. So probably they will say you can't use anything you learned, you can't cross examine her if this goes to trial, but they'll probably let him stay on the case.",

And what we saw yesterday was the judge was quite critical at times of FOX's arguments. At one point, he even said, you know, I think the argument you're making is, it feels intellectually dishonest. And so I think that is really interesting as we take a look at this case, and as this judge is being asked to rule in favor by, FOX is saying you should declare us the winner, Dominion is saying you should declare us the winner. This might give us some window into his thinking as he's being asked by both parties to just avert a trial and declare an outright winner.",
