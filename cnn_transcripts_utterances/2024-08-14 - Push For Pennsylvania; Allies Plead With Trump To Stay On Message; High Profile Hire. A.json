The push for Pennsylvania coming as the Harris campaign is trying to make inroads and win back some of the lead that Donald Trump has held for quite some time on the economy and his economic -- the economic agenda, saying he has long waged a war on workers, is the position and pitch from the Harris campaign.At the center of that message, a question about whether or not Donald Trump could make a McFlurry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Can you simply picture Donald Trump working in a McDonald's trying to make a McFlurry or something?

The concern is that Donald Trump has not only squandered the opportunity to define Harris during these critical past three weeks, but that he is risking reminding voters why they decided to turn away from him in 2020. And if you want a window into what the Trump campaign would prefer he talk about, take a look at this post to X on Monday ahead of his interview with Elon Musk.In it, Trump asked the question, are you better off now than you were when I was president? That is certainly the ground that his campaign and his advisors want this race to be fought on. But when it actually came time to have the interview with Musk, Trump didn't ask that question or bring up that topic until the very end of his two hour interview with Musk. Instead, he spent time talking about the 2020 election, comparing the beauty of Vice President Harris to the former first lady and his wife. And these concerns are not just being made in private to Donald Trump anymore. They are coming into the public. His allies are trying to speak to him through the television. Look at what a couple of them said earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: You've got to make this race not on personalities.

Thank you ladies for joining us.Economy, of course, the biggest issue for voters, Harris is expected to release her first major economic plan. Axios is saying something really interesting about what she is going to do. And a big part of the Harris plan is to, as they put it, unapologetically change some of her more liberal positions and say that her White House experience has changed her mind. Ashley, what do you make of this? And can she do this successfully? Because, of course, Republicans are already saying, this is a flip- flop. This is -- she's flip-flopping. ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. Well, I'm excited to hear that she's going to be rolling out her economic policy. It's been less than a month since she's been at the top of the ticket, and really wanted to kick the tires on some of the issues that she knows Americans and voters really care about. I think she most certainly -- look, the things I believed in 2016 most are true, but there are some things because of lived experience that over eight years I've changed my mind on. And I think that that is the courage of a leader to say, OK, maybe I didn't have that exactly right, but I'm going to adjust it, or the country is different now than it was pre -COVID. I want to adjust some topics. So the vice president has a great opportunity with the bus tour that Eva just mentioned, going through Pennsylvania, a really important state, and talk about her election. But also she'll have those four days of the convention. And you won't just hear her talk about it in her speech, but I would imagine all of her surrogates, all the big headliners that are going to be during the convention, also teasing out some of the policies that the vice president stands on, whether they are different from her original position or not.",

Donald Trump is responding to some of this.He went on Univision, which is Spanish language television that is highly popular, and he said this about immigration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, we have people coming into our country from all over the world, not just from South America. Everyone thinks South America, it's really from all over the world. They're coming from Africa, from the Middle East, from Asians, we're being attacked. It's a new form of crime in the US. It's called migrant crime. And it's caused because of Harris, Kamala, you know? Nobody knows her last name, it's Harris. Nobody -- everyone thinks of her as Kamala. So it's Kamala Harris.

Nonetheless, look, we know immigration is an important issue, and it is something that the Democrats are going to have to address, but we also know border crossings are down under the Biden-Harris administration, lower than they were on when Trump left office.We also know that there was a bipartisan bill that, but for Donald Trump, would have been signed to deal with some of these issues. But I want to address something else is that, I'm not sure if you showed the picture, but Donald Trump recently released a meme that had pictures of African immigrants, black and African immigrants in this country.",

He talks about them being as whole countries, or he talks about them being immigrants, being rapists and murderers, and it's othering. It's trying to make voters and Americans feel scared of immigrants coming to our country, when in reality most of the folks who are in America are because they have an immigrant story, their families coming from Europe.And so, Donald Trump has a tactic right now that is not surprising, because it's a part of his tactic. But he's doing these things with racial undertones and saying, like in a Kamala Harris presidency, all these black immigrants and African immigrants, and Haitian immigrants are going to come into your country. And do you want that? And you should be afraid. And so, it doesn't appear that scare tactics really work in elections, but it is right out of the Trump playbook. And I would hope that their campaign would behave better. If he want to talk about the issues, great, but using imagery to try and invoke fear is pretty ruthless politics.",

He's already been convicted of gun crimes in Delaware, and he is headed in just three weeks to a trial on tax evasion charges.What our resources are telling us is that, Hunter Biden has been open to a plea deal with the Special Counsel's Office for some time. He had one before it fell apart before the judge. It was a deal that would have minimized his potential prison time, and even after he was convicted by a jury in Delaware's Federal Court on those gun charges, there were some nominal sort of preliminary feeling out talks of the possibility of a plea deal. He does seem to be possibly open to this, to not have this second trial in California, but the Special Counsel's Office hasn't given him anything concrete that he would want. And so, it's full steam ahead to trial, that's where Mark Geragos, this lawyer based out of Los Angeles, comes in. He is going to be stepping into this case, taking more of a lead as it goes to trial. He's based out there in Los Angeles. He's also has more time on his hands and is a little bit cheaper, or doesn't have as much of an infrastructure around him as the people that took Hunter Biden to trial in Delaware would, that is Abbe Lowell, another very high profile lawyer. So there's a shift here happening for Hunter Biden as he heads into this trial, the second trial, where he could risk a conviction that would be quite significant on top of the gun charges that he's also convicted of already.

The internal information that The Times was able to obtain through the State Department, it was a Commerce Department official saying, you know, the US government should not be advocating with the government of Italy on behalf of this Ukrainian company. We're not going to do anything here. But this is just another bullet point on the history of Hunter Biden trying to capitalize when his father was the Vice President, on his family connection, something we know he's done many times. But, of course, we have no evidence that shows that Joe Biden did anything to help the business interests of Hunter Biden at that time, and Hunter Biden has been investigated for some time, obviously facing federal charges on multiple things that he's done in his past, but nothing related to foreign lobbying.
