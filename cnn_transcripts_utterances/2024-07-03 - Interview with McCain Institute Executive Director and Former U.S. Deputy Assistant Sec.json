      "sentences": "-- the Pulitzer Prize winning play, \"English.\" Screenwriter, Sanaz Toossi, brings us a group of Iranians navigating the emotionalintersection of language and identity. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. President Biden is in damage control mode and is now, according to a source, privately acknowledging that the next few days are going to be critical to saving his candidacy. Biden meets tonight with Democratic governors who are concerned over his debate performance. The president is also preparing for a sit-down interview and plans to give a press conference at next week's NATO Summit in Washington. This critical moment for the United States is spooking allies and thrilling adversaries, with much of the world in crisis and flux. The ongoing Israel- Hamas war, Ukraine's desperate battle for survival, the far-right at the doors of power in France, and what about China? Evelyn Farkas served as deputy assistant secretary of defense under President Obama, and she's now executive director of the McCain Institute. She recently traveled to some of the most crucial areas of global tension, including Taiwan, Israel, and the Palestinian territories, and she's joining me now from Washington. Evelyn Farkas, welcome to the program. I want to -- just a broad question, how do you think, as I said, allies and adversaries will be looking at this moment and trying to figure out how to take advantage of it. EVELYN FARKAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MCCAIN INSTITUTE AND FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Yes, Christiane. Thank you for the opportunity. I am very nervous right now at how allies like Israel are looking at this opportunity because, you know, Israel is an ally that we've been trying to pressure. The White House has been trying to pressure Israel not to start another war in the north with Lebanon with the Hezbollah. And of course, we have our adversaries. China has been increasingly upping the ante in the South China Sea against the Philippine Navy. And you know, on and on Iran, all of these emboldened actors, Putin looking across the border at Russia is counting on a -- you know, a weak America if he can get his way. So, it is unsettling right now at this moment. It's a bit of a dangerous moment.",

So, I think that foreign leaders are probably holding their breath, waiting to see, whether the White House answers that question of whether the president has the stamina, the vim and the vigor to continue to stand up to our enemies and to stand with our allies.",

President Biden, as part ofhis comeback tour, if you like, is going to give a press conference there. Maybe he would have done anyway, but still, what do you think is the most important issue right now? Is it the idea of a vacuum and a crisis of American leadership in the alliance, including NATO? Is it a question of the kind of American leadership, let's say, it's not a Democratic president who believes in alliances and it's Trump again who is much more transactional and chaotic as we saw in the first term?",

All of these bad actors together confronting the democratic peace-loving nations of the world. That's making people uneasy. And if you have a President Trump who clearly admires our adversaries and frankly, disdains our friends and allies, or certainly disdains alliances, that puts the United States in danger and frankly, it puts the world in danger because we are still the number one economic, political, and military power in the world and our allies have depended on us to take the lead. I do think they're taking a little bit of a shift. They have been hedging. I saw that in Asia on my recent trip, and we see that now with NATO and we'll see it at the summit. But I think the world is very much nervous about who will be leading the United States, especially with the ramped-up Trump rhetoric right now, where he's saying, I'll be an autocrat on day one. I'm going to take retribution. And he almost doesn't have any other policy agenda except this one.",

So, to Okinawa. Also closer into Taiwan and more aggressively and more frequently. So, the military deterrence needs to be stronger. And of course, in the Philippines, I mean, they just did some things that were kind of -- you know, we would never have imagined that we would see these unimaginable that they would actually seize the resupply. The -- so, the Philippine Navy was resupplied and the Chinese vessels and the Chinese personnel took the resupply. So, food and whatever it was they were getting. They did end up returning it, but there was also a bunch of knife fighting. So, which actually does remind us of the fighting that the Chinese have done on the border with India. So, the Chinese are really pushing the envelope. And I think what it tells you is that they don't -- they're testing our political will because clearly, we have military might, but a big part of deterrence is do we have the will to stand up to China and with our allies?",

They've moved the -- basically the decision-making mechanism where allies got together to decide what kind of equipment and what kind of other assistance Ukraine would provide. Would receive on the military side from the United States and from all of the NATO members. It's now being embedded inside of NATO so that the U.S. is, in that sense, dispensable. So, they've Trump proofed it. They've also -- all of the member NATO's, of allies -- of member nations of NATO, almost all of them, have also signed -- at least the big ones, have signed bilateral agreements with Ukraine, including, of course, the United States. That means that even if NATO doesn't come to the assistance of Ukraine, these other countries will, U.K., of course, France, as you said, it might be up for debate again. But the other NATO allies who are consistently there. Germany is important. Again, I'm not discounting the fact that they have a far-right as well. But ultimately, right now, the center is holding.

He doesn't show signs of moving again to, as I said, a political settlement. His military campaign also may not have been as effective because the Hamas terrorists are reconstituting themselves. That's what we're hearing in Gaza. On top of that, he's emboldened, empowered his far- right cabinet to take -- illegally take, essentially, under Israeli law, maybe they're legalizing it, but under international law, they're taking more territory in the West Bank. That does not -- should not -- international law has not determined belongs to Israel and should be part of a future State of Palestine.

And it's going to be a huge shock to them to discover that it is. I also think that in the period, really, since at least 1980, there has been a movement toward this idea of an imperial presidency, and it's going to be the project of the next five months to convince Americans that this is our moment.

And what the problem for me about that was, was not that Biden was stumbling over his words as he tried to get out the different things that his administration had done. And it was not even that Trump showed us who he was, because those of us who've been paying close attention for a while knew that he has deteriorated in the time since he's been in office, knew that people didn't know how bad he was, know that he is a pathological liar and that he is refusing to accept the norms or the guidelines of our democracy. We knew that. What shocked me was the degree to which the American media looked at those two people and rather than saying, this is what is happening on that stage, we have these two characters, or even worse than saying, what is happening on that stage is looking at a former president talking about destroying American democracy. What they did was they presented to the American people that the central problem of what happened on that stage was Joe Biden's age, when he's three years older than the man on the other side who wants to destroy American democracy.",

And in the whole picture of American history, if you change a presidential nominee at this point in the game, the candidate loses and it loses for a number of reasons. First of all, because the apparatus of the party for the election is set up around somebody else.

And in this case, of course, the primary voters in the Democratic Party who are the most loyal people have voted, and they voted for Joe Biden. For all the people who are focusing on Biden right now, and as you mentioned, I'm a historian of the Republican Party. The Republican party is in crisis and they are as well doing something unprecedented, which is trying to run for president somebody who not only has 34 criminal convictions, but also tried to overthrow the will of the people in the 2020 presidential election. So, I think that -- again, right now, I think the idea that the focus is on Biden is a bit misguided, at least from my perspective, because I don't care if we elect Biden or Harris or anybody else. I care that we recognize that running currently against that ticket is somebody who is trying to destroy our country. And I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way.

We know that 70 percent of Americans want protections for abortion enshrined in our national law.

And then to look at their performance in that office and say, we would rather have the man who couldn't get anything done and who really just worked with other authoritarians around the world than the man who has really managed to protect American manufacturing and so on. So, I care deeply that the American people have an entire picture of what is at stake in this election and where we are right now, after that debate, is not giving us that picture. It is my expectation following the Supreme Court's recent decisions that that balance may be restored, but if it isn't restored from the higher reaches of our government and from the media, the American people sure better do it themselves because we have five months to make sure we get to the 250th anniversary of the American Republic.

It also includes new funding that the Department of Defense will use to purchase interceptors for Patriot and NASAMS air defense systems to help Ukraine defend its troops and its cities against Russia's aerial attacks. The United States support over the last few months has been critical in helping Ukraine defend their territory against Russia's advances. Thanks to the bravery of the Ukrainian forces and weapon deliveries from the United States and our allies and partners, it is increasingly clear Russian offensive around Kharkiv has been a failure. And as President Biden has been clear, we are committed to continuing to stand with Ukraine until they prevail against Russian aggression. So, I want to share a bit of additional updates before -- for all of you before we start. I know some of you have been trying to confirm some of this information that I'm about to share. So, I'll do it right now at the podium. The president has connected with Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Representative Clyburn, Former Speaker Pelosi, and Senator Coons. Today, President Biden taped two black radio interviews that will air tomorrow morning. One is with Earl Ingram on Civic Media Network, which airs across Wisconsin, and one with Andrea Lawful Sanders on WURD's, The Source, in Philadelphia. And as Governor Walz of Minnesota announced today, the president will meet with more than 20 democratic governors. Now, as you know, these governors are some of our closest partners when it comes to creating jobs, building new roads and building bridges and so much more.

He met with supporters whether at the Waffle House or in Atlanta, at a watch party or in North Carolina where there were hundreds of supporters there, in Raleigh. And so, he was busy dealing with -- you know, dealing with his schedule and also speaking directly and engaging with his supporters and then spend time with his family. I think what's important is that he has done this outreach, he's having these conversations. It is important to him to do so.
