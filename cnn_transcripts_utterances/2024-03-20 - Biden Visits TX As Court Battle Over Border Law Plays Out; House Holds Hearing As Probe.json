Today, an appeals court heard arguments on SB 4, the law that gives Texas authorities the power to arrest and even deport migrants suspected of entering the country illegally. SB 4 has pinballed through the court system here in the past 24 hours and adding to the uncertainty, some gray areas in the law have emerged. They were on full display during this morning's arguments.Here's an exchange between one judge and the Texas solicitor arguing in favor of the law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE PRISCILLA RICHMAN, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, FIFTH CIRCUIT: I was just trying to envision how this law plays out. A couple of things, just because I'm not sure I understand the law totally. So what if someone enters in, let's say, from Mexico into Arizona and lives there for five years, then moves to Texas.

Yesterday, he visited with Latino voters saying that they will be critical to his re-election coming in 2020.It comes at a time when former President Trump has tried to make some inroads within the Latino community. But the President has been trying to argue that he and his policies are quite different from the approach that Trump has taken to Latinos and immigrants in this country. But this latest legal back and forth over that Texas immigration law really has brought the issue of immigration and border security once again front and center in the 2024 campaign. We have yet to hear directly from the President about the legal back and forth, but the White House yesterday did push back on this Texas law. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement: \"SB 4 will not only make communities in Texas less safe, it will also burden law enforcement, and sow chaos and confusion at our southern border. SB 4 is just another example of Republican officials politicizing the border while blocking real solutions.\" You have seen the President try to show that he's trying to take some actions when it comes to border security, considering executive actions, supporting that bipartisan deal that was ultimately scuttled due to former President Trump expressing his opposition to it. The President has tried to turn the tables on Republicans on the issue of border security, which has increasingly emerged as a political liability for Biden heading into 2024. After he's done here in Arizona, he sets heads right to the state of Texas. A coincidence as this debate is playing out in the courts down there, the President will be there on hand to raise money for his presidential campaign.",

The thing to point out there is that most people, if you look at polling, do not agree on a national abortion ban.
