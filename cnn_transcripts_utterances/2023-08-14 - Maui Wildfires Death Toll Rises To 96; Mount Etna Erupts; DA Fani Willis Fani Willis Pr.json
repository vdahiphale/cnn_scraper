You can see all the diapers and critical supplies, the water and food. People just coming in here and it's sort of a self-organizing system. Archie has great leadership experience as a lifeguard extraordinaire, and it's all coming to play right now. People trust him. He does say that the state and federal response is getting a bad rap.
