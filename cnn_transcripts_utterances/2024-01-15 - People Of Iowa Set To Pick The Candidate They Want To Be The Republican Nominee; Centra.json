This is extreme coldeven for them. Temperatures right now are at minus four degrees Fahrenheit right now in Des Moines. So, sub-zero. Once you factor in the wind chill, you have these wind chills at 20 to 30 to 40 degrees below zero, and it doesn't look like we'll hit zero degrees as we go through the day today. So much of the state staying sub-zero. That's why we have these wind chill warnings in effect for much of the state, because we're looking at that wind chill factor staying as cold as 30 to 35 to 40 degrees below zero. And that can cause frostbite in minutes. Here's a look at the highs for today. Again, pretty much all of them, most of them sub-zero, one degree below zero in Des Moines today factor in the wind chills feeling even colder. And all of these -- you see these numbers here showing us that the departure from average is 30 degrees. So, much colder than average, not typical for Iowa. Frostbite times are 20 to 25 minutes or less with how extreme some of these wind chills are so it doesn't take much to get frostbite out there on a day like today. And when we look at the caucuses, the history of them, most of them are in the 30s and 40s. The coldest before this was 16 degrees in 2004. Again, today we might not break zero.",

I think she's likely to outperform expectations, and she's got META behind her. DeSantis -- I wouldn't count out his organization, because to some extent, it reflects on Kim Reynolds, the governor of the state, very popular, endorsed him a few months ago, and evangelical leaders like Bob Vander Plaats. So, I think it really essentially is a three-person race. Trump, I think, is concerned about Vivek Ramaswamy taking a little bit from him.

But there certainly are signs that momentum has been moving in her direction. And he's loosened up in the last bit. I thought both their town halls on CNN were the sound of candidates really hitting their stride. But Donald Trump will do well in the rural areas. It'll be interesting to see how the weather affects all this. Donald Trump's core support, very intense. But people who are wavering towards him and in the more rural areas where it may be more difficult to get out, you know, this X factor is significant, as well as whether independent voters who can caucus if they choose to join the Republican Party, what impact they may have.

The world is facing major challenges. That is not surprising. Sunday marked 100 days since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7th. In Tel Aviv, crowds gathered for what they called the 100 Days of Hell Rally. In Gaza, the Hamas-controlled health ministry says the death toll has surpassed 24,000 people, more than 60,000 injured. That conflict is already having an impact beyond Gaza's borders. Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea in support, they say, of the Palestinian cause. And last week, the U.S. and U.K. struck back at Houthi targets in Yemen. In a speech just hours ago, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that he does not take any direct threat to British vessels lightly. Now, the war in Ukraine is approaching the two-year mark and shows no sign of cooling off. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be speaking in person in Davos tomorrow. The world will also be watching the all-important U.S. elections this year. The first contest of the 2024 presidential race, the Iowa caucus kicking off today in bone-chilling temperatures. And to all this, the climate emergency, global economic challenges, migration, and you have a cauldron of hot-button issues that global leaders need to tackle. So, we have a lot to talk about with Ian Bremmer, President and Founder of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. He's also the author of \"The Power of Crisis: How Three Threats and Our Response Will Change the World\". Ian, it's so great to see you. So, you know, every year we look forward to your top global risks list. And I just want to focus with you on the top three here because it really pertains to what we've introduced this segment with. So, we have the partitioning of Ukraine. We're going to be hearing from Zelenskyy tomorrow, the Israel-Hamas war, and the U.S. versus itself. Let's start with Israel. As we noted a terror attack today in the center of the country, clearly an indication of just how alarmed the country as a whole is, regardless of how close they are to the war going on in Gaza, and a reminder of just how small the country is. We mentioned the attacks, coordinated attacks from the U.K. and the U.S. in response to the Houthi strikes. That was hoped to be dismantling, at least attempt to dismantle some of the Houthis' weaponry and their systems and their capabilities. Just a few hours ago, we saw the Houthis launch another attack at a U.S. container ship. How concerned are you right now about what we're seeing in Gaza, expanding beyond just Gaza?",

The Ukrainians were there, the Russians were not, of course. The Chinese were not, of course. There was nothing on offer. The ability to move them to here's a way we need to find to negotiate is not there. And furthermore, the ability of the Americans to ensure that they're going to at least have the military capacity to defend the 82 percent of the territory that they still occupy. That's increasingly uncertain, as well. Now, Chris Murphy, who was supposed to be here with the Congressional delegation, has stayed behind because he is working to try to ensure that $60 billion for Ukraine will actually come through.

And we really get a first taste of how that will look in terms of Republican nominee tonight in Iowa with the results coming in from the caucuses there. That is your number one area of concern to watch for. The U.S. versus the U.S. Talk a bit more about that. Well, I mean, there's broad panic just underneath the snow here from all of the European leaders that are in attendance because they're deeply worried about the geopolitical environment that a second Trump administration would be governing in. It's very easy. If you're flying your plane at 40,000 feet and it's clear skies, you give the controls to an untested, untrusted pilot, it's probably okay. You take that same plane and you try to land it in a hurricane-force gale and you can't see the landing strip, good chance you're going to crash. That's the environment we're talking about right now is that the Russian- Ukraine war -- President -- former President Trump sees Zelenskyy as a political enemy -- as a personal enemy that refused when he demanded to actually open investigation into President Biden -- then a former Vice President, and His son Hunter. When Trump becomes president, if he wins, he is going to demand an outcome, an end to this war that Zelenskyy will find inconceivable to accept.",

In the U.S., the first step onthe path to the presidency begins, of course, in Iowa. But it's often where failed campaigns end. Less than eight hours from now, Republican voters will meet in groups across the state to decide which candidate do they want to challenge President Joe Biden in the November election. But first, they will have to make another major decision, and that is whether or not to leave their homes at all. That's because of what you see on your screen here, bone-chilling, actually even life-threatening temperatures, the coldest in Iowa caucus history are threatening to dampen voter turnout. As it stands now, Donald Trump is the front-runner in Iowa by a pretty substantial margin. But Nikki Haley's campaign has also been gaining momentum. In fact, a new poll shows that the former South Carolina governor is in second place. This is according to a new poll, with Ron DeSantis in third. Still, the Florida governor is expressing confidence in his ground game and ultimately his overall strategy. I want you to listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee going back into the early 2000s. All those candidates won because they had a great ground strategy and DeSantis has adopted that going into this caucus. But none of those candidates ever had to go up against a quasi-incumbent like Donald Trump, and that has proven to be a massive challenge for all of these candidates, but especially for DeSantis, because he has been trying to galvanize many parts of the Republican Party where Trump is most popular. He has been making inroads in evangelical communities. He has been pushing this idea that he is the most conservative candidate. He passed the Six-Week Abortion Ban. He has taken steps to ease gun restrictions in his state. All things that he thought would appeal to conservative Republicans in this state, but what he is finding is those conservative Republicans remain enamored with Donald Trump. They have been harder to get it to move on than they anticipated.

I think it's very difficult how he continues in this presidential race. The next contest is next week in New Hampshire. That's Nikki Haley's best bet to try and get an early win against Trump. She's expected to do well among independents and even Democrats that cross over into the Republican primary there. DeSantis isn't doing well at all with New Hampshire. It's not a very good fit. After that, there's the Nevada caucuses, which Trump seems to have pretty much wrapped up. And then they go to South Carolina in February. South Carolina is Nikki Haley's home state. That's where she plans to make a stand against Trump. But it's also a state where Donald Trump Trump is exceedingly popular. I don't think I've been to many states in the United States that like Trump more than South Carolina. So, it's again very difficult to see how DeSantis, even as he's running to the right of Trump on many issues is going to make much impact there. So, at that point, you get to a situation where the rationale for DeSantis starts to dry up, and probably the money that he needs from donors and fundraising to continue on in the race.",
