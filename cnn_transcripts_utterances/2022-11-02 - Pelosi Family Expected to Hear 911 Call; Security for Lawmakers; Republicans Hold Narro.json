Six days left now until the midterm elections. This morning, a new CNN poll shows Republican voters are more enthusiastic than Democrats heading into Election Day. The economy remains a top concern as people cast their votes. CNN is on the trail around the country. Also watching today, the Federal Reserve, set to hike interest rates again. That is sparking major concerns that the Fed's attempts to cool inflation could send the economy into a recession. Plus, new details about the attack on Paul Pelosi. Today, the family is expected to see body camera footage of that violent attack, hear the 911 call made by Speaker Pelosi's husband. This just one day after the suspect pleaded not guilty to multiple state charges. CNN's Veronica Miracle is live in San Francisco. She begins things for us this morning. So, Veronica, in terms of that 911 call and the body camera footage, there's also some information about a live feed of cameras that the U.S. Capitol Police was able to watch. Walk us through what we know that's new this morning.",

An officer was able to see lights and sirens on a live camera feed at the U.S. Capitol Police command center in Washington, D.C. Now, in terms of that body worn camera, we understand that the attack was caught on camera and that the Pelosis will be able to see it. And the San Francisco police chief here is crediting the dispatcher on the other end of that 911 call with saving Paul Pelosi's life. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It states that DePape had intentions to target other politicians. He's also quoted as saying to the medics and officers on the scene that this was a suicide mission. I'm not going to stand here and do nothing, even if it costs me my life. He also told officers, according to the motion to detain, that hurting Paul Pelosi was not his intention, but if Paul Pelosi escalated things he would go through him if he had to.Now, in court, the suspect, David DePape, he was arraigned on numerous felony charges. He entered not guilty pleas to all of those charges. The Pelosi family was not in attendance. They were trying to watch through a Zoom link but that did not work and so they were not there. But the prosecutor did tell the judge that the family is asking for privacy during this very difficult time. The judge also signed a protective order that says David DePape cannot contact Paul or Nancy Pelosi in any way. When he came into court, the suspect did have a sling on his arm. And I learned from the public defender it's because he dislocated his shoulder during the arrest. Erica.",

Thank you.Well, fears about the safety of lawmakers has understandably increased in the aftermath of the attack on Paul Pelosi. The U.S. Capitol Police chief now warning in this political climate more resources are needed to protect members of Congress. It's a warning that comes as CNN has learned that the suspect, as Veronica was just talking about, had planned to target other prominent politicians and their families. CNN law enforcement correspondent Whitney Wild joining us now with more on this part of the story. So, in terms of the Capitol Police, the chief now speaking out. Part of the issue here, right, there's a desire among many people for more protection but there is certainly a resource issue. Can they meet that demand?",

The economy is a driving factor, as we know. CNN congressional correspondent Jessica Dean is on the trail in Philadelphia this morning. Pennsylvania a key battleground here in the midterms.

And I think let's talk about this new polling first to kind of paint the picture and then I'm going to give you a concrete example of what we saw at a rally last night.So, looking into some of this new CNN polling, it's really kind of giving us a lot of data points on where voters are now less than a week out from Election Day. And one key figure is, if the election were held today, would you vote Democrat or Republican? And if you look at the numbers back from October 5th compared to the numbers from October 31st, you see that Republicans have gained a clear advantage there. And Republicans, if you talk to them, Republicans in Washington, also Republicans I'm talking to here in Pennsylvania feel like they really have the wind at their back here. They feel like they are going into these last six days with a lot of momentum and history on their side and they feel very good about that. The -- we also asked people, do you believe the economy is in a recession? And an overwhelming amount, 75 percent of respondents saying yes. Again, giving you a snapshot of where people think the economy is. And then, finally, are you satisfied with your personal economic situation? You take a look at those numbers and 55 percent dissatisfied there. So that's kind of what we're seeing across the country, right? Let's zoom in on Pennsylvania. This open Senate seat that Democrats are hoping to flip. Republicans want to hold on to. We went to a rally just outside of Philadelphia in what's known as the collar (ph) counties, these are the suburban counties that surround Philadelphia. They are full of independent, swing voters. So they are rich for both campaigns to go to. And we went to a rally with Dr. Oz last night, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate. The room was full of real base voters. A lot of Trump paraphernalia. Clearly, hard core Republican voters. And his message to them was not trying to swing them or get their support or whip them up, it was really to have them go and find their conservative Democratic friends and their independent friends and sell them on Oz's candidacy. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEHMET OZ (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE: So your job is to highlight, what are the three things, the economy, crime and the border, right? Three things. Don't talk about other stuff than that. You don't need to. Those are the three issues they -- kitchen table issues that everyone's worried about. Talk about what concerns voters and they'll come over to us. (END VIDEO CLIP) DEAN: And, Erica, pay attention to that. If that's what Oz's closing message is and that's where he is right now, that should give us a good signal as to where the campaign believes that they are heading into the six days out from Election Day. We're going to see Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee, also campaigning in those so-called collar counties, talking to those independent voters in the next couple of days. So they are really zeroing in on this. And we're going to see President Biden, former President Barack Obama and former President Donald Trump all coming here to Pennsylvania over the weekend.",

It's never been easier to register. we have record registrations. We have 6.9 million registered voters -- active registered voters and it looks like to me we will probably be pushing well over 4 million, which is what we had in 2018.

Essentially going from small city to small town, rural communities, and going and making sure that they talk to those voters so they can get that turnout out. Democrats out on the trail today. Of course, Senator Raphael Warnock and Democrat Stacey Abrams. And then as far as Republicans go, we've seen Governor Brian Kemp, who appeared with Vice President Mike Pence yesterday, and Herschel Walker, sort of hitting those more friendly, smaller, rural communities on his bus tour.

And in just a few hours, the Fed is going to, once again, try to chip away at this historic inflation that is crushing families and businesses.Now, the Fed's main tool to fight inflation are these interest rate hikes. The Fed has basically been taking a sledgehammer to inflation with these jumbo-sized interest rate hikes. We are expecting another 75 basis points today. That is big and that would be the fourth in a row. You know, that's something that we never saw under Janet Yellen or Ben Bernanke or Allen Greenspan. You actually have to go all the way back to the early '80s under Paul Volker since the Fed has had to do anything like this. I think that shows just how high inflation is right now but also how stubborn it's been. I mean it's basically been stuck at these 41-year highs. Now, Feds warn inflation is sending shock waves through the economy. Mortgage rates are above 7 percent for the first time in 20 years. The stock market is having its worst year since 2008. Credit card rates, they're near record highs, and recession risks are elevated. Now, history shows that the Fed is often late to attacking inflation. And then when it does attack inflation, they end up going too far. Often, but not always, we see recessions following these inflation- fighting campaigns. So, Erica, you know, the Fed has to get this just right. Put out the inflation fire without wrecking the economy. And that's not going to be easy.",
