Now, Ratcliffe is an interesting choice for a number of reasons. One, not that surprising if you think about the fact that he had been actually running the policy division of the transition team when it came to intelligence, two, interesting because he was on the shortlist for attorney general. We know that he had been in conversations about that position as well.Now, a little history on Ratcliffe, he was the head of the director of -- he was the director of National Intelligence from 2020 to 2021. And at that time he did face accusations that he was basically weaponizing intelligence information to help Trump politically in 2020 in that election. Interesting to see how that plays out. But one thing is very clear here. Donald Trump's team is really trying to fill these positions and fill them quickly.

A source has confirmed to CNN the existence of the proposal, but a transition official says it did not originate with the transition team. CNN has not independently reviewed the draft order. Tonight, the Trump team though is not disputing it exists, telling CNN, and I'm quoting now, the American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver, close quote. Joining us now, one of The Wall Street Journal reporters behind the story, Lara Seligman is joining us right now. Lara, thanks very much for joining us.

That would bypass the normal Pentagon process of having a panel of officers that are familiar with the officer's work and career decide, and then, of course, confirmed by Congress.So, it is in keeping, though, with Trump's statements on the campaign trail. He's made clear that once in office, he wants to fire what he calls the woke generals over the Pentagon's diversity and inclusion programs. He's also said that he would ask all the generals involved in the Afghanistan evacuation to resign by noon on inauguration day. So, this is not something that's completely unexpected, but it could create a chilling effect on the top military brass who are now facing, having their futures, their careers decided by a panel of people outside the normal Pentagon process.

One person that defense officials worry that Trump would want to fire immediately is General C.Q. Brown, who is the current chairman (INAUDIBLE) Chiefs of Staff, and he was appointed by President Biden. Now, Brown is only the second black man to be appointed to that position, and during the George Floyd protests of 2020, he spoke out about the impact that movement had on him, and what it was like to rise through the ranks as a black fighter pilot. So, that could put him in Trump's crosshairs. Honestly, though, all of the Joint Chiefs were appointed by President Biden, just about all of them.

But this is the kind of distraction, the revenge and the retribution that so many people worried about and that I think often just comes with Donald Trump. It becomes this distraction from so many more important issues that, as a commander-in-chief, you should have. And, you know, this panel could speak to it better than I can, but we have a military recruiting crisis already. We do not have enough people who are raising their hand to serve. To further politicize the military by showing some form of retribution to our general officers, officers who have served distinguishedly for decades, I think, could hurt that even more. So, it's exactly the kind of thing folks like many of us who have spoken out didn't want to see. And I would just encourage the former president focus on the task at hand.

He's tough on Iran. He's taken firm positions against Russia. Mike Waltz is national security adviser, I would say the same about, obviously, a Green Beret who served in combat. And John Ratcliffe is somebody who served as director of the Office of National Intelligence in the former term, was a United States congressman.These are people with the credentials to do the jobs. They signal that he's putting serious people into these roles, not purely sycophants who are there more out of loyalty than credentials. These are, of course, loyalists, but they also have the credentials to be there.

SIMMONSI think about the last couple of ambassadors, whether it was Jack Lew, who was former White House chief of staff and treasury secretary, or Tom Nides, who was former deputy secretary of state. These were very serious people who understood international foreign policy and they understood some of the major issues that were taking place. They tried to have an even hand when they were dealing, because America leads not just with like our force, we also lead with kind of this moral suasion. We lead with hard power. We also have soft power of our economy. And we think about those big soft power presidents like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama and the hard power presidents like George Bush. This is kind of a puzzling power, right? We just don't know what Donald Trump is up to. We don't know what his real objectives are. And if he's just going to try to govern by business deals, by figuring out how to cut this up like a sort of a land deal, or is he going to try to actually get to some level of justice where the people in Israel feel like they're secure and the people in Gaza and the West Bank feel like they have a future and they're secure and they've got some self- determination.

I'd honestly argue that Trump is kind of layering Kristi Noem.Being a DHS secretary in a Trump administration has traditionally been a no-win job. I think somebody who's a lot more of a tactician, like Tom Homan, is somebody who is probably going to be more effective for what he's trying to do. And I would just remind folks in the Obama administration, nearly 3 million people deported under Tom Homan overseeing that. And then, again, Trump actually had lower numbers of deportation in the first term. So, as he's talking about these mass deportations he's going to do, I would imagine that this is the individual who's going to be running him.

Those three candidates, Senator John Cornyn. John Thune and Rick Scott.Cornyn and Thune are seen as the frontrunners in this race. Rick Scott has support from people outside of the Senate, people who are aligned with Donald Trump, but Trump himself has not weighed in. Cornyn and Thune are seen as the favorites because they are long time senators. They fundraise for their members. They've done -- they've built inroads and people (INAUDIBLE), which gives them a leg up in the secret ballot election that will happen tomorrow. Now, on the House side, there's also a leadership election expected tomorrow afternoon after Donald Trump comes and meets with the House Republicans. Then they will actually vote to move on, decide who should be the next speaker of the House. Right now, the current speaker, Mike Johnson, believes he eventually will have the support in order to be elected speaker come next January. The question will be if anybody decides to try to undercut his bid. He could only afford, potentially, to lose a handful of votes, assuming Republicans keep the House. We have now projected that the Republicans will keep the House, but if they do, it would be a narrow majority, meaning he could only lose a handful of votes, Wolf, and that's one of the things that the speaker told me earlier today. He believes he will not have the problems that the past speaker, Kevin McCarthy, had. He says he believes he'll have the support and the support of Donald Trump as he comes to Capitol Hill tomorrow.",

You might be wondering, why would an immunity ruling that says that a president doing his official duties would be impacting a case that dealt with a campaign before he was president? Well, because there was testimony, according to Trump's lawyers, that would have fallen under the scope of immunized testimony in the form of official conduct. Hope Hicks testified, for example. They believe that's enough to throw out the entire results of that jury verdict.Now, the judge had said, tell me by today, what impact that would actually had. Now the parties got together and said, we need a little bit more time, one week from today, to really flush out these issues a little bit further. There is still a date of the 26th that is technically on the records of sorts to tenth NSM (ph), but it will likely be delayed if not. For a long time, indefinitely.",
