That's all the more extraordinary since it was that same president of Belarus who said in the days after the revolt that Prigozhin was living in Belarus. Prigozhin has not been seen in public for nearly two weeks now.Though it's unclear exactly where the Wagner leader is, we do see that Russian state media has launched what looks like a classic smear campaign against him, airing this footage of a purported police raid of his home, Prigozhin's home and office. There are some images that we're going to show you, some images of what they say, the things that they found in his has multiple passports, as you can see, a cupboard full of wigs and documents, multiple aliases on those passports, as well as ammunition and large amounts of cash. CNN's Matthew Chance is following all of this for us from Minsk, Belarus, this morning. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, invited us here to the Palace of Independence, this marble clad edifice in the center of Minsk. It's one of his presidential offices for a press conference, and what he said was a conversation about all the dramatic events that have been unfolding over the past couple of weeks. Of course, the main interest was the whereabouts of Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. So, I got a chance to ask Alexander Lukashenko what update he could give us about that mercenary group that, of course, staged a military uprising in Russia just last month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said the deal is still on the table is what he insisted, but it has not been finally agreed yet.Meanwhile, in Russia, on state television, we've been seeing these extraordinary images of what they say is Yevgeny Prigozhin's house, one of his houses in St. Petersburg, where police have raided and they have seized gold bars, cash, passports, some with false names, with Yevgeny Prigozhin's photographs, and wigs, strangely, which could be obviously used as disguise, weapons as well. And it all implies that Russia is sort of moving to discredit the Wagner leader, possibly ahead of arrest, although that's not been confirmed yet. I spoke to the Kremlin earlier today, and they said at the moment they're not commenting on it. But, clearly, the deal for Wagner and its leader to be exiled in Belarus is at the least being renegotiated, and that could end very badly indeed for Yevgeny Prigozhin.

WILLIAM TAYLOR, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPE AND RUSSIA AT U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE:  John, it's a great question, of course. We don't know. St. Petersburg is Prigozhin's home. That's where he came from. That's where Putin came from. That's where the Wagner headquarters is. And you've been showing the raids on those headquarters, so we don't know why he's there. The issue, the real issue, though, is the problem for Putin. I mean, here's a man who led -- Prigozhin, who led a mutiny, who killed some Russian soldiers, who was attacking up the M4 toward Moscow, and all of a sudden he's given amnesty. He's supposed to go to Belarus. He's not in Belarus. So, the deal that got him off the hook is undercooked (ph). The other interesting thing, John, is Prigozhin's deputy, or Prigozhin's accomplice, is a Russian general who hasn't been seen or heard from in a week.",

Overnight, a Russian missile struck an apartment building, killing five people and injuring dozens of others. You are looking at drone video there of the destruction.Right now, hundreds of rescue crews are on scene searching for people who may be buried alive in the rubble. We've now learned a 95-year-old World War II survivor was one of the residents killed in that attack. Let's go live to CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is in Ukraine for us. Ben, can you give us some sense of how these rescue efforts are going? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they're struggling. And the Ukrainians are used to dealing with this sort of catastrophe. Although it must be pointed out, Lviv is one of the quietest, calmest, most peaceful corners of Ukraine. It's very close to the Polish border, and many people have fled from the east, for instance, and taken refuge in that area. So, it's a city in shock. Now, we understand that the strike took place at 2:30 A.M., when everybody was asleep in that area. And it was struck by a Russian Kalibr missile. That is a hypersonic missile that carries more than a thousand pounds of high explosives. It's very accurate, and it flies so fast, it's difficult for air defenses to take it down. Now, also, we've learned that in Lviv, ten bomb shelters had been locked shut, perhaps because nobody expected that Lviv would be struck in this manner. So, now the local authorities, in addition to being busy with clearing away the rubble, looking for survivors, is also now investigating why that was done and why people could not take shelter when they desperately needed it.

They wanted the warrant, and so they had a bunch of details at that time.It's not detail that we haven't seen in the indictment. It very much tracks what is charged, what Walt Nauta is accused of doing when he was indicted last month. But this document we have from court from last August now, it highlights how the Justice Department had video of him apparently going in and out of this storage room. They write, on May 30th, four days after Witness Five, so that, we believe, is Walt Nauta after his interview with the FBI, during with the location of boxes, was a significant subject of questioning. Witness Five, Nauta is observed exiting the anteroom around a storage area, anteroom doorway with approximately 50 boxes. So, that's something that the Justice Department had back then, even before that search video.
