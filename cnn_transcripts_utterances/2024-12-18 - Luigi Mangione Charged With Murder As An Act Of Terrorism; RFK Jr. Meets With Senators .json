GAYNOR:  No. What I heard was not only the vice president thinking a critical part of her base of support -- I mean, she won the youth vote -- the 18 to 24, that 25 to 30. She beat Donald Trump in those categories. And I saw a vice president who is trying to engage a base that she will need if she wants to run again for president. There's been a lot of reporting about the vice president weighing whether or not she should run for the nomination in 2028 or run for governor in 2026. And the youth vote is critical for her because she's been engaging young voters even before she was the nominee in 2024 election.

The attorneys will get all the discovery, which is the information they need to fight the case. And then it's game on.
