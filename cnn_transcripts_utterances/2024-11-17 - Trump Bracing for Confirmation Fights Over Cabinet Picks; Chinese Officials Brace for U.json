He was accompanied by several allies and newly selected administration picks, including his choice for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his choice for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as Elon Musk, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and you'll see Kid Rock as well. Not there was Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of Defense, after new information emerged about a scandal involving Pete Hegseth. His attorney says Hegseth paid the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017, but denies assaulting her. The payment was part of a settlement that included a confidentiality agreement. Hegseth's attorney says the incident was a consensual sexual encounter. Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit in connection with the incident. Meanwhile, Trump has selected the head of the fracking company, or a fracking company, to be his Secretary of Energy. He's a man who's expressed doubt that climate change is linked to extreme weather. CNN's Steve Contorno has more from West Palm Beach, Florida. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Wright is the CEO of Liberty Energy, a company that services oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Along with his wife, he is also a major Republican fundraiser, and he's also someone who does not necessarily believe in man-made climate change.In fact, he has said there is no climate crisis. Of course, that is a belief that Donald Trump also holds, though it is notable given the department that he will oversee. He will also be named to the newly formed Council of National Energy. That will be chaired as well by Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, who is also named by Trump as his Secretary of the Interior. Even as Trump builds out his incoming administration, he continues to face questions about some of his picks that he has already made, including Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. Gaetz is a figure who has many enemies on Capitol Hill for starting intraparty fights over the years. He is also the subject of multiple investigations into alleged sexual misconduct. And Trump remains steadfast in his determination to get Gaetz across the finish line, despite concerns that he cannot get the 51 votes in the U.S. Senate to be confirmed. A source telling CNN on Saturday that Trump remains, quote, \"100% committed\" to seeing Matt Gaetz through and believes that he is one of the most important, if not the most important appointments of his cabinet. This source telling CNN he is not going to back off. He's all in on Matt Gaetz. Steve Contorno, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He says that, that approach is driving America towards bankruptcy. Instead, Musk is pushing for Howard Lutnick, a staunch Trump supporter who runs investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald. Musk insists Lutnick will, quote, \"actually enact change.\" [05:05:00] Senior officials in China trying to determine what Trump's second term will mean for their country. Trump's cabinet picks include China hawks Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Mike Waltz as well as National Security Adviser. That's raising concern in Beijing on a range of issues including trade and territorial claims in the South China Sea. Chinese officials see a possibility for communication through alternate channels such as Elon Musk. The Tesla owner has a huge factory in Shanghai, but the unpredictability of Trump himself remains a huge concern as China holds out for hope of cooperation in that relationship. Those concerns loomed over the final meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. Meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Lima, Peru, the leaders agreed that A.I. should never be allowed to control nuclear weapons. President Xi emphasized the need for stability in the U.S.-China relationship, whilst Mr. Biden raised issues including Taiwan and the presence of North Korean troops in Ukraine, which he called deeply dangerous. For more, CNN's Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. I guess this was a chance for President Biden to, you know, speak to his legacy, tie up some loose ends as much as he could.",

This is a meeting where both sides had a mission, and from this vantage point, at least it appears to be mission accomplished.Let's first talk about President-elect Biden. He has a relationship with Xi Jinping that dates back about a decade from when he was vice president. This meeting was perhaps a way to wrap things up and to reflect back on this decade-long relationship. It was not always an easy one either. In fact, I'm thinking back to early 2023 when the U.S. shot down a Chinese balloon. That caused an entire diplomatic freeze. Eventually, channels were re-established and things thawed out. And since that time, we have seen regular diplomatic visits by American officials here to Beijing, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, as well as National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. And then last year at APEC, we also saw the two world leaders meet face-to-face for what were substantive conversations. But for right now, at this moment for President Biden, it is a moment to take a look back, as also to perhaps set the tone for the future, despite the unknowns of what a new administration may bring. Let's take a listen to President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: These conversations prevent miscalculations and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict, competition, not conflict. That's our responsibility to our people. And as you indicated to the people around the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I say unpredictability because during the first, his first term, many diplomats in China laid awake at night wondering what was going to happen next.So as far as the Chinese side of this meeting, President Xi Jinping very much was trying to convey this message of communication and stability. And it's very noteworthy the language he used. He talked about phrases such as win-win cooperation and mutual respect, peaceful coexistence. And some of the very phrases that he used in his congratulatory message to President-elect Trump. But Max, there will likely be hurdles ahead. As you mentioned, Marco Rubio, likely to be incoming secretary of state. He is a well-known China hawk. And then there are some very thorny issues, including trade and tariff issues that the Trump administration has hinted will come very early on. China has this practice of if you hurt us, we will hurt you back. And so it is going to make this a very difficult and perhaps challenging relationship for both governments as we watch the Trump presidency move forward early next year, Max.",

Israel says it took steps to mitigate harm to civilians from the strikes. Iran says it was caught off guard by reports that its U.N. ambassador recently met with Elon Musk. Tehran categorically denies the meeting ever even happened and says it was surprised by the coverage in the U.S. media. The \"Associated Press\" and the \"New York Times\" said the two met earlier this week allegedly discussing ways to dial down the tensions. The alleged meeting raised questions about Musk's influence on future U.S. foreign policy. He has already been picked as a co-leader of what has been dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency. But Musk will only be an advisor and it is still unclear how that body will actually operate. Well, Russia has launched one of its largest air attacks across Ukraine over the past few hours. Ukrainian air defenses can be seen shooting down incoming missiles in the skies over Kyiv early on Sunday. At least two people have been killed and eight wounded. Officials in Ukraine say the attacks targeted energy facilities using both drones and missiles. Blasts could be heard across the country including the western regions. Residents in Kyiv were forced to take shelter in underground train stations during the attacks. Ukraine's Foreign Minister slammed Russia for launching air attacks against \"peaceful cities,\" sleeping civilians and critical infrastructure.

But we got video from Friday showing one of his assistants preparing to ship the luxury watch collection via FedEx to both Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. Now, this is a remarkable fall from grace for the former mayor of New York City, a man who was once referred to as America's mayor and it's been a long running saga after he accused Moss and Freeman of having something to do with rigging the election which of course we know did not happen. Now, in the last several months, Giuliani has tried to delay this judgment at first by arguing that he was bankrupt, that proceeding was thrown out of court after he failed to comply with basic requirements of the court. And now by saying that he wants to be able to hold on to some of the items. There are some things in the list of things that Giuliani has to turn over that the judge will still get to decide on. But for now, the process has started. Now, we're talking about $148 million judgment against Giuliani. So the reality is that it's unlikely he'll ever be able to fully pay what he owes to Moss and Freeman. But for now, by turning over his watch collection as well as his apartment, some of the sports memorabilia as well as the car, it seems that that process has finally gotten started.
