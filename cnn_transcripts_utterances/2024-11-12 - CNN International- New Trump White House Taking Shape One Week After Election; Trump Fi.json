She would work alongside two immigration hardliners who Trump has also picked for senior roles, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan. Both served during Trump's first term. And according to a source, Trump has also asked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz to serve as National Security Advisor. He joins the people, you see here, just one week out from the election.For more on all the transition developments, let's bring in CNN's Steve Contorno.

      "sentences": "Well, it's very clear, Rahel, that Donald Trump is very focused on getting his immigration priorities front and center early in this transition process. He has built out a team that includes, as you said, Kristi Noem leading the Department of Homeland Security, and working with Tom Homan as sort of a border czar, and Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration policies, will be White House Deputy Chief of Staff. And that triumvirate will obviously have incredible power and importance and influence in Donald Trump's administration, as he carries out his plans for a border wall and mass deportation.And then, Mike Waltz is an interesting figure, because he will be in charge of national security advisor of the President-elect, and he is someone who has been staunchly pro-Trump almost immediately since he came onto the scene, but his background is as more of a Bush-era Republican. He is someone who worked in the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld. He has advised Dick Cheney in the past. All of these are figures that have been very much not in line with Donald Trump's foreign policy agenda and the way that he has pulled back the U.S. from the world stage. And so, it -- but he is -- it just shows you that if you are someone who is -- demonstrates your bonafides as someone who appreciates the former President, President-elect Donald Trump, and someone who is loyal to him that he is willing to overlook your resume if you are promising to uphold his -- what his priorities are.",

Certainly, their history is well documented, and as you pointed out, they were rivals on the stage in 2016, and a big part of Rubio's case against Donald Trump was that he felt he was not prepared for going toe-to-toe with other world leaders, and that it was not safe to have Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear football. But now, eight years later, he has aligned himself closely with the former President and President-elect. He has campaigned aggressively for Donald Trump.I will say it is an interesting choice, given the saber rattling we have seen from Rubio, especially in regards to Iran and China. He is someone who has been in favor of regime change in certain parts of Latin America. He worked closely with John Bolton, who is obviously an adversary of Trump's now. So, it's still a pick that doesn't necessarily jibe with what Trump has said about his foreign policy priorities, but it's someone who he has grown very close to in recent years.",

Steve, thank you.And the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial has delayed his decision on whether the President-elect's conviction on 34 counts should be overturned. Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office have both agreed to delay further hearings on the case until November 19th. This gives the Trump team time to make new arguments on how his election as President impacts the case. In May, you might remember, a jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records to cover up a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we were waiting today for the judge overseeing this case to decide whether the conviction stands or whether it would be set aside. That was based on the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity, and Trump's lawyers were moving for a dismissal. Prosecutors said they had plenty of evidence in this case anyway, and it should stand.But, what we learned instead was that both sides had been talking over the weekend, and Trump's lawyers had said they wanted to ask the judge to postpone both today's decision on immunity and the sentencing in light of Trump being elected President, and some of the issues that are raised there, a President-elect going into office while facing state charges, and whether a state judge could do anything on the criminal sphere while there is a federal official in office. Now, the DA's office saying that they agree that these are unprecedented times, and they asked the judge for one week to come back to him with a plan of what they think should happen. So, that's what the judge agreed to today. He said prosecutors have until 10:00 a.m. next Tuesday to tell them how they think that they should proceed moving forward. So, big question will be, does the DA'S office want the judge to move forward with the ruling on this immunity question and whether the conviction stands, or do they say that that should be set aside until Trump is out of office four years from now? Also, of course, whether he is sentenced if, in fact, this conviction stands, with the calendar the way that it is, it seems very unlikely that they would get a sentencing in on this case just based on the pure timeline. Of course, though, that will be ultimately up to the judge to decide how he wants to handle this, but the prosecution will give them their recommendation. Meantime, Trump's lawyers are still saying that this conviction should be thrown out because Trump was in office when some of the evidence that entered into the case came in, such as tweets that he had made, and also saying that, because he is going to be back in office, that this case should just be satisfied. Rahel. SOLOMON: OK. Keep us poster. Kara Scannell, thank you. And as Donald Trump rounds out with his team, Republican lawmakers are hoping to seize unified control in Washington. So, at this point, we are still waiting for final results in 14 House races. Republicans only need three more seats to hold on to the majority, while Democrats are 12 seats away from taking control. In the Senate, a secret ballot election is expected to take place on Wednesday to decide who will lead the chamber where Republicans now have control. Within the last hour, House Speaker Mike Johnson spoke about his party's gains last week. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): This is a very, very important moment for the country, and we cannot take it lightly. We flipped blue seats to red, as we planned, and we kept this majority. We expect that the majority will be larger than last time. We still have a number of races outstanding, but we're very optimistic about those, and we are looking forward to governing in unified government beginning in January. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Democrats have to look at what happened with Latino men and whether there is a enduring cultural gap there, and obviously some of her positions on LGBTQ issues hurt her. But, the through line in this election is one that we have seen before. I mean, there is simply no precedent for a party holding the White House when an outgoing President is facing the level of discontent that Biden was. I mean, we know that when incumbents who have the level of disapproval that Biden did run for re-election, they tend to lose, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Trump himself in 2020.What's discussed less is that even when that President chooses to or has to step aside, his party has also lost the White House. Harry Truman in 1952 was unpopular. Republicans won. LBJ in 1968, deeply unpopular with the war and inflation, Republican won. And of course, in 2008, when Bush had to leave amid the financial crisis and discontent over the war in Iraq, Democrats won. So, yes, there is a lot going on, but in the end, 60 percent of voters said they disapproved of Biden's performance, and over four fifths of them voted for Trump.

Trump is anything but a normal candidate, but voters kind of treated him that way. To a large extent, we had the normal hydraulics of American politics. When people are down on one party, they move toward the other. That doesn't mean, as you noted, they have completely erased all of their concerns about Trump. I mean, between the exit polls and the vote cast survey, which are the two competing measures of how voter attitudes, we saw a majority of voters said they thought Trump was too extreme. A majority said they worried he would steer the country toward authoritarianism. A majority opposed mass deportation. A majority supported legal abortion rights. But, in each case, a significant slice of voters with those viewsvoted for Trump. In effect, they decided that an unpredictable future was less of a risk than the unacceptable present. And obviously, if Trump can deliver economic results that give people more of a sense of security and stability, he is going to be in a very strong position. But, if they are still feeling economically insecure in two years, and he has pursued a lot of these policies, sweeping tariffs, mass deportation, rollbacks of civil liberties, that voters still are expressing resistance about, hesitation about, at least, the picture could look very different in 2026 and 2028.",

Today is 30 days from when the United States sent that letter, demanding that Israeli authorities take steps to improve the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that letter came directly from the Secretary of State, from the Secretary of Defense, and it made really clear the number of steps that Israel needed to take and the kind of benchmarks that were laid out for what accomplishing those goals would actually look like. The United States has yet to actually say officially whether or not Israel has improved on those numerous criteria and whether or not they will impose consequences as a result of that.But, a group of eight humanitarian aid organizations say that Israel has failed to meet the criteria set forth in that letter, and that also they are arguing that Israel has also taken steps that have actually worsened the humanitarian situation in Gaza over the course of the last month. Now, it's clear, when you look simply at the number of trucks that are actually getting into Gaza that Israel is nowhere close to reaching the target of 350 aid trucks that the United States set forth in its letter. If you look at October, just 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to Israeli authorities, 75 per day on average this month of November so far. Israel has opened a new crossing into central Gaza today. They also slightly expanded that humanitarian zone in Gaza, although we should note that that zone has also been subject to Israeli airstrikes, just like other parts of the Gaza Strip. And we are also seeing in northern Gaza, where the humanitarian situation has been most acute. Yesterday, you actually had the first aid trucks in over a month reaching the northern Gaza city of Beit Hanoun, three trucks loaded with food, canned food, water as well as flour, that actually reached that city. But, this morning, local residents as well as the World Food Program reported that Israeli troops then entered and surrounded the area where that aid had been delivered and ordered residents to leave. And so, you are just seeing as even the glimmers of hope that are coming on the horizon in Gaza are being extinguished just as quickly. U.S. officials are still meeting with their Israeli counterparts to work on some last-minute improvements in the humanitarian aid situation in Gaza. And I expect that next week, perhaps once U.S. officials have had time to convene and take stock of the situation in Gaza, we will get a better sense of whether or not the U.S. will impose any consequences for Israel, clearly not meeting those criteria outlined in that letter.

This is the 29th COP. It just took 28 of them to acknowledge the source of the problems is fossil fuels. And this morning, the President of Azerbaijan, the host country, said that their gas reserves are a gift from God, and chided fake news Western media for talking about the need to decarbonize. So, it's all over the map. It has always been messy these particular negotiations. But, in 2015, the Paris Accord was this sort of singular cooperation, almost 200 countries, and a lot of progress came out of that.So, the earnest delegates in Baku are sort of focused on that that this is going to be a struggle. COP20 or -- COP35, COP50, and this is going to go on for a long time. The question is, can the financing that they set their sights on this particular COP, the rich countries kicking in a hopeful trillion dollars to pay for developing nations to brace for the ravages of climate change, can that happen now that Donald Trump has essentially said, we're out? We're not giving one red cent to anyone else around the world. The America First policies, he is vowing to just take hold.

This was his answer then.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEE ZELDIN (R), FORMER NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think we would be very productive if we could just get to exactly what is real and what is not real, because I think both sides of the climate change debate are filled with people who are stretching truths.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, Rahel, is trying to Trump-proof a lot of these things, including new methane regulations that were in the IRA. Maybe it will take an act of Congress to roll those back.

New data from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says that sexist comments, including \"Your body, my choice\" and \"get back to the kitchen\", are trending online. White nationalists and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes posted the \"Your body, my choice. Forever\" message on election night. It has since been reposted more than 35,000 times, and experts worry that the online harassment could carry over into the real world.Let's bring in CNN's Clare Duffy, who joins us now with more. So, Clare, give us a sense of how bad this seems to be getting. CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yeah. Rahel, it is really significant. These are the kinds of characters and the kinds of language that have existed in dark corners of the internet for a long time, but it appears that they are feeling more emboldened by the results of this election, where we know there was so much focus on women's rights, women's bodily autonomy. This surge in online abuse really started with that Nick Fuentes post on Tuesday night. But, since then, according to this analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, reposts of that phrase have surged 4,000 percent on X. The group also, as you said, recorded increases in the use of the phrase \"get back to the kitchen\", calls to repeal the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. And this is all part of what researchers are saying is the growth of the so-called manosphere, these online misogynistic communities where the discussion ranges from anti-feminism to outright threats of violence towards women. And there are some women who are already being targeted, specifically with this kind of language. There are women who have posted to TikTok, saying, \"Your body, my choice\" is showing up in their comments, in their DMs. After writing the story yesterday, I actually woke up to an email in my inbox with that phrase, and lots of other ugliness that I won't repeat on television, in my inbox. And so, I think the fear for experts really is that we start to see this online language move offline in terms of harassment and abuse that could manifest in the real world. Rahel.",

Joining me now to dive deeper is Eric Liu. Eric is the CEO and Co- founder of Citizen University, which is a nonprofit organization promoting civic empowerment. He also served as Deputy Assistant to President Bill Clinton. Eric, great to have you. The reason why we booked you is because of a piece that you wrote in 2016 that we thought might still be really helpful in 2024, and you argued in that piece that even after the 2016 election, that Americans don't need reconciliation. They actually need to get better at arguing. How so?",

But, the point that I was trying to make was even as toxically divided as we are and polarized, and what we were just hearing about the kind of nature of quote, unquote \"debate online\", it is getting more poisonous in many ways. As much as that is true that what we actually need to remember is that it's OK to argue that America is an argument.America is, by definition and by design, a perpetual set of tensions among principles that may sound like they're all good and happy, liberty and equality, but you realize when you spend two seconds thinking about it that liberty and equality are always in tension with one another, that the strong emphasis on a strong national government is always in tension with local control, that a colorblind approach to the Constitution and law is always in conflict with an emphasis on color consciousness and racial justice, that these are baked into the way that we live as Americans, and that the point of American life right now should not be to have fewer arguments. It should be to have less stupid arguments. And I don't mean that just as a glib throwaway line. It is possible to have better arguments. A group of us, after I wrote that piece in 2016, came together and created a project called The Better Arguments Project that lays out a whole set of principles about how we can have more productive ways of disagreeing and engaging with each other, but it starts with that premise that we are not uniform, and that to be unified as a country does not require unanimity, that we should accept a certain amount of division always, but that the way that we've got to do this is both to have more productive arguments, but also ones that do not dehumanize us across the board, so that we stop thinking about each other as full, complicated people.",

Now, that's almost radical in our culture right now, where the whole point of online and other forms of engagement is to own the other side, to crush them, humiliate them, to kind of score points off them, and that kind of culture leads us nowhere. But, if you actually, sincerely, as a matter of personal, almost spiritual commitment, say, I'm going to engage with somebody who sees the world different from me, not to change their mind, not to show that they're wrong, not to bombard them with facts, as I see them, but actually just to understand, if you try to engage not to win but to understand, you totally shift the energy, and you totally make possible a different form of engagement.And to me, a better argument is one where people leave holding the same general worldview they might have come into the argument with, but they can no longer actually say all those people, those people, and dehumanize them and put them in a flat, caricatured box, you suddenly realize, oh, this is a person who I understand now. I get their worldview. I get what experience, what trauma, what triumph, what things shape the way that they see things, and I can kind of relate to some part of it, at least. And to me, that is the point of a better argument to be able to understand rather than win. And I get, but that sounds radical, almost naive, but it's not. It is a deep ethical commitment to re-humanizing each other.",
