And it is indicative of the tone, I think, of the speech, of this hour-long speech, which was extremely combative and divisive.And one could even say, maybe catered to who was inside the room, because it's important to know who was not in the room. And that's dozens of democratic lawmakers, some who boycotted the speech, some who attended alternative events with families of hostages and other events, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said it was one of the worst speech from a foreign dignitary ever. That was her quote on Twitter. And it's significant because this was his fourth speech to Congress. That's more than any foreign dignitary, any world leader has ever addressed U.S. lawmakers. Winston Churchill spoke to lawmakers three times, four times for Netanyahu. So extremely significant to also see what he did not speak of in the speech, and that's very intensive ceasefire negotiations that are underway. That was barely mentioned.

She could be president in a matter of months, but we don't really know her position. She's just been in lockstep with Biden. What vision will she present?

They said that there was an incident and a report of an assault at Greater Manchester Airport. We believe this happened on Tuesday.They responded, three officers were apparently injured, including one female officer who had her nose broken. And that is what led to this incident that you see on the video there. Now, as you say, we can't independently verify it, but they are very much trying to get out in front of it. They are providing that context, but they are not trying to justify it. Greater Manchester Police themselves are calling this truly shocking. They have, as you say now, suspended one officer from all duties. They initially just suspended him from active duties, and they have referred themselves for investigation to the U.K.'s police watchdog. But look, this is a case, I think, of where videos have gone viral online, and that has escalated the situation on the ground. We then saw that protest at that police station in Rochdale, which is an area outside of Greater Manchester -- what's inside Greater Manchester, outside the city of Manchester, which has a very large Muslim population. We don't know yet the identity or the religion of the men involved. We also don't know their condition. But Paul Waugh, who is the MP for Rochdale, he's come out and said that one of the men arrested was from Rochdale. He plans to meet with them today, so we may get more on that. And Tell Mama U.K., which is a group here in the U.K. which tracks anti-Muslim attacks, has put out several tweets on this, and they say that clearly there needs to be some very serious community engagement by Greater Manchester Police to calm things down. So that is what we see now, a real concerted effort from police, from local officials to try to engage with the community to diffuse these tensions. But obviously, as you say, this will raise questions in the U.K. about disproportionate force by police and about the potential for racism, which is a charge that has been levelled against British police forces, including specifically Greater Manchester Police.",
