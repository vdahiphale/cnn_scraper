White House officials say Joe Biden, though, will meet with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. The NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced Monday that Turkey dropped its year-long objection to Sweden's membership. In turn, Sweden appears to be supporting Turkish membership to the E.U. That's according to Turkey's state-run news agency. Sweden's defense minister says Turkey's decision to endorse the country will strengthen the security of both. A similar sentiment echoed by the head of the military alliance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, that's why he is particularly hesitant to do this.Now, I don't detect among many of the NATO members, a lot of enthusiasm for letting Ukraine in during the war, but obviously there is a lot of enthusiasm for letting them in immediately thereafter. And you know, Zelenskyy makes a good point which is they are de facto not only acting as a member -- I mean the United States, NATO, other NATO nations are supplying arms, but they are now probably the biggest and most effective military and certainly the most battle-tested in all of Europe, and therefore NATO might make sense.

After months where this judicial overhaul was frozen in place essentially months ago after this massive general strike and protest that froze Israel into place, the Defense minister even coming out against his own government's plan, now Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are starting to bring it back.It looks a little bit different. It's a little bit watered down. And it's being done in a very slow piecemeal fashion. But the legislation that was brought to its first vote on Monday night would strip these Israeli Supreme Court's ability of being able to declare a government action as being unreasonable. They have rather broad powers right now to say that even if a government action didn't necessarily break any laws, that it is unreasonable and cannot stand. And this legislation would attempt to strip that away. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has watered down other aspects of the judicial overhaul, namely the ability of the Israeli Parliament to overturn supreme court decisions with a simple majority. Those have been taken off the table, but the other elements are still there. And the protesters and the opposition essentially are saying we don't believe when the government says that this will be a softer version of this judicial overhaul, and they are still taking to the streets. They've actually never gone off the streets, even while there were compromised negotiations trying to take place at the Israeli president's residence, even while this legislation was technically frozen in place, Israeli protesters were still taking to the street on a regular basis. And on Monday evening, they were on the floor of the Israeli parliament trying to stage some sort of sit-in. They were forcibly removed by parliament security. And then on Tuesday is this day of disruption being planned from the morning until the evening. Israeli protesters saying they're going to essentially try to disrupt daily life in Israel, including at the airport, at Ben Gurion Airport just outside of Tel Aviv, as well as at important embassy buildings throughout the country from different countries, and along the really the heart of Tel Aviv, downtown, Tel Aviv and the main highway there. We've seen these types of massive protests in the past. And the goal of these protesters is to try to once again encourage important figures such as the defense minister, such as other ministers who may be supporting their efforts to come out once again against this judicial overhaul. Even this piecemeal legislation, the slow pace that they plan to take it and to come out against it because for these protesters, the only way that they will really come off the streets is if this judicial overhaul is completely off the table.

The question to me is, yes, people are definitely leaving Twitter and going to Threads. A lot of my peer group, plus people I know have gone from Twitter to Threads.But they're also going from Instagram. That's a complicated question for Meta. To the larger question of what Twitter can do, well, they'll have to fix some of their basic infrastructure. They need to stop crashing. And then they need to position themselves in a way that is like what they've been doing but much better. They gave to make themselves the place for real interesting discourse, new ideas. Because Threads is saying, Hey, we don't want that. We don't want politics. We don't want discourse. We just want to be, you know, celebrity talk, sports, the same stuff that's on Instagram. Twitter does have a real opportunity to say, Well, we're the public square. We're where real conversations happen. They just need to be able to do it in a way where the site doesn't crash or people don't feel as uncomfortable as they sometimes do now.",

Who does the measuring? Is it winner take all? So far, Zuckerberg hasn't responded. But you know, is this Elon Musk unhinged? Is he having a joke, diverting attention?

That has been clear for many years.He particularly doesn't like Mark Zuckerberg this week, now that Mark Zuckerberg has undercut him and is taking away all those people who are using Twitter. As to what he was saying in that repulsive tweet, I think he's probably having a joke, and I also think that, for the sake of the company, he should throw away his phone. I mean, this -- one of the problems Twitter has is they need to attract advertisers. They need to make people comfortable. Musk, he can be wonderfully funny on Twitter. He's honestly one of the smartest people in the world. But if I were the CEO of Twitter, I would try to filter some of what he says, like that tweet that you just read.",
