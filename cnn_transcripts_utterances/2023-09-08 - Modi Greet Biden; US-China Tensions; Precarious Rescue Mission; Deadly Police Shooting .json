Hurricane Lee intensified with exceptional speed. Why monster storms are becoming more common. Jimmy Fallon apologizes over allegations of a difficult work environment on \"The Tonight Show.\" Live from Dubai, it is Friday, September 8th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Welcome to the show, and tonight the leaders of the US and India are praising their country's cooperation on trade and technology ahead of the G20 Summit marked by the absence of China. President Biden arrived in New Delhi on Friday, one day before the gathering starts. He went straight to a meeting with Prime Minister Modi, where the two announced a range of agreements. The weekend Summit is expected to be more fractious. Look, discussions on potential joint declarations have been difficult. Chinese President Xi Jinping is skipping this year's Summit as Russian President Vladimir Putin is too as well. Ivan Watson is at the G20 in New Delhi. He joins me now. Ivan, great to have you on. It's more about who is not going to be there, it seems for this year's G20. We know the White House has said it is disappointing that the leaders of Russia and China will not be attending, but what can we expect? What are we expecting over the next few days?",

Well, Prime Minister Modi is hoping to shine a spotlight on his country's achievements at the event. Signs around the Summit show his face as he aims to highlight his role as a global statesman. Mr. Modi has been on a campaign to beautify the area. The government has cleared slums and removed stray dogs in preparation for the gathering. It comes as the government seeks to wield its influence in both the G20 and among BRICS countries. Ravi Agrawal is the editor-in-chief at \"Foreign Policy.\" He used to serve as CNN's New Delhi bureau chief, and he joins me now. Ravi, great to have you on. It is quite an event that we're expecting in New Delhi, look -- and there's a lot that's happening. We're focusing on China, we know why the Russian president will not be there and we see the US president arriving a day early. How important is this G20 Summit in the context of what's going on globally on the geopolitical front. RAVI AGRAWAL, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"FOREIGN POLICY\": It's really important. I mean, look, this is a month of Summits. We just had the BRICS Summit in South Africa, the UN General Assembly meetings are coming up in September, and all of this comes amid a very troubled time for multilateralism. The world is more fractured than it's been in three decades, really with competition between the United States and China ramping up, and the world sort of fracturing into bloc, as it were. Even Russia's war on Ukraine, which United so much of Europe has divided the rest of the world, as we've seen with countries that are unwilling to condemn Russia and India as among those. The G20 amid all of this is incredibly important because it brings together so many countries, and not only that, it is trying to expand. I think, Ivan mentioned this, but if the G20 does end up also including the African Union from next year onwards, making it a much bigger G21, covering a large part of the world that would make the G20 a much more powerful, more inclusive organization, kind of setting it up against the G7, the BRICS, and other groups that have become more powerful on the global stage, especially the G7. That's one thing. The other thing as again, Ivan alluded to, was debt relief. If the G20 under India's leadership is able to provide more instruments for debt relief for the Global South, better interest rates, for example; more money for the World Bank and the IMF to deploy at better lending rates for countries like Nigeria, which spends 90 percent of its GDP servicing debt, then that would be a huge accomplishment to emerge from this. But as you pointed out, Eleni, all of this is a big PR exercise for India.",

Giving the global south a bigger voice, does that amplify the strength of the G20, and perhaps, you know, do away with the conversation and the fear that the global power axis might be shifting dramatically, of course, with what we've been seeing with Russia and Ukraine, and of course, the rise of BRICS?",

You know, Xi Jinping has traveled afair bit this year, after not traveling for a while. But two things really strike me. One is, China has an unresolved border crisis with India. This shines a spotlight on that and that is not good for India. So India is quite upset by that, maybe China thinks it's getting something out of that. But the other thing, I think, is that this is a missed opportunity in that Xi Jinping doesn't get to meet US President Joe Biden on the sidelines. That's a setback for US-China relations and it's something that isn't good for the world. Clearly, Xi Jinping has thought through these things, so maybe that's what he wants.",

That's when Jenni Hermoso told the prosecutor that Rubiales began pressuring her and his associates began pressuring her and her -- those close to her to put out a statement in defense of Rubiales saying that nothing untoward had happened. Now, that pressure, according to this new statement by the prosecutor could constitute harassment and that's where that coercion part comes in. It's still a while to go. It is a long legal process.

But he is a great hardcore player.And he's played the role of disrupter as well throughout his career, especially here at the U.S. Open and he's won here as well. He has a slam title to his credit here in Queens. So anything could happen. Carlos Alcaraz has had a very smooth trip about as smooth as you can get to get to this point. So far, he hasn't been challenged really physically or mentally. So that one is a little bit up in the air, but I think a lot of people are expecting Alcaraz to probably meet Novak Djokovic in the final. It was interesting to listen to both Novak Djokovic and Ben Shelton come into Arthur Ashe Stadium just a short time ago. The crowd really was -- I would say pro Novak at the beginning. They gave the 23-time Grand Slam champion a huge ovation when he came in. But there's a lot of support for Ben Shelton as well. This 20-year-old American who burst out onto the scene at this year's U.S. Open and who right now looks a little bit tight. There are some nerves kicking in. We've seen that big surf that we expected from Ben Shelton, but this one still TBD with Novak Djokovic leaving somewhat comfortably in the first set.",

I mean, what's so exciting about the women's side is that it's so wide open, you have so many interesting,unique women that you could potentially root for, from all around the world who come to these slams and content. And I think that's why your point is so well taken. It's so exciting to watch women's tennis right now. For Coco Gauff, 19 years old on the very brink of winning her first slam right here at home. A home slam at the U.S. Open would just be sort of storybook and really full circle for her when you consider the fact that back in 2012 as a young eight-year-old, she was kind of bouncing around the grounds here at Arthur Ashe Stadium during fan week. And who could know at that point in time, what her life would look like right now. So many people have been waiting to crown her as tennis' next big player on the women's side. And she's retooled her game over the summer. And now she looks very confident. She runs into Aryna Sabalenka who's an extremely talented power hitter with a huge surf who has also made very deep runs at every single slam this year. So, this is going to be a tough test for Coco. It should be very quality tennis. Whoever serves best is likely going to survive the contest, but I'm glad you'll be watching. I think a lot of other people will be as well because it is -- it's too good to pass up.",

During a Zoom, Fallon reportedly told his colleagues that he was embarrassed and hadn't intended to create that type of atmosphere. Rolling Stone based its reporter on 16 current and former staffers who spoke to the magazine anonymously. They describe living in a constant state of fear and said they hid in crying rooms and walked on eggshells. NBC responded saying it's proud of The Tonight Show, and that the network's top priority is to provide a respectful work environment. We've got Oliver Darcy standing by to give us what insight into this news. I mean, that Rolling Stone article really fascinating describing a very toxic environment. Frankly, perhaps that happens far too often in the media industry. But interestingly, Jimmy Fallon coming out and apologizing and also saying it was embarrassing.",

But the staffers again, they're telling Rolling Stone that off camera, behind the scenes, it's a totally different Fallon. Someone who was quick to anger, someone who is difficult to please at times. And the story, you know, it was deeply reported. It was relying on 16 current and former staffers, but the reporter said she reached out to dozens more. People looking for even just supports for the late-night host. She'd said that most of the show runners, all the show runners, except the current one had not issued any support for Fallon which is a little bit not usual. Usually, you would expect a former show runner to show their support publicly for the person that they work for. And in this case, none of them did except the current one. And so, I think that speaks to really the environment that has taken place behind the scenes at the Tonight Show, you know, in the industry, it's not known as maybe the best place to work. Hopefully now that this new showrunner is in, NBC thinks that they can improve the workplace environment and since this is detailed how poor it has been behind the scenes. Hopefully that also gives them additional motivation to really clean up -- clean up the workplace.",
