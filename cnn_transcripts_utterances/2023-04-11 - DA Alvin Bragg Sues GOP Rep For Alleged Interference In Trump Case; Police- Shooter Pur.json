      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly is getting more acrimonious, Bianna. We've learned that the Manhattan District Attorney's office has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the subpoena from Jim Jordan's committee, the House Judiciary Committee that they made last week to one of the top prosecutors who worked on this investigation.Now, Jim Jordan has also reached out to the district attorney's office, Bragg saying they wanted him to come in and testify. But this is a significant step forward to combat this effort. Bragg's lawsuit is alleging that this is an unconstitutional effort by Congress to try to interfere in a state prosecution. They also say that Congress has no power to supervise or to get involved in state investigations. So they're asking the judge here to block the subpoena for the former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz' testimony. He had a deadline of April 20th, that's next week to report to Congress to give his testimony. They're also asking the judge to stop any future subpoenas to Bragg or to any current or former prosecutors from that office who have worked on this investigation. I mean, interestingly, in this lawsuit Bragg's office is also alleging that Jim Jordan and other Republican congressmen have been involved in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation and obstruction. And they cite the former President Trump's own threatening statements to Bragg and you'll recall that Bragg's office did receive a letter with suspicious white powder in it. It was deemed to be non-hazardous. But Bragg's office saying that these threats, these statements of intimidation by Trump were not denounced by these Republican congressmen and instead they said that the House Republicans were participating in these threatening efforts, Bianna?

But Jordan is still planning to press ahead with their efforts to probe Alvin Bragg's investigation into Donald Trump as well as to target decisions that Bragg himself has made as a prosecutor in Manhattan.On Monday, they plan to have a field hearing in Manhattan to spotlight what Republicans say is Bragg's, in their view, lacks of prosecutorial discretion against violent crime in Manhattan. They are making clear that they want to argue that Bragg's decision to go ahead and press ahead with charges for Donald Trump was a political one, in their view, and at the expense of other more serious actions. So they are using the power of their majority to essentially discredit Alvin Bragg and they have made no secret of their desire to potentially to push ahead with legislation. Legislation that in their view would prevent prosecutors, local prosecutors from potentially charging a presidential candidate and prevent them from doing that in the future. No real language has been drafted on that yet, but that is the idea going forward. In Bragg's lawsuit itself, it does criticize that effort saying there is no legitimate legislative purpose to go after the investigation suggesting that there's no constitutional authority to investigate a single prosecutors probe. But don't expect Republicans in the House to take this lightly, expect some pushback. Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House has supported the efforts by Jordan along with two other House committee chairmen to try to target Alvin Bragg. They are on recess right now guys, but expect next week this to be a major focus for the House Republican majority to defend Donald Trump, even as some Republicans including some Senate Republicans want to shift the focus elsewhere, guys.",

But then the other key part of this is we heard the frustrations from public officials. You heard from the hospital official, they're saying he's not just tired, he's weary, and that reflected everyone's thoughts here that it's not just the acute incidents like mass shootings that what happened in the bank behind me, but every day gun violence that they see here in Louisville. And the Mayor for one, he's someone who survived an attempted shooting of his own, said that he now had to announce the deaths of people he knew at a separate workplace shooting. Again, the one that happened here and it's why he says there needs to be state action to change the laws here and quickly because lives are on the line, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR GRAIG GREENEBERG, (D) LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies.

      "sentences": "Yes. It - I think there is a value to releasing that if only - to not sanitize what is going on in America, we can put context around what we're about to see. But I am the new school I think I would argue which if we don't see it, we tend to sanitize it. We talk about gun shootings or deaths.And one way to recognize the harm that this particular weapon does, the AR-15 is to understand what we are putting our police departments in, in terms of the threat that they are facing. I don't pretend that getting this kind of gun off the street or making it unlawful is going to solve all problems. But as we've seen time and time again, there is almost no capacity to respond to a weapon that not only kills this not only shoots this quickly and this - and with such damage, but really leaves no room for recovery or for the ability to - for police to come in, so I am for this. I want to say another reason why it's important to push back or to create a new narrative around these videos, one of the things about the AR-15, we see it with politician as well - politicians as well. It's become a performative weapon, so think about what we see online with politicians or people running for office with their little kids, with these guns. It's become a sort of cultural phenomenon as much as it is a weapon. And I think these videos become performative for the people who are doing them and it's a way of sort of showing off what they're doing. And we have to push back on that narrative whether we see it online with allegedly political people who are who are putting their kids with AR-15 to - or killers themselves who are using it in this kind of theatrical way. We got to make it real for people. Real people are dying. I mean, let's - we don't need to be - we don't need to sanitize it anymore.",

You would think at the very least there could be a carve out that you don't put the weapon that kills five or six people back on the street, but the way that the laws have been written in support of gun ownership is that those can be recycled. They're in police ownership now. That is just a grotesque, I mean, let's just be - no country needs to do that. We have enough guns. They don't have to be recycled.The second law that we should consider and we're - is this fight between localities and states. We know guns transfer between, say, Louisville and the rest of Kentucky. But if a community wants to make a statement about what can be sold in its jurisdiction, that's being taken away by the courts. And so what Louisville is asking for is more authority from the state to be able to essentially raise the floor in terms of gun laws. I will say everything I heard from them is exactly right, 40 deaths in Louisville since the beginning of the year of gun violence outside of mass shootings. But the one piece that was sort of jaw dropping for me was the deputy police chief Humphrey says, the reality that we know now we used to tell communities and people to run, then hide and then only fight if you have to. And I think there's a growing recognition, as he said, that if you think you have the capacity to stop this, do it. That is the police that essentially say no matter how good we are, we're not good enough against this weapon and I think that should cause us all pause.",
