It was a little quieter on the border with Lebanon. So, it's clear that the militias are tuning up their attacks to be a retaliation for what Israel is doing. But the Israelis make the case that if their central objective in the war is to destroy Hamas, endingly Hamas operation or ending the Gaza operation before they've achieved that will undercut their long term goal. I think what you're going to hear the secretary argue to them is that they can at this point, do this with much more targeted operations, and could suspend the overall bombing.

We drive through Ecuador's capital city with Luan Tuan Wey (ph), he shows us private homes and Airbnb where Chinese migrant stay where they arrive. Luan (ph) has lived here in Quito for five years and runs a travel agency. He has witnessed the recent surge in Chinese migrants and with it a spike in businesses catering to them, like this Chinese- run hotel. The owner estimates there are as many as 100 hotels in Quito that like hers host Chinese migrants headed to the U.S.",

It was difficult to support myself, he tells me. He says some employers in China refused to pay him even after working. Even if they say the Chinese economy is strong, it is all about the upper class, he says. I wish I was never born. Living feels so exhausting. After saving up enough to restart his trek, Zheng heads to this Quito bus station where ticket sellers hold up signs like this one in Chinese. It reads, \"To Tulcan, Colombian border.\" More than a dozen Chinese migrants board the bus north. We go with them to the four hour-plus ride. On board, Zheng and the others plan their next moves.",

And because they are often carrying more cash, they are now prime targets for corrupt police and cartels. But like Zheng, they remain determined. As we return home, he updates us on his trek. Over two weeks, Zheng travels through five Central American countries, at times messaging Chinese-speaking smugglers who remotely coordinate with local cartels to get him and others on vans, buses, boats and on flights. It cuts his travel time down to about half that of most Latino migrants, but it is costly. By the time he reaches Northern Mexico, he has spent more than $10,000, with one more border to go. A camera we set up facing the U.S. southern border captures weeks of crossings, thousands entering the U.S. through this gap in the wall, group after group, day and night. You can hear these migrants shouting in Chinese. They end up where we started, San Diego County, burning fires through the night to keep warm, and during the day, expecting border patrol to pick them up. Just before New Year's, Zheng messages us that he too has crossed into the U.S. and is waiting to be processed for asylum...",
