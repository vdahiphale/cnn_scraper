Heavy shelling and fighting is putting medical centers in emergency situations. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Gaza's second largest hospital is now out of service due to the (INAUDIBLE) of fuel and power shortages -- outages, excuse me. Many medical centers in Gaza have become shelters for thousands of people displaced by the fighting. Israel Defense Forces say they're enabling safe passage from Gaza's hospitals, but medics say it's too dangerous to leave because of intense fighting around some of the complexes. With civilian casualties mounting, today Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN that the lives lost fall squarely on the shoulders of Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But you certainly wouldn't give immunity to the terrorist. So we're obviously treading carefully when it comes to hospitals but we're also not going to give immunity to the terrorists.

He was something of an unknown to the White House and they are still developing that working relationship.But certainly the White House wasting no time in panning his proposal to keep the government open saying in a statement last night, \"With just days left before an extreme Republican shutdown and after shutting down Congress for three weeks after they ousted their own leader. House Republicans are wasting precious time with an unserious proposal that has been panned by members of both parties. The White House went on to say House Republicans need to stop wasting time on their own political divisions, do their jobs and work in a bipartisan way to prevent a shutdown. The White House not mincing any words there. What does remain clear is whether all Democrats will oppose this plan because while it is unorthodox in its structure, it does not include some of the deep spending cuts, some of the conservative priorities that Democrats so oppose. We did hear last night from a senior Senate Democratic leadership aide who said it was a good thing that this bill did not include spending cuts. We also heard from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy earlier today who said this was a gimmick, but he has said he was still open to listening to their proposal. So there are some shades of differences there. Depending on how many Republicans oppose this plan, Mike Johnson will need Democrats for it to secure passage. It was notable in that White House statement, the White House did not explicitly say whether or not President Biden would reject this if it made it to his desk when it was a plan to keep the government open. But bottom-line Omar, the clock is ticking. The government will shut down on Saturday morning if nothing is passed. This plan could come up for a vote as early as Tuesday, Omar.",

And things have been delayed inefficient, not getting down, and I'm very concerned that if we pass this continuing resolution, and it does not attach supplemental funding for Israel humanitarian aid, and Ukraine will never get it done.To add to that, the fact that we are heading into the holidays, and Congress is notorious for, you know, not being happy about sticking around on Thanksgiving Day, and you can imagine. So, we really need to get this done, all at once. I completely agree with Chairman McCaul. He's the chairman of my Foreign Affairs Committee. I have utmost respect for him.

That was very unsatisfactory to the extremist caucus. I'm very concerned that speaker Johnson, that is who I don't know at all, yet, it's going to run into the same problem.

President Biden has even expressed some frustration with how long it's taken Israel to implement a large scale humanitarian pause.And while Israel has agreed to some four-hour pauses in parts of northern Gaza, does Israel, do you believe Israel needs to go further to protect civilians, that what they've done so far?",

But the continuing loss of life, and by the way, that includes some IDF of shoulders, and other Israelis as well, and potentially these hostages.I'm very, very concerned about the fate of the hostages. But we cannot be watching just thousandths of innocent lives being lost without using the leverage that the United States government has with Israel to really ask them to adopt a different approach. I'm not a military expert, but there are military experts that have spoken with that have told me this can be done in a much more targeted fashion. Less air power, more on the ground power, I understand the risks, I understand the problems of having Hamas in tunnels. It's a devastating situation, and yes, Hamas caused this problem, no question about it. But there are Palestinians, people of Gaza, who are -- have no fault in this, who are losing their lives every day, and we've got to do something to reduce the ongoing loss of life. We're not going to be able to bring those lives back, sadly. But in addition to that, for the people who have survived, thankfully, we've got to make sure that the humanitarian aid is getting to them. And that's, you know, a significant part of the supplemental that needs to be passed by congress, but these pauses have not -- did not come quickly enough, and have not lasted long enough. I was part of a letter, more than a week ago, asking for these pauses to be extended, and to make them really meaningful, and I'm glad that the Biden administration is leaning on the government of Israel to make that happen.",
