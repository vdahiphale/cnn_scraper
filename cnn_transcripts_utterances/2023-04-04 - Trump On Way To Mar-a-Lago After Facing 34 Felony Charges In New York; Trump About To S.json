This is a special edition of OUTFRONT.I'm Erin Burnett in New York, along with Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And Wolf and I have just watched the former president exiting his private plane coming down the stairs. He is heading back to Mar-a- Lago, as you see, coming down those stairs there now in his motorcade, leaving the airport, heading back to Mar-a-Lago. All after he pleaded not guilty in the New York courtroom to 34 counts related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. All of them were felony counts. We are all seeing supporters now that some of them lining the roads where Trump will be driving by, waiting for the motorcade to pass. And once he is back at Mar-a-Lago, Trump is expected to take a brief break and then speak publicly for the first time since today's historic meeting that room, that big ballroom in Mar-a-Lago, also filled with Trump supporters. And we'll just show you some images that we have. This actually happened today. Trump's hearing his arraignment, there's the picture that we are able to see what we're told he was staring straight ahead for much of the time, occasionally looking over prosecutors. This is a pivotal moment, of course, in American history, Wolf.",

He walked very slowly down the center aisle, scanning the aisles that were filled with reporters.But taking this walk very slowly, added to kind of the weight of the moment and the anticipation in the room, you know. Then he was at the defense table. It was actually off to a pretty quick start. Once the agreement began, the judge asked him how he pled to those 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree felony, and Trump said it himself, not guilty. You know, then they went on to deal with some other legal issues that prosecution also raising some of these questions about Trump's rhetoric, the threats, verbal attacks that he's made against the judge and against the District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Trump's lawyer, saying that he's been frustrated because the D.A.'s witnesses, including Michael Cohen have been on television, in print stories, talking about the case. They said that Trump felt like he couldn't say anything. The judge said that the frustration did not justify these tweets. He asked everyone, both the prosecution witnesses and the former president to dial down their rhetoric to not say anything that could be viewed as inciting violence, or civil unrest. You know, interestingly, Trump was flanked by his legal team, including his new attorney, Todd Blanche, who was added just yesterday to this legal team, but he had no family members in the courtroom. The only other associate was another attorney, although he's not working on this case, Boris Epshteyn, but someone who has worked with Trump and his close adviser. Otherwise, he was flanked by the secret service to as he exited the courtroom, and it was only after he left that we were all allowed to leave the building -- Wolf.",

One was -- one was an indictment.And Alvin Bragg when he took office a few weeks into his term, one of those investigations that was started under Cy Vance was handed to him and presented as if it was ready to go. And Alvin Bragg, if this was political could have just said, oh, great. Let's go. I'm going to bring this case. But he said, hold on. I reviewed this case. I want more evidence because I'm going to follow the facts where they lead, he said. So, he and he decided to continue to investigate these cases while he prosecuted one of them. So there's nothing about today that that strikes me as political. And calling this a sham -- there's nothing about this I think that seemed like a sham. I mean, he was handed a statement of facts that gives the information. It's a lot more than just the Stormy Daniels hush money payments.

If you're going to take the step of indicting a former president of United States, of arraigning on television a former president, United States you would hope that it was something that just sensibly was easier to explain to the public that is, is as simple as 11,780 votes in Georgia or stealing documents from the White House and not giving them back and then obstructing. I mean, there are other cases that are more cut and dry. What I continue to wonder as we are here in this moment, and this was relevant because it was the first, but it may just be the first.

She's there at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is expected to speak in just minutes. And, Kristen, I know that you've been watching people there that room fill up. You're seeing some notable Trump supporters coming through and a different energy in the room now? HOLMES:  Yeah, Erin. That's right. I mean, these events at Mar-a-Lago are usually more low key than a rally. We saw that when he announced his presidential bid back in November there seated. They are members of the club usually. They're shorter. People tend to mingle a little bit, but then take their seats. That is not what we're seeing right now. There is a lot of energy in the room. It feels a little bit more like a rally. Just seconds ago, we heard chanting, Kari won, because Kari Lake walked in the room, almost the entire room erupted. We've seen Roger Stone, Michael Lindell -- it's really a who's who of MAGA world here, like tell it by the energy and again. I know I mentioned this earlier, but the entire Bikers for Trump group is here, as well as Club 45, then you also have some of the members among social media stars and the conservative world. We are expecting him to feed off of this and to make a political speech. I just talked to one source close to Trump, who indicated that this speech was going to really lean into what we heard one of our commentators saying a few moments ago, that Trump's message is that they can do this to me. They can do this to you. They're actually coming for you, but I'm just standing in the way. And, of course, this is a message. We have heard time and time again, but not a message. We have heard post his arraignment. There had been some questions as to whether or not the messaging would change once we saw those charges, but we're not getting any indication of that. He is looking at this through the lens of 2024. As we continue to note during his arraignment, they sent out a fundraising email with a manufactured mug shot on it.
