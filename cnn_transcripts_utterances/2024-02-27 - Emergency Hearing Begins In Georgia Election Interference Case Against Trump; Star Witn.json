And in minutes, an emergency hearing is going to begin that could disrupt, might even upend, the Georgia election interference case against former President Trump and more than a dozen other co-defendants. A star witness for them is expected to take the stand in the attempt to disqualify Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis and remove her from the case. Terrence Bradley is the former divorce attorney for Nathan Wade, a prosecutor who had a romantic relationship with Willis.",

The judge wants to know everything that Terrence Bradley knows about when this relationship started and any other details that he can provide. And you remember Ashley Merchant, she's the defense attorney that says that Bradley can prove that Fani Willis and Nathan Wade weren't being fully truthful about when their relationship began.So what's going to happen? What's really interesting about this all is that this allegation started as a claim that Fani Willis may have financially benefited from hiring Nathan Wade as the lead prosecutor in this case, but it's now morphed into whether or not Fani Willis and Nathan Wade were telling the truth on the stand when they testified just a couple of weeks ago.

But that changed in January when one of his co-defendants, Mike Roman, a former campaign official, filed this motion first surfacing these allegations that Fani Willis and Nathan Wade, our top prosecutor, were engaged in this alleged improper romantic relationship.And look, the judge since then has laid out the threshold for disqualification. He has said that defense attorneys have to prove that Willis benefited financially from that relationship. But he also laid out two other questions that he sought to answer through what we now have three days of hearings. One was, was the relationship romantic? And two, when did that relationship start? Willis and Wade have both acknowledged that, yes, the relationship was romantic, but we were still kind of trying to work through the answer to that second question. When did it start? That is the focus still to this day of the hearing that we're going to hear Nathan Wade testify in. We've already heard Fani Willis, though, take the stand. Remember earlier this month she gave an unprompted and unpredicted testimony. Take a listen to what she said when she took the stand earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And they're trying to insinuate that because there was so much contact, because there was so much proximity, that that must suggest that perhaps this relationship began sooner than what they've said.So, if they have data, again, it's not conclusive. I mean, it certainly raises questions. The Trump team released it to much fanfare in recent days. But, yeah, it's not conclusive.
