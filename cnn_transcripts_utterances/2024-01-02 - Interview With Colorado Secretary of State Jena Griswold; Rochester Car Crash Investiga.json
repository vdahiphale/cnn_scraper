      "sentences": "We are getting new details on the breaking news out of Japan. An investigation is under way after a Japan Airlines plane collided with a Japanese Coast Guard aircraft on the runway in Tokyo, and then it all burst into flames. You can see it happening right there as the passenger jet landed.Five crew members on board the Coast Guard plane were killed, the captain severely injured. Now, they were preparing to fly to the west coast of Japan to help with earthquake relief. The preliminary reports are the pilots of the Japan Airlines flight did not spot any aircraft on the runway before landing. At this point, it's unclear if the flight actually had been cleared to land at all. Nearly 400 passengers and crew had only 90 seconds to deplane. No one on the aircraft was seriously injured. Four people were taken to the hospital after saying they didn't feel well. Here's some of the video of them as they are getting off. CNN's Will Ripley has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The Japanese prime minister is sending condolences to the families of those five Coast Guard crew members who lost their lives in this fiery runway collision right in the heart of Tokyo.Take a look at this. This is at Haneda Airport shortly before 6:00 p.m. local time. A massive fireball erupted right on the runway, right in the middle of this busy airport, when a crowded Japan Airlines jet with 367 passengers, including eight children under the age of 2 and 12 crew members on board, collided with a Coast Guard plane that was taking off to deliver relief supplies to parts of Central Japan on the western side that are desperately in need of aid right now because of the massive earthquake that struck just hours after the country rang in the new year and began 2024. After that tragedy and all of the hustle and bustle of the holiday weekend coming to a close at this very busy airport, Haneda Airport, a hub that serves the Japanese capital, along with Narita Airport, two major airports in town, and now only one operational because Haneda operations had to shut down after this collision and all of the questions that are being raised about how it happened. But the extraordinary part of this story is that everybody who was on that plane in a matter of seconds was safely evacuated, everybody on that passenger plane, including the parents with their young children, even as the black smoke was filling the cabin, even as passengers said they really thought they were going to die and they could see the fire spreading, even as passengers claimed that some of the exit doors were not operational and they all had to go out through the exits near the front of the aircraft. They all made it out alive. And the half-a-dozen people on that Coast Guard plane, only one of them survived, in critical condition right now at the hospital. Will Ripley, CNN, Tokyo.

I'm just curious sort of what your reaction is as we get these preliminary reports that, apparently, the pilots on the Japan Airlines flight didn't see any other aircraft on the runway. I mean, what are you thinking when you hear that?",

      "sentences": "First and foremost, congratulations to the crew. All of the crew. Not just the pilots, but also the flight attendants. This is a wide body airliner with two aisles. It takes a long time to evacuate one of these airplanes, and it's incredibly complicated.So you have to have some situational and spatial awareness as a passenger. But then the flight crew practices this over and over again not only in the airplane, but also in static mockups of the airplane and large buildings, where they run through these evacuation procedures. They deploy the emergency slides, like we saw in this incident. Sometimes, those slides and those exits can be blocked, so you need to go to one that is different. I saw in some of the video that folks were using the R1 exit. So that's the door at the front-most nose of the airplane to get out on that slide, although it seems like some parts of the airplane were engulfed in fire. Of course, you want to go away from the flames. And this is the big takeaway. Listen to the instructions of the flight crew. Of course, they are there for your convenience. They are also there for your safety and seconds in an incident like this can be the difference between life and death. The rules in aviation are written in blood.",

      "sentences": "Again, here's one more look at how it happened, as Japan Airlines Flight 516 approached the Haneda Airport onto runway 34 Right. You can see it approaching here. This is where it made contact, the fireball right there with the Coast Guard plane that was on the runway.That's important to know. The Coast Guard plane was there. The Japan Airlines flight lands, collides with it, streaks down the runway in flames, which is remarkable, in and of itself, ends up at the other end of that runway in this fireball. This is where all the passengers manage to get out from, which, as Pete Muntean was saying there, is a story in and of itself. With us now is CNN transportation analyst Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And, Mary, as we said, one of the questions we still don't know the answer to is, was the Japan airways flight even cleared to land? What questions do you have this morning?",

      "sentences": "We do have some views of what it looked like inside the Japan Airlines flight as it was going down the runway there in flames.And, as you said, you actually see out the window there before. The wings are still intact. The wing is still intact on the Japan Airlines flight, which indicates perhaps what you were saying before, that the flames themselves came from the fuel on the Coast Guard vessel. Then you saw people there still sitting inside the aircraft as it's going down the runway. And then a little bit later, you see this. This is the moment just before the passengers get up to evacuate. You can see the smoke already there. One thing you do notice, as you pointed out, no one's going to the overhead bin to get their bags out of the overhead bin, which is the problem or can be a problem when you're talking about evacuations. We do believe that all the evacuations happened toward the front of the plane. Passengers are reporting that the exits in the rear were not working. Is that a concern, or is that something that could just happen because of the collision and the fire?",

      "sentences": "I think that's something that happened because of the collision, fire. And then in other videos that people have posted, it was the back of the plane after everyone was off that was so involved that the tail then eventually fell off during the fire.So, if the windows -- you look out the emergency exits and you see flames, you're instructed, don't open it. And had they done it and it was engulfed in flames and they tried to open it there might have been a very much worse result for these passengers if flames got in the cabin. And so if your emergency exits are not working before you take off -- and you can do it legally -- you can have one or two that are not functional -- it has to be marked with tape, and it has to be marked with signs. There have to be big signs that say nonoperational before you ever take off. And we don't see anything like that in the picture. But the report will indicate whether all the exits were working. I suspect that they were, and it was simply the flames and smoke at the back of the plane where people wisely did not open those exits and allow flames inside until people got off.",

They will have the best recorders on the plane, every piece of communication with the tower, with each other, even somebody saying, oh, what's that on the runway or not saying it.Every piece of communication with that Airbus, they will have on the cockpit voice recorder. The tower is recorded as well. We have to give kudos to the tower, because there's a fire phone, emergency phone in every tower. And you pick it up, and the emergency crews are there to respond. And, clearly, they did. So all that will be recorded too. The only question is on a Dash 8, which is the Coast Guard plane. It could be -- it could be very old. It could have very -- not a lot of recording and make full recordings at all. So we will have to see. But everything's recorded in this accident.",

And the reason for that is, the mission of the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force is to mitigate threats to national security. So, even though this individual is deceased, they want to know, was he working with anyone else? Did someone else push him in this direction? Did someone support his efforts? Did someone send him money or materials in order to accomplish this attack? And they will look -- the questions they will ask are, what did he write? What did he say? What did he post on social media? What does his family know about him? Does he work somewhere? Let's talk to his co-workers.
