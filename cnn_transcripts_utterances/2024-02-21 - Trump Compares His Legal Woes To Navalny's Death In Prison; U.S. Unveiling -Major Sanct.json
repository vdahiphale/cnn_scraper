So Trump is still alive and his Mar-a-Lago estate is markedly more comfortable than an Arctic penal colony. Trump insisted during a Fox News town hall last night that paying a fine for bank fraud isn't that different than what happened to Navalny.

We are turning into a communist country in many ways, and if you look at it, I'm the leading candidate -- I get indicted, I never heard of being indicted before. I was -- I got indicted four times. I have eight or nine trials all because of the fact that, you know, this all because of the fact that I'm in politics. It is a form of Navalny. It is a form of communism or fascism.

And what Trump is banking on is that his supporters are people paying attention to him, aren't really that informed about what's happening. In Russia, regarding human rights violations towards people who criticize Putin. And so, what the Biden campaign is trying to do, is actually clear up the miscommunication, hoping not only to connect with some of the individuals in Trump's base.

But another is that people aren't as tuned into news as they were during the height of the Trump era. And so many of the things that you and I talk about every day, a lot of the people who should be paying attention respectfully aren't because they're focused on their families and the economy and other priorities. What Biden and Democrats are banking on, it said these individuals will tune in more the closer that we get to the election and they're hoping to remind these individuals of all of the things that led not only Americans, but people around the world to give Trump such low approval ratings when he was in office, hoping that those ratings will be more of a the priority and concern for these voters, than Bidens own",

That senior U.S. official is telling CNN that yes, a package was in the wax, as you say, timed to coincide with the second anniversary of the invasion, which is on Saturday, but they are expanding that in the wake of the death of Alexei Navalny.Now, in terms of who it will be targeting, Jake Sullivan telling reporters on Tuesday that it will be but punishing people or entities linked to Russia's defense industrial base. So that presumably is more linked to what's happening in Ukraine, but also elements that power Russia's repression he said, we don't know what that means, possibly elements linked to law enforcement, the prison service, things like that. They aren't going into detail as of yet. But that would seem to be the area where things have expanded in the wake of the death of Navalny. This is not a paradigm shift. This is more entities and individuals being added to the sanctions list. That means asset freezes, travel bans, things like that. Will it move the needle when it comes to Russia? It seems unlikely at this point, but it is getting weight from the fact that it is going to be coordinated with the E.U., which has just agreed its own package in principle -- Kasie.",

So we also have lots of conversations about what part of a classified document we might release and what parts of it are in the public interests. He dumped the whole lot back in 2010, and 2011. So that is part of the argument. There were other arguments coming in today as well about, you know, we're wondering if he'll turn up to court today. There's a lot -- he couldn't turn up yesterday because he's unwell. The only sort of illnesses we're aware of are his mental illness and the argument that he might take his own life if he's sent to America. That would breach his human rights. And then this much broader argument that the CIA was out to assassinate him. He said he's got evidence of that. We haven't seen it yet. I don't think it'll appear in court. That would be for a future hearing if there is one. But it's largely based as we understand it, from the CIA, wanting to get plans of the Ecuadorian embassy that he was hiding out in. And that was an assassination plots. And Donald Trump, who was present at the time, was part of it. So major accusations, we haven't balanced that. We're waiting for more on defense on that, but these are long-running arguments or being thrashed out in court today.",
