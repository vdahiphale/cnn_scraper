That's the more explicit part. The more implicit message Xi Jinping is the only man can do it and he has done so in the past decade of his reign.And of course, from their perspective, he said all the right things, for example, promising to renew economic growth by focusing on innovation. But critics have long argued innovation has been stifled under him precisely because of his government's sweeping crackdown on the private sector, especially on the tech industry. And indeed, the sharp economic slowdown in large part due to his insistence of a strict zero-COVID policy even with growing evidence that it's not working and even though it's generating growing public frustration or even resentment towards this policy. But of course, if you listen carefully throughout his speech, he used one-term time and again. That is struggle or fight. He talked about fighting COVID, fighting corruption, fighting separatists in Hong Kong and Taiwan and without naming the United States, fighting unilateralism and hegemony. So that's also a very clear indication he's not going to back down from any of his hardline policies and positions including on zero-COVID -- Max.",

And in reality, for more than 70 years since the civil war ended in China, they've had their own government here. And it has over the years evolved into a hard won democracy that people fought, they died for. And now people vote the leaders of this island and more than 23 million people. And even though Beijing says that the leaders are not legitimate and that one country two systems is the model that must happen here, it continuously is rejected by the Taiwanese public and by all of the major political parties here even the traditionally pro-China KMT doesn't have one country two systems on their political agenda currently. They used to, you know, think that eventually there might be some sort of, you know, eventual unification with the mainland. They don't even feel that way anymore. That's how much the landscape here in Taiwan has changed. But that room in Beijing with all the pomp and the ceremony and the very carefully controlled scripted praise of Xi Jinping and his communist compatriots that doesn't ring true here. People don't identify with those people as their leaders. Their leaders are the ones they choose. And they say they're going to continue to make choices about their future. And that's why Taiwan continues to bolster its national defenses, continues to bolster asymmetric, you know, defenses because they know in terms of sheer size they can't compete against a mammoth military like China's, Max. But this is an island. Island are difficult to invade. They know that here in Taiwan and they're trying to adjust their military strategy. Learning lessons what happened in Ukraine and what is still happening in Ukraine to try to potentially have to put those into action in a different model, but same, you know, same concept here. Of course, nobody wants that to happen, Max, but people are not living in a fantasy world. They know that is a distinct possibility especially given the rhetoric out of Beijing from the Chinese leader.",

One of the main criticisms that people had and the markets in particular had about the way the Prime Minister and the previous chancellor were handling things is that they weren't informed. There wasn't enough briefing about what they were going to do. So, that's one of the messages that Jeremy Hunt wants to send today.It is perhaps unusual that he's starting with a statement to the media and then he's going to the House of Commons when finance ministers are discussing things like tax. Very strange for them not to go to the House of Commons first. But I think he's got a bit of latitude here. And speaking of latitude that he has, he hasn't moved in to Downing Street yet because, of course, the chancellor lives there, too, next to the Prime Minister. But when he does, there will be one powerful person at Downing Street but it definitely won't be the Prime Minister. Because MPs are calling Jeremy Hunt the de facto Prime Minister. All the power is with him. And this push me, pull you, between Prime Minister and chancellor is quite natural. We always see that, but never like this. I mean, it is what he says goes. And he's obviously taken this role on the condition that he's doing it on his own terms.",

You can't tax your way to growth. So, the main tenants that she stood on are now all being undermined and completely dispensed with if what we have been briefed comes to be by the new chancellor.So indeed, what is the point of the Prime Minister if all the things she centrally believed and all promises that she made to the Conservative Party are now not going to be executed because they've been shown to destabilize the markets and they're not successful. Which is why we have these constant questions and rumblings in Westminster that are continuing about how Liz Truss could be ousted. We had three MPs come forward over the weekend and saying -- within the Conservative Party and saying she has to go. If that momentum increases, we know how this goes. We have seen it quite recently. She's going to be in even less tenable position.",
