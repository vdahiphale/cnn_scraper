Tonight, the Israeli military are now encirclingKhan Yunis in the south of Gaza as the U.N. warns nowhere is safe for civilians. We'll have the very latest for you. Then fears of regional escalation as Lebanon says one of its soldiers has been killed in an Israeli attack, we are live in southern Lebanon with more. Plus, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will address U.S. senators in the coming hours, just a day after the White House warned aid may soon run out. That story, just ahead in the show. But first, Israel says it is the heaviest day of fighting since the ground war in Gaza began. It's reporting fierce battle today, including face-to- face combat with Hamas militants, saying Israeli forces are striking from the land, air and the sea. Israeli troops say they're now operating the heart of Khan Yunis, a major city in the south as well as Jabalia Refugee Camp. As you remember, that is in the north. Well, in central Gaza, dozens of casualties are reporting Deir al Balah after an airstrike destroyed a multi-story building. You can see men here digging, you can see right there with bare hands trying to rescue any survivors. Well, the vast majority of Gaza's population is now displaced. But U.N. officials stressed there's nowhere safe to go, warning of apocalyptic conditions. Palestinian civilians are not only fleeing for their lives, they're also scouring for food and water amid a wasteland of rubble. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I fled with my brother-in-law and brothers from Gaza. We suffered from the war cannons, so we ran away from it to the starvation wall. Now, we cannot find food. We make food by ourselves. We divide one tomato between all of us. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We spent all night hearing rockets and bombing. We are living between life and death. We may die at any moment. It may be our turn and our kids' turn to die. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the IDF making clear that they are focusing on Khan Yunis. They're continuing operations in the north and central parts of Gaza, but there is a major focus on Khan Yunis, because they do believe that Hamas leadership has gone into that city. It is the biggest city in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. The IDF says that they are operating at the center of it, the most senior general in the Israeli military says that they are encircling it. We have seen airstrikes like the ones that we are showing on the screen there. The complication, of course, is that so many hundreds of thousands of Gazans were told to go to the south.",

Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Desperate times call for desperate measures. And in Gaza, if that means looting the local bakery destroyed overnight by an Israeli airstrike, so be it. \"Look at the people\", says Icramari(ph), \"they're doing this out of hunger\". It was the Baraka(ph) Bakery, Baraka(ph) is Arabic for blessing. But now Gaza is under the curse of war. It was the last functioning bakery in Deir al Balah. People's basic needs, striking it is a kind of terrorism. Once the sun came up Monday, people of all ages descended upon the bakery, taking away bags of flour, cooking oil, scraps of wood to use for cooking and heating, and just about anything else they could carry away.

We are hoping to connect to MSF, Medecins Sans Frontieres to get the very latest as to what's happening inside Gaza, particularly in the south. As soon as we've connected with MSF, we will of course, bring that to you. In the meantime, the Lebanese army says one of its soldiers has been killed in an Israeli attack and three others wounded. This appears to be the first death of a Lebanese soldier due to the fighting in the region sparked by Hamas attack on October the 7th. Groups like Hezbollah are also firing projectiles and cross-border fire between Israel militants and Lebanon has been happening as you know, as we've been reporting here on the show for weeks. A CNN team witnessed that, appeared to be -- what appeared to be Israeli interceptors, you can see there, hitting some of the outgoing rockets from Lebanon earlier today.

He said that he's been hearing stories, he said that broke his heart. Both mental and physical stories from those hostages, of course, who have been released. Those hostages who were brutally held by Hamas for some seven weeks or so. He also heard about sexual abuse and rape, and he said -- I'm going to quote him here, \"until a few days ago, I hadn't heard any organizations of human rights organizations\", he said, \"to talk about their rights.\" And he then -- if you heard, spoke in English. \"You heard the rape of those horrible atrocities where\" -- and I'm going to quote him here, \"where the hell are you?\" So blaming U.N., blaming other NGOs for not speaking out about the rape of the women and men, I should say, faced, according to Israelis at the hands of Hamas. He went on to say he expects all leaders, he said, to speak up about these atrocities. And he went on to mention that the aim of this war is still to bring the hostages home. That is still the aim, of course, everyone home. And we know there are 138 hostages being held in Gaza, we've heard that today from the prime minister's office, 118 males, 20 females. He went on to talk about the mission, of course, which is also as you well know, to destroy Hamas. Gaza, he said, will never again be a threat to Israel. He mentioned that so far they have -- they had eliminated half of commanders. And he said -- commanders who attacked, who raped and who burnt. So pretty much giving us a brief update on the stories he had heard from many of those hostages. Some of those have been meeting with cabinet members. So important there to hear from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Before we went to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I was speaking to MSF, to Leo Cans. Leo, thank you very much, thank you for waiting for us. I was asking you -- you were telling me before we heard Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu there about the conditions, the dire conditions that the hospitals that your team are working under, the fact that they're overwhelmed. My question to you before we went to Netanyahu was, you know, we've seen -- we've seen Gazans having to move from the north to the south. And now they're being told again to move because move away from the fighting. My question is, this is the question I've been asking a lot of viewers is, I mean, where are they going?

But there is still plenty of room for negotiators in Dubai to water down the language in the final text. The summit has been controversial from the very start. The UAE relies heavily on petroleum. It's accused of using the event to sign new oil and gas deals. And the oil executive leading the summit has had to defend comments he made, downplaying the need to phase out fossil fuels. And this all comes as the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization says that the decade ending in 2020 was the hottest on record. Climate change has been blamed for making extreme weather even worse. Right now, southern India is reeling from a major storm, Cyclone Michaung made landfall earlier today. The region was already being battered with heavy wind, rain and flooding. Thousands have been evacuated; at least six people are reported dead. Rescue efforts are underway. Israel is expanding its ground operations, as we told you at the top of the, show into southern Gaza, now encircling the city of Khan Yunis. The United Nations warning of what they call an apocalyptic situation for civilians with nowhere left to flee. The Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007, is calling on governments to review and put conditions on military aid to Israel, in light of the country's ongoing war against Hamas. They issued a statement last Monday, which reads in part, I will read, to \"Israel's disproportionate response to the horrendous terror attacks by Hamas on 7 October, which The Elders unequivocally condemned, has reached a level of inhumanity toward Palestinians in Gaza that is intolerable.\" Mary Robinson chairs The Elders after serving as the first female president of Ireland. She is also the former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and she joins us now from Geneva. Mary, great to see you. Thank you very much for taking the time to be with us this evening. Let me start with that statement we just had, part of a statement, I should say. It's a lengthy statement from The Elders. Reading, not holding, back calling Israel's response disproportionate and a level of inhumanity in Gaza tolerable. Give us your assessment, Mary, of the last seven weeks here and the manner in which Israel has been conducting these operations. MARY ROBINSON, UNITED NATIONS' HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The problem is that we are seeing on our televisions, as human beings, so many men, women and children, particularly women and children, being bombarded with heavy bombs. Their houses destroyed. Their hospitals destroyed, their schools destroyed. And being told to move in a very congested area, which I know, I've been to Gaza a couple of times as part of The Elders. So and then the Biden administration has rightly called for a proportionate response for restraint at the level of killing and -- of innocent civilians, as Kamala Harris said in Dubai. It's not acceptable. We all agree with that. But words aren't enough anymore. So we as Elders, are asking that countries that provide military aid, notably the United States to Israel, now have to urgently review military assistance and place conditions for any future provision.",

They say they have been fruitful, that's what the language has been. We have had the WHO meanwhile saying the situation in Gaza is deteriorating by the hour. So what kind of pressure can be applied here realistically, not just on Israel, by the way, but also on Hamas, to release the hostages?",

There's two, some of the hostages and families of the hostages, some ofwhom lost family members, were killed and was taken. And of course, we would very much welcome their full release. But words of restraint, when we don't see that restraint, when we see that what is happening all over, there is no safe place now. And then that is on top of the human conditions, which are truly appalling -- not enough food, not enough water, not enough sanitation. Hospitals being bombed that were trying to deal with badly wounded children. The world is really very caught up in this. And that's why the United States has to use its power to restrain and to review and to say we will not accept that our military arsenal is being used in this way. They haven't said that explicitly. They should.",

There is a surge of even more settler violence.When Duncan Moon (ph) and I visited in June, we were shocked at the settler incursion in a most illegal way on Palestinian land, making the two states more and more difficult. And now since the 7th of October, there's almost a license to settlers. The Defense Forces don't seem to pay any attention when they kill, when they drive families and communities out of their villages. That again, there needs to be sanctions on settlers. President Biden has talked about. It is time to do it. It is time to sanction settlers and to sanction government ministers who encourage this Jewish supremacy approach to the West Bank.",
