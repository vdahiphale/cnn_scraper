I'll give you more details of exactly what is moving in the larger market or the wider market in just a moment. Those are the markets and the main events of the day. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agrees to delay judicial reform in the face of mass opposition. Nationwide strikes, grounding flights, and paralyzing public transport in Germany. And, SVB bank as a buyer for most of its US assets. Tonight, I am live in London. It is Monday, it is March 27th. I'm Richard Quest, and in London as elsewhere, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight in Israel where Benjamin Netanyahu says that the country is at a dangerous crossroads as he postpones his divisive plan to overhaul the judiciary. The Prime Minister has added to the unrest this weekend when he sacked the Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, who had publicly suggested that the plan be delayed. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of protesters have been filling the streets in Jerusalem, and Israel's largest trade unions called for a general strike. At Ben Gurion Airport, flights were grounded, and at the ports, shipments were halted. Some of the country's largest banks, shut. Union leaders have now called off the strike, the general strike this evening, after Benjamin Netanyahu went on TV and backed down for now.

Then we saw protests erupt on Sunday evening. These were angry protests in what we've seen over the last 12 weeks, and then this morning, that huge historic strike that affected everything from universities to nurses, as you noted, the ports and the airport. Richard, even McDonald's here were closed down as part of this strike. That strike has since been called off because after hours of speculation that he was going to do so, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally did announce at least a pause to legislation. But I should note that the initial announcement about the pause of the legislation actually came from the National Security, Minister Itamar Ben- Gvir, the far-right wing Minister in Benjamin Netanyahu's government. And I think, Richard, that should give you an indication of potentially who is really in control of the situation here, because it does appear was that it was Ben-Gvir who was the ultimate obstacle to Netanyahu to come out and call for this pause in legislation. And meanwhile, the opposition is saying let's wait and see whether this is a real pause before we come to talks for over some sort of compromise over these reforms.",

Bonn was all part of this mega strike. The two main transit unions want a 10.5 percent pay increase to offset the rising cost of living. Now to France, workers there are still protesting against the increase in the retirement age. There was a picket line today that blocked tourists from entering the Louvre Museum.
