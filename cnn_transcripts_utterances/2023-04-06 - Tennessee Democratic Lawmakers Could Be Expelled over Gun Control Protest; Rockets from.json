Right now, a potentially historic legislative session has begun in the statehouse, as lawmakers prepare to vote on a resolution to expel three Democratic state representatives.All three are accused of breaking house rules while calling for stricter gun control measures alongside dozens of protesters. But they did so inside the chamber. Ryan Young is following this story from Nashville. Ryan, this is a really contentious situation because we've seen, throughout the day, first the protesters outside surrounding you. And suddenly they all start pushing in to the capital. But they are seriously upset over what these legislators are doing when it comes to making schools safer.",

They told me, almost down to a woman -- because there's a lot of women here who are stressing the fact that they were here not just for these three lawmakers. They are here for the children. A lot of people who showed up here today are teachers themselves. Andthey say they are tired of all the talk, all the back and forth across this country when it comes to protecting kids in school. They say how many shootings will have to happen before someone in this country does something to stop it? So we saw thousands of people lining up and you're, of course, asking what happened next? They all went up to the capital. They knew it was going to take hours before they could get inside. Some of them made it in. This is braving all the rain here. But they are upset that now this has turned into a conversation between Democrats and Republicans, about these three lawmakers, who could be thrown out. Yes, they believe that is important. But they say the focus should be on the fact that, in this community, six people lost their lives to a weapon. They don't feel it should be on the streets anymore. And they want to do more to protect schools. So that's been the conversation. So far, we know it's been heated on the inside. This is not a standoff. If the Republicans want these three members out, they could totally vote them out this afternoon. That could happen, as you said, within the next hour. One of the members took to the floor to talk about the reasons why he feels they're being persecuted and this should not happen. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE REP. JUSTIN JONES (D-TN):  We are making this political statement today by trying to act like we're doing something that is not going to do anything to prevent what occurred. More police officers in schools; yesterday passed a bill to arm teachers, this is not going to make our students safe. And I think that we owe it to these young people that the thousands here, who we who we try to speak for when we were silenced, the thousands who are gathered outside, demanding that we take real action to address the crisis of easy access to military grade weapons in this state. And so with that, I must say that I cannot support this bill because this bill is a Band-aid.",

You can understand that people are hurting and they're passionate about how they should move this forward. But right now, all the focus is inside that state capital to see exactly what happens next. And will Republicans move forward to do something that, of course, has not been done many times here in this state; I believe it's only been done four times since the Civil War, that someone has been thrown out of the statehouse.

We believe there are several, obviously other resolutions that are going on. Will the vote happen in the next half hour? No one seems to know exactly the timing. Of course, they're discussing it right now. And then, when this happens, these people plan to swell back in; the hope:  to push lawmakers that make some sort of change there because, at the end of the day, if this happens or doesn't happen, the conversation still has been changed from the focus, which should be gun violence.",

Israeli military officials say at least 34 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel today. Officials in Israel say that 25 of those were intercepted by the Iron Dome.We should note the IDF also says, though, that, at this moment, the numbers are not final. This is a major escalation in the Middle East. All of this comes after days of tensions over Israeli police operations that played out in violent fashion at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

      "sentences": "It's clearly an escalation. And thanks for having me. But I think Hadas says it right. The reality is, since 2006, the prospects of a serious escalation, which could morph into a major war between Israel and Hezbollah.The last time, of course, in the summer of '06, both sides sought to avoid it. This is a very curious issue. Maybe Palestinian groups fired those rockets; Hezbollah is in control that area. It's hard to believe that Hezbollah had no foreknowledge of it. Palestinian groups clearly are supporting Hamas' rockets from Gaza into Israel over the last 48 hours. And both groups are supporting Palestinians in their confrontation with Israeli police on the Haram al-Sharif, the Temple Mount. We always knew that Ramadan and Passover, when religious sensitivities are high, would be a period. And now particularly with an Israeli government, the most extreme clearly and fundamentalist in the history of the state, you do have the makings both with respect to Lebanon and on the Palestinian front a major escalation. And it's occurring at a time, all those extraordinary demonstrations in the history of the state of Israel, right now Israel has a, quote, \"fired defense minister,\" unquote, Yoav Gallant, who is clearly still in his office, being briefed and apparently instructing the Israeli chief of staff, even though Benjamin Netanyahu was about to -- I mean his security cabinet has not yet officially decided what to do about his status.",

Also, as you're talking about leading to the defense minister being pushed out.

There is great concern that this can affect morale and Israeli military readiness, particularly since Israel hasn't fought a ground war in some time. The reservists are very, very critical, both to Israeli air force operations and to Israeli intelligence. My gut tells me, frankly, that Middle East wars don't happen by accident. They're usually preceded by a relatively long trail of actions, actions and reactions, actions and reactions. I don't see this morphing into a major sustained confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah, because there's also one other factor, which is Iran. And Iran, I think, relies on Hezbollah in the event there is an Israeli-Iranian confrontation to open up its high trajectory weapons. I suspect there's still a good chance to put this back in the box. But Middle East is no shortage -- no shortage of unexpected crises, as we've watched today's play out.

Really what we've seen these last few weeks is these protests getting more violent as a result of the government's decision to force its pension reforms through parliament without a vote. It is now almost certain to become law. It's going through one last constitutional hurdle but these protests will continue. In fact, the unions have said already today they intend in a very unified way to carry on making their voices heard and to keep people on streets of Paris.

That is what brought -- has brought people to the streets for 11 straight days. Millions of people on some occasions, though, you say today, fewer -- we're seeing bicycles on fire right there.

There has been a lot of the trash, still been on the streets of Paris as well, the strikes that get set alight, they get charged by the police. And the aim of these much more violent demonstrators, the Black Bloc, we call them, is really who seek out that kind of confrontation. And so you see it all along the march and through to the end. By the time it gets to its destination, we expect perhaps some of the angriest scenes. Those far less protesters we've been interviewing in the last couple of weeks, John, and they've been saying that because they feel that the result of the people you see out here today, to continue protesting it there, they really intend to make these as violent as they can. They don't feel the government (INAUDIBLE) and they want that much more (INAUDIBLE) angry noise to make itself heard as they try and take on the police. One of the difficulties for the police at this stage is trying to keep the security of these marches relatively intact without allowing the protesters to impose too much damage. But without on the other hand the police themselves getting into (INAUDIBLE) some of the accusations, allegations of excessive violence that we've seen over the course of the last couple of weeks. Really, the streets of Paris for the last two weeks, during every time there's a protest like this, much more successfully by that group of extremist supporters, extremist demonstrators into a sort of direct battle between the security forces on one hand and the demonstrators on the other.",
