Now, Deion's son, Shedeur Sanders -- he had a great opener. He threw for 445 yards and four touchdowns, and three of those TDs going to two-way star Travis Hunter. And on the last one -- look at this -- look at the grab Hunter made with the defender all over him. That TD put Colorado up 31-20. The Bisons, though, had a chance to win the game on the final play. The Hail Mary attempt was caught but it was short down at the four- yard line. Colorado survives 31-26. And here was Coach Prime on how he was feeling after the win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Carlos Alcaraz, who won Wimbledon and the French Open, and got silver at the Paris Olympics, ousted by world number 74 Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.And to give you an idea of how big of an upset this was, if you bet $100 on Alcaraz to win this match, you would have only won a dollar. This match wasn't even close either. Van de Zandschulp winning it in straight sets. This ended Alcaraz's 15-match winning streak at the Majors. And afterwards, the 21-year-old said he was lacking energy after a busy tennis schedule. All right, Naomi Osaka, meanwhile, also suffering an early exit. The two-time U.S. Open champ beaten by Karolina Muchova in straight sets. Osaka, who had her daughter last year, hasn't reached the second week of the Grand Slam since winning the 2021 Australian Open. All right. In Atlanta, Scottie Scheffler may just run away with the tour championship. He started the day with a two-shot lead thanks to the FedEx standings, and then he went out and shot a six-under to increase that lead to seven strokes. Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele right now tied for second. Scheffler trying to become the first player since Tiger Woods in 2007 with seven wins in a single season. If he holds on, he will claim the $25 million prize. All right, and finally, pitcher Rich Hill back on the mound for the Red Sox last night at the ripe old age of 44. Hill is the only active player in baseball to appear in each of the past 20 seasons. This is Hill's fourth stint with the Red Sox. He's played for 13 different teams. Hill is the oldest pitcher to appear in a game since Bartolo Colon in 2018 when he was 45. Hill pitched an inning and a third innings giving up no runs and striking out two in the loss to the Blue Jays. And Manu, I'll tell you what. Hill -- he's been pitching in baseball longer than the iPhone has been around. Longer than YouTube has been around. And I'm happy to see him Manu because I love it that there's still a couple of guys that are older than me that play baseball still. You've got Rich Hill and then Justin Verlander who is 41. I like to cover athletes that are older than me still.",
