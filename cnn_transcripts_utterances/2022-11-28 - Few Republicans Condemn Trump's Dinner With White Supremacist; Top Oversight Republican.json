I'm Jake Tapper.Nearly one week after Donald Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago with openly antisemitic Holocaust denier and white nationalist Nick Fuentes, along with another anti-Semite, rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye. Not only has Mr. Trump not publicly condemned Fuentes or his sick ideology or Ye's, the number of Republican officials willing to publicly criticize Fuentes by name or Trump for meeting and helping to mainstream him remains, shall we say, rather small. I reached out to the offices of a few top Republican congressional leaders today. None, none, offered comment. A few Republicans have publicly condemned Trump's actions, Congress members Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. Senators Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins among them. But Trump is the only declared Republican 2024 presidential candidate. He remains the presidential front runner for his party. Only a couple possible 2024 rivals have criticized Trump's move -- former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and this man, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

Gab, if you do not know, is the fringe social media platform, very popular with the alt-right and, yes, with neo-Nazis, run by an unrepentant anti-Semite named Andrew Torba. And, of course, this is the same woman who once suggested wildfires in California were started by space lasers controlled by any number of prominent Jews. Marjorie Taylor Greene also recently hired notorious anti-Semite Milo Yiannopoulos as a summer intern. That was just a few months ago. But I digress. You know, there's so many anti-Semites accepted in public life these days. It's easy to do that. Back to the story at hand. Responding to Trump's claim that he did not know Fuentes before their two-hour long dinner. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said yesterday, quote, a good way not to accidentally dine with a vial racist and anti-Semite you don't now is not to dine with a violent, racist, anti-Semite you do know. That is a reference to Ye, of course. Many of Trump's Jewish supporters seen quite shaken today. Trump's former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, tweeted yesterday, quote, my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this. Even a social visit from an anti-Semite like Kanye West and humans scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable. I urge you to throw the bums out. Disavow them, relegate them to the dustbin of history when they belong, unquote. Trump has not done that. Former Trump State Department official Elan Carr tweeted today, quote, no responsible America and certainly no former president should be cavorting with the likes of Nick Fuentes and Kanye West. To placate anti-Semitism is to promote anti-Semitism. President Trump must condemn these dangers men and they're discussing and un-American views, unquote. And, again, Donald Trump has not done that. Nor have we heard any Republican congressional leaders do that publicly, or by name the RNC chair who insist there is no home for this kind of hate in the GOP. To hear Ye and Fuentes tell it, they feel quite at home. The folks who don't like anti-Semitism, they are the ones who seem uncomfortable. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty starts our coverage with a closer look at how such spreaders of hate ended up dining with the former commander in chief.

Like you want to make sure you get enough ventilators, or enough PPE, or you want to get your population vaccinated. The comment that I made about their severe actions that they've taken is that you have to have an endgame. What's the purpose? At the purpose is, lets get all the people vaccinated, particularly elderly, then okay for a temporary period of time to do that. But they have very, very strict types of lockdown. They're locking people in their homes, which is really, they can't even go out and, from what I hear, shop or walk a dog or something like that.

You know, hopefully we could have been more on top of appreciating the dynamic nature of how things changed. Thinking that it wasn't aerosol spread in the beginning, and then you find out it is aerosols spread. Thinking that, well, symptomatic people spread it. And then you findout that 50 to 60 percent of the transmissions occurred from someone who has no symptoms. So, it's a moving target. We just need to be much more flexible. And when we make a statement to the public, even though we try as best as can, make sure you emphasize that it is a moving target because when people hear, and you say something in January, based on data that are clear in January, you come back in March, the data are much different. They make you change your mind. And when that happens people, say, well, what's going on with the scientists. They are flip-flopping, they are changing their mind.

If you are a retailer, chances are your having to pay more for labor, for people to work at your store. That is a sign of inflation. In addition, moving products from point A to point B during parts of the year we saw very high fuel prices. That could have an impact as well. So perhaps some caution before celebrating these sales figures. Something else that I think is important to point out, is that a very large number of Americans this year made purchases using credit cards and through buy now, pay later services. There should be some caution associated with this, especially as interest rates continue to rise. Depending on what happens next year, if Americans default on these purchases, they don't pay on time, it can have some very severe consequences, Jake, at a time, when the economy is still very fragile.",
