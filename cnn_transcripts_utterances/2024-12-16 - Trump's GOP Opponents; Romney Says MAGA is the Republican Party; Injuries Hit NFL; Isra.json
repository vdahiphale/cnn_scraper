The evidence here, and everyone deserves what we call the presumption of innocence, but it's very compelling. It's very compelling from a circumstantial perspective, right, meaning evidence maybe not direct. And there is direct evidence in this case, right? You have a video of him. You got the actual shooting. You have his fingerprints on a water bottle, his fingerprints on a cereal wrapper. You have a manifesto. You've got motive, even though you don't need it. You've got a bag that they found. I mean, I could go on and on and on. He goes off the grid. So, no matter who's in the case, it's a challenging case. There's no one piece of evidence.

Sometimes a chill in the air means it's about to snow, a few flurries. Other times it can mean a blizzard's on the way and we just don't know what's on the way right now.

There's a chill in the air and lots of companies are acting accordingly. That's why Jeff Bezos is heading to Mar-a-Lago this week. That's why Apple CEO Tim Cook dined with Trump the other night.
