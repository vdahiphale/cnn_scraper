Now, we don't know what this will be, but it comes as pressure mounts for Garland to appoint a special counsel to oversee an investigation into President Biden's handling of classified government records. We are following this from every angle. So let's begin with CNN's Evan Perez. Evan, what are you learning about what we can expect to hear from the attorney general in just a few moments?",

We know that, at least at this point, there was an initial review that was done by the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch. That part of the investigation is completed. And so now the decision from Garland -- and we're going to -- we expect to hear from him in the next few minutes -- is what to do next. And as you as we have all been talking about, the fact that the -- this has to do with the sitting president, Merrick Garland's boss, really kind of puts him and others here in the department in a difficult position, one that could be solved by bringing in someone who can be viewed as independent. There's a problem with perception that has been created by the fact that not only did you find documents in one place, but apparently in a subsequent location. So we expect, given the fact that there is already a special counsel looking into the matters related to the former President Trump, that this one will likely be have to be treated in the exact same manner -- Bianna.",

They say these documents were actually found in two different locations at the residence. The first, they say, was a garage and a storage space contained in that garage. The second piece of this pile of documents, they say, was a single document, a single page found in what is described as an adjacent room. But a lot of questions still outstanding, how many documents, what exactly were they, and how did they get there? In the statement, the White House said it selected different locations to search, looking specifically at where files were shipped from the vice president's office during the 2017 transition. Now, another big question is, how much of this was known to the U.S. attorney in Chicago? As Evan just noted, our reporting is that the U.S. attorney's review has been completed. So is this new information to him? When were these located? The Biden White House is making a strategic decision to let most of this information leak out through the media, and they're leaving a lot of unanswered questions in this swiftly escalating situation.",

If we keep seeing tame numbers like this, that will bring inflation down closer to the 2 percent level that the Fed is targeting. Now, investors seem to liked this inflation report. We see U.S. stocks up pretty significantly today. Markets are betting that the Fed is going to be able to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. Instead of slamming the brakes on the economy, maybe they can tap the brakes. And, of course, that would be a big deal.

A new system hits in just hours as millions clean up from the last one. Across the state, weeks of flooding, mudslides and falling trees have killed at least 18 people.

You can see it just right over here.This water has overtaken this area, including this house right here. You can see the water level has almost reached that top of the windowsill here at the front of the house. And just to show you beyond this the significance of how much water has flooded this area, I want you to take a look at those trees in the distance, those trees way out there. It is normally on the other side of those trees that the river channel is. And that's how much water has flooded this zone, including this house and a house in the distance there. Officials here have been concerned about this. There are two major highways that the Salinas River also crosses over. And they're concerned that it could be over -- both of those roadways could be overtaken later this afternoon, potentially through the weekend, which means that traffic in and out of the peninsula could be blocked and damaged. And they're asking people to be aware of that. This comes, of course, as a major storm is about to come into California after weeks of a fire hose of rain has just sprayed over the state with very little respite, very little relief, and very little time in between all of this damage and all of this destruction. It has proven to be deadly; 18 people at least have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy who was swept away from his mother's arm -- mother's arms, rather, in floodwaters. And this all comes after years of a historic drought in the state of California. It has been incredibly dry, and now all of the water reservoirs are filling up. The snowpack, which also feeds into those reservoirs, is at a historic level. So if there is any good news, it is there's water in a state that needs it very badly. However, at this rate and at this pace, it is proving to be very dangerous, deadly and costly here for the people in California -- Bianna.",

It doesn't appear that was a coincidence as to why the attorney general appointed him. He also went through a list of dates in terms of the sequence of events and when the DOJ was notified about this batch of documents. The initial batch was found November 4. And, November 14, he appointed John Lausch. And December 20, now they were informed that an additional batch of documents were found.

I worked with Rob when he was appointed as the principal assistant deputy attorney general in 2017. Always found him to be well-informed, industrious, hardworking guy. And, as you mentioned, Bianna, I think it's not insignificant that he was an appointment from the Trump administration, served in the Trump administration as a very, very high-level official in the Department of Justice.

But, most importantly, if you're going to pinpoint this case, he did two very significant investigations into the NSA, two employees, both of whom carried large amounts of classified documents out of the NSA. One of them stored them in his home, in his car. Another had massive information electronically.

The FBI had gone back in December to go retrieve those documents. So that's an important thing, because it raises the question as to why the White House didn't just disclose everything at the time that they did on Monday. But it appears that the Justice Department was already way past the point where they believed they needed to do a special counsel. According to the attorney general, the recommendation from John Lausch, the U.S. attorney who was standing next to him, who had done the initial review, he had concluded already by that point that this was a step that needed to be taken to make sure that the department and its decisions are viewed, essentially, that they are handling this in an independent manner. And I think that's the important thing, certainly for the Justice Department. For Merrick Garland and Chris Wray, two people who are very much attuned to the idea that it is important for the Justice Department to be seen to be handling these cases in an independent manner, and whatever happens, they're going to follow the law, they're going to follow the rules. And the White House, I'm sure, is not pleased that this is the direction things have gone, but it appears that the decision was made here very, very early on, and not as a result of the communication snafu that we have seen unfold from the White House in the last few days.",
