It is showing the Hawaii Army National Guard helping here to fight the wildfires. They're using helicopters, dipping large buckets into the ocean, dropping that water on top of the flames.

Mahalo for covering this and for having a way to collect funds to support our community. Our community is in support mode right now to help those most affected.

The winds have been gusty and it causes flare-ups after it's been controlled, so it's been really unpredictable. The winds have died down. The day that the entire town burned, we were unable to fly helicopters to help control the fire because of the 80-mile-per-hour winds.

Our community has been devastated. Lahaina was one of our - was our kingdom's capital. We have lost so much. It's in ashes.

Don't knock me over with any of your winds, I'll do my - my best with this warm water. And the warm water now two to four degrees above normal in some spots, and even warmer than that in some of these really developmental zones for hurricanes. So we've had four names already, but the numbers will certainly go up. And I know it seems like, wow, it's been hot. Hurricane season must be over. Nope. We are right there. We are just at the beginning of the ramp to get up to the top in the beginning of September when there are more storms in the water on these days than really almost all the days here and all the days there.

      "sentences": "That's right, Alex.This investigation began actually back in March. It was a social media company that observed some concerning material on their platform. They called the FBI's National Threat Information Operations Center and said, look, this is troubling. The FBI then looked into that account. They eventually identified this suspect as the owner and they put him under surveillance. They said at one point they saw him wearing a Donald Trump hat, an AR- 15 lapel pin. They walked up to him and made contact and confronted him about some of these posts. Now, he originally had told them that, look, this was part of some dream I had, a lot of these threatening posts that he had online. He then got very belligerent with the agents, told them to go away, don't come back unless you have a warrant. Now, it was after that that he began posting, essentially taunting the FBI. I'll show you one of these posts, which some might actually see as a threat. He said, \"The FBI tried to interfere with my free speech right in my driveway. My 45ACP,\" that's a reference to a type of ammunition, \"was ready to smoke 'em.\" He then goes on another post, essentially posting at the FBI, saying if you're still watching, are you watching my account, if so, I need to make sure I have a loaded handgun in case you swing by, so that obviously very concerning. But what really concerned the Secret Service and the FBI was just ahead of President Joe Biden's visit to Utah yesterday, where the suspect posted - I'll read part of that from the criminal complaint. He allegedly wrote, \"I hear Biden is coming to Utah, digging out my old ghillie suit,\" that's a reference to an attire, a camouflage attire worn by snipers, \"and cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle.\" The FBI then went and sought an arrest warrant. They attempted to take him into custody yesterday. A law enforcement source told me he pointed a gun at those agents, one of the agents opening fire, fatally shooting the suspect, Alex. And Josh, these troubling posts online, on social media, that wasn't - they weren't just directed at the FBI and at President Joe Biden, but at other prominent Democrats all across the country. What do we know about those?",

I mean, the reason that's important as you connect the dots here is that the through lines in his alleged targets were prominent Democratic officials, including those that have been targeted verbally by President Donald Trump. That includes, obviously, President Biden, Vice President Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland who, of course, is overseeing an investigation into Donald Trump.There were also state officials, including California governor, Gavin Newsom, New York attorney general, Letitia James, and Alvin Bragg, of course, who was also overseeing a criminal investigation into Donald Trump. The reason that's so important is because, as we've continued to report on, intelligence and law enforcement officials remain concerned that this vitriol that we're hearing in this overheated political climate could actually lead to violence, people getting whipped up. That's what they're concerned about moving forward. Someone just like this person, who might have stood ready to actually fire upon those agents had they not shot him first.",

The reporting that ProPublica released today found Justice Thomas received many more gifts from more benefactors over decades than previously known.Four moguls collectively treated Thomas to 38 destination vacations, including a yacht voyage in the Bahamas, plus another two stays at luxury resorts, 26 private jet flights, and that does not include another batch of trips by helicopter, and a dozen VIP passes to college and pro sporting events. Thomas reportedly also had a standing invitation to an Uber-exclusive golf club. Joining us now is CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst, Joan Biskupic. Okay. So Joan, first we have ProPublica reporting first on Harlan Crow's gifts in the spring. Turns out that was kind of a drop in the bucket, and the kind of expenditures that we're talking about on the Supreme Court justice were the kinds of things that if they were spent on, say, a member of Congress or someone in the executive branch, would certainly have to be declared or they couldn't even be accepted.",

Now, CNN has learned that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is eyeing major charges like conspiracy and racketeering and that at least a dozen potential defendants are on her radar and Trump, of course, is one of them.

And as you mentioned, we know that she's been eyeing racketeering charges and the potential for a RICO indictment allows her the opportunity to go after multiple people at once.And we're told by sources familiar with her presentation to the grand jury that she's pursuing charges against at least a dozen people. It could be much more and we've learned that it could be among the biggest names of those in Trump's orbit. Look, this is not just about Trump's infamous phone call to Georgia's secretary of state here in 2020 after he lost the Georgia election, where he asked Raffensperger to find more votes. This is about a slate of fake electors that tried to subvert the Electoral College and say that Trump won Georgia when he really didn't. This is about illegal accessing of voting data systems in rural Coffee County, Trump's stronghold, and this is about a pressure campaign from Trump operatives on Georgia lawmakers and Fulton County election workers to overturn the results. This has been a sprawling investigation, it's taken a lot of twists and turns over the course of last year, but there are several indications that this is near its end. We know at least three people have been subpoenaed to appear before the Fulton County. They'll be given a 48 hours notice and we've also seen a dramatic increase in security around the Fulton County courthouse as we prepare for the expectation for Trump to be indicted and arrested for the fourth time, Alex.",
