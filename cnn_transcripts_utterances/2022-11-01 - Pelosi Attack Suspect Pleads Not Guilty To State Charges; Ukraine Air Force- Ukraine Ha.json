Her amazing story of survival, tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: in court. The man accused of assaulting Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband making his first appearance before a judge. David DePape pleading not guilty to a long list of state charges, including attempted murder, residential burglary, and assault with a deadly weapon, as well as threats to a public official in her family. DePape is also facing two federal charges, and he could face life behind bars if found guilty. Some Republicans have tried to cast doubt on certain details of the attack, though, raising questions that suggest that something is suspicious about the official version of the story. And today, the former president joined a growing chorus of conspiracy theorists. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

It's hospitality industry, let me start this out, a little bit, excuse me from turning my back, punished, punished incredibly by the COVID pandemic.At one point in April 2020, the unemployment rate there was almost 28 percent, almost twice the national average. Think about that. Now, it has recovered, unemployment now is higher than pre-pandemic levels, but, Erin, when you get hit with a punch like that, it bruises, and it bruises for a long time. And Cortez Masto, the incumbent Democratic senator, has to deal with that economic exactly. The economy has recovered, the unemployment rate is now 4.4 percent, all the jobs are back. But gas prices tend to be higher out west, right? Look at this. They are more reliant on Russian oil, fewer refineries out west, and so the transportation costs are higher. The national average is now $3.76, that's down from the peak of the summer. Look at the price of gas in Nevada still, just under $5. Cortez Masto, the incumbent, running in that environment. First, COVID, now, gas prices. And she is a Latina in the Senate, right? She's trying to stop what has become a trend in recent elections that concerns Democrats, and that is a rising, may only be modest, but a rising share for Republicans, at least for Donald Trump among Latino votes, 20 percent of the electorate, it will, maybe a little bit more in Nevada, 2016, Trump got 29 percent, 2020, Trump moved up to 35. The Laxalt campaign is confident it can move up its numbers among Latino voters. Not, win here, Erin, but it's about the margins. In a very close race, Laxalt does something like that, maybe a little bit better, that could be the difference. So, part of Cortez Masto's pitch is please, I'm one of, you I understand. Obama got 75 percent of the Latino vote in 2008. Maybe he can help there too.",
