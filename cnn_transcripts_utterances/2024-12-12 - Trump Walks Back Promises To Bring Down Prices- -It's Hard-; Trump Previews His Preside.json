      "sentences": "And then we had Covid happen and prices just went through the roof.Since February of 2020, supermarket prices are up by 27 percent. You can see it on that chart right there, just a significant move higher. Now, thankfully, they're no longer skyrocketing, but they're also not coming down. And some items have gotten more expensive over the last 12 months. Butter prices are up by 4 percent, pork chops 5 percent. And look at that, eggs, almost 40 percent more expensive. That, of course, is largely due to bird flu. Now Trump, during the campaign, he did talk about making prices plunge. And I know that made some economists scratch their heads. Because even though falling prices sounds great, it's not really how things work. And actually, when you have prices plunge too much, that can become a negative because people will stop buying things. And that can be a tough thing to get out of. So I do think it makes sense for Trump to kind of tap the brakes here, because it's not going to be easy to make supermarket prices fall dramatically.",

And mainstream economists say otherwise.And one thing that we do import from other countries is food, in particular. from Mexico. You look at 89 percent of the avocados that are imported into the United States, they come from Mexico, 91 percent of the tomatoes. And don't forget, the president-elect has said that on his first day in office, he could put a 25 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico. So it's easy to see how that could cause prices to go even higher. We also know that the United States imports some food from Canada, including peppers and mushrooms. And there's one other point here, Boris, is it's not just about tariffs. The president-elect has also threatened mass deportations. He said in that \"Time\" magazine interview that ran today that he would use the military to the maximum extent allowed for these mass deportations. And let's not forget, a large number of the people who work on farms in the United States are unauthorized workers. And so if there's fewer workers, that could mean there's less food and ultimately higher prices -- Boris?",

The idea that she would be overseeing this U.S. government-funded international broadcaster is certainly eyebrow raising. But it's exactly the kind of thing that Trump has been doing in his picks. The difference with this pick, though, this announcement last night, is that presidents don't ordinarily have anything to do with choosing the Voice of America director. This job has historically been an independent post. VOA is very proud of having a firewall so that it's news coverage of foreign news all around the world is taken seriously and is respected by the viewers and by the public. So historically, that firewall has existed. But during Trump's first term in office, he did install someone on the top of the agency that runs VOA that basically went through and did a purge, investigated journalists for loyalty to Trump and that sort of thing. Federal investigators later found that laws might have even been broken during Trump's first term in office at that agency.
