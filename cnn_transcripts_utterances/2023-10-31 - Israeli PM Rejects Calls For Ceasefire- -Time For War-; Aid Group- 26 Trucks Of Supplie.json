Israel is rejecting calls for a ceasefire as its troops and tanks events ever deeper in the Gaza, more than three weeks after the deadly rampage by Hamas. Now the Israeli ground operation is expanding and it's believed Israeli forces are at least several kilometers or a little bit more than a couple of miles inside the enclave. The Israeli prime minister is making it clear there will be no truce, comparing his government stance, to that of the U.S. after the attacks on Pearl Harbor and 9/11.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A closer look now at the Israeli militaries ramped up offensive in Gaza, as well as the fighting on a second front. CNN's Jim Sciutto has our report.

A sniper takes up position in a window of an abandoned building, Israeli infantry advancing on the ground. And in a brief moment of apparent triumph, Israeli soldiers raised the Israeli flag over a Gaza hotel. The outside world's vision into the extent and size of the Israeli ground offensive so far is limited. The IDF said those ground forces have struck some of their first targets. REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI ARMY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Dozens of terrorists were eliminated last night who had barricaded themselves in buildings and attempted to attack the forces that were moving in their direction. SCIUTTO (voice-over): One measure of their forward progress, CNN geolocated the video where the soldier raised the flag on the hotel, more than two miles inside Gaza. One geographical marker in a ground campaign playing out mostly out of sight. What remains visible are Israeli strikes on Gaza and rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. Despite weeks of Israeli bombardment, Hamas is still keeping up its rocket campaign. The Israeli prime minister said that his war cabinet is refusing calls for a humanitarian ceasefire.",

This was a joint IDF and ISA, Israeli Security Agency operation with boots on the ground.

A professor name Rickford talked about the Hamas attacks earlier this month as being energizing and exhilarating at a rally on campus. And then just a short time later, this kind of hate got normalized.First of all, threats are always criminally prosecutable in the United States. And the FBI is looking into this. But what we've seen time and time again, is that when leaders speak of tolerance, it has an ameliorative effect. So six days after 9/11 when President Bush spoke of tolerance towards Muslims, hate crimes dropped the next day and into the next year. Similarly, though, when candidate Trump talked about a Muslim ban proposal, five days after the San Bernardino terror attack, hate crimes against Muslims went up another 23 percent above the spike that we saw from the terror attack. So bottom line is, civic leaders, including campus leaders have to set a tone where certainly people can rally under the First Amendment. But threats, those are illegal. Moreover, for a community, we have to say that anti-Semitic stereotypes are glorifying the weapons that were used in terror attacks, that should be communally off limits. And we should make a safe space for everybody on campus so that people can discuss these things, as opposed to threaten each other.",

In our view, the student statement aims to contextualize the events of October 7th, 2023, pointing out that military operations and state violence did not begin that day, but rather it represented a military response, a military response, they're saying, by a people who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power over many years.I want to get the opinion from you because you know how contentious that statement is at this hour.

And that is free speech and protecting it, but also having communal norms say, hey, when you glorify or discount violence against some groups, and not others, that's something that we should shy away from. But also have discussions between groups because that's part of the educational environment, and we are not serving that well.When on the one hand, we can have protests, but there's a certain type of Jew hatred, it's not by everybody.

And it's clearly very difficult for his teammates of Liverpool, too.Colombia's national media says that Diaz's parents were kidnapped by armed men on motorcycles at a gas station in the town of Barrancas. The director general of Colombia's national police force says they are offering a reward of more than $48,000 for information leading to the rescue of Diaz's father. And a considerable search team has been activated. 130 police officers are out there looking for him. You can only imagine the anguish that Luis Diaz must be feeling right now. Liverpool says that he has returned to Colombia, and he will be away indefinitely. Diaz' teammate Diego Jota honored Diaz by lifting up his number 7 jersey after scoring against Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Sunday.

Absolutely impossible to do that.Some of us here, we have to give the game extra sense.

The team's manager Jorge Vilda was also fired. FIFA's disciplinary committee found that Rubiales had acted in breach of Article 13 pf their disciplinary code. FIFA says the ban covers all football-related activities at national and international level, but that it is subject to a possible appeal before the FIFA appeal committee. Back to you.
