How big of a challenge is this for a lot of Republicans to do this? I mean, obviously you've got to get out of your comfort zone a little bit. OLIVIA TROYE, FORMER ADVISER TO VP MIKE PENCE AND MODERATING \"REPUBLICANS FOR HARRIS\" CALL:  Yes, and like we all know, party identity is real, right, when you're a lifelong Republican. I was that person that used to go into the voting booth and no matter what was happening on the ticket, I pulled straight R's and voted for straight R's. And I think a lot of people feel that. And so, I think that's a personal -- very personal conflict. But at the end of the day, given what's at stake in November, I do think that this coalition is set on bridging that gap, reaching out to center right voters, moderate conservatives, and saying this is not the way forward for the party. The party that we used to support isn't there right now. We've got to band together.",

Is that healthy for this country?FMR. REP. RAY LAHOOD (R-IL), FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Jim, I'd like two things. I'd like to go back to the Republican Party that when I was a staffer working for Bob Michael, we had Ronald Reagan, we had George Herbert Walker Bush, we had George W. Bush. These were Republicans that we respected. Didn't agree with them on everything, but we respected them, and we were proud to support them. I was proud to be a McCain delegate. And after I heard what Trump said about McCain, that was it. I mean, just to disparage a war hero, somebody who distinguished himself is just outrageous. The Republican Party that many of us came up through and worked with does not exist, Jim, and we want it back. We want to take it back. The way to take it back is to make sure that Trump does not get elected. The Trump Party exists. The Republican Party does not. I believe that Vice President Harris, hopefully, she'll follow some of the leads of President Obama and President Biden in terms of reaching out to those experienced, knowledgeable people that can make a difference.

They went on to say, we're deeply disappointed by the notification, are going to continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to ensure that just scoring placement and medal award for Jordan. So, you know, that's the next step. They're going to go to the Swiss Tribunal with video evidence that they say they have. Now, during the competition, you know, coaches have one minute after the routine to file an appeal to the judges' score, and the U.S. appealed Chiles' score and point one at the time was added, moving her into third place, which got her that bronze medal. Romania's original complaint, they said that U.S. took too long to make that appeal, to which the Court of Arbitration, they agreed. They said it actually -- it was four seconds too long. It's what they said, it's why they were going to strip her of the medal, but the U.S. says they've got video evidence. That it actually was done in 47 seconds. So, you know, Jim, we're going to have to wait and see what the Swiss Corp. has to say about all this. You know, we often see Olympic medals -- it's all about seconds, right?
