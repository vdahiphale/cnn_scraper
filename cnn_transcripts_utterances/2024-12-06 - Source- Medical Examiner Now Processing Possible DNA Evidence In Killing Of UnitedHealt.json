And new information on how investigators are trying to close in on the gunman's identity.Plus, Pete is a winner. Donald Trump posted that message about his embattled Pentagon pick today. A new public show of support for a nomination that is essentially hanging by a thread and pushing preemptive pardons. I'll ask a democratic power broker, Jim Clyburn, about his push for Joe Biden to preemptively pardon people. Donald Trump said he'd go after. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with a trail of clues to catch a killer who has been on the run for more than 50 hours now. And there's a significant new development to report to you. The person of interest was last seen on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, exiting Central Park on 85th Street Wednesday morning. That's where CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is right now. And Shimon, you have that information and some additional information about DNA.",

So, there is now DNA that investigators believe they have pulled off some of the evidence that they recovered at the scene in that alleyway where, as you'll recall, the suspect was seen fleeing.So, there is some -- they believe there are some DNA there and they have submitted it to the New York City Medical Examiner's office, which are the folks that would pull it and test it and see if they could perhaps find some kind of match. The importance of that is also you have to keep in mind that investigators are building a criminal case. And right now, since they really don't have a lot of evidence per se linking him to the crime, when you look at that video, you see him from the back. Perhaps they have other information, but they're starting to see -- what we're starting to see is that they're starting to hopefully, eventually hope to arrest him and then they have to prosecute him. And so, we're starting to see them develop some of that information and evidence for a potential prosecution. But as you said, Dana, quickly, we're out here on West 85th Street. This is the last place that we know of. There is video of this man fleeing from the scene. This is the last place that we saw him in video riding on his bike up 85th Street and going down the street here. And we don't know, as he approaches Columbus Avenue, does he make a left? Does he make a right? We don't know that. What we do know just based on our own work on the ground, he doesn't drive past Columbus Avenue, west of Columbus Avenue. We've looked at videos on that street. He's not there. So, where he is, is obviously the biggest question right now. It's kind of hard to believe that in a city of this size, that he would be able to hide. So, in this sort of large area, that's what's going on. And police tell us they're looking for him. They're trying to identify him, and they're looking for him. The other thing is, Dana, we haven't had a lot of information publicly from the NYPD since the hours after this. They have not held another briefing, and there could be a number of reasons for it. So, for now, all we have is really the information that we've been able to gather on our own here, on the streets and certainly from sources. And we'll wait to see if at some point the NYPD gives us any updates.",

We know that law enforcement was searching the park for it -- Central Park for it, but so far, they've been unable to locate it. So obviously, already, as he's riding, as he's get making his getaway, he's thinking of ways to get rid of evidence. And so far, law enforcement has not been able to find that.",

First of all, the NYPD is very good at what they do, so physical evidence from the videos that they're collecting, we don't know everything that they have.And as relative to this DNA evidence, even though -- even if it doesn't lead us directly or immediately to the perpetrator, who it is, the identity of the person, by collecting it, say, from a water bottle, from a discarded cell phone, maybe we get lucky and discovered a backpack, and there's more DNA evidence there, maybe the bike and so on. By being able to match that DNA among the items, the shell casings that were discovered at the scene, right? Maybe we get lucky and discover it and find the weapon itself.

There were a lot of hard nos that people that said they weren't going to shift. So, part of the reason that Donald Trump is still supporting Hegseth is because of the fact that they see a pathway there. But I am told that this could shift at any time, and there's a couple things that could shift at one. If there is a swell of senators who say we just can't get there with him, Donald Trump is likely to drop this candidate. The other part of this is what else is out there on Pete Hegseth. Is there anything else? And I am told by sources that if there are more allegations, if there are more accusations, if there are more whistle blow reports or police reports that come forward, that could shift the entire dynamic because there are people close to Donald Trump who don't feel like Hegseth was completely forthcoming on what was out there.",

In an interview during Trump's first term in office, years before Hegseth became Trump's pick to run the Pentagon, one long time Fox News producer told CNN that Hegseth also had a drinking habit that was an open secret on the set of Fox &amp; Friends. The producer said he sometimes noticed beer cans in the trash can inside Hegseth's office, and once asked his boss, does Pete drink before he goes on the air every day?
