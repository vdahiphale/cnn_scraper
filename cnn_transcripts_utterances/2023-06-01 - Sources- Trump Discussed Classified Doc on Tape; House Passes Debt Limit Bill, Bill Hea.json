Sources tell us there is a tape, an audio recording of former President Donald Trump admitting that he held onto a classified Pentagon document and suggesting he wants to share that information, but he's limited bid by his post-presidency ability to declassify records. So there's a whole lot there. CNN has not listened to the recording, but Special Counsel Jack Smith has it in his possession. And sources describe it as a, quote, important piece of evidence in the possible case -- possible charges against Trump. Here's what there is. It undercuts his argument that he declassified everything. And it shows that he knew he wasn't supposed to share sensitive information with others. We are told the recording is about two minutes long from July of 2021, and in it, Trump talks about a document involving a potential attack on Iran. So Abby Phillip asked Trump attorney Jim Trusty about this last night. He deflected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR/SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Did you know that this tape existed?

And in it, among the people in attendance were several Trump aides and two people working on an autobiography of former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows was not in attendance at this meeting, but during this time, Trump was in the habit of having his aides record conversations with journalists, writers, anyone working on a book. So he was aware that he was being recorded. And while we have not heard this tape, multiple sources have described it to us, and they say that on this recording, Trump makes it clear that he is still in possession of at least one classified document from the Pentagon describing a possible attack on Iran. Now, we're told that you can hear paper rustling, as if he is waving some sort of document. But it is unclear if it's the document he is referring to or something else for theatrical effect. But most importantly for investigators, on this recording, Trump is heard acknowledging the limits of his ability to declassify materials once he was out of the White House which, of course, undercuts every public defense he and his attorneys have provided for why he was still in possession of some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.",

Over the past year, he and his attorneys, they've given various, at times conflicting, explanations for why he did not intentionally retain this sensitive information.They've said that he had a standing declassification order. So anything that left the Oval Office was automatically declassified. He told FOX News that he declassified things just by thinking about doing so. But his lawyers have also told Congress that he was only in possession of these materials because it was so chaotic at the end of the administration, and he wasn't aware. But this recording, it really shows that none of those statements are true. And this also exposes the true legal jeopardy that the former president is facing. Also important to note that most of the reporting up until now has focused on classified materials down in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago. But here in this recording, it reveals that at least one classified document was up in New Jersey. Now, Trump's attorneys searched Bedminster late last year. They didn't find anything.

BRADLEY MOSS, NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY/DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, JAMES MADISON PROJECT: Yes, what sticks out to me is the comprehensive nature of this factual background that Jack Smith appears to have been compiling, in the case that he does choose to bring indictments. We've always expected there would be an obstruction angle. That we've already heard tons of media reporting about. We've seen a lot about that in the search warrant back in August 2022. But this shows not just that Donald Trump had brought documents, classified documents to Mar-a-Lago, but he knew he had them. He knew that they were still classified, and he knew he couldn't disseminate them to other people. This goes to the intent. This underlies and undercuts the potential defense issue that he was going to raise of he had automatically declassified it or he didn't know. No, he clearly knew.

But it doesn't have to be. But here's the thing. Donald Trump has a slight bit of truth in his statements. This is the most dangerous place for him. Yes, when he was president, he had all kinds of authority to declassify documents. But the courts have weighed in, saying there has to be proper declassification. Every single time it's been handled, there has to actually be the demarking, the documentation of the declassification. He can't just walk off with it as he flew down to Mar-a-Lago and say it's declassified. It's not the way it works. He understands a small bit of the legal theory, and he's taking that to the extreme. And that's going to be his undoing here. HILL: Be his undoing in terms of all those past statements. What about what we've heard from his attorneys?

That is the hope, in part because we are bumping up against that deadline on Monday of June 5th when the country could default on its debt. A couple of things at play here right now. There a number of Republicans and Democrats who remain undecided about this legislation. There's also a huge question of how quickly the Senate is going to move. You heard yesterday from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that he was hopeful that they could put this in motion and pass it as soon as Thursday or Friday. But you have to get a time agreement. And there are a number of members who want to have amendment votes. The big question and the big problem for an amendment vote is none of them actually can pass. Otherwise, you have to send this back over to the House, and you are in a position where you would definitely miss that Monday deadline. So, they have to have a couple of amendment votes.

Now, these are Soviet-era bunkers that are built around the city, very frequently close to or underneath tower blocks and residential blocks. But for reasons that are now subject to an official investigation in Kyiv, more than a year after the war, somebody had locked the door, trapping people outside. And then tragically, they were hit by debris descending. This all coming on a day in which the Russians continue to be under pressure, too. They are saying in Belgorod province in the South of Russia, on the Northern border with Ukraine, that a large number of villages along the border are being evacuated. More than 300 children. They're talking about evacuating -- evacuating women. And that's because a number of towns, they claim, are being hit currently with Ukrainian artillery and mortars.

Most recently, the New Jersey Nets and Devils back in 2003. But no one has ever been able to complete the double and win them both. Game one of Panthers and Golden Knights in Vegas, Saturday night. Puck drops at 8 Eastern on our sister channel, TNT, for that one. But tonight, we get to see Nikola Jokic on the biggest stage for the first time ever. And guys, his rise to stardom is one of the biggest we've ever seen in NBA history. He was the 41st pick in the second round back in 2014. The ESPN broadcast went to a Taco Bell commercial during his selection. I think it's safe to say that we will never have a two-time MVP in history of the NBA that's ever drafted again during a Taco Bell commercial.",
