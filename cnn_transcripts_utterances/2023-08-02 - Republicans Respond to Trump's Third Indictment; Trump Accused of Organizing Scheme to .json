Meaning next year could be a straight-up wild start to 2024 for Donald Trump, his team and everyone.On January 11th, looking at the calendar, Donald Trump is a defendant once again against E. Jean Carroll who sued him for defamation for statements that he made, denying he sexually assaulted her back in the '90s. That very same day is when the Republican Iowa caucuses occur. Then if you move that forward into March, Super Tuesday is set for March 5th. More than a dozen states are going to hold primaries on this day. And two weeks later Donald Trump is back in court for his second trial of the year, this for the 34 criminal counts that he faces over falsifying business records for cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. Now, a vast majority of the Republican primaries when you move into May, a vast majority of them finish by mid-May with six more playing out around Trump's classified documents trial. That kicks off on May 20th with jury selection set to begin for that case, all kind wrapped up in that moment. Donald Trump faces 40 criminal charges in connection to that one to -- for -- because of charges connection -- connected to illegally keeping classified documents after leaving office. Now, you have this next indictment, just handed down yesterday. Trump's team calls this indictment, election interference. Most of his Republican opponents in the presidential primary are agreeing with the former president, though some, including his Former VP Mike Pence, are standing up to call him out now. CNN's Jessica Dean picks up the story there for us. So, Jessica, how are his opponents, the other Republican presidential candidates reacting to all of this?",

David, to the point that Jessica was making there, look, usually re-election campaigns, incumbent campaigns are about the incumbent, about Joe Biden. But now, how is not everything that's going to happen, the primary and then if Trump wins the general election, how is this not now about Trump, and to an extent this actual case? DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR:  Well, it's interesting, John, because the Biden team would like it to be about rejecting MAGA extremism, as they say. So therefore, putting Trump at the center here, if not just the specifics of this case, a broader argument against extremism. But to your point, you have to remember here Republicans largely, as Jessica just walked you through those numbers in \"The New York Times\" Sienna Poll, they don't see criminal behavior here. They don't see something that threatened American democracy here, at least the vast majority of them. In fact, still if you look at polling, you know, majority of Americans believed that Joe Biden didn't legitimately win the 2020 election. They are bought into the very lies that Jack Smith is detailing in the indictment that Donald Trump has been selling. And so, this creates now a real test for the entire political system here. Yes, Republicans are going to have to deal with it in their own house first, in some way, and we'll see how that comes through. But there is no doubt, you are right that this will be, especially with the court calendar, playing out simultaneously, this will be a central issue of the 2024 campaign.",

Matthew DePerno, a failed Trump-backed candidate for Michigan's attorney general, and also, Former Republican State Representative Daire Rendon. They were both arraigned Tuesday.CNN's Zach Cohen joins us now with much more on this. Zach, tell us more what you are learning, as well as what you are hearing from these now defendants?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, this is the other indictment news from yesterday. And it comes in the form of state charges in Michigan against these two Republicans, as you mentioned. One of them is Matthew DePerno who, actually, was endorsed by Donald Trump to unseat the current attorney general in Michigan, Dana Nessel, and he obviously lost.But because he decided to run and tried to challenge Dana Nessel in the last election, she had to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee this case. Now, in the -- even though this was an independent special prosecutor and a grand jury that handed down this indictment, you know, DePerno is categorically denying any wrongdoing in this case. He says, the charges are unfounded and motivated by politics. But the indictment itself does stem from a long-running investigation, and DePerno is part of a loosely affiliated group of Trump supporters who have been trying to get access to voting machines across the country. DePerno also is behind one of the infamous lawsuits after the 2020 election where he was trying to get access to voting machines in another Michigan county. So, he's a known election denier in that state. And this is an indictment that was handed down by an independent special prosecutor despite the claims to the contrary by DePerno. Now, we also know that there are similar voting machine breaches that are under investigation in two other states at least, Colorado and Georgia. Both of those have had -- took place after January 6, 2021, as did the ones in Michigan. But it looks like they fit into the broader election investigation conversation because in Michigan, specifically, Dana Nessel, the attorney general there, has also indicted 16 of the fake electors, the fake Trump electors, who signed that certificate and put -- and sent it to the National Archives, asserting that Trump won the 2020 election. We also know there's a criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the election in Georgia. And of course, the indictment of Donald Trump yesterday announced by Jack Smith.",
