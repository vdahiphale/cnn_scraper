We know he traveled back to New Jersey with the former president. We've also learned that his lawyer was on the plane as was Donald Trump's lawyer. So maybe an indication there of how exactly they will deal with this communication. Of course, the judge saying that they could not communicate to each other about the case. We still have questions about who else will be on that witness list that Donald Trump cannot communicate with about the case. Of course we're going to see how that unfolds. But Donald Trump defiant tonight, his team saying that they feel good, they feel better than the past. And they now have a playbook for dealing with these indictments.

Now we've heard from the Chief of Staff of the SDF, Yasunori Morishita, and he said an investigation has been launched to make sure this never happens again. He has also said, quote, this kind of incident should never happen in an organization that handles weapons. Now gone crime is extremely rare in Japan as it is. Because the gun ownership laws are so stringent and there is such a strict vetting process to be able to get hold of a gun. Last year for example, there were just nine firearms incidents for the entire year including of course, that high profile assassination of the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. But what this is, is something different. It is within the military. We understand that police and military do have guns in Japan. They are those that are allowed to have them and this is why the chief of staff is so concerned. Saying this should never have happened within this kind of drill.

The latest numbers from the government show that consumer prices jumped by 4 percent year over year in May, that is not good, but it is so much better than the four decade high of 9.1 percent last June. Annual inflation has now cooled off 11 months in a row and it's now at the lowest level since March of 2021.All of that is moving in the right direction. It is very good news when it comes to the cost of living. One problem though. The most recent cool-off in inflation is being driven in large part by the plunge in gasoline prices. And that is not likely to be repeated. When you look under the hood, you can see that underlying inflationary pressures are stubbornly high, they have not cooled off all that much in large part because of the spike in housing costs. So it is going to take some time for that metric to really get back to healthy levels. But beyond the official government numbers, economists and investors they like to look at alternate sources of data. And we did get some encouraging news on that front as well. Because online shoppers are being greeted by rapidly dropping prices. Adobe Analytics says that online prices in May fell by 2.3 percent year-over-year, that is the biggest decline since April 2020. Back when COVID-19 pandemic was causing all kinds of chaos in the world economy. Computers, electronics, flowers all experienced large price drops. Online prices for groceries are still going up rapidly, but even those have cooled off. So when you take all this together, Wall Street is betting that the latest inflation indicators are going to give the Federal Reserve cover to do absolutely nothing in today's meeting. Investors are growing increasingly confident that the Fed will hold interest rates steady, that would snap a streak of ten consecutive meetings where they've raised rates. But because inflation is still not back to healthy levels, investors and economists are penciling in another interest rate hike come July. Max and Bianca. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
