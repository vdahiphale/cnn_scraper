      "sentences": "Well, president-elect Donald Trump on Friday urged the Supreme Court to put a pause on a controversial ban on TikTok, arguing that a delay in implementation would allow his incoming administration to try and negotiate some sort of deal that would save the app.Now all of this relates back to a ban that Congress approved earlier this year and Biden signed into law, really arguing and requiring that the platform be sold to a new non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States. That ban is currently slated to take effect on January 19th, just one day before Donald Trump is sworn in to office. Now what Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to do puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which filed its own briefing on Friday, urging the Supreme Court to move forward with the ban. And they warned of grave national security concerns if it is not implemented. Now one thing to be clear on is that Donald Trump, in his briefing, did not really address the underlying First Amendment questions. But he did urge the court to put this pause on the ban so that his administration can try to find some way to resolve the issue. This is what he said in the briefing, quote, \"President-elect Trump urges the court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans. \"While also addressing the government's national security concerns.\" Now one thing to be clear on is that TikTok is very popular in the United States. It has 170 million monthly users in the U.S. And Trump, for his part, has wavered on the issue. Back during his first administration, he actually signed an executive order that would have effectively put a ban on TikTok, also arguing of its national security concerns, given China's influence over the social media platform. However, throughout his time on the campaign trail in 2024, as well as just a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump said that he is warming to TikTok. And he argued that part of his stance on that is because so many young voters who voted for him use the app. Now all to say it is very unclear what is going to happen. But Donald Trump's argument is that he wants a pause on this ban so that his administration can figure out how they want to resolve this -- Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Police were flagged down by a passerby, who reported seeing a man on fire on Friday. The flames were out when police arrived and the man was sent to a nearby medical center but he sustained burns across his legs and torso. The extent of his injuries was not known. Police say they're still trying to find out how the man suffered the burn injuries. Well, that incident comes less than a week after the gruesome burning death of a woman on a subway car. And now a suspect has been indicted by a grand jury. Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is scheduled to be arraigned on January 7th on charges including first and second degree murder. Police say the 33 year old undocumented immigrant set fire to the woman as she slept on the stationary subway car. They say he fanned the flames with his shirt after igniting her clothes. Law enforcement sources tell CNN the victim is believed to have been homeless, which makes identifying her quite difficult. Though her body was badly burned, investigators have made progress using fingerprints and DNA evidence.
