That is how wildfires take advantage of the dry fuels in and around the area to produce additional fires and spread this large, large complex fire that is ongoing.In fact, there was an individual who sent us this video as they were flying into Amarillo Airport. And you can see the -- just the general space and the magnitude of these fires. This is overnight and into the Texas Panhandle, just how far as the eye can see, there is wildfire burning across the Texas Panhandle. Right now, 500,000 acres, zero percent containment, that's over 200,000 hectares, for our international audience. That is a significant fire. It puts it at the second largest in the state of Texas history, set back -- a record set back in 1988. This is very interesting as well. We noticed that the Smokehouse Creek fire has crossed state lines as well. Of course, there is no borders with wildfires. But, it is interesting to note as it continues to travel with the winds. It continues to spread into parts of Oklahoma. Speaking of the winds, check this out, cold front moved through overnight last night. It was able to be detected on the satellite imagery. Those are the hotspots. You're looking at a vantage point from space. And notice, once the winds change to a more northerly direction with the passage of the front, the fire's behavior changed as well, starting to move in a southerly direction, being pushed by the strong winds behind the cold front. So, that also made it more difficult on the ground for firefighters and residents to predict the exact future of where this fire will eventually spread. What about the smoke? Well, right now, it currently varies thick across Amarillo and portions throughout the Texas Panhandle. But, notice this. The shift in the wind direction will make that smoke move in a northerly direction by this weekend, impacting places like Dodge City, parts of Kansas and western Oklahoma. Winds, yes, considerably lighter than they were yesterday at this time, but they are forecast to pick back up, and the warmth will return in this forecast. So, it is expected to see more fire behavior, fire weather possible by this weekend, not something residents and firefighters want to hear. Rahel.",

And so, there has been some cattle that's been let loose on some county roads, but it's better for them to be safe and be able to run away. And these are people's livelihoods.

      "sentences": "Right now, there is negotiations that are happening between the House and the Senate to try to avoid this shutdown on Friday. They tried to actually pass a short-term extension of government funding. They've already done that three times since the beginning of the fiscal year, last October, started kicking the can down the road to avoid a shutdown, just pushing it down for another few days. That's where the talks are at this moment. But, it has caused considerable frustration within the ranks on both sides of the aisle because it really has a significant impact on the federal government, on program level spending, planning for federal agencies, impacts on jobs, and families as they are concerned about the prospects of having shutdown as well.So, so many issues here at play. But, the politics are complicated, particularly among the House Republicans versus the Senate Republicans. House Republicans have demanded certain measures and policy restrictions to be added to these spending proposals. Democrats in the Senate have pushed back on that. Senate Republican leaders also have been aligned with Senate Democrats on this. So, very much is a Senate GOP versus House GOP division about strategy and tactics going forward. And Mike Johnson, the new Speaker of the House, signals that he believes that they can prevent a shutdown. But, he is facing his own internal pressures within the House Republican Conference to push for much more aggressive policy restrictions or even deeper spending cuts. He is resisting some of those urges on his far right. So, if he does agree to a short-term extension of government funding, which is -- seems to be the direction things are headed, undoubtedly he'll face backlash with the -- on his right flank. And remember, back in the fall, the reason why Kevin McCarthy, the then Speaker of the House was ousted in historic and unprecedented fashion is because he agreed to move forward on a short-term extension of government funding with the support of Democrats. That was something that was seen as a red line for members on the far right. So, this has been a very complicated saga, which is really the basics essence of governing here in the Capitol, fund the government, keep the lights on, but that has proven to be a very difficult task in this historically unproductive Congress.

Typically, you're supposed -- Congress was supposed to pass year-along funding bills from October 1 through September 30, the fiscal year. They sat down in front of this band aid approach. He said there'll be no more doing of any of that. But, the reality is, he is faced with a choice. They don't have to deal on funding the government for a year-long basis. And so, the only option is a short-term extension of government funding or shut the government down.

I mean, Hunter Biden coming to testify behind closed doors is a huge get for Republicans who had been trying to obtain his testimony for months. And this is a really high-stakes interview because Republicans have essentially looked to Hunter Biden as the basis for their entire investigation and allegations about the President. But, there has been no evidence that the President has been involved in his son's business deals.In fact, Hunter was unequivocal about that in an opening statement that we obtained. Let me read a section of it for you. Hunter says, I am here today to provide the Committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry. I did not involve my father in my business. Not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions, domestic or international, not as a board member, and not as an artist. Never. So, Hunter is just the latest witness to meet with Republicans behind closed doors and refute their central allegation.

The good news, Rahel, is that there is time. The other good news is that this White House is continuing to reach out to those folks in Michigan, and frankly, in other places that are not happy with how this administration has been handling the war in the Middle East. They are listening to them. And in fact, if you look at what this President has been doing from October up until now, he has changed some of this course. And I believe that those changes, as subtle as they might be and as frustrating because they don't go far enough as they are to those who are supporting a ceasefire, they need to understand that they are making a difference.In fact, it was just recently that the President used the word \"ceasefire\" for the very first time. He has announced sanctions to the folks that live on the West Bank, the settlers. That has never happened before. I think the challenge moving forward, and I believe it's also an opportunity, is for this White House and this President to continue to listen to those who are unhappy. There is a lot of pain in those communities, and in those groups of voters who see the horrific images that are going on in Gaza, but to also focus on what is the broader themes here in the general election. What is at stake? The contrast between somebody like Joe Biden and somebody like Donald Trump, who would implement a Muslim ban, who is as xenophobic as you can get, and who would be a huge existential threat, not just to our democracy, but for all communities that make up our great American electorate.

If you ask the Haley camp, there is really not much they can offer there, because let's not forget, Nikki Haley, in the fall, talked about this unfettered support for Israel, Israel being our only ally in the region. She has been given Netanyahu's back at every turn, and that's not going to change. Trump, on the other hand, I think Bibi would like to see Trump back in the White House, no doubt. But, Trump is a little bit disjointed when it comes to messaging on this. We've heard various things from him. He went from criticizing Bibi, to saying he is supportive over the - of what that administration is doing in Israel.But, I think you -- you look at this bigger thing. You zoom out. The big picture here is that frustration from a lot of Americans across the political spectrum, across a range of demographics, whether it's Gen X on down, that do not believe in having the back of our allies when they're committing atrocities. So, the state-sponsored genocide that you hear a lot of Arab Americans talk about, and why they wanted to run this uncommitted campaign, that is something that should continue to remain at the forefront of the minds of politicians on both sides of the aisle. I'm not trying both sides as for no reason, Rahel. But, what I'm saying is that you've got this crop of Americans that does not feel represented in our federal branch of government, whether you're looking at the legislative or the executive, not even the judiciary. So, what do they do with this? They don't politically participate. And that is a thoroughly modern problem that I don't see anybody in the GOP talking about responsibly.

He never deployed sophisticated, innovative techniques that could help with quelling what I think is continually a crisis that has spilled over into communities like mine in southern West Virginia, where fentanyl continues to ravage my hometown. And I would just say this. One of the best people on this entirepresidential campaign trail, whether you're looking at the Democrats or the Republicans, is Nikki Haley.

We have seen as the pace of the meetings of the conversations has picked up in the last week or so. And today, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader, in a televised statement saying that his organization has displayed \"flexibility in the negotiations in recent days\". He said that that flexibility is out of \"concern for the blood of our people and to put an end to the great pain and enormous sacrifices\". But, he is also reaffirming that he will not allow through what he describes as political machinations to arise what hasn't been accomplished on the battlefield.He also interestingly called on Palestinians in the West Bank and in Jerusalem to march on Al-Aqsa on the first day of Ramadan, which could give us a preview of what could come if there is not a deal between Israel and Hamas. We saw, of course, yesterday as President Biden expressed optimism here. But, in the region, that optimism is far more cautious than what he talked about in terms of being able to secure a deal by early next week. What is clear, though, is that efforts to get aid into Gaza are being hampered by the fact that the Israeli military is continuing to carry out heavy operations and that there has been insufficient coordination between the Israeli military and these aid groups to actually get that aid, where it is most needed in the Gaza Strip.",

So, these devices are used to turn legal single shots semi-automatic weapons into rapid fire guns that can fire several hundred rounds per minute, resembling illegal automatic weapons. Bump stocks were banned after the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017, the deadliest in U.S. history. 58 people were killed when a gunman opened fire from a hotel room. Authorities said that at least 12 of the weapons were outfitted with bump stocks.Joining us now from Los Angeles is CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell. So, Josh, this is not a case that specifically about the Second Amendment, but it is being watched pretty closely on both sides of the debate of gun control. So, bring us up to speed of sort of what's happening at the High Court.",

If the Supreme Court rules that the ATF, the agency here in the U.S. that can regulate guns, if they can't regulate a bump stock, are they not able to regulate other devices? A gun can be easily modified with all sorts of contraptions that can make it fire more rapidly, increasing its lethality. And so, that is what, again, both sides of the debate are watching here. If the Supreme Court rules that the ATF cannot regulate this device, could there then be this floodgate that opens where other regulations are also now called into question? Again, this is a very, very serious issue. We know that gun control itself has been stalled in Congress for many, many years. And we'll have to wait and see whether this regulation is also going to be countered by the court.",

And it's stunning to know that in the last several years, there have been over 500,000 of these types of devices that have been sold and widely available in the United States. And so, that was something that everyone will be watching. Are all those people who are now in possession of them, can they use them? Or is it still illegal?

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, I'm told that this program has been a game changer for the U.S. government. Starting late in 2022, CNN has learned the Treasury starting to quietly roll out artificial intelligence-powered fraud detection, basically trying to catch the bad guys who are trying to steal from taxpayers. And this strategy appears to be paying off, especially when it comes to fraudulent checks.Treasury officials tell CNN that in fiscal 2023 alone, the government was able to recover $375 million by using this AI-powered fraud detection. It also led to the arrest of multiple individuals. Now, this is the first time that Treasury is publicly acknowledging that they're using AI to try to fight financial crime. And we know that this is something that, as you mentioned, the IRS started doing recently to try to catch tax cheats. It's also popular in the private sector banks and card companies and other businesses. They're leaning on AI also to try to guard against fraud. Now, we should note, though, Rahel, that as you mentioned, AI is kind of broad. Right? And so, this is not the generative AI that gets all the headlines. Right? This is not the stuff of ChatGPT and OpenAI that creates images and song lyrics and even movie quality videos. This is really big data and machine learning. And the point is, though, that it is helping the government try to combat fraud, which has become a major issue. Check fraud, in particular, has spiked by 385 percent since the pandemic, according to Treasury. And here is why AI can be so helpful. AI technology is really, really good at combing through vast amount of data and trying to detect patterns and red flags. And it can do that at lightning fast speeds, so much faster than humans ever could. One security CEO told me that once you train an AI model, it can detect red flags within milliseconds. And so, Rahel, that means that in some cases, now the federal government is able to spot these anomalies, alert the banks, and prevent fraudulent checks from ever being cashed. I think the crazy part here is that the AI revolution, it's really just getting started.",
