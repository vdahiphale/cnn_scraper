As the war between Israel and Hamas continues in Gaza, U.S. warships are responding to attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, all of this leading to fears of a larger war across the Middle East. And fans in South Korea and around the world are mourning the loss of Lee Sung-Yoon, the latest on the investigation into the actor's sudden death, ahead. Plus, in Myanmar, criminal charges are -- criminal gangs are engaging in human trafficking and a method of scamming known as pig butchering to steal millions from unsuspecting Americans. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". Israeli military leaders are making it clear that the war with Hamas won't end anytime soon. The Chief of Staff for the Israel Defense Forces says the fight will continue for many more months. He says Israel is close to its goal of dismantling Hamas in northern Gaza and is now concentrating more on the southern half of the enclave. News that Israel's offensive will likely go on for longer is not sitting well with some countries. France's foreign ministry says that it is worried about civilians in Gaza and renewed its call for an immediate truce. A U.N. human rights expert says Israel is, quote, working to expel Gaza's civilian population. The U.N. estimates that 85 percent of Gaza's population has been internally displaced since the conflict began. With more on that, here's CNN's Will Ripley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The terrifying sound of ongoing bombardment, Israeli shells hitting targets. Closer and closer to this U.N.-run school in central Gaza. For thousands sheltering here, it's time to move, again. Families forced to flee for their lives, and this is not the first or even second time for many. Once again, they carried the war-torn pieces of their lives in pursuit of elusive safety. Just days earlier, many here vowed they would never move again. Never. A vow they're now willing to break only because they know their children's lives are at stake. OM MOHAMED, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): There's no safety in the school. We're looking for a safer place. I'm leaving because of the intensity of the airstrikes and the suffering. RIPLEY (voice-over): Everywhere else is crowded. There's no guarantee they'll find a spot but what else can they do? Even if they have nowhere else to go, they can't stay here. They don't want to die here. The scene, a grim reminder of what their parents and grandparents endured in 1948, when Zionist militias forced them out of their hometowns. In the cold winter, blankets and mattresses are precious commodities. Cars and the fuel that run them are scarce. Those who can't afford it hire donkey carts. For the rest, it's a long trek on foot. It's very tough back there, he says. Bombs are falling on people everywhere. People were injured there. We don't know where we're heading. Everywhere is under threat. We're just moving with the rest of the people. The destination for many? Relatives' homes. A roof over their heads even if they are in neighborhoods already devastated by Israeli airstrikes. Street battles raging across Gaza, turning areas north and south of the strip into ghost towns. The scars of battle rock.",

The U.S. is taking a moreactive role in protecting ships traveling in the Red Sea. The U.S. says it intercepted 17 drones and missiles fired by Houthi forces in Yemen on Tuesday alone. This after the Iraqi government condemned a series of American airstrikes that targeted Iranian-backed militants operating inside Iraq. The White House says the airstrikes were aimed at militants who attacked U.S. forces in the region, but Iraq says civilians were among nearly 20 people injured in the U.S. airstrikes. For the latest on all this, let's bring in CNN's Pentagon Correspondent Oren Lieberman. So Oren, the United States sent two ships to the region as a deterrent, has put together a coalition in the last few days, as well. And yet we continue to see these rather bold attacks by the Houthis, obviously sponsored by Iran, as U.S. intelligence has linked the two. What more is the U.S. saying about this growing threat?",

And this latest barrage was quite stunning in its size and, frankly, its audacity. Over 10 hours, U.S. Central Command says yesterday Houthis launched 12 one- way attack drones, three anti-ship ballistic missiles and two land attack cruise missiles. Those were intercepted and shot down by a U.S. destroyer and U.S. fighter jets operating in the region. So, you see there the threat to commercial shipping. A Houthi spokesman says some of that was fired at a ship that had not responded to Houthi naval forces, and some of that, the Houthi armed forces spokesman said, was targeted towards Israel and launched in solidarity with the Palestinian people. We have seen a number of major shipping companies avoid the Red Sea for this very reason, because of the threat of Houthi attacks on what they see as Israeli-linked ships. It is worth noting, though, Bianna, that a couple of days ago, Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, if not the largest shipping company in the world, said they would once again begin sailing through the Red Sea instead of trying to go all the way around Africa or find some other route. That is a major vote of confidence in what the U.S. is trying to do here. And we'll see if other countries and other shipping companies follow suit and continue once again to go through the Red Sea. But that's the goal of the U.S.-- to try to make sure they secure international shipping, especially through such a critical waterway. Meanwhile, the U.S. trying to calibrate its responses, its actions in the Middle East to try to send a message to Iran and its proxies without this war spreading any more than it already has.",

Well, right now you are looking at new video of Tuesday's attack on a Russian Navy ship in Crimea. The U.K. Defense Secretary says the incident shows the war is not at a stalemate. And this is the aftermath of an attack in Odessa, where a Russian drone killed one person. A six-year-old child was among the four other people injured in that attack. And shelling in the Kherson region killed a police officer at a rail station. People were lining up there to evacuate the area at the time.

Well, one of the things that we're actually hearing from on theground is that the Russians apparently have really upped their game, especially as far as those drones are concerned. The FPV, very small first person view drones, as they're called loitering munitions as well, and also drones that can be used at night. But also what we have seen from the Russians is large scale attacks using armored vehicles where a lot of those armored vehicles were apparently destroyed by the Ukrainians. So, I think one of the things that we can see, especially along the eastern front in Ukraine, as well, the territorial gains, so far, pretty incremental, even if you look at towns like Mariinka, which has been almost, which has essentially been completely destroyed and Avdivka, it still is a very active frontline. And I think that's also what that Ukrainian commander, Alexander Sierski was alluding to as well. The Ukrainians under pressure in the town of Avdivka near Donetsk, also under pressure on the outskirts of Mariinka, where they apparently still hold a few places, but not much again. That place has been reduced to rubble. There is literally not a single building that is intact in that town. So, really not much of the Russians are said to gain in that area. However, the Ukrainians, of course, are saying at the same time, they're able to still strike the Russians and hurt them pretty badly as far as that ship was concerned. The Ukrainians are saying that they hit that ship, that landing craft, and that they believe that there was a large amount of ammunition on board that ship, which is why that explosion was so big. Of course, the Russians so far are only saying the ship was damaged, Bianna.",

The State Supreme Court in Michigan has just rejected an effort to remove Donald Trump's name from the state's primary ballot. Critics have been seeking to disqualify the current Republican frontrunner over his role in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. This ruling comes just days after Colorado's Supreme Court ruled the opposite barring Trump, citing the Constitution's insurrection clause. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us now from Washington, D.C. with more on the case and its implications.

There have been challenges across the country making this argument based off the 14thAmendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, and they have almost all been rejected except for Colorado. Colorado was very different. They held a trial. There were witnesses, cross-examination, evidence, and ultimately a finding that Donald Trump is ineligible for office. That was Colorado, but this is Michigan. And a decision today from the Michigan Supreme Court was to uphold a lower court decision that dismissed this case on procedural grounds, essentially finding that there was no role for the courts to settle this type of dispute and no authority for election officials to even remove Trump's name from a primary ballot. So, look, the decision from the Michigan court was unsigned and it was very short. But one of the justices did write a brief opinion to explain some of her rationale, and I'll read it for you because this is a very critical point. Justice Elizabeth Welch said that \"I would affirm the Court of Appeals ruling on this issue, which still allows the appellants,\" those are the challengers, \"to review their legal efforts as to the Michigan general election later in 2024, should Trump become the Republican nominee for President.\" In other words, yes, he can stay on the primary ballot for now, but if he wins the nomination, this Justice says that they could file their lawsuit again. And that's what some other states have said, too, Bianna. And it looks like that might be exactly what the game plan is here for the anti- Trump challengers. Let me read for you a quote from one of their lead attorneys that he issued after the ruling. This is Mark Brewer. He said, quote, \"The court's decision is disappointing, but we will continue at a later stage to seek to uphold this critical constitutional provision designed to protect our republic.\" So, a big win for Trump today but you've got different opinions in different states begging for a resolution from the U.S. Supreme Court, and we all think that's where this is headed.",

And the Houthis, for their part, I mean, they tweeted this out saying that this is showing their continued support and solidarity with the Palestinian people. But there are dozens of nations that have been affected now. Many of these ships have nothing at all to do whatsoever with Israel. And we've seen companies like Moller-Maersk, one of the world's biggest shipping lines, oil giants such as BP, changing the routing of their shipping as a result of these threats. And it's a very important threat because this Bab al-Mandab Strait, which is between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, accounts for about 10 percent of seaborne trade goes through that. It's also very important for Egypt because the seaborne trade going through there, most of it, is going through Suez Canal and beyond. And so, it's impacting not just Israel, it's impacting Egypt, it's impacting global trade. And I suppose the big question here is at what point will Israel, which has also been shooting down some of these drones and missiles, and the United States and its allies, at what point will they move from defensive positions, i.e. just taking out these missiles and drones, to an offensive position to take the war to the Houthis, which of course are backed by Iran and based in Yemen, and are threatening global shipping and global trade.
