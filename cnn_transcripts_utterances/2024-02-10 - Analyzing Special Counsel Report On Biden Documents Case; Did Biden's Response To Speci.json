I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.That was the New York Times headline after the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report on his investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents. The word exoneration, I think an overstatement. How bad was it? Well, a president who turned down CBS's invitation for a pre-Super Bowl interview with a guaranteed audience of millions in an election year suddenly felt obliged to speak to the nation in primetime from the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House. And when he did, he seemed to be in denial, both about the substance of the report and the political implications. Recent polling has shown that a majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, have major or moderate concerns about Biden's fitness for a second term. But when CNN's MJ Lee raised that with the president, he said that was only her incorrect perception. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Think about, for example, the Central Park Five people who were falsely accused of a crime they had nothing to do with. This report is more like an inch away from an indictment if you look at it.And you highlighted the key passage in your opening there, the third sentence of this report says essentially, the evidence showed that Joe Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified documents, there is a federal crime for willfully retaining sensitive national defense information. And if that rings a bell, it's because Donald Trump is charged indicted for 32 counts of that exact federal crime. But what Hur does, and this is fair for prosecutors to do is he says we need to look at the other factors around this. And he says that in his judgment that mitigates against an indictment, that's called prosecutorial discretion. And there's perhaps some debate about how we exercise that, but that's why he comes out at no indictment.",

Robert Hur under the Special Counsel regulations, had to write a report setting forth his findings as to whether prosecution was required or not.Now, as to some of the language around the memory loss, it's important to understand it's relevant to the prosecutorial determination here because Hur says, well, we might have a problem proving intent because of the memory loss. I do agree, however, that the way Robert Hur writes it, the way he describes it is over the top, is more colorful than necessary. And I think there are flourishes there that a prosecutor would not have to include. You could just write it as we believe that given our interviews with Mr. Biden, there would be intent questions, he -- his memory at times was faulty or failing, you could have left it at that.

Within the next 10 days or so the Supreme Court might make the most consequential decision of our lifetime. It pertains to Donald Trump and the election but I'm not referring to whether Colorado will be permitted to knock Trump off that state's ballot. No, I'm talking about a more arcane but important issue of legal process.On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals in the D.C. Circuit rejected Donald Trump's assertion of immunity in the federal election interference case pending now in front of Judge Tanya Chutkan. The court said this, \"We cannot accept former President Donald Trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power the recognition and implementation of election results.\" The ruling against Trump was not a great surprise. Although, the comprehensive nature of the 57-page opinion it was thorough to the point of clearly wanting to be the final word. More revelatory was the accompanying judgment entered by the three-judge panel the order contained a mandate which basically said that Trump has until Monday to notify the Supreme Court of his intent to file an appeal or writ of certiorari, which he will surely do. The Monday deadline is a highly accelerated timeline. Normally, three weeks or so would be afforded before a case will be sent back to the district court. No doubt that's in recognition of the election calendar. Once Trump provides notice of his intent to appeal, the Supreme Court will need to decide whether they're going to stay the ruling of the Court of Appeals pending Trump's filing of a petition for writ of certiorari. Or will they allow Judge Chutkan to re-list the case for trial? Remember, this case had been scheduled for trial on March the 4th. Trump wants to delay all the cases against him and run out the clock until Election Day. A Supreme Court's day would freeze the proceedings at the trial court level and make it less likely that Trump would be tried before the election. Without a stay, Trump's lawyers will be free to pursue his appellate rights, but Judge Tanya Chutkan could simultaneously put the case back on her trial calendar. So, here's the issue. Can Donald Trump get the necessary five votes needed for a stay? He appointed three of the nine justices but that's no guarantee of how any of them are going to vote. Of course, whether this case viewed by me and by many as the most potentially perilous to Trump among the four indictments whether it gets to trial before the election could determine the election winner. Look no further than the poll released last week NBC. It shows Donald Trump ahead nationally over Joe Biden by five points. But when asked if a Trump conviction would change their vote the lead switches to Biden by two. Joining me now to discuss is Tobias Barrington Wolff. He's a professor at the Penn Carey Law School. He specializes in civil procedure complex litigation, conflict of laws and constitutional law. Professor, thanks so for being here. What's going to happen on Monday?",

Circuit, exactly as you described, Michael, they have taken every part of this case that they have control over and they have advanced it. They have said, we are not going to allow ordinary delay to slow down the potential trial calendar for this case. What they don't have control over is the part of it that involves the Supreme Court. And what the court is going to need to decide is whether to put the case on hold while they are figuring out whether they are going to hear an appeal.And so, on Monday, in very concrete terms I think what's going to happen is that Mr. Trump will give notice to the court that he intends to file a petition for writ of certiorari, which is the device to for trying to seek an appeal in the Supreme Court, and he's going to ask them to -- at that point, the D.C. Circuit will continue to put things on hold until the Supreme Court decides what to do about a stay. And then the next big decision that they have to make, the Supreme Court, is will they stay the proceedings while they are deciding whether to hear an appeal.",

The chief has shown in several ways that he cares about perhaps his legacy but also the institutional regularity of the court. And Justice Barrett, before she became a judge, was a scholar of procedure in the federal court and I think cares very deeply about these issues.You know, there has been a lot of procedural irregularity in the court in the last several years. So, you know, you can't count on their commitment in that way. But, I think, they are the two members of the court on the conservative side who are going to care the most about making clear that they are using their powers in an appropriate fashion.",
