And we're going to see all of that being laid out and applied to the law. There's different categories of damages. Some of that will relate to loss of business opportunities. Some of that will relate to emotional distress. And some of that will relate to those punitive damages that we spoke about. We're going to see the plaintiffs go through and talk about why the award should be millions and millions of dollars and justify that using the evidence that was set forth in the trial.The defense perspective is going to do the exact opposite and talk about how and point to evidence about the undercutting E Jean Carroll's damages claims and especially attacking the prospect of punitive damages being assessed in the case.",
