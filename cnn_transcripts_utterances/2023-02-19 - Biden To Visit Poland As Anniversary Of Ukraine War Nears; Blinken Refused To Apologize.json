That now seems to be a growing consensus in NATO and in the European Union, that that might be likely. This is what the Chief European official said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, I have spoken to Ukrainian refugees who told me, they arrived to the US with just summer clothes, expecting that they were going to be back by the fall or winter. And now a year later, they are still here and they are setting roots there. They were able to do so through a humanitarian parole program that the United States has set up for them to be here for two-year periods. Now, of course, one year in that is already causing some stress and concern about what happens within the next year as this war continues in Ukraine, and many of them are looking to see what their options are, whether they have other legal pathways to stay in the US or renew or extend that parole status that allows them to be here temporarily and to work here temporarily. But, Paula, there is no doubt among the Ukrainian refugees that I've spent the last few days talking to here in the United States that they are emotional about the fact this war is ongoing, that they may have to stay in a country they never thought they would have to move to -- Paula.",

They also need to have some reassurance that the United States is going to support them diplomatically and militarily and continue the aid that has been flowing to Ukraine through Poland, in large part during the course of this conflict.

The Ukrainians, of course, have special prosecutors that are looking at violations such as those that occurred in places like Irpin and Bucha.But the key thing to think about here is that this may mean consequences for Russian political and military leaders at the end of this war whenever that occurs.",

The tank crews also, you know, they're getting the Abrams and the Leopard tanks. Those need training as well. So it's going to take a while for these weapon systems not only to get to Ukraine, but to be employed by highly trained effective crews and that will make a difference.

So they are a very dangerous combination for the West and it is very possible that the Chinese will try to circumvent any sanctions that are placed against them and against Russia, so we could very well see lethal aid going to the Ukrainian front by the Chinese, being provided by the Chinese and that, of course, could be dangerous for the Ukrainians.",

It was already done, things were already rolling before that happened.Also, there are a few things that are interesting, as far as the background of some of these businesses. You know, the railroad company outsources the cleanup. There's this company, Artes, out of Holland, they have locations in the US and offices. One of their Vice Presidents just a few years ago got convicted and charged for fraudulent invoicing where they were extrapolating some of the things that they were doing and saying they were doing a lot more work than what they were doing. Obviously, he was removed from the company, he is not there, but that is kind of like a little bit of insight into the type of company that is cleaning up the area.

I looked into her background, she has an MBA. She has a Master of Business. She's an attorney for an electric company before this, and I don't see how an attorney is supposed to be cleaning up an environmental issue. And so, a lot of these people are in over their heads and I don't think there's enough help early on from the State government. And definitely, we are how many days into this? Two weeks?
