Donald Trump is ramping up his appearances this week, while Kamala Harris is largely stepping back a bit from the campaign trail. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign released a new ad today focusing on inflation and the economy, two issues weighing down her bid for president. A new ABC/Ipsos poll shows Harris trailing eight points behind Trump when it comes to who Americans trust to handle the economy. Let's bring in our CNN political commentator and former communications director for Vice President Harris Jamal Simmons. And former spokesperson for Republican Governor Doug Burgum -- Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign, Lance Trover, is joining us as well. Jamal, let me start with you. Vice President Harris' new ad vows to cut costs for everyday Americans and it acknowledges that prices right now are still too high. So how does she sell a different strategy to voters when she has been vice president for the past 3.5 years?",

The truth is the macroeconomic numbers are spectacular, right, 16 million jobs growing, the inflation rate is down, wages are up, GDP is going up. All those things work.But people still have pain points in the economy. And that's what the vice president is going after directly. She talks about rent and trying to help people get more housing stock and then be able to buy houses that would help with lowering housing costs. She talks about now price gouging and how we're going to have -- go after companies that might be taking too much money from the American public as the inflation rate's going up and they're overpricing. So they're really going after very concrete steps to help people who are trying to manage an economy where they still have pain points around inflation.",

So I think the real test for him is going to be not to let Kamala Harris, who I think a lot of people are going to be tuning in, saying, who is this, who is this vice president we have been hearing about? They're going to be Kamala-curious, I think. And so the test for Donald Trump will be not to let her rewrite history. She's kind of wanting to gloss over her time as a U.S. senator, wanting to gloss over her time as being vice president. So I think, for Donald Trump, it's about not letting her gloss over that time as inflation has skyrocketed over the last four years and the border has been out of control.

The danger is that you just start throwing the kitchen sink at Trump and then none of it really lands well because people don't understand the fundamental point you're trying to make.

When you hear West Nile, EEE, and dengue, you know it must be mosquito season out there. Mosquito-borne diseases are surging across the globe right now, not just here in the United States. And experts now say climate change is contributing to the conditions that enable the transmission of those diseases. But before we panic over every bite, let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, to help break -- to help us break down exactly how concerned we all need to be. Sanjay, how widespread, first of all, are these diseases right now? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  So let me give you a snapshot of the United States. We can put up the map of what's happening with West Nile. And as you look at this map, keep in mind that August and September are sort of peak mosquito season. So we're in the thick of it right now. But what we can see if we have that map of West Nile is that two -- there's 289 cases roughly in 33 states. Sort of interesting, Wolf. It's sort of spread around the countries. It's Texas, California, but also quite a bit, as you see there, in the Northeast and Michigan, that area. So you're seeing quite a few cases right now. Again, this month, sort of the end of this month is when we will probably start to see those numbers start to come down. Eastern equine, that's much rarer. We have six cases in five states right now. Again, it's the same thing, because they're both mosquito- borne illnesses. This is the time where those cases will be up. I will point out, Wolf, that, when it comes to dengue and malaria, that's typically travel-acquired. Travel somewhere, you bring it back. But Puerto Rico right now has a public health emergency going on with regard to dengue. They have 1,500 cases or so, much higher than they normally get. So that's something we're keeping an eye on.",

And it's just the females, by the way, that bite and transmit the virus.The recommendations are going to sound pretty obvious, but using mosquito repellent all the time, really, especially this time of year, August, September, important, DEET or picaridin. Picaridin doesn't have the odor. So if DEET bothers you from an odor standpoint, picaridin is probably better. Wearing the right kinds of clothes, loose-fitting clothes. Standing water is one of the big areas where these mosquitoes breed. And then dusk until dawn, that's going to be the worst time. So if you're out at those times, wear long sleeves and wear insect repellent. And, again, hopefully, fingers crossed, Wolf, end of this month, that's when we will see the number start to go down.",
