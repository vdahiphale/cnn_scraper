It turned out that he was actually there months later in China, overall, not in Tiananmen Square. Here's what he just shared with reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ, (D-MN), VICE-PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I got my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989. That -- that move from Hong Kong into China, it was profound for me that was the summer of democracy. I said it's where I understood how sacred democracy was. It's what encouraged me, about 15 back-and-forth with my students, taking them to China to understand both, first of all, the culture, but also to teach Chinese students about democracy. That was part of the first -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MIKE MORGAN, HENDERSON COUNTY, NC, SPOKESMAN (via telephone): Yes. Thank you very much for having us on. And, yes, we've never experienced anything like this in a county before. We've just been -- we took a direct hit from hurricane. And you don't usually see that in the mountains of western North Carolina. But right now, we've set up hubs, resource hubs all across the county. We're trying to get residents water, non-perishable foods, other items they need, baby formula, you know, diapers, wipes, things like that for small children as well as toiletries. While all these hubs are passing stuff out, they have had a constant flow of people. We're accepting donations currently. We've seen stuff come in from all across the country. We've seen some federal stuff and state stuff starting to show up as well. We have a very long way to go because there wasn't a part of this county that wasn't affected. And some took bigger hits than others. And it's going to take a lot to rebuild. But I tell you, we are tough folk here in Henderson County in western North Carolina. Not just us, but our good friends up in Asheville up the road and even farther west in the Waynesville and Haywood County, who also took a big hit. And, you know, we're -- we're going to work together. But we are still in rescue mode in this county. We still have people in this county we're trying to get to. And that is the main focus for everyone in Henderson County and our emergency management teams right now.",

Because we've heard from the former FEMA administrator, just because someone has not been accounted for, you have to be very careful. This does not mean -- don't read too much into it.

We've seen the - the last number, last report I heard, we went from about 75,000 homes to about 50,000 homes without power. I think that's improved today.Cell phone services has come back today. We had a pretty big problem yesterday. Communication has been the biggest problem. People who have been cut off. And yes, I worked the phones a little bit after the storm hit and we started a wellness check list. And we had over 600 calls that came into our call center of people just asking, how's my grandmother, I need to check on my brother, my sister, my son. And what we've done, we took the employees in this county, 750 almost 1,000 strong. Everybody came to work on Monday. We put them doing stuff and we had a bunch of folks getting in the cars. We mapped it out, going, trying to get to these wellness checks, trying to see if these people are OK. So folks in Henderson County have been working hard looking out for their neighbors. And I totally agree, because of the lack of contact, it's kind of hard. And especially if they're in these areas that got hit really, really hard. I mean, it may be another week or so before they even have cell phone service or power down there. But folks are working hard. Duke Energy's working hard. The cell phone carriers are working hard. Our emergency management, rescue squad, EMS. We've got help from all across the state. We've got other fire departments here assisting us. It's been an unbelievable effort. I'm not there now, but I've been living pretty much in the operations center. Those folks are the heroes, man. They're superheroes, those men and women out there risking their lives to save folks in our county. God bless them all. We're so fortunate to have them. And we're going to get through this.",

And one other thing he did was he acknowledged that this investigation is one of several related investigations that are taking place by the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. And that the investigation into Adams started in the summer of 2021. That was before he was elected mayor. They also revealed some information about allegations of witness tampering. What the prosecutor said was a significance instance of witness interference in this case. What he said happened was that one witness was approached by the FBI. After that, according to the prosecutor, quote, \"a clear message from the defendant was delivered to this witness to not tell the truth to the FBI.\" Now, after court, Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro, said that that is the sort of nonsense that prosecutors say when they don't have a real case. He said, if they had a real case, they would bring it. Now the big question is, when will this case go to trial? Adams' lawyer is pushing for this case to go to trial and be wrapped up by March of next year. Because that is when the election signatures and the certification begins in is underway for the New York mayoral race. Adams is up for reelection next year. Prosecutors suggested May. The judge said he wasn't going to pick the date now, but he did agree that it was in the publics interests and in the mayor's interest to have this case happen quickly and have this trial underway. Prosecutors are estimating the whole case could last about four weeks. Everyone will be back in court on November 1st. We might learn then when this case will actually go before a jury -- Boris?",
