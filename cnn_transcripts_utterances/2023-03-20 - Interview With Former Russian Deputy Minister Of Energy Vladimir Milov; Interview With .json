I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Tonight, as the war in Ukraine throws the spotlight on democracy and accountability, we will look back to look forward because it's 20 years since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the reverberations are still being felt today. President George W. Bush once said, the road to democracy in that region would lead through Baghdad, and be a watershed event in the global democratic revolution. Well, it didn't. Quite the contrary, in fact. Here he is, back in 2002. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT:  The days of Iraq acting as an outlaw state are coming to an end.

We will examine that legacy later in the program, but first, Americas hubris then is being flung back in its face now by new global challenges. Vladimir Putin, intent on crushing Ukraine's democracy. And China's, Xi Jinping, who sees a new world order being made more in Beijing's image. Today, the two come together in Moscow. Beijing is casting this visit as a journey of peace. But is it more like the rise of the authoritarians? Vladimir Milov, former Russian deputy minister of energy, is joining me from Vilnius in Lithuania. And Michael Beckley, former Pentagon official and co-author of \"Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict with China\", joins me from New York. Gentlemen, welcome to the program.

On the contrary, I'm sure he promised Xi Jinping last year that this will be just a swift blitzkrieg type operation. Now, it is messy. And moreover, China has no influence over it. They cannot make any decisions that would change the course of the war. However, Putin is a very important ally in Xi Jinping's standoff against the democratic west. He needs him.

Just to put some doubt in the back of Putin's mind that he could really count on China if he escalates severely in the conflict. But other than that, I mean, you know, I agree with Vladimir that China, obviously, would have wanted Russia to win this war easily. But I think a longer drawn-out conflict is not necessarily a terrible outcome for China either because it ties down the west and causes the United States and its allies to expand their own stocks of munitions and distracts them from whatever China is trying to do in East Asia. And so, while it might have preferred a Russian victory, keeping this war going is not the worst thing for China.

And in that hour, when suddenly all the security forces of Saddam melted and disappeared, and the Iraqis were, I would say, everyone was excited to get rid of Saddam. But when they saw the Americans, they were expecting, you know, -- I mean, it's a Faustian deal. No one wanted a war. We've been bombed by the Americans before. We've seen war with Iran. But they thought, fine, if this will get rid of Saddam, let's go through the motions. But then, of course, no one asked the Iraqis if they want a war or nothing.

And I want to talk about Iran as we saw it. You know, when I was a child, during the Iran-Iraq war, I thought Saddam was the manifestation of God. Because I had seen nothing. His pictures are everywhere. You -- people talk about him. People fear him. And this is how we understood this Iraq. And Saddam, kind of, portrayed himself as this manifestation of the glory of all of this history stuff and replaying the history again and again. And that was our understanding of history. Of course, the war in Iran led to the war of Kuwait, led to the sanctions which destroyed the Iraqi people. 13 years of very severe sanctions. Come 2003, Iraq is a broken nation. It's barely standing. It's barely functioning. And then suddenly, we are told that this whole narrative of 5,000 years of civilization is not true, you know? It's a new narrative. Now, it's a very sectarian narrative based on a system we call muhasabah (ph) in Arabic in which each sect will take a number of ministries.

And of course, the Americans left in 2009, then stopped fighting on the street. But the Iraqis continued to die, and die in a more horrific numbers thanks to the emergence of ISIS, the Islamic state, and all the repercussions. And they are still dying until today. You know, two weeks ago, I was in Baghdad, and I was hanging out with this guy, you know, writing about him. He's a militia commander and he is responsible for killing thousands of Iraqis. And you know, 20 years later, there is no accountability. None of the people who plotted the war, who led the war, who executed the war, the commanders foreign and Iraqis who killed civilian, there's no accountability, 20 years. And this is the problem for Iraqis, you know. When you ask them about America now, they will just point at this corrupt political system that we have and they blame America for bringing that. And without holding people accountable, not putting them in jail, but just opening the, you know, being honest with the Iraqi people, I'm talking to them.",

And you write, no, no, you can't be doing this, I gasped, at least allow the facade of liberation to last for a day. But now, with all the arrogance of every occupying soldier throughout history, he covered the face of the defeated dictator with the flag of his victorious nation, briefly, but long enough to seal the fate of the invasion in the eyes of many. You then called it perhaps an honest act. I remember, American -- the officials in Washington were horrified and tried to, you know, send a message to stop that, get that flag off because this wasn't about America, it was about Iraq. Talk about again that moment. ABDUL-AHAD:  This is why I think he was very honest, because for that marine, he did not believe in all this rhetoric coming from Washington, all of the people were talking about. He saw it as a war between his army, his soldiers, and the Iraqis. And probably, if all the rhetoric that was coming around the invasion, the rhetoric of liberation and Iraqi prosperity and whatnot, that act of the marine, covering the face of Saddam with his American flag, as horrible as it was on TV, it was a very honest act. You know, that was a dictator, we topple. It is not the Iraqis who toppled this statute, and this is another sad thing, you know.

Were you concerned and where did you think it would lead to that time, in 2003, 2004? Did you think it would ever lead to ISIS in the end? ABDUL-AHAD:  Maybe no one could have imagined ISIS as it is, but it was obvious that the Americans had no security plan. And the borders were open, and anyone who had a grievance against the Americans would come to Iraq to fight, that includes the Jihadi's, coming as far as -- from as far as Afghanistan, so many. But also, the Iranians who were working very hard to make the -- you know, the Americans -- why would the American succeed in Iraq and we are next? We should make the Americans fail in there. So, all these different forces. But also, again, the sectarian rhetoric.

Because there are many people who say that even though the war was -- the invasion was based on a lie about WMD, that a post war plan that was coherent and credible might have made the best out of a situation. Do you believe that or not? ABDUL-AHAD:  For a few months, probably a year I thought of that. I thought, if only the Americans would do soi and so. If only they would fix the services, maybe the people would. And a decade later, I realized you cannot bomb a nation, put it under sanctions for 13 years, bomb it again, and come with this very clumsy plan until it become a democracy.

Hence, there was enormous confusion and there was enormous chaos and there was enormous disorder, immediately after the regime was toppled.

They need to -- Americans need to modulate their fears. They need to really be able to determine much more accurately when there is war is not \"an existential threat.\" They also need to grasp the limits of American power. During this period of time, of course, the United States had hegemonic power, no great power rivals whatsoever. So, American policymakers thought they could achieve what they wanted to achieve. They perceived threats and from a pretty weak nation, overall, Iraq, and they believe that the exercise of their power would enable them relatively easily to remove the threats that they perceive. Another lesson, right, would be reexamined fundamental assumptions. That's easy for me to say, it's easy for most people to agree, but how many of us reexamined fundamental assumptions. The fundamental assumption here was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that assumption should have been carefully reexamined, and there were opportunities to do it.

So, I would say today, President Biden's carefully calculating these issues with regard to the situation in Ukraine. He understands that undeterred aggression, that Russian aggression left unmet is a dangerous precedent, both for Europe and for what might in the future have been in East Asia. He understands that and I think that he is right about that. At the same time, he has carefully tried to calculate that although that is an important interest, and overriding priority is not to get engaged in a full-scale war with Russia because that might culminate in the use of nuclear weapons. So, I see President Biden trying carefully to calculate the nature of American interests and to prioritize them and to design tactics that are commensurate with the priorities he is assigning to those interests. And I think that's the lessons to be learned here. It's not, yes, we have an interest in Iraq or we don't have an interest in Iraq, we do have interests in Iraq. We have interest in the Middle East.
