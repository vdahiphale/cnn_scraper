We have just learned the Secret Service has concluded its investigation into the security failures in Butler, Pennsylvania. And soon, Ronald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, will announce those findings and then take questions from reporters. It was that 13th of July shooting in Butler in which a gunman opened fire at a Trump campaign rally, grazing the ear of the former president and killing a spectator while injuring others.",

Those same highest levels with respect to the Secret Service are being provided to the former president's detail. And so, when it comes to maintaining this, where we are at right now is, we have finite resources. The way we are structured with some of our classified assets, with some of our personnel, and with some (AUDIO GAP) designed to support the president and vice president. We have now expanded that to include the former president. And so, while we can do this, it is certainly -- we are burning through a lot of assets and resources. And that's the argument that we have been trying to show. This isn't -- this isn't some pie in the sky, trying to say, hey, we want -- we want this now. We are not capitalizing on a crisis. We are showing the math. We have finite resources. And we are stretching those resources to their maximum right now, which is going to require us to replace these assets. It's going to require us to also adjust to look at this and evaluate that, if we have to do this again or do it because of some other situation that we have no other control of, we have to be able to sustain that for an indefinite period of time.

And when agents start, we don't -- you cannot put them on the highest level protection, protecting a protectee. When they graduate from our training facility, they go to a field. They do advances. They do criminal investigations. The importance of having that, what we call phase one, that's where those agents that are doing federal investigations, that are interfacing with local law enforcement, those are skills that they learn, analytic skills, how to conduct a federal investigation, how to interact with a U.S. attorney, how to interact with a state or local agency. And all the while they're doing that, they're also popping in and out doing protection, whether they're doing it in New York City for a United Nations General Assembly or they're doing an advance for a visiting head of state or a world leader that comes into their field office district. That's where they cultivate and sharpen those skills. And it will take them up until probably four years. Ideally, that sweet spot is between the fourth and fifth year where we send them off to a permanent detail. That's where we are getting to as far as the career path. And so it's critically important that we make sure that we still develop people. You -- it is -- being on the Presidential Protective Division or the vice presidential detail, it is a very, very high-pressure situation. It requires a lot of maturity. It requires decision-making, analytic skills and the ability to problem-solve. And it takes time to develop those skills, even though we have put you through training.
