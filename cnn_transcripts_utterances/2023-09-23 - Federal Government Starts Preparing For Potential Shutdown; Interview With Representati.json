Just one week from today the federal government will face a midnight shutdown unless some kind of funding bill can be passed and signed by the president. With every passing hour that looks more unlikely. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy sent lawmakers home for a long weekend after far-right Republicans defied him and his spending measures so federal agencies have begun their formal process of preparing for a shutdown. For millions of federal workers and military personnel their paychecks could be delayed possibly for weeks. And it all comes as a crisis grows at the southern border. Federal officials are sending more resources there to help with this resurge of migrants crossing into the U.S. Today House Speaker Kevin McCarthy conceded he has to win over Republican hard-liners but he's hopeful he says that they'll fall in line to pass some kind of stopgap spending measure and prevent the shutdown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I think when it gets crunch time people will finally -- that have been holding off all this time, blaming everybody else, will finally hopefully move off because shutting down and having border agents not be paid, your Coast Guard not to get paid, I don't see how that's a victory.

It is up to two sides, where we typically talk about Democrat and Republican. It is Republican on Republican.Today in the House the speaker had a conference call with his members. This was the message to his members. Avoid a government shutdown. Pass a stopgap spending bill. Keep the government running for some time while they negotiate the larger year-long bill. The problem is he doesn't have the votes because he has made a strategic decision to try to pass this along party lines. They want a Republican position coming out of the House to negotiate with the Senate on it and try to come up with a compromised plan. But there are a group of hard-liners that are simply not there. There are probably about seven or so who oppose any sort of short-term measure. So -- and he can only afford to lose four votes. So therein lies the challenge. And you heard Republicans come out today. I spoke to some of McCarthy's top allies trying to make the case for their members that they believe if there's a shutdown they'll get the worse solution. They'll get jammed by the Senate. And that's exactly what Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told me earlier this week, on Thursday. I talked to him about this impact, Jim, about what would happen. He said they're going to cut a deal and they're going to try to jam the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We may have to now go first. Yes. Yes, I do. Given the House. Leader McConnell and I are talking and we have a great deal of agreement on many parts of this. It's never easy to get a big bill, a CR bill done, but I am very, very optimistic that McConnell and I can find a way and get a large number of votes both Democratic and Republican in the Senate.

I guess let's just get quickly right into this. What is your take on where things stand on the shutdown right now? You heard Manu just say a few moments ago it looks like we are heading towards a shutdown at this point, barring some kind of unforeseen compromise that comes out of the Republican Party. I mean, do you guys in the Democratic Party, in the House, sort of on the sidelines or watching this from the bleachers at this point? What do you think? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): When it comes to a shutdown, Jim, Democrats are working for working people. And in the Senate Republicans and Democrats came together to fund the government, take care of our troops, take care of our police, take care of our border agents, take care of the American people. The president stands ready to sign that legislation. House Democrats stand ready to pass it. But we've seen complete failure by House Republicans. They've failed to govern. They've failed to fund, and by doing that they have failed to protect the American people.",

They are the failures.And if we're talking about Kevin McCarthy's job, and if that's what Kevin McCarthy is worried about, then he's not worried about the millions of people who will be affected if the government shuts down. The federal workers who won't get paid. The FBI agents, the border agents, the troops who won't get paid. The air traffic controllers who won't get paid. We kind of need them to move Americans around so our economy can keep humming along. And so this isn't about one person's job.

I suspect next Saturday night is going to be a painful one for a lot of us here in Washington. What do you think? Is Kevin McCarthy in -- it sounds like he's just in a pickle. He's just in a bind.

I mean, Donald Trump is under 91 felony indictments. And by the way, you are not hearing these calls from the Republican members of Congress for him to drop out of the presidential race.I think Bob Menendez's instincts to try to tough it out is very much, you know, reflecting that shift in the belief among politicians in both parties that you can now survive things that didn't seem to be survivable just by putting your head down. What changes the dynamic, Jim, though, as Manu noted, is that he is up for re-election next year. So he has to face a primary in June at a moment when Democrats have to face really eight seats that they are defending that are not at all guaranteed to hold. The idea that they would have a wounded incumbent in New Jersey I think really changes his circumstance, and there will be, I think you saw Andy Kim already, I wonder if there'll be others. Mikie Sherrill is someone who many in the Democratic Party representative from New Jersey, will be a national star. That could change the equation here and put much more pressure on him than if he was up for re-election, for example, in 2026. ACOSTA: And if you're a Democrat, doesn't it sound more consistent to call for Menendez to resign, if you've been out there calling on Trump to, you know, get out of the race or that he's not qualified to run for president and so on?",

So I don't know if that it's. I think it's really more if he was not up for re-election this year, I have a feeling this might play out very differently.But the fact that he is up for re-election in '24 means that whatever other Democrats say, and whether he faces -- whether he ultimately resigns or not we know now he's going to have at least one challenger and he may have more challengers, and if he doesn't step down I think the voters -- Democratic voters of New Jersey are going to have to decide whether he is their best standard bearer going into the '24 election.",

From overnight last night until now, this storm has kind of come and gone in this area strangely. We heard the rain. Saw the rain overnight. Then when we came out here to downtown Alexandria earlier today it would kind of come and go.And now we're getting another squall of wind and rain, and we're told it's going to get worse. Now over here, at the Potomac River, you can see kind of the pattern over there. The rain is coming this way. The river was at high tide about an hour ago. And high tide will come again of course early tomorrow morning. That's kind of what they're concerned about. About an hour ago the water was coming over the river and kind of towards this way. And one of the problems here in Alexandria that we're going to show you about is regarding drainage here. Drainage is a problem here in old town Alexandria. It's a low-lying area. It was built on a marsh and drainage is an issue. Right over here, this whole area here was basically covered in water a little over an hour ago. Still, as the rain builds you're going to have problems with the sewers overflowing here and elsewhere in Alexandria. That's been an issue. That's been an issue for decades here but that is part of the problem. They have issued a flood watch here in Alexandria from 8:00 p.m. tonight until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. I just texted with a city official who said that crews are going around trying to repair traffic lights that are out. Otherwise, he said they've gotten through the storm pretty well, but what they are advising people as we see the wind picking up here in downtown Alexandria is that you've got to secure the things that are on your balcony or on your patio, chairs and things like that that are kind of loose. Bring them inside or at least try to tie them down because, again, this is going to be kind of coming and going throughout the afternoon and evening into tomorrow morning. We also we talked to some business owners down there who while they often put sandbags on their entrances and windows, they're not doing that now because they don't expect the actual flooding to be that bad right now, but one of them said they're going to monitor high tide tomorrow morning at about 7:00 a.m., because that's when, she said, some of the water tends to kind of come up in a second surge. And with the tropical storm adding to that surge, that's what they're worried about here, Jim. So, you know, again, it's a strange pattern. Kind of comes and goes here in Alexandria. We're getting hit with another squall right now and some flooding is expected here in the coming hours. So we've got to keep an eye on this area -- Jim.",
