And are you concerned about Hamas using the hospital as a potential base?DR. ABDEL-MANNAN:  So, myself and my colleagues have traveled to Gaza many times over the last 10 years and speaking to the colleagues as well. And I asked him that question, have you seen anything that amounts to military activity? The same doctor, Dr. Ibrahim Mattar (ph), and he said, I swear on my life. I swear on my mother's life. I have never seen anything that looks like this. I have never seen Hamas militants inside our hospitals or using children's cancer wards to launch rockets as the IDF proposes or claims. We have not seen this evidence. There is no footage or images of Hamas militants working inside. So, if the IDF and Israeli government have evidence, then they need to show it.

And I don't want to get into the specifics of how social media works, but this wasn't just shouting into the wind about some of these witnesses, literally tagging them so they would see his statements. That's how social media works for viewers who aren't aware with it.You know, if you put @johnberman, John Berman's going to see this, not that anyone would ever say anything unkind about you, John. So, the point is, he was doing this about a number of witnesses, which really steps up to the line of if not witness intimidation, certainly tinkering with the administration of justice.

I'm going to get right to what we've just heard about this ethics report and that the head, a Republican, of the Ethics Committee is going to go forward and ask for George Santos to be expelled.What are your thoughts? The Democrats tried to kick him out of office after all the lying, and then he was indicted in federal court. The New York Republican delegation also tried to do the same. And now, here we are with this very damning report. What are your thoughts? REP. HALEY STEVENS (D-MI):  Well, only five people in the history of the entire House of Representatives have ever been expelled. And so, while this isn't unprecedented, it is a big deal. And I have been shocked, disappointed, upset by the allegations against Mr. Santos, his behavior, not only starting with the lying, but also, frankly, the illegal behavior that has now been exposed. Wire fraud, abusing campaign dollars, donations. Who is this man? And so now, having gone through the right process with the Ethics Committee, shared by a Republican and a Democrat, their findings have revealed that he is indeed at fault. He is qualifying for expulsion. I know Mr. Guest. I came into Congress with him. I know he takes his position very seriously. And learning that he is going to file this motion is a big deal. And frankly, I voted to expel Mr. Santos the last time it came to the floor, and I plan to vote for it again.",

And one of the things that we are seeing coming out of this face-to-face meeting is that these two leaders saying, we're not going to agree on everything, but we need to find ways to work together.The U.S. is the largest economy in the world. China is our largest trading partner. A manufacturer of many, many American consumer goods. We're certainly working on reshoring supply chains and investing in manufacturing, which is what we did with the Chips and Science Act that I helped to pass last year. That's making a big difference for Michigan automakers, every (ph) workers. But the deal is this, that we have waited a long time for China to come along. And in many ways, they haven't. There's still fishy, if not illegal practices going on. There's a trade imbalance. And this isn't just a wake-up moment for our country, but it's a wake-up moment for other trading partners of the United States, the European Union and our partners in the global South.
