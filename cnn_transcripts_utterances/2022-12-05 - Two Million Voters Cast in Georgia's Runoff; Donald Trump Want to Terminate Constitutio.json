In an election fatigue state making sure that the people who haven'talready voted actually show up on election day. Now, here in Loganville, Georgia, Republican Herschel Walker was joined by Republican Senators Tim Scott and Joe Kennedy. They spent a lot of time talking about former President Barack Obama who, of course, came to Georgia on Thursday to rally for Senator Warnock. Now Herschel Walker in these final days hasn't really changed his speech, but he is a more having a more pointed attacks against Senator Warnock when it comes to missing Senate votes because he has been out campaigning and also to work to tie him closely to President Biden. Now, we are also seeing surrogates for Senator Warnock try and tie Herschel locker to former President Trump. Senator Warnock keeping a very busy schedule for the duration of this four-week runoff period, he held a large event last week with the AAPI Victory Fund, and also spent the day in Athens, which is awful considered Herschel Walker territory. The University of Georgia being there and outside of Atlanta, in Gainesville. Warnock will maintain that aggressive campaign schedule through election day. But we've talked about Herschel Walker having a bit of a lighter campaign schedule, not having as many events. This was the only one today. That changes on Monday, the Walker campaign scheduling five different campaign events. A much more ramped up schedule than we have seen really throughout this entire runoff period as we go from days to hours before election night. Diane Gallagher, CNN. Back to you.",

It's astounding how many people still showed up, as you pointed out almost two million ballots already.Look, what we saw in the first round and reflected in the exit polls was a very close race. Georgia was probably the swing state that snapped back the most in general towards Republicans, between '20 and '22. The other key states, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all very clearly move towards the Democrats. But in Georgia, Republicans quite well on most, in most races up and down the ballot, but voters have enormous doubt about whether Herschel Walker is up to the job of being Senator. They question his kind of command of the issues. Obviously, his morality, his veracity, and all of that has really created an enormous opportunity for Raphael Warnock to buck the tide in the state. The best thing that Herschel Walker had going for him was the chance that he could be the 51st vote creating a Republican majority Senate, which I think many voters in Georgia would support. That is not there anymore. So, whether Republicans are still going to come out in the numbers they need once they no longer have the opportunity to control the Senate, I think that is the big question and it's the one that gives Warnock the thumb on the scale edge of the end.",

So, meantime, former president Donald Trump is going to be calling for the termination of the Constitution to overturn the 2020 election and reinstate him to power, an extension of course of his continued effort to deny the 2020 election results. Why are we not seeing more Republicans push back on this, given that more are starting to question his viability as a 2024 presidential candidate? BROWNSTEINterminate. Because too many of the interviewers use the word suspend the Constitution. That isn't what he -- that isn't what he said in his -- in his tweet. He said that the Constitution should be terminated to restore him to power through non-Democratic means. I mean, that is essentially as close as you can get to the definition of an autocratic coup. And yet, as you pointed out, once again as we have seen throughout Trump's, really since his emergence as the national figure, virtual silence from Republicans as there was about personally criticizing Trump over his meeting with Fuentes and the rapper Kanye West, and virtual silence over his suggestion in between that meeting and these comments that the January 6th defendants are being railroaded and that he would not only pardon but apologized to them. And what you are seeing is the continued refusal of Republicans to stand up to Trump. Even when he clearly is threatening kind of the pillars of American democracy. And I think what's really important is that this is happening at a moment when Trump is at a low ebb, where as you point out, elites in the party are saying that he has, kind of have led them into a dead end after this disappointing midterm. And if Republicans are unwilling to stand up to him at this point, what does that say about what would happen if the became the nominee again, much less the president again, and try to move down on any of the past that he have laid out in the last couple of weeks?

Let's start with these reports that he said that Iran's morality police was abolished. Now please take that with a grain of salt. These were off-the-cuff remarks in response to a reporter asking why the morality police had not been seen in the streets of Iran since these demonstrations began, just about three months ago.And there seems to be seen this interpretation here, because Iran state media was very quick to push back against these comments, make clear that Iran's judiciary is not in charge of morality police, that falls under the interior ministry of Iran. And you would imagine, Rosemary, if Iran was indeed abolishing its morality police, that would be a major announcement that would be well orchestrated and very clear. So, let's put that aside for a second and talk about the review of the hijab law, which that's critical here. Also, these comments coming from the attorney general who is speaking Thursday, saying that the judiciary and Iran's parliament are reviewing this hijab law. Now, we could hear the results of that review in the next couple of weeks, but it's important to remember here, Rosemary, that the demands of these protesters who have been taking to the streets in Iran in multiple cities for weeks and months now, have grown way beyond a call for a review of the hijab law or for any changes to the hijab law. They are now demanding serious, serious reforms. Even the overthrow of Iran's religious establishment. So even if there are changes coming, it's unlikely that they will meet the demands for those many protesters still on the streets. Rosemary.",

So, our air quality is not too bad at the moment, but when that front moves through a lot of these green dots are likely to turn moderate to sensitive groups because of the wind shift pulling more out of the south and a lot of it moves into a heavily populated area. So, we'll have to be cautious on that. So, there is the high, but we are watching the low and that front move through.

This is a sanction on Russia designed to limit their revenues from oil, which have actually been going up not down since the start of this war because of the disruption that the war ironically has caused to the global oil markets sending prices up.So, the west wanted to limit the amount of money that Russia can make from that key export, and funnel, of course into its war effort. But in doing so, the secondary sort of goal of this measure was to limit the impact to global oil markets, which of course have been in so much turmoil since the start of this war. That is why they set the price at $60, that is quite some way above what we believe to be the breakeven level for Russia only a little bit below the recent average for the Russian euro's oil variety. So, in theory, it should incentivize Russia to keep producing, not to take oil off the market leading to a price hike. But of course, it's controversial because it is only a little bit below what Russian euros oil has been trading for Many are including, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy are criticizing it for being too weak. And I think also, the jury is still out on how well this will do in terms of stabilizing oil markets. You can see oil is coming up a little bit this morning. Not too much. I think many are in a wait and see mode because if Russia does follow through on its threat not to ship oil to countries that comply with the cap, that could in theory lead to some rationale coming off the market. At the same time, as we're seeing COVID restrictions potentially loosening in China leading to a rise in demand, and that could send prices up again.
