This new video edited and provided by the Israeli military appears to show helmet camera from Israeli soldiers coming under fire while rescuing those hostages. One resident of a refugee camp in Gaza claims he saw special forces with the Israeli military disguise themselves as Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians during the operation. The operation did come at a great human cost. Scores of Palestinians dead. Just how many, we don't know. Gaza's Health Ministry says the number is at least 274. Israel says it's fewer than 100. I am joined now by Joel Rubin. He is the former deputy assistant Secretary of State in the Obama White House. Joel, good morning to you. Wonderful to see you this morning.",

But in the big picture, the best way to get Israeli hostages out has been through deals. Through a ceasefire for hostage exchange like the one that we saw back in November. So a good day for Israeli unity. It didn't last long. Obviously, the politics in Israel are very dicey with Benny Gantz now exiting the coalition government.

And now, with Benny Gantz leaving the coalition, it gives them a little more power in the near term. But it also puts the question to the Israeli public -- and I think this is why the president did go public with his proposal to get the Israel public to recognize the stakes. To put it back in the political arena this question about how to end this war in a manner that we don't see a Hamas resurgence in Gaza. And so, the holdup right now is that Hamas understands that this proposal is against their interest and that's why we see the secretary going out. That's why it's frustrating that it's not yet done. But Hamas -- they're hoping for more days of violence, like on Saturday, where they don't have to make this agreement. And that means more Palestinian lives are put at risk.",

One of the hostages rescued, Noa Argamani. She was kidnapped by Hamas from that music festival and was seen on video being forced onto the back of a motorbike. Noa's father said that the reunion that she had with her family was difficult. Her mother has late-stage brain cancer and was unable to express her feelings. Professor Hagai Levine is the head of the health team at the Hostages and Missing Family Forum and joins me now from Tel Aviv. Professor, thank you so much for being here. Noa is being treated at the same hospital as her mother is. What are the primary concerns for her as she tries to recover after spending eight months in captivity? HAGAI LEVINE, PROFESSOR, HADDASAH MEDICAL CENTER AND HEBREW UNIVERSITY (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, of course, it's very emotional to be back in Israel to meet her mother. Unfortunately, her mother is very, very sick and we are even sure if she understood that Noa is here. That's terrible. That shows that when the innocent people were kidnapped, also the families were kidnapped. And we see and we also know Almog's father Yossi's funeral was last night and he did not -- he just died a few hours because he received before the news that his son is arriving. About Noa, I cannot disclose her personal information but I can say in general, she's in a much better shape than what we were concerned. There are not only psychological but also physical issues related to captivity. I brought her personally the glasses that she needed for eight months where she had to use contact lenses. Obviously, it's not good for her eyes. And now she has a struggle because her mother is so sick. So it's the joyfulness of coming back home and she cannot be completely happy.

I must say that their resilience and their support of each other are remarkable. It's really showed us what the human spirit can do. And, you know the stress -- any time in captivity could be your last moment. Sometimes, it's a small anecdote as they taught each other languages and they taught them Russian and some Arabic and staying together with all their physical and mental and other assaults (PH) it's also very reassuring in a sense to see how they were able to cope with the situation. Which reminds me, you know, the stories about Carmal Gat, who is a student at the Hebrew University where I teach for occupational therapy, and she provided yoga lessons for, remains in captivity. We don't know what is going on with her right now. It's clear they will need a very long recovery process. And Shlomi cannot return to his home up in the north because there is war going on there and his home is attacked. And it will take months and years. It's also -- for the other families, it's great joy but the concern is enormous. They cannot really -- the released hostages -- they cannot really fully recover when they know that their friends are still there. And I must say with some worry because today, in the Israeli Parliament, the families of the hostages were attacked by the extreme right-wing members of the Parliament which, in a way, told them that they should be sacrificed. I am sorry to say that. And we know that the only way to get all the 120 hostages back, dead or alive, is by a deal. There was a deal that was put on the table by President Biden and I think it's -- all of us -- and I am -- through your show I want to deliver to the world we must put the pressure on the Hamas and its allies to accept the offer and to stop the bloodshed and release all the hostages.
