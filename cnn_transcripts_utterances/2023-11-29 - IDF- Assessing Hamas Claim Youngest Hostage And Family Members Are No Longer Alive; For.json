Because Hamas had initially said that it didn't no longer have control of this family and did not know exactly where they were.MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET), U.S. ARMY: Yes, Sara, very difficult news. And in some ways, we were getting to this spot for these hostages in the fact from an accountability perspective that we're going to lose track just going to be the number that they took. And I think what Israel is going to look to do is you know proof of life, the -- flying drones, they're going to do whatever they can from an Intel perspective to try to circle back and see what if they can prove this out or not. Again, I -- it's not going to be the first story on this. I don't -- I don't believe just given the volume of hostages they have, given the fact that they've given some of that already. And again, from an Intel perspective, they're going to clear their desks, use whatever they can to try to figure out where this possibly could happen. This is easy for Hamas now to blame every lost hostage on an Israeli airstrike. And I think that's -- from their propaganda perspective, that's -- you know, right out of their playbook.",

Aid coming in from the United States there.There's just so many layers to this information propaganda war, that in the -- in fact, you know, Hamas and that kind of network always seems to be out in front of. And I think that's what they're trying to do now. Get out in front of this information and say, look, this is what happened. We lost accountability. That means it's really not our fault. And in fact, it's the fault of Israel because they ended up killing them in some kind of airstrike. So, again, the propaganda war is something Israel is going to fight every day.

They have to be careful. Other IDF forces are in defensive positions now to see what Hamas has done if they reposition some of their soldiers to the south. I would not think that there would be too surprising. They could look to flank some of the IDF positions that are even in the north. But I don't necessarily think they're going to throw those ground soldiers in right away, just from the psychological impact of it.And you know, having been on the ground and in a combat zone, it's really difficult to kind of flip that switch to go from this warfighter to all of a sudden in a defensive position, and now all of a sudden get told we're going to start clearing operations. So, I think they're going to --they've got negotiated this work completely at their level on their pace all the way through, and I think they're going to continue to do that. But once it starts, again, I think you're going to see a combined air, land, and sea campaign in Gaza.",

They say they are hoping that the IDF will refute that.Here's their statement. Our family has learned of Hamas's latest claims. We are waiting for the information to be confirmed and hopefully refuted by military officials. That is where we are now. They are devastated hearing it. They have been devastated for the past month and 22 days as they wait to hear any news on the youngest of those who have been kidnapped. Now, to someone who has experienced the terror of October 7, Ahiad Ben-Yitzchak is a survivor. He was enjoying life with friends on the beach on October 7 in Israel when bullets and missiles began to rain down around them. He and his friends tried to escape. They did manage to get to an army base. They were first turned away but eventually let inside. But they weren't safe at all when they got there. He decided to leave and make a run for his car eventually having to abandon it even after he was shot. He wrote this harrowing story of survival. And he joins us now to remind people of what happened on October 7, and to remember his friend who was killed almost two months ago. First and foremost, how were you doing? How was your injury? But more importantly, because I see you're standing here before us, how are you mentally? How are you done? AHIAD BEN-YITZCHAK, SURVIVED HAMAS ATTACK ON OCTOBER 7: I'm fine. And I'm really excited to be here. Like you gave me an opportunity and it's part of my healing process to talk about it. And it's really helpful. You know, I need some time. I think about it a lot.
