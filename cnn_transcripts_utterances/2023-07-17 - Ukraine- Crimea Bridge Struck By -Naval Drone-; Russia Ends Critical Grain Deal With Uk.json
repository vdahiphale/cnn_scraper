We have much more on the extreme weather, along with other major developing stories, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.We are learning new details this hour about the attack on a critical bridge linking Russia to occupied Crimea. Ukraine now says the bridge was blown up by naval drones. You can see the aftermath here, a portion of the 12-mile long bridge appears to be heavily damaged. Vladimir Putin is claiming the two strikes carried out early this morning were \"terrorist attacks.\" The bridge was built after Moscow illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and it's a major supply line for Russia, especially in southern Ukraine. And just hours after this bridge was attacked, Russia announced it is pulling out of a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain from its ports. Several Western countries are now condemning Russia's decision, saying it will have a devastating impact on global hunger. CNN Senior International Security Correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, joins us now. So, Fred, why is Russia terminating this deal?",

In fact, the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out earlier today and he specifically negated any notions of that. He said, look, Vladimir Putin has been talking about this for days, saying that Russia was unhappy with the grain deal and that Russia was probably going to pull out of the grain deal. And if we look at the grain deal in itself, it's been in force for about a year and it's really been hanging on by a thread. Since then, the Russians threatening to pull out at various times. There are certain concerns that the Russians say that they had, which they felt were not being addressed. They said, on the one hand, the sanctions were making it difficult for them to export their own agricultural goods. They also said that they felt that a lot of the grain that was being - and other agricultural goods that were being exported from Ukraine were not going to developing countries, and they felt that that was against the spirit of the agreement. Now, the Ukrainians, in the form of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, they came out and said, look, they really want the deal to be implemented again. They want to try and salvage the deal. The Russians on the face of it are saying maybe they'll get back into the deal, but there is a U.N. diplomat who told our own Alex Marquardt that it sounds pretty final what the Russians are saying. And, Boris, on top of that, Vladimir Putin looked really angry. He was in a meeting with some of his top security officials after this attack on the Crimean bridge and said, look, this is already the second time that something like this has happened. He wanted to see some concepts for how to better protect that bridge and he vowed retaliation on the parts of the Russians and said the military was already working up certain scenarios for that. One of the things that we have to keep in mind with that, Boris, is that the last time the Crimean bridge was hit was when the Russians unleashed and started unleashing that massive aerial campaign against Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian critical infrastructure, Boris.",

So when you look at this bridge, of course, this is one of the biggest engineering feats that the Russians ever built. It's the only link, only bridge link between Crimea and Russia. It's also the major supply route for Russian forces, especially on the southern front in Ukraine. And then, of course, prestige project. It is the longest bridge in Europe, 11 miles.

Now, when it comes to what the Europeans are going to do, we don't know exactly how long that's going to take. But the key thing to think about here is not only are there language issues, but there also are specific requirements such as close air support, basic fighter maneuvers, suppression of enemy air defenses. Those are things that they'll need to train for to be effective on the battlefield. So if that's going to happen, it will take at least a year for them to be really good at this.",

More than half of the 33 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs that have been shipped through the initiative have gone to developing countries, including some of the most food-insecure regions of the globe. These shipments have helped drive down and stabilize global prices. And every shipment under the initiative has contributed to reducing hardship in the world's poorest countries, since bringing grain to world markets lowers food prices for everybody. Russia's decision to resume its effective blockade of Ukrainian ports and prevent this grain from getting to markets will harm people all over the world. Russia will be fully and solely responsible for the consequences of this military act of aggression. Indeed, we are already seeing a spike in global wheat, corn, and soybean prices just today as a result of Russia's suspension. We urge the government of Russia to immediately reverse its decision. Meanwhile, the United States has and we will continue to work with other countries to enable both Russian and Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world, including by ensuring that our sanctions do not target - contrary to Russian propaganda, they do not target Russian food or fertilizer. And we will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to get that grain to markets that desperately need it even if that's through other routes. A lot of work to be done here. This is a deeply regrettable and, as I said, a dangerous decision that we urge Mr. Putin to reverse. Now, just quickly a readout on the President's discussion today with Prime Minister Netanyahu. They obviously talked about a broad range of global and regional issues of mutual concern. The President underscored his ironclad, unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and he condemned recent acts of terror against Israeli citizens. The two consulted on our close coordination to counter Iran, including through regular and ongoing joint military exercises. They noted that U.S. - that the U.S.-Israel partnership remains a cornerstone in preventing Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon. The President stressed the need to take measures to maintain the viability of a two-state solution and to improve the security situation in the West Bank. To that end, he welcomed Israel's willingness to consider new steps to support Palestinian livelihoods and recognized promising steps by the Palestinian Authority for their part to reassert security control in Jenin and other areas of the West Bank. He expressed concern about continued settlement growth and called on all parties to refrain from further unilateral measures. The two leaders agreed to consult with regional partners with the aim of convening a meeting soon in the Aqaba/Sharm format as soon as possible. They also consulted on progress towards establishing a more integrated, prosperous, and peaceful Middle East, including through efforts to deepen and expand normalization with countries in the region and beyond. Finally, President Biden reiterated, in the context of the current debate in Israel about judicial reform, the need for the broadest possible consensus and that shared democratic values have always been and must remain a hallmark of the U.S.-Israel relationship.

And that's been a year where, obviously, the bulk of grain wasn't getting out, because the only other option you have for that is overland - by rail, by truck - overland. And, of course, overland transport of anything in Ukraine right now is a pretty hazardous undertaking. And, of course, you'd have to go through EU countries; they all would have to be okay with that. They have farmers and farms that they have to be concerned about for their own economies.

He had already been leaning that way publicly.Now, I'll - won't speak for him. If he has his own justification, he can do that. But I've seen nothing that points to causation. And then, to your second question, we don't take it upon ourselves to determine legitimacy or illegitimacy of targets that the Ukrainians hit. They're fighting for their own country. Crimea is Ukraine. And we don't tell them what is or what isn't legally a legitimate target. They determine their targets for themselves.",

And this intrusion allowed the hackers to get access to some email traffic, particularly, that were - that is the main concern here - of various government officials and agencies. The reason Microsoft knew about it was because we told them about it. We found it and alerted them to that. And in so doing, we also took steps immediately to minimize any further impact by this intrusion and to close down any additional vulnerabilities. We're going to continue to evaluate the cyberspace environment in the wake of this to make sure that those fixes are, in fact, doing the job that we expected them to do and that we're still protecting our vulnerabilities through cloud services and through unclassified email. So, we're mindful of this. I think it's important to remember that our systems get attacked and we're fending off intrusions every day, I mean, from a variety of state and non-state actors. Cyber resilience and cybersecurity is a paramount concern for the President. We've just recently released a brand-new cybersecurity strategy for the country and certainly for the government that we think will have a positive impact on our ability to operate much more effectively and much more safely in that space. Now, as for the attribution, we're not in a position right now - and I don't have an update for you on the investigation to give. We're not in a position to independently verify attribution, but we have seen nothing that would cause us to dispute Microsoft's finding that it was a hacking group out of the PRC.",
