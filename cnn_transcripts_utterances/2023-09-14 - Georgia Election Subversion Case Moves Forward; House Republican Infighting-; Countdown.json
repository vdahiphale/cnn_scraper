We have CNN's Kayla Tausche, who is at the White House. There has been some good economic news, Kayla.

And we should expect the president to lay squarely at the feet of Republicans the possibility of a government shutdown over the budget later this month in just a few weeks' time. But, in the immediate term, that potential auto strike is proving to be a political headache for President Biden. Sources tell me that this particular negotiation poses some very unique challenges, the fact that they're not negotiating with one automaker over one issue, there are still several, if not all issues outstanding, that the president of the UAW is a new commodity to them, despite meetings directly with the president and his top staff, and the fact that the administration doesn't have clear legislative or legal authority to intervene to stop the strike. So they're simply taking a middleman or a bystander position. They do hope that the workers get a deal that is commensurate in terms of salary, but there's not much that they can do to ensure that that's the case -- Brianna.
