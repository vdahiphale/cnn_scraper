      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We begin with a warning from U.S. Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who says the U.S. is now witnessing the worst telecom hack in the nation's history. People briefed on the matter tell CNN that Chinese hackers have been tracking phone calls reading text messages and even listening to the conversations of well-connected Americans. The phone communications of senior figures in both the Republican and Democratic parties have been targeted, including Donald Trump and JD Vance. What's unclear is exactly what intelligence was gathered in the operation. \"The New York Times\" reports that officials, and I'm quoting now from \"The Times\", \"have learned that the Chinese hackers got a nearly complete list of phone numbers the Justice Department monitors in its lawful intercept system, which places wiretaps on people suspected of committing crimes or spying usually after a warrant is issued. In addition, the paper says even without listening in on phone calls, the hackers could gather metadata about phone numbers called length of the calls and even the rough location of the cell phones involved. The paper says top executives from Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and others discussed the matter with national security officials at the White House on Friday. And we're learning an all-senators classified briefing has been scheduled for December 4th. So far, no comment from the Trump transition team on this latest hacking report. Meantime, the president-elect has mostly completed his list of cabinet secretaries and key leaders. Now comes the hard part. His picks need to get past skeptical senators whose lack of support already forced one nominee, Matt Gaetz, to withdraw. Today there is increased scrutiny over the vetting process for some of the controversial nominees. So far, Trump has not yet filed the paperwork necessary for the FBI to conduct background checks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): We require these background checks of line DEA agents, Drug Enforcement Agents. We require of first-time prosecutors for the federal government. Why wouldn't we get these background checks for the most important job in the United States government? So if they keep delaying on these background checks, we will have a delay in getting these cabinet officials in. And I don't want to have a delay. I want to have the hearings. I want to make a decision on each one of them on the merits, as I've done in the past. And I can't do that without the background checks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They Began to recognize some of the issues he could face such as his past comments on abortion and being supportive of abortion access. That is something that I know the transition team has discussed and that they are currently working on as they prepare RFK Jr. for the confirmation process. Tulsi Gabbard again there's a lot of issues with how people in the Senate are viewing some of her beliefs as it relates to the surveillance and intelligence community. And obviously, she is someone who would be running the office, or excuse me, be Donald Trump's main intelligence director. And so a lot of these they recognize they have a lot of work to do. They are staffing up these different nominees as well their own teams to really try to prepare themselves for when they ultimately face their confirmation hearings. I note as well that Donald Trump's team is planning to, we saw this with Hegseth earlier this week, but he's planning to with the other picks that he has, bring them to the Hill and have them meet individually with different senators who will be crucial to that process. So there's a lot of talk happening behind the scenes about how to exactly prepare each of these different picks for that process, Fred.",

I mean -- and I've reported on this a couple of weeks ago as well because this is an issue like you mentioned, that has been a problem because it was due earlier this year, even before the election. But again, they continue to say that they are going to be doing that. I know a couple of weeks ago I had reported that one of the issues and one of the reasons that they said they weren't signing these MOUs and moving forward with the formal process at the start was because there were some things they needed to work out over ethics, the ethics agreement that is tied to that. Look, we don't have the answers that I think you're looking for. I think we're all asking these same questions, and we have to see how this plays out.",

Beyond that, those used to be automatic disqualifications but we're definitely in a new era led by the soon-to-be president where these things are, well, they just happen. Well, I don't share that view. They don't just happen. And in my view, they are clear disqualifications. However, the American people saw it differently with the president. Now, when you get into the -- Tulsi Gabbard, she's made comments that are just not acceptable. And the problem here is going to be she has access to all of our nation's intelligence and, even more important, to our allies. And I would suspect our allies are going to take a look at her record regardless of what the Senate does, take a look at her record and say, I think we're going to hold on to our secrets. And so our intelligence community is likely to be seriously disrupted if she does take that job. Now, there is one good fellow that I think the president has found, and that's Michael Waltz. I've worked with him for the last four years on the Readiness Subcommittee. I was chairman, he was ranking member. He was chairman, I'm ranking member. We have a very good working relationship. And I have confidence that he'll do very well at the National Security Council. So but boy, I'll tell you at the top of the heap here, you want to go into the Justice Department. Well, one down. Bondi has been very, very clear that she intends to see that department used for retribution and for revenge. She's been very, very clear in her comments on the campaign trail about how she will use, what she thinks needs to be done in the position as attorney general. She has incredible power to bring about investigations, harassments of all kinds and to use that department in what Trump has promised, retribution.",

Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): women have made -- have made us more effective in fact. Our military could not go to war without its 223,000 women who serve in uniform. We would have an ineffective military that was not capable of deployment if we were to pull out all the women and say, you cannot be in combat. For those women who are in roles such as the infantry or Navy Seals, those women have met the same standards as the men in order to be assigned to those positions. So again this shows that Mr. Hegseth is not qualified for the position because he doesn't understand, apparently even after having served that women are actually vitally important to an effective military.

So if you have some travel plans and you can be flexible, you may need to be in the coming days.For today specifically, the eastern half of the country looks absolutely wonderful. No issues expected in those areas. It's in the west where we now have multiple systems in play that could end up causing some slowdowns, maybe even requiring you to use a little bit more patience, especially at some airports. When we fast forward into Monday, we've got two separate systems. The first one is going to be impacting portions of the Great Lakes, Midwest and down through the Ohio Valley, where you could have some rain and snow. Out to the West, several different systems bringing heavy rain along the coast of the entire West, basically from California up through Washington. Snow, which could be very heavy, especially in the Sierras, two to three feet is expected. And then more of that snow will continue to creep into portions of the Rockies as we head into Tuesday. That initial system also starting to spread eastward on Tuesday now bringing rain chances from New York all the way back down towards Louisiana. By -- late Tuesday into Wednesday, that first system now finally exits out over the open Atlantic. But it's this system here. This is the one that's going to continue to spread its way across the country as we go through the rest of the week. So by Wednesday now you're looking at the Midwest, much of the Mississippi Valley, looking to have some rain chances back into the mix. By Thursday, that begins to spread back into the mid-Atlantic, Ohio Valley, and yes even into portions of the northeast. So any local travel plans or last-minute travel plans you may have on Thanksgiving Day itself, the northeast stretching back all the way down to the Gulf Coast may have some rain and even some snow into the forecast. This begs the question, ok, what about the Macy's Day parade that will take place in the morning? Well those first couple of hours you may get lucky but it's the latter portion of the parade that's likely going to have some pretty higher chances of rainfall into the mix. Temperature wise, still, on the chilly side, looking at maybe in the low to mid-40s at absolute best throughout the parade. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We don't know yet exactly what that was about or why that happened, but it was shortly after Stines tried to make that phone call that he opened fire.

One of the first of its kind, measuring his movement, his blood, his gut microbiome, even the air he breathes, all to try to better understand how our health is affected by ultra-processed foods.Oh, I think your food's coming in. We saw the kind of food he got and eggs and spinach and yogurt, but we don't know that could be processed. It could be unprocessed. That's part of the trial. Ultra-processed foods contain additives and ingredients you wouldn't find in your own kitchen. They were shown in the previous NIH study to drive overeating and weight gain, according to researcher Dr. Kevin Hall. Are ultra-processed foods just junk foods? DR. KEVIN HALL, SENIOR INVESTIGATOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: What we often think of as junk foods probably captures a big chunk of the ultra-processed foods kind of category. But there's a lot of things that people would be surprised that are in the ultra-processed foods category and, you know, could potentially be healthy for you. So, things like whole grain breads that you might buy from the supermarket. Most of those are considered ultra-processed because of some of the additives and preservatives that are in there as well as how they're manufactured. There's a lot of debate about whether or not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you.",

Each day, participants in the trial are offered a total of 6,000 calories and researchers measure how much they choose to eat. The trial is a month long and each week has a different diet, minimally processed or different kinds of ultra-processed. Sam was in an ultra-processed week during our visit, but one with foods Dr. Hall doesn't expect will drive him to overeat. How is that ultra-processed?",
