Earlier in the day, he sat down for talks in the Oval Office with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. Mr. Biden called the U.S. and U.K. the best of allies and said the two men had much to talk about, including soccer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, all the efforts by the president to say, I'm running, I'm running, and the campaign saying that he's going to push forward, that has done very little to calm Democratic anxiety on Capitol Hill. In fact, many Democrats, they either said they want to see more or they're suggesting that Joe Biden has still may not run.In fact, that's what Nancy Pelosi suggested in a national television interview just earlier in the day on Wednesday. And that led to a whole day of back and forth, including from some Biden allies who said that John Fetterman said this is a strange remark that she would make at this time. Others, however, echoed that remark and hope that Joe Biden would make the quote right decision. Even if they were not trying to forcefully call him to step aside, suggesting that he should step aside because they're worried that he could take him down. They could take Congress down with him in November. Now there are still eight, only eight Democrats have come out publicly and calling for Joe Biden to step aside. The eighth, Pat Ryan of New York. He is a New York swing district Democrat. Other swing district Democrats are also on that list. Some of them do harbor those concerns privately, including Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Jon tester of Montana, two Democrats in red states who are facing difficult reelections in the fall. Both of whom said behind closed doors on Tuesday that Joe Biden would lose in November. They would not reiterate those same concerns when we asked them early in the day on Wednesday. But speaking to Democratic senators it was very clear that there's still ample fear about what Joe Biden's candidacy may mean for them in November. SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): I think he's going to win.",

And Mr. Zelenskyy is thanking Denmark and the Netherlands for donating U.S. F-16 fighter jets to his military. Additional aircraft will be coming from Belgium, Norway.Nada's here. Does he go back from this summit better armed, at least? NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly. This is something that he has been pushing for, for some time. We know that the transfer of F-16 jets has been in the works for a couple of months. Now we know that Ukrainian pilots have, of course, been training. We heard from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that the first batch of pilots who were undergoing training graduated earlier this year. So those jets are already on their way to Ukraine. Of course, this comes just a day after we heard from the U.S. and other NATO allies saying that they were boosting their support when it comes to air defense systems as well. This has been a huge goal for President Zelenskyy from the outset of the war, but especially going into this NATO summit, trying to secure those concrete commitments for more military support. There has been some suggestion over the last couple of weeks that Ukraine has been somewhat forgotten, left alone. Clearly, this isn't the case. The NATO alliance really bolstering its military support. Canada as well announcing a new multi-million dollar aid package, military aid package for Ukraine. So there has been that huge sort of pledge of military support from the NATO alliance. But of course, Zelenskyy also wants to see concrete commitments when it comes to Ukraine's membership of the alliance. That's something he's been pushing for, of course, from the outset of the war. You mentioned that they said that this is irreversible, that Ukraine's place will be within the NATO alliance. But there was no clear timeline for when that might take place. There are still commitments that need to be fulfilled, still prerequisites that need to be fulfilled. So until those conditions are met, Ukraine won't be fully admitted into the NATO alliance. But this is something that clearly member states have committed to and again reiterated their support for during this summit. But again, no timeline for that.

It's not just about Ukraine's individual security. So these commitments that we're seeing have been framed as an effort to ensure that the world is protected from rising threats, including the threat posed by Russia and President Putin.
