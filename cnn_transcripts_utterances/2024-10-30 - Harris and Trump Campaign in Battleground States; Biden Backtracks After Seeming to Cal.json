Kamala Harris says she's aiming to be a leader for all after controversial comments from the president about Trump supporters. Regime retaliation, Iran's response to Israeli strikes could come before the U.S. election and will be, quote, \"definitive and painful,\" according to a source. Trading tech for troops, South Korea suggests Kim Jong Un may want nuclear technology in exchange for sending soldiers to help Russia. And a pinstripe pipe dream. The New York Yankees give themselves a sporting chance in the World Series with victory over the L.A. Dodgers. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, it's now six days until the U.S. presidential election and the Harris campaign in some degree of damage control following controversial comments from President Joe Biden. Just listen to what the president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know, or Puerto Rico where I'm -- in my home state of Delaware. They're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization is seen as unconscionable. And it's un-American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.

Stephen, these Biden comments, some might suggest they pale in comparison to some of the rhetoric thrown around on the Trump campaign over the last few weeks, but like it or not, this is arguably an insult to 75 million Americans. It's a gift at this moment to the Trump campaign. It also gives Harris, as she's utilized, an opportunity to distance herself from Biden and say, look, I disagree, and I'm a leader for all.",

Having said that, I can't remember an election, maybe 2004 was the last time, when all of the key states were very, very close. And you could construct a scenario where it could go either way on election night. So, you know, I don't think anybody will see those polls in the Harris campaign and breathe a sigh of relief. This is a tossup.

I do find it difficult to believe thatpeople who have made a decision that the economy is not working for them are going to go to the polls and think, well, gas prices are a little lower, I'm going to vote for Harris. You know, this is why inflation is such a scourge for politicians, why they fear it so much, because the financial and psychological impact that it has upon voters is so great that it's difficult to shift. We've seen voters, not just in the United States but around the world, punish their politicians for the spike in inflation after the pandemic, and it's something that takes a long time to go away. Having said that, you know, it always used to be conventional wisdom that the economy and economics decide U.S. elections. Given the tribal nature of American politics these days over the last decade or so, I think that's less true than it used to be, even though the economy is still the most important issue in most of the polls. So, I think voters are weighing a few more things. And the fact you have Donald Trump on the ballot, this, aberrant character, if you like, in American history, there's been no president or presidential candidate like him in modern American memory.

Some of your data is quite interesting though, it suggests that more than half a million people in Georgia that didn't vote in the presidential election four years ago have actually cast a ballot in the early voting this month. So, again, do you think it's this advertising push that's actually making those that didn't vote so many of them four years ago vote this time around, or do you think that's partly to do with the candidates that we're talking about and whether it's deciding to vote for Harris or vote for Trump or prevent one or the other from winning because the margin was, what, less than 12,000 votes four years ago?

And then the historic candidacy of Kamala Harris becoming the first woman of color to be on the candidate for a major party, only the second woman to be the major party's candidate on the general election ballot. So, you know, I think there are people who, as we've seen, weren't as enthusiastic about voting. We've even gone back and found some voters who haven't voted since, oh, wait, when Obama was on the ballot, who have voted in this election.

Now, obviously, Look, last game, yes, a big story was the Yankees found some offense after struggling over the course of this series, but another aspect of it, too, were these two fans that really interfered in a way much further than we typically see with fan interference in Major League Baseball. The ball goes over the right side, right fielder Mookie Betts for the Dodgers tries to grab it. It's not just fan interference, but one fan literally grabs Mookie Betts' wrist while another fan tries to pull the ball out of his glove. Those two fans have now been banned from this game by Major League Baseball and the Yankees. I want to read a little bit of what the Yankees have said as part of this. Tonight marks the final home game of the year, and we want every ounce of our fans' passion on display. Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however, the exuberance of supporting one's team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk.

And if you're just waking up to us in Asia, may I be the first to wish you a very happy October 31st, aka Halloween.Here's a look at the White House this hour where President Joe Biden is greeting trick or treaters, handing out goodies to children and their families. The super spooky holiday is celebrated across much of the globe and becoming more and more popular in Asia, especially Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. It often overlaps too with the Day of the Dead celebrations in parts of Latin America. What you're looking at here is a costume parade that took place in Mexico City on Sunday. Now, they know how to do it right. In the United States, Halloween has been big business for decades, helping to boost -- boo-st. The bottom line. See what I did there? Americans are expected to spend more than $11 billion dollars on costumes, candy and decorations this year. $3.5 billion on candy alone. Trick or treaters, however, may be taking home less chocolate as cocoa prices rise to records. Shoppers have been spending more on less expensive goodies this year. Mars Wrigley is one of the candy giants watching Halloween trends closely. It is the home of sugary treats, including M&amp;M's, Skittles, and Snickers bars. Halloween is such an important holiday for the company that it has a chief Halloween officer. Yes, it does. And Tim LeBel holds that prestigious title. He is also more importantly perhaps president of sales at Mars Wrigley. You wear two hats in this job. Fantastic to have you on the show, sir.
