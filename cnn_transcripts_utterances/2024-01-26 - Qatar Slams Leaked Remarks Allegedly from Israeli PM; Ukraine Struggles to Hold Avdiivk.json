The case was brought by South Africa, accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians and failing to prevent and punish genocide.

Once again, Moscow has accused Ukraine of shooting it down, killing all on board, including nine Russians and 65 Ukrainian POWs, en route, according to Moscow, to a prisoner exchange. According to Ukrainian intelligence, only five bodies have been recovered so far, which accounts for the Russian flight crew. Ukrainian officials believe the plane was transporting missiles, not POWs. Images from the scene do not appear to show mass casualties. In the battle for the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, Russian tactics have been described as a meat assault (ph), sending wave after wave of soldiers to attack Ukrainian positions, regardless of losses. Here's CNN's Fred Pleitgen. And a warning: some of the images you're about to see in his report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): A U.S. provided Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, almost single-handedly stopping a Russian assault near Avdiivka in Southeastern Ukraine, pelting the Russians with tracer rounds from its powerful 25-millimeter gun. Vladimir Putin's troops pinned down, unable to advance. This is just one element of Ukraine's efforts to hold Avdiivka, run from underground command centers in secret locations. The Ukrainians have given us access to their command bunker for this part of the front line. From here, they organize part of the defense of Avdiivka. It's rarely calm here, they say, the Russians assaulting nearly all the time. A Russian tank with a small group of troops shows up. The Ukrainians track their movements. And these two soldiers, probably from an already decimated unit, cowering in a trench, aware the Ukrainians have spotted them. They hit the Russians with a kamikaze drone, but they survive for now. The commander tells me Russian losses here are staggering. \"They use a lot of equipment. We destroy a lot of equipment,\" he says. \"A lot of infantry assaults. They expand people. They step over each other, don't provide assistance. It's true. There's a lot of infantry equipment and meat assaults.\" From the many drones monitoring the battlefield, we see the bodies of dead Russian soldiers, frozen amidst their destroyed vehicles. The command post also directs artillery and rocket strikes and even counter assaults with ground forces to clear trenches and stop the seemingly endless waves of Russian infantry attacks. \"Fortunately, they have a lot of losses,\" he says. \"Yet, they do not stop. But Avdiivka will be ours. They will not succeed.\" But Ukraine's American-provided guns could go mostly silent soon if Congress doesn't end its impasse and pass additional military aid, President Biden says.",

So if you let your tea steep a little too long, or if you'd like it a little longer to get more antioxidants, it can be bitter.
