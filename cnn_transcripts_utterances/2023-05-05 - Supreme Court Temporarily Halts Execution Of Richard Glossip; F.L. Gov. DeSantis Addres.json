Meanwhile, the person who actually murdered Van Treese by beating him with a baseball bat, nobody questions that, that's Justin Sneed, he's in prison, too, not on death row, because Sneed secured a deal to avoid the death penalty. Plead guilty, testify against Glossip, and you won't be put to death.Now, since then, two independent investigations have poked hole after hole in the case against Glossip, revealing the state's, quote, \"intentional destruction of evidence,\" unquote, an inadequate police investigation, letters from Sneed in prison asking about whether he could recant his testimony. Now, with the U.S. Supreme Court's temporary stay of execution today, Glossip has now endured nine execution dates and three last meals, leaving his advocates wondering, how many chances does he have left? CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now. And Brynn, this has been a momentous day for Richard Glossip. Do you know if he even knows that his execution has been at least temporarily stayed?",

So, last I heard, he didn't yet know. But we'll get those updates. I'm sure you will, Jake.Listen, this was, as you said, momentous, an 8-0 decision by the Supreme Court. And what this allows is this execution to be stayed while the court can consider those filings that are before it. Some of those filings include new evidence in this case that we have been showing on your show and on CNN in his case, that really cast doubt about whether or not Richard Glossip should have been convicted of this crime and sent for the death penalty. And also, as you remember, Jake, the attorney general in the state, Gentner Drummond, a Republican, he stood by the defense, which was an unprecedented move.

No matter how many trials you have and how many appeals you have, it's still possible that these things happen. And I think the incredible coalition that has formed around him is a testament to that. All the legislators that have been fighting so hard for him, and many of whom are pro death penalty Republicans, and that really says something, that they took the time to look at this case. And of course, the courageous action of Attorney General Drummond as well.

He's one of Lord Vader's bad guys from Obi-Wan. It's so good to have you on. Thank you so much. Let me ask you, \"Homeland,\" I'm not going to spoil anything because there are still people who probably haven't seen it, and I do recommend having watched every single episode that they check it out.It started as the story of a U.S. Marine returning home after being held as a POW in Afghanistan for eight years, and the big question was whether or not he had been turned during captivity. At that era, it was kind of a risky thing to raise questions about patriotism and the war on terror. What drew you to the show initially? RUPERT FRIEND, ACTOR, \"HOMELAND\": First of all, thanks for having me, Jake. It was actually the only show that I watched in England, and I just thought it danced that line of ambiguity so beautifully in a way that, as your introduction mentioned, we were getting writing of a caliber that hadn't never even seen on television before. So deciding who the good guys and bad guys are used to be such a black and white concept, and I think that Homeland was one of the first shows to say, it's not that simple. TAPPER: In addition to that, how do you think shows such as \"Homeland\" changed T.V. and how we watch it, because obviously the kids today don't know, but it used to be only a few channels, and, you know, you had to record it if you wanted to watch it.
