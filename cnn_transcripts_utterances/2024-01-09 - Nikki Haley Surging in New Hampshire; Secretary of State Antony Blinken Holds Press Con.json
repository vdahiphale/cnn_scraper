That is the unprecedented question before the federal courts. This morning, Donald Trump's attorney and a lawyer from the special counsel's team making their opposing cases, over the course of an hour, a three-judge appeals court panel hearing heated arguments and stunning hypotheticals ranging from presidents ordering political assassinations to courts being powerless to review presidential actions.",

And, for example, President Biden could be prosecuted for what's going on at the border. Said -- the special counsel said no. There are charges here because the conduct here is unprecedented. It is extraordinary. They also pointed to the investigations during the Clinton administration and said, look, no criminal charges were brought there. It doesn't mean that we're going to open this tit for tat. But, really, this argument that you can assassinate your political rival if Congress is cool with it, I mean, that was pretty wild.

That's not how this works. No one is above the law. And they have also -- there have also been other decisions on similar and related issues, both in this Court of Appeals that found that he is not immune from civil liability. And then this question of what he was up to in and around January 6, whether that was actually an official duty or something outside of that, that's also something that his former White House chief of staff has lost on that argument that what they were doing was related to their official work and should be protected.

However, Judge Pan, I think, cornered Sauer into acknowledging that, OK, so if he was convicted by the Senate, now he could be tried by -- in the criminal courts, which is odd for you to say that that's not double jeopardy. It's just one of those arguments that I think is one of their weakest arguments to try to make in this case. I also thought what was interesting, we didn't hear a lot of the political question, the question of whether what the former president was doing was electioneering or taking care of his own political future, which is something that other judges have kind of delved into.

That's according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire.The former president now leading only in the double digits -- or, rather, the single digits. Look, Trump's still holding a meaningful lead over Haley, 39 percent of likely GOP voters opting for the former president in New Hampshire compared to Haley's 32, the rest of the field lagging far behind, Chris Christie at 12, Ramaswamy and DeSantis in the single digits, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson hash marks. The poll shows that Haley has momentum. Look at this. She's climbed 12 points in just a few months since November. That support appears to be drifting from some of her rivals. You see a slump there for Trump, as well as Christie and, notably, DeSantis down four points. So who is behind that surge? It's undeclared voters. Haley is up 18 points with that group since November. Trump is actually down seven. And yet, when it comes to conservative voters, Trump actually leads Haley by some 40 percentage points, 60 to 20 there. The inverse is true when it comes to moderates. Haley is up 42 points when it comes to those voters. Now, roughly how many folks in the Granite State can still be persuaded to potentially switch candidates? Among likely Republican voters, 80 percent of Trump supporters say they are definitely decided. Compare that to Haley supporters. They're at 54 percent. But here is the key part. This is what Haley's team is banking on. Just 45 percent of New Hampshire Republicans say that they are backing other candidates and that they are decided on that. That means the door is still open for a potential upset in the New Hampshire primary with only two weeks to go, Brianna.",
