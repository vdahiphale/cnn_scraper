I mean, that's really the issue here because all these other economic indicators are really good at this point. You know, they've seen a lot of improvement in jobs and other areas, but you know, prices are still higher than they were four or five years ago. And people feel that very strongly. And so, I think that's the thing.

I think the economic message is a big piece of it. Trump has been very successful in talking about I'm talking about the economy, talking about various tax breaks he wants to do, and has -- just has a lot of appeal in those groups that the Biden was able to chip away at, and she has not really been able to do as much. And the other thing which is pretty basic, Manu, people want to see her more. In Michigan, they want to see her a lot more. I mean, you were obviously you're seeing her out.
