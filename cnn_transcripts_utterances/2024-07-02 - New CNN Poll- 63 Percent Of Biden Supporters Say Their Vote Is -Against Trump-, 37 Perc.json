Maybe that's not surprising in today's politics, but 26 percent means that there's still a chance.",

Now, we saw among that third of the electorate right now, those that do have a choice are splitting rather evenly between Trump and Biden.So it's a big, tall order for Biden in terms of not just getting people who have no first choice and persuading them to come over and move them over, but actually taking somebody who right now is loosely aligned and supporting with Trump, but movable and bring them over. That is a pocket he can go to. There's no doubt about that.",

It helps campaign wise that it fits very much into the narrative that they already have out there about -- and that they're pushing hard -- about Donald Trump and this poll helps to sort of explain how that could work for the Biden campaign.Would you vote -- would your vote be more against Trump or for Biden? 63 percent say against Trump. So, arguing, guys, look at the sort of free reign that Donald Trump could have when he goes back to the office if he actually wins, thanks to the Supreme Court, that fits into where the voters who they need potentially are. OLIVIER KNOX, SENIOR NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, U.S. NEWS &amp; WORLD REPORT: Right. And I think one of the dynamics of this race is that each candidate is trying to convince voters that casting a ballot for the other guy isn't just wrong, it's unthinkable. And I think that the Supreme Court decision here gives the Biden argument a little nudge here because of the sweeping immunity that it affords this president and future presidents.",

I mean, the campaign and Democrats have always felt as long as you could make this race about Donald Trump and not a referendum on Joe Biden, then he might have a chance, but I think the problem is the debate made it more about Joe Biden than Donald Trump.The Supreme Court immunity case, of course, strengthens his argument that Trump will have unchecked power and that U.S. democracy is at stake. But I think to the point that about a third of the electorate is movable, I do think it's important to note that Biden was having a number of problems with the electorate before the debate on issues unrelated to his age. I think polls consistently show his age is the top concern among Democrats and Dependents sort of across the board, but he was having issues among key voter groups on a range of other issues, whether it's the Israel-Gaza war, whether it's the economy, people, you know, very upset about inflation. And even their argument on abortion, I think, only takes them so far because in some of the states they need to win, abortion is protected.

And anytime it's a voting issue, a campaign needs to have a strategy for how to confront it.Part of that is, I think, putting the president in positions where his acuity is most salient. And that, like I said, foreign policy, I think is really strong there for him. And part of it also is going back to how he described himself as a bridge to the next generation. Let's build that bridge and let's charge across of it. Some of the Democratic Party's brightest stars, people like Raimondo and Buttigieg and Wes Moore and Raphael Warnock and Kamala Harris. We can make a strong case to the American public about what the next four years looks like with a team approach to campaigning and to governance, especially in contrast to Project 2025, which the Supreme Court functionally just green lit, Dana, and which will really include the politicization of the entire federal government. I mean, Donald Trump wants to make it so that he can spend money without Congress's approval. He can ignore judicial rulings, and he can politicize not just the Department of Justice to turn it to his own law firm, but also things like Medicare and Social Security. Those things are going to be very real for constituents when we start to see that basic public services are predicated on your partisan leanings.",
