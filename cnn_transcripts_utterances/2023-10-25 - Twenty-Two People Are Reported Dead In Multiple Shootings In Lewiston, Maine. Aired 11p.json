      "sentences": "There is truly stunning news tonight out of Maine. Twenty-two people are dead in multiple shootings in Lewiston, Maine. Sources telling CNN that 50 to 60 people are reported injured in the incidents, though it's unclear how many are injured due to gunfire. Central Maine Medical Center has confirmed that they are reacting to a mass casualty, mass shooter event.A suspect is still at large as we speak, and you're looking at a photo of him armed with an assault-style rifle. And do look closely to that photograph because the police, they want anyone who may recognize him to please call 911, and they are warning everybody in that area to stay inside of your home with the doors locked. Police releasing this photo of a vehicle they believe to be the suspect's car with a front-page bumper that is painted black. The Lewiston Police Department identified the businesses where two active shooting incidents took place. There was a bar and a grill called Schemangees -- Schemengees, excuse me, and a bowling alley called Sparetime Recreation, according to a post on Facebook. Now, there was video that was shared with CNN and it shows the scene at that bowling alley with a very large police presence and people who, as you see, are sprinting away from the location. I want to get right to CNN's Josh Campbell and chief law enforcement Analyst John Miller. Gentlemen, on nights like this, I cannot believe that we are here again and thinking about all of these things. Let me first go -- do we have John -- do we have Josh here right now? Josh, this is a very fluid situation. We are trying to get the information as quickly as we can. The public is desperate for more information, particularly in this community, a very small one. And the shooter is still at large, Josh. We have a photo of his car. But with that information and the photograph, how are police tracking him down and wherever that car might be? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a massive manhunt that is underway involving now multiple agencies. This occurred, as you mentioned, in a small community. Then what happened was police called in what's called mutual aid. They bring in resources from other neighboring police departments. The federal law enforcement officers are there as well as the state police, just providing every type of resource that they can in order to physically try to find this person, but also gather information behind the scenes regarding, you know, surveillance footage from the scenes of these two shootings, interviewing witnesses, trying to determine if anyone knew who the suspect was in an attempt to try to locate where he might be at this hour. Of course, making that so much more challenging for law enforcement is this is happening under the cover of darkness, and they are trying to identify an apprehended shooter who has already killed 22 people, a mass murderer, that they are on the hunt for now, who was using a high-powered, assault-style rifle, according to police. I want to focus there on that rifle as we look at that photo. This was released by authorities from the bowling alley shooting. You can see a high-powered, assault-style rifle with a large capacity, what's called a magazine. That's the contraption that holds the ammunition that goes in to the gun. Why is that so important? Because Laura, as you and I have covered so many of these mass shootings, this is so often the weapon of choice for many of the nation's deadliest mass shooters because you have that high- powered velocity, you can also fire multiple rounds in quick succession, but also you don't have to reload as many times as you would with, for example, a pistol. And so again, time and again, in so many of these cases, we've seen that type of weaponry. That, of course, is why authorities will be on high alert out there as they try to identify and possibly approach and apprehend this person. He is certainly armed with a very high-powered rifle at this hour, Laura.",

He's about 40 years old.He, um -- and, you know, he has a -- he has a reason to look competent with this weapon. He's a former military. He is reportedly still in the military reserves. He is a certified firearms and tactics instructor which obviously makes him more proficient than even the average trained shooter. He is known to be attached to an Army Reserve unit up there in Maine, and he is still at large. He is -- got a white Subaru. That's the car we've seen in that photograph. That apparently took him from one shooting location to another. That is registered to him. And police are obviously saturating the area, looking for Robert Card tonight as a person of interest in this case.",

That is obviously very telling. And you look at the video right there, the still shot that was released by authorities, you see someone in a tactical posture that indicates that it appears as though he knows how to manipulate that weapon. We now are indicating why that's the case. He's a firearms instructor, according to that reporting. And then lastly, if you look at this picture, you can see this individual, looks like he's wearing cargo shorts. We -- I mean, not cargo shorts, cargo pants rather -- we have seen time and again in these mass shootings, mass shooters will come armed to the teeth with additional rounds of ammunition on their person so that when they expend one magazine, they can then quickly reload as they continue this morbid, murderous task of trying to indiscriminately kill people. That makes this situation obviously that much more challenging for authorities who are hunting for the suspect. For example, if he was able to make his way into a wooded area, this is -- parts up there are very rural and secretes himself, for example, they're dealing with someone who was an accurate shooter, which obviously makes it much more dangerous for authorities who are out there on the manhunt at this hour, Laura.",

This is now going to be complicated all the more, Jonathan Miller, when you're talking about it's dark, you've got a rural area with a lot of tree cover, we understand, at some point, and somebody who has the military training, and also, obviously, a law enforcement officer who'd be trying to capture this person.

We know certain things, and Josh Campbell is very aware of this from his FBI experience, that based on the Bureau's studies of offender characteristics in active shooter situations, you know, there are three notable outcomes, that the person is confronted by law enforcement and takes their own life, that the person is confronted by law enforcement and attempts to take their lives, or that the person surrenders. And, you know, in this situation, given what has happened, this is going to extraordinarily dangerous for law enforcement even to make this approach.",

Law enforcement sources say he also was complaining to hear voices, that there was a threat to shoot up the military base at Saco where he had been attached, and that he spent two weeks at a mental institution, being evaluated in Maine, and then he was medically cleared to go and released. More recently, it appears, he lost his job.

We know that there have been -- there has been a mass shooting that has happened in Lewiston, Maine.What we learned from that press conference tonight, that there is a person of interest who has been identified, Robert Card. He is armed and dangerous. They are labeling him as a person of interest. They are not saying a suspect tonight, but they are telling the public not to approach or contact this person. The car was located in Lisbon, about what, seven miles away from Lewiston, Maine, and they have located that particular vehicle. There is a reunification location in place at a middle school in a neighboring town as well for those who have information or those who have questions about their loved ones they are searching for. They are asking the public's help and giving any information they have been forthcoming till now, but they are not addressing how many people may ultimately be included in that casualty number. He is not comfortable saying the number at this time. It's a very fluid situation. Joining me now, CNN senior national security analyst and former Homeland Security official, Juliette Kayyem. Also here is CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe. Sadly, the three of us are here yet again talking about this unbelievable tragedy, and it is so fluid. Juliette, let me begin with you. We've got information from John Miller. He has been reporting that the person of interest, Robert Card, is military reserves, a certified firearms and tactics instructor. Does that explain something to you about the number of victims we're hearing about?",

Andy McCabe, that press conference, he was very clear that he was identifying this person as a person of interest, did not want to call this person a suspect, did not want to go into whether there was anything known about a criminal background or how this person may or may not have been known to law enforcement. Why do you think there was that decision made? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, that's hard to say at this point, Laura. I mean, we have -- the three of us have sat and watched these press conferences very closely. I cannot even count how many times now. It's unbelievably sad part of our lives here in this country. But I have to say, I would not rank that press conference among the more informative ones. I think they're just being incredibly careful.

They may have his name come back to that vehicle registration in one way or another.So, my guess is they're pretty confident that's him, but for whatever reason, in an abundance of caution, they don't want to come out and say, this is our guy until they've confirmed it to some absolutely unimpeachable degree.",
