So there are rivers that are going to rise downhill from here in parts of the Western, Northern North Carolina here, but what place in the world can take this type of rainfall and not get absolute devastation? And I would say that's probably maybe the top of Kauai, because there's just nobody up there and it's the top of a volcano. When you talk about how much rainfall came down over those days, and it was very heavy at times, it happened before the hurricane, and then it happened during the hurricane, and now it's finally ending for the most part. But 20 to 30 inches of rainfall in these higher elevations, that's just really hard to put your mind around because all of that water had to run downhill, had to wash away homes. I know you see those pictures and it looks like sticks and twigs, but there are bits of homes in there. There's people's livelihoods in there. This is truly a devastating event here from Asheville out toward Black Mountain and places that, if you're from the South, you go there because they are so beautiful. Well, this is going to take a long time to be beautiful again, I'm afraid, for many people. So we will have some rainfall across parts of Virginia today, but likely only about one to two inches. So this is not a big event, but what you may have missed over the weekend, now we have three, Isaac, Kirk and Joyce. It's like, wow, you guys really ramp things up in a hurry. And now we have one that could potentially here be in the Gulf of Mexico, same place that the last one was, likely not growing as much as the last one is. The computer models are not making big circles here. That's what we'd be looking for right now, those tight eyes. Just don't see it yet, not that it's impossible. The water's still very warm.

They were talking about a rally. They were talking about a messaging event. Obviously, everything changed once that storm took place. Now, in terms of what Donald Trump is going to say, you're going to hear what he already has been saying. He's hitting Kamala Harris. He's hitting Joe Biden, saying, why aren't they on the ground, trying to seize this as an opportunity to show himself as the former president who is caring for these people on the ground. But, I mean, obviously, it's a lot different than having a sitting president or a sitting vice president on the ground. There's nothing he can really do in terms of promising aid or promising distribution. There's nothing he can really even glean from this to take it to other states or to try to help with the disaster response. So it's really a show here of him reaching out. Now, the other thing that's kind of interesting is, he's now trying to blame the administration for only helping certain areas of North Carolina, in particular, essentially saying that they're not helping Republicans and his supporters. This is what he posted on TRUTH Social. He said: \"I was also going to stop in North Carolina, which has really been hit hard. I have a lot of supplies ready for them, but access and communication is now restricted. And we want to make sure that local emergency management is able to focus (AUDIO GAP) effective, and not being concerned with me. I will be there shortly, but I don't like the reports that I'm getting about the federal government and the Democrat governor of the state going out of their way not to help people in Republican areas. MAGA.\" We have no indication that that is true. We have not heard any of these reports. And just to be clear, one of the things that we heard from President Joe Biden today, and we know this to be true, is that it's very difficult and it does take a lot of resources for a sitting president, or even a sitting vice president to travel to these areas, particularly a place like North Carolina, where they need all of those emergency resources. And it's been a point of contention in past presidencies as well. Do you go right away? When do you go? You do not want to be responsible for taking away resources that could potentially help people who are suffering, or even with this recovery, but also they want you on the ground and you risk being hit politically for not being there.",

Vance going toe to toe tomorrow in New York, a key moment for both campaigns, and one that Walz apparently is especially nervous about.CNN's Isaac Dovere has that new CNN reporting. And, Isaac, you have been speaking with players behind the scenes of his debate prep. And whenever I see stories like this, I wonder, is this expectation-setting by the campaign? How much of this is legit? You just told me before the commercial break, this is actual nerves. He's actually nervous. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  It's fair for you to feel like there's expectation setting going on, but there is genuine nervousness going on here. Walz is pretty committed to the idea that he does not want Donald Trump back in the White House. He does not want to let Kamala Harris down and make her think that she screwed up her choice. But it's also about going up against J.D. Vance, J.D. Vance, who is better at debates than Walz has been in their past performance. He went to Yale Law School. Walz has been in Congress, was in Congress for 12 years, has been governor for six years. That's a long time, but he has never been great at the debating part of it. And, in fact, he was at a fund-raiser in New York last week, and one of the people there asked him, how is debate prep going? And he said -- someone in the room told me that he said, as teachers, we're trained to answer the questions, and we train our students to answer the questions. That's not what this is. So he's got in his head, how do you get a question answered in under two minutes? What does your face look like when you're not on camera? How do you respond? All these things. It's a lot to do.

She did get into policy a bit, talking about the economy and her vision for small businesses. And then she also reiterated a long-held position on marijuana policy. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so she wasn't shying away from this conversation. She went on to evoke the legacy of Shirley Chisholm when she was later asked about the five people she most wanted to be around her dinner table, dead or alive. And the hosts and her had a brief moment where they talked about the significance of her legacy. So I feel like she felt a lot more comfortable talking about race in that space. But this was also to set the record straight here and to be clear that her racial identity is not up for debate.",
