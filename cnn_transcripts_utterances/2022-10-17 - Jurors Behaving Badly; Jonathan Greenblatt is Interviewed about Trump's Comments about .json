He is the man accused of aiding his son, Paul Flores, in the alleged murder of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student Kristin Smart. They've gone to begin deliberations all over again after one of the jurors had to be replaced last week for talking to his priest about the case. Judge Jennifer O'Keefe said it was a, quote, appropriate but difficult decision when she announced it last Thursday. The juror was dismissed after reportedly speaking to a priest recently saying he needed spiritual guidance as he contemplates his decision in the case. An alternate juror was sworn in, deliberations started over, potentially pushing back, though, a conclusion in the Smart trial several days.And in the Florida death penalty case of Nikolas Cruz, the admitted gunmen who killed 14 students and three school staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, one juror report alleged that deliberations over the death penalty were so intense that she felt disrespect and even threatened.

But whatever is in his head or his heart, I have to deal with anti-Semitism in America today. And the fact of the matter is that in 2021 we saw the highest number of anti-Jewish incidents on record. In the past week we've had anti-Semitic vandalism at cities across the country. We had a Jewish orthodox man assaulted in Brooklyn. We have the rapper Kanye West making wild claims about Zionists and Jews.So, there is a larger pattern afoot. People are feeling, you know, attacked and (INAUDIBLE) in from both sides. It's incredibly concerning. So, when the president says, \"before it's too late,\" it sounds like a threat in an environment where Jews already feel threatened.",

We have anti-Semites on the right and on the left. We have progressives and conservatives.But here today, right now, what we need is for people irrespective of, you know, how they vote or what political party they affiliate with to say once and for all, this is wrong. We need not just Jews, but our non-Jewish allies to recognize that in this moment Jewish people are feeling besieged. And when the former president of the United States makes, if you will, an unveiled threat, don't excuse that by harkening back to policy things he may have done years ago. Right here, right now, where Christian nationalists are running for office, where anti- Zionists are running for office, where popular rappers and entertainers evoke anti-Jewish, you know, tropes with impunity, people in all political stations should say it's wrong.",

But despite the violent online rhetoric, none the agencies, including the FBI nor the Capitol Police, gave a clear warning about the potential for large scale violence.CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller is with us now with this new reporting. John, this weekend, CNN obtained a number of documents involving this threat information that the Secret Service had before January 6th. What did we learn from this that we didn't know before?",

And the threat documents that were part of the nearly million documents that the Secret Service turned over to the January 6th committee told us that there was a lot of information in the possession of law enforcement, including statements from people on Parler, the site we just talked about a moments ago, saying, I'm coming to Washington with my gun, you know, that traitor Pence will have to come out of the Capitol in handcuffs or we're going in after him. Intelligence information about militia groups like the Oath Keepers with quick reaction forces that would be pre-staged in Virginia until they got the call from the president of the United States to come in to back up the protesters. Information on the numbers of people coming in. So, there was a lot of that.The good news is that information was there. The Secret Service had it from the FBI, from the Department of Homeland Security. The knock on the Secret Service was that they weren't sharing the information. As a guy who ran the intelligence bureaus from police departments in the nation's two largest cities, that's actually not how that works. The sharing agencies are supposed to be, under executive order one to 333, the FBI and Homeland Security. And Homeland Security never put out a threat assessment for the January 6th event.",

The director testified - the deputy director, the head of intelligence, and they even zeroed in on who exactly said what the committee is talking about. But nobody had any intelligence on a coordinated plan to storm the Capitol. What they had was intelligence on large numbers of people, armed people, militia group, white supremacists, the high potential for violence, and I think the black swan event there, the thing that wasn't in any of the intelligence, because logically it couldn't be predicted, was, no one had advance information that the president of the United States was going come out on the ellipse outside of the White House and say to thousands of people, you've got to go down to the Capitol and we're going to fight like hell to save the country. That was probably the x factor that nobody saw coming.The Capitol Police issued an intelligence report that pretty much laid out the propensity for violence, the fact that Congress, not counter protesters this time, was going to be the target. The fact that they asked for permission to call in the National Guard at the Capitol Police and that that got the run around in the Capitol Police board and was never approved until the Capitol was under siege was another thing that I think we're all going to look at and say, maybe that could have been done better.",
