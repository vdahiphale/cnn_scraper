So that causes those flames just spread extreme -- just spread very fast. Now, I want to show you here behind me, the crews still working in this area. There are firefighters that are trying to create those fire lines. Here, you still see them hosing down in a lot of these hotspots. And if I turn the camera over to the other side, what I want to show you is the scorched hillside here, because its spread read so quickly. And when we got here earlier in the day, we saw those raging flames and what they're doing is not only working on the ground, but they're also using air resources. So we've seen helicopter after helicopter doing a lot of the airdrops. And of course, that has helped tremendously, especially in the area that we are now. But again, there's still a lot of work to be done and residents are being told to be extremely careful. Already, 1,200 people are under evacuation orders.

He's in stable condition. His brother is in critical condition. Their 39-year-old mother, she was shot in the stomach and the leg and she remains in critical condition. All of them members of the same family trying to have a fun afternoon when police tell us a gunman approach the splash pad, got out of his vehicle, opened fire and discharged his weapon nearly 30 times, stopping to reload the weapon. Now, we know that the suspect has been identified as Michael William Nash. He is 42-years-old from Shelby Township. And police so far tell us that they believe this shooting took place at random. They've yet to determine any sort of motive for why this took place. As I said, it was a Saturday afternoon where children and families were just trying to have a nice day at the splash pad when this gunmen opened fire, I want you to listen to the local sheriff talking about what happened after for the shooting because Nash fled the scene and took cover inside his mothers house that she wasn't home at the time. That is where a standoff between police and Nash took place before they were able to find him. They believe he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For the second straight meeting between the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky, WNBA rookie sensation Caitlin Clark gets knocked down, but walks away with a victory.This afternoon, Clark was driving to the basket for a layup, as you saw right there, when she was hit in the head from behind by Sky's Angel Reese. Reese was given a flagrant foul. You'll see it again right there. This file was similar to what happened in the first meeting between those teams. This one is a little different, when Clark was knocked over by Chennedy Carter after play had stopped. Like in the first meeting, Clark was able to finish today's game and the Indiana Fever beat Sky 91-83. All right. The leaders have teed off for the final round of the U.S. Golf championship. Big-hitting American Bryson DeChambeau started the day with a three shot lead after battling through a hip injury Saturday to soar to the top of the leader board. He has become the crowd favorite at the U.S. Open, but he has some of the top players in the world are right on his heels. For the very latest, let's bring in CNN's Patrick Snell at Pinehurst in North Carolina. So, where do things stand?",

And I can tell you that Bryson DeChambeau has a real fight on his hands right now, thousands out on the course as the players make the turn for home on the back-nine. The leaders, and it is really nip and tuck between DeChambau and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who is trying to win his first major title in over ten years. They are both a short while ago at 6 under par, which means we have a battle royale for this year's U.S. Open crown. But a little more on Bryson DeChambeau, really kind of reinvented himself oh, and the last couple of years in the world of golf, he really has kind of changed the narrative. He made global headlines when he joined the controversial Saudi-backed LIV Golf Series. But he really is in an old to get a better place right now, reinvented himself in terms of his popular YouTube channel, for example, and a short while ago, just for a teed off earlier on Sunday, we got some great video of him interacting with the fans that his big thing now about taking the game and expanding it globally, taking it to the fans, breaking up play during Saturday's third round by talking a fans, telling them, listen, if you move yourself here, I'll find you later inside photograph. You don't see players doing that in the course of a major battle for a huge prize in the world of golf. So, DeChambeau relaxed, he was high fiving with fans as he came off the range a little earlier today, he is in an altogether good place right now, but I will say, it's going to be very, very tense here over the next couple of hours as we wait to see who will be crowned U.S. Open champion later on this Sunday, Fred.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. We're talking a lot of areas here. More than two dozen states have the potential to break records. Look at this number, over 170 potential records just in the next five to seven days and it's over several different regions.Now, a lot of these records would begin in the south before finally spreading northward and eastward in the coming days. So, even places like Atlanta and St. Louis, very hot to finish out the weekend. But then you'll finally start to see those temperatures coming back down by midweek. Now, keep in mind even by midweek, its not necessarily getting back to normal, just cooler than it is this weekend. Look at Chicago, for example, the average is 81 degrees this time of year, but they will spend every single one the next seven days well above-normal, about five to ten degrees. But if you look in places in the northeast like New York, Boston, even Philadelphia, those areas you're talking 15 to 20 degrees above average over the next several days. Now, heat is just one of the stories were keeping an eye on. We also have severe thunderstorms in the forecast for Sunday, flood threat for areas of the Midwest and also a pretty potent flood threat down along the Gulf Coast. Now, the reason for that is we're keeping an eye on to potential systems for possible tropical development. But see this one down here has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next seven days. But regardless of whether this becomes a name tropical storm, as it moves northward, it's going to bring all of that moisture with it. So there is the potential for very big rainfall and heavy flooding not only Monday, but also Tuesday along the Gulf Coast. And that includes places like Houston. When you look at some of these numbers, some areas of Texas could pick up more than ten inches of rain in just the next few days. (END VIDEOTAPE) WHITFIELD: All right.
