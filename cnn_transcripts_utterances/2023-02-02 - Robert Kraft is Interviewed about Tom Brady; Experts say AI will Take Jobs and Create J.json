And he had a pizza under his arm from the food service. And he came up to me and said, hi, I'm Tom Brady. I said, I know who you are, you're our sixth round draft pick from Michigan. And he looked me in the eye and he said, I'm the best choice your franchise -- I'm the best decision your franchise has ever made. And I looked him in the eye and, you know, he just said it in a way -- now, you've got to understand, we just gave 100 million, the biggest contract to any quarterback to Drew Bledsoe just before this, a few months before.

Now, for starters, the state education official told me the Ohio Department of Education is basically reviewing compliance with statutory and regulatory policies in this state because it's not clear how much they can actually do about the curriculum of homeschooling.Now, I want to show you an example. This is a group that they believe operates out of Upper Sandusky, Ohio. And this is an example of a Thanksgiving copy working assignment where basically, you know, you're learning handwriting, elementary school age, and they're using Hitler quote to learn that handwriting. You know, this is a group that doesn't hide being pro-Nazi, white supremacist, homophobic. Honestly, you name it, it's probably there. I want to show another lesson that was posted - quote, lesson, leading up to Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This was by a user named Mrs. Saxon. She wrote, it is up to us to ensure our children know him, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., for the deceitful, dishonest, riot inducing negro he actually was. He is the face of a movement which ethnically cleansed whites out of urban areas and precipitated the anti-white regime that we are now fighting to free ourselves from.
