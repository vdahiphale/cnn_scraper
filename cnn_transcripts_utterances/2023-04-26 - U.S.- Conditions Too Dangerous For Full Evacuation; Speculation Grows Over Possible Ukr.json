One of the two military factions vying for control the country has seized Sudan's national public health laboratory in central Khartoum, not far from some of the worst of the fighting, bringing urgent warnings from the World Health Organization of an extremely dangerous situation, and in their words, a high risk of biological hazard. The rapid support forces now control the facility, which houses pathogens of diseases like measles, polio and cholera.With technical staff forced to leave and ongoing power cuts, officials warn, it's no longer possible to safely store the deadly diseases and warn other potential germ bomb. Day two of three day truce is now underway. But fighting has continued sporadically. And this fragile ceasefire brokered by the U.S. seems close to collapse. With both warring sides accusing the other of violations but a senior U.N. official says in some parts the truce remains in place. And the lull in fighting has seen a rush of evacuations of foreign nationals. But the millions left in Sudan are facing chaos and humanitarian crisis with severe shortages of water, food and medicine. CNN's Oren Liebermann picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the absence of people, the streets of Sudan are filled with the scars of war, the death toll climbing toward 500, with the fighting into its second week. Now, a new threat with the paramilitary RSF seizing the national public health laboratory threatening to turn a humanitarian disaster into a biological nightmare. DR. NIMA SAEED ABID, WHO REPRESENTATIVE IN SUDAN: That is extremely, extremely dangerous because we have polio isolates in the lab. We have measles isolates from the lab. We have cholera isolates in the lab, so there is a huge biological risk associated with the occupation of the central public health lab in Khartoum by one of the fighting parties. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The United States announced the 72-hour ceasefire that started Tuesday, but eye witness reports heavy clashes between the warring factions near the Sudanese capital. SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D-DE): It's my hope that the determined work of our diplomats and some regional leaders will produce an enduring ceasefire and then allow a negotiated renewal of the movement towards the civilian government. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The U.S. released these images of its weekend evacuation showing diplomats and their family members arriving in Djibouti after the operation. But the Biden administration said it's too dangerous right now for a full evacuation of American citizens. The latest U.S. security alert for Sudan said, it's not currently safe to undertake a U.S. government coordinated evacuation of private U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, countries from all over the world conducting evacuations of their citizens from Sudan, and including several Americans. The U.S. facing questions about why it's not doing the same. VEDANT PATEL, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPT.: I think what I will point to is what national security adviser Jake Sullivan said yesterday, which is that it is not standard practice for the U.S. to send U.S. military into war zones to extract U.S. citizens. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The U.S. has sent in troops to evacuate U.S. citizens multiple times in the past, including in 2006 when the U.S. evacuated 15,000 American citizens from Lebanon after war broke out. And evacuation operations are one of the critical missions for a Marine Expeditionary Unit. The U.S. says it has drones watching evacuation routes from above and a Navy ship in the waters of Sudan with two more on the way. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We're moving naval assets within the region to assist with potential contingency off the coast of port of Sudan. I don't have anything else to share beyond what our national security adviser shared. But clearly this is important to us and important to the President. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Ukrainians say that they're beginning to see Russians in the Zaporizhzhia region begin to evacuate civilians from some of the towns there.And further south in Zaporizhzhia, Ukrainian officials say that in the town of Melitapol they're seeing Russian forces pull back some of their military further south to the coast. Now what this is indicative of is hard to say. This is certainly a region where the Russians are expecting a potential Ukrainian counter offensive. And earlier on last year we saw Russian forces evacuate civilians in the Kherson region when they thought the Ukrainians were going to advance there. Could this be an indication of that? Not at all clear. But this is what Ukrainian officials are saying. Now in that same area that Russian controlled part of Zaporizhzhia in the town of Tokmak. Russian officials say that Ukrainian forces fired six high MARS rockets into that town close to the frontline, again, hard to know what to read into that. But this is the place that Russians are really looking to see if this is where Ukraine will launch their offensive. Ukrainian officials say that the Russians for their part decreasing their attacks in most parts of the frontline, apart from in the east around Bakhmut where they say the Russians are actually increasing the level of fire.

But talking about his achievements, the three-minute long video also frames the race as a fight against Republican extremism for the soul of America. But President Biden has low approval ratings and a lack of enthusiasm even among Democrats, according to recent polls. Biden is already the oldest serving U.S. president at 80 years old. If reelected, he'll be 86 by the time he leaves office.Republicans responded to the campaign launch with artificial intelligence, creating a bleak, dystopian, apocalyptic future under a second Biden term, none of it real. CNN's Kristen Holmes reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The plan for Republicans to attack Joe Biden now that he has announced is still coming into focus. Of course, we know that in order to actually put a comprehensive plan together, they have to know who exactly will be running for president against Joe Biden in that nomination process is still very much underway. However, after Biden announced, we started to hear what exactly that attack might look like. And they went after him for a number of different reasons. Firstly, RNC put out a video that they said was AI generated that hit him on a number of issues. But after him on the border and talk about inflation, crime rates, essentially said that if Joe Biden won presidency in 2024, that the financial institutions will completely fall apart. We also saw Republicans hitting Biden on a number of other issues that included crime waves, again, inflation, a several different buckets that weren't not similar to what we saw in 2022, that playbook strategy there. But again, in order for a firm plan to come together, they're going to actually have to have a nominee. And that process is looking more and more messy by the day. Right now, those Republicans are focused on hitting each other. And we even heard from former President Trump today who suggested that he might not participate in the primary debate. So clearly a lot to work through there before Republicans can actually come up with a cohesive plan to go after President Biden in 2024.",

I mean, if you look at some of the basic attitudes that Americans are expressing these days, typically, they have spell trouble for an incumbent President. I mean Biden's approval rating is consistently below 45 percent. It's been closer to 40 percent in four high quality national polls released last week, three quarters of Americans are more say they think the economy is in bad shape.And as you know, we've been noting on CNN in the last few days, 70 percent of voters say they don't want him to seek a second term. And historically, as I said, those have been, you know, ominous numbers for an incumbent president, the problem Republicans have is that all of those numbers were there in 2022, as well, and Democrats did unexpectedly well, particularly in the swing states that will likely decide the next election. And the reason they did unexpectedly well, is because an unusually large number of voters who are dissatisfied with the economy or dissatisfied with Biden's performance voted for Democrats anyway, because they view the Republican alternative as unacceptable and too extreme. And that is still the fundamental risk that Republicans face in '24. That even if voters are not necessarily that enthusiastic about four more years, for our first 80-year-old president, there is a powerful coalition that is passionate about ensuring that Republicans do not take the White House and attempt to impose nationwide in particular the cultural and social agenda that they are passing in the red states. And so in many ways, you know, Biden's best asset is that saying he often attributes to his father, don't compare me to the Almighty compare me to the alternative. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At the start of the banking crisis, about two-thirds of first republic deposits were uninsured with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The company saying that in this report as of March 31st, that number is closer to 27 percent of total deposits. The bank also announcing that in recent weeks, bank deposits have stabilized.

This time Prince Harry wants to take Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers to trial over historical claims of phone hacking and other illegal methods of gaining private information.Now the claims date back years from the 1990s until 2016 critically beyond a legal limitation period and that's why News Group Newspapers argue the case should be thrown out. However Prince Harry's legal team argue he was unaware of the full instances of phone hacking. Plus they say he was unable to make a claim earlier due to a secret agreement struck between the publisher and the institution of the royal family. Prince Harry says this agreement would allow members of the royal family to bring a claim at a later date to avoid the situation where a member of the royal family would have to sit in the witness box and recount the specific details of the private and highly sensitive voicemails that had been intercepted. News Group Newspaper says there was no such agreement. In his witness statement, Prince Harry says in 2017 he received permission from his grandmother, the late queen to pursue News Group Newspaper for a public apology from Rupert Murdoch. However he says he later found his move seemingly blocked by his father's staff at Clarence House claiming they wanted to keep the media on site to smooth the way for his stepmother and father to be accepted as queen consort and king when the time came saying upsetting the apple cart was to be avoided at all costs. The other bombshell dropped in Prince Harry's witness statement and certainly adding to his argument for why this case should go to trial was his claim that his brother, Prince William, reached a settlement with the newspaper publisher for a, and I quote, \"huge sum of money in 2020\". That is beyond the period of limitation. Now to this claim, the statement from News Group Newspaper said, \"No comment\". Meanwhile officials at Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace have told CNN they do not comment on legal proceedings. Prince Harry has accused the royal family of colluding with the tabloid press before, both in the Netflix docuseries, \"Harry and Meghan\" and in his autobiography, \"Spare\" and it could make for an increasingly awkward family get together at the coronation of King Charles, which is less than two weeks away.

When I founded the company back in 2019 our focus was in the African market. And we wanted to solve big issues. So the first big issue we were targeting is to try and close the $350 billion lending gap we have in Africa. And the reason why we have this gap in Africa is not because there isn't enough capital. We have a lot of capital in Africa. We have a lot of financials institutions. We have a lot of banks. The problem is that these institutions use old methods or don't have a full understanding -- a f full picture of the individuals that they are providing their financial solutions to. Hi, everyone. Our first or pilot solution was to help these institutions to fully understand their end user and that way they can now provide better solutions to them and thereby reducing their default rate and their turnover rate.
