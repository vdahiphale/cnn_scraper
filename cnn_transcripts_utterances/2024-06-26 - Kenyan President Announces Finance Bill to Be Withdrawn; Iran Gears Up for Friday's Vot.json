He said there were legitimate protesters but that legitimate protesters had been infiltrated by treasonous criminals, which did not go down well with many Kenyans and less than 24 hours later he comes back and says, the people have spoken. They need to make more concessions and, therefore, he is rejecting his own finance bill that was proposed by the executive that he is the head of and that he thanked all the MPs around him. The people sitting around him are members of his own ruling party who defied the feelings of the people and went ahead and passed this finance bill while people were actively demonstrating against the bill outside parliament, while people are getting killed outside parliament. They went ahead and passed this bill and put it on the floor and put it on the seat of President William Ruto. And now he's saying, oh, you were right and we will not be signing this bill. So there's already some defiance on social media and people say, it's too little, too late. And some of them even threatening to still go ahead with planned protests tomorrow. So that is the instant reaction. The feeling from people who feel that all of this could have been avoided.

So that's one. But two, the background he started with his press conference is completely the right tone because he has, Kenya has a debt problem, which he inherited from his predecessor. But he was number two in that government of Uhuru Kenyatta. He said that just last week Kenya cleared the $2 billion euro bond that has been hanging over the heads of the country. And so that's why he's pulled the country from the brink of debt distress. So that's also accurate. He's -- they were trying to raise about $2.6 billion through these extra tax measures in the finance bill. After a public outcry, they cut it down to about $1.5 billion. And now that's been scrapped entirely. So he's got to find a different way to explain this to the people of Kenya, to talk to the people of Kenya, not talk at them. So far, in the entire public engagement process, President Ruto has not done what he has done this afternoon:  explain systematically, slowly, what he's trying to do and why he's going to do it this way. And find a way around it. And now it's come a little too late in the game and it's going to be much more difficult conversation to convince anyone after the events of the past few weeks and especially the events of the past day.",

We never know what we're going to get on these days, right? The Supreme Court tells us they'll be releasing opinions. As you noted earlier, there are a number that we are waiting on, a number of pretty important consequence here in the U.S. especially leading up to an election. One of the ones that we have been watching, we did actually just get this morning. So this will be the first of three straight days of opinions that are set to be released. So what we just got his a case known as Murthy versus Missouri. This was a number of states and some other folks actually suing the federal government, the surgeon general, another of a number of other administration officials named as well, over essentially content moderation. And what content was on social media platforms at different times. I want to bring in my colleague, Jessica Schneider, who's following this. So Jessica, we got this decision. It's a 6-3 opinion which was written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Among those dissenting justices, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch. This reverses a decision from the Fifth Circuit. And in her writing the opinion for the court, Justice Barrett said that the Fifth Circuit glossed over complexities in evidence and she basically said they were just wrong. What more are we seeing?

They were really concerned that the government could be restricted from warning social media companies about certain content, We saw in 2016 the proliferation of misinformation, disinformation that was spread online. Social media companies need to have the power to be able to do something about it and they need the help, at least in the view of these justices, they need the help oftentimes of government officials. And if you cut off that line of communication and don't allow government officials from any agency or certain agencies to talk with social media companies, it's really going to disservice, especially this year, voters in general. It could also disservice just American people looking for information. Increasingly people get their news and information on social media. So there needs to be some sort of, give and take from the government and social media companies. And the Supreme Court is at least saying, all right, in this case, we're going to continue to allow it. There may be other lawsuits in the future with more appropriate plaintiffs, who have maybe more -- have the standing to bring this case. But at least for right now, government officials, according to the Supreme Court, will continue to be able to communicate with social media companies, to encourage social media companies to take down information that might be wrong, that might be deceiving.

It's what conservatives used to complain about the liberal court, the Warren court doing, making (INAUDIBLE) legislating from the bench. And that's what we've seen the Supreme Court rejecting. There seemed to be six votes on the Supreme Court to get back to the fundamental American idea, hey, we're going to let government function. We're going to let the executive branch do its job, like talking to social media companies. The legislative branch do its job, passing legislation. We're not going to interfere with these hot button issues. Now abortion has been an exception. But even there, the court has wheeled back with the mife decision.

But no one really knows. Anyone who says they know what attitude Donald Trump is going to bring when he stands on that stage, they're lying. Like even Donald Trump's advisers, when I speak to them, say, we're not exactly sure whether or not he's going to go off script, meander; all of the things that we've seen Donald Trump do time and time again in many of his political speeches and at his rallies. However, also in my conversations with the campaign, they are encouraging him to focus on kitchen table issues and specifically the ones where Donald Trump polls better than Joe Biden. That's the economy, immigration, crime -- and it is interesting just to go off what Kevin was saying about what Biden is going to focus on. He wants to argue about crime as well. Donald Trump, wants to talk about the economy for entirely different reasons. He is going to try and hammer Joe Biden, argue that there is record inflation that is being seen under his administration and really try to undercut any messaging that the Biden team wants on that. Now I also just think it's important to take a step back and look at how Donald Trump has been preparing for this. Unlike Joe Biden, he's not engaging in mock debates. It's been a very untraditional type of campaign or -- excuse me -- debate prep from Donald Trump's campaign. He's been engaging in informal policy discussions. He's been picking the brains of his advisers, his allies, people in his former administration as well. They're all working to sharpen his messaging and it's not just the issues he wants to talk about. They're also trying to look at sharpening his rhetoric on the issues they know he's vulnerable on. That includes his handling of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, his discussion of abortion, an issue that Donald Trump has really struggled with over the past year or so as well as how to frame his recent guilty verdict in his Manhattan trial and the New York hush money case. So that's really what's been going on behind the scenes and he's been doing that at his home in Mar-a-Lago. Another thing I just want to point out as well is this expectations game that we've seen Trump's campaign engage with. And I've talked to one adviser who essentially told me a lot of this change in wanting to raise the bar for how they think Joe Biden will perform came once they realized that Joe Biden was going to be spending an entire week at Camp David preparing. And that's why you've kind of seen a lot of Donald Trump surrogates, including some of his vice presidential contenders, like Doug Burgum and J.D. Vance, they've been saying that they think Biden will do a good job on the debate stage, that, when he needs to show up and perform, he can. That's all coming because they recognize that they want a higher bar for Joe Biden on Thursday. And so that's kind of where the Trump campaign is at this. And they are again, trying to make sure that Donald Trump is a little bit less aggressive in this debate. If you look back at the first debate in 2020 between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, Trump was very aggressive and he had repeatedly cut Joe Biden off. He hardly let him get a word in at points and they saw Donald Trump's poll numbers fall in days after. It's something Donald Trump actually candidly admitted in an interview this week, saying he recognizes that the perception after that debate was that he had lost that debate. And so I think he's going to try to rein it in. But of course, you never know what Donald Trump -- and he could kind of go off script and kind of show some of his meaner side, which some people are anticipating as well.",

And that was something the lawyers and family thanked the Australian people for, because they said, without that ground level support to bring Assange back home, that wouldn't have given the political space for people like the prime minister to weigh in with President Biden as he did many months ago. To try to try to make this happen. But the real window for it his lawyers say opened up quite recently with Assange's ability while in jail in the U.K. to appeal the extradition to the United States. But there were a couple of points here, I think his lawyers really wanted to get across, not just sort of recounting the difficulties of the past. But they wanted to get across this point that Assange was essentially held to account on espionage laws in the United States. And his lawyers saying, look, this has never been done to journalists before. It's never been done to lawyers before. This is a very bad sign for journalists in the future.
