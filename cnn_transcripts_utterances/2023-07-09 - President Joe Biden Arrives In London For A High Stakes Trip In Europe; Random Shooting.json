He was confident, in my view, and many in the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO. So, holding NATO together is really critical.

The president during his trip here is really hoping to once again shore up that remarkable unity that has been seen between allies when it comes to providing support to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. That includes, the president is hoping some discussions when it comes to long-term security assistance that the alliance can provide to Ukraine going forward. Just a few days ago, President Biden said that he approved sending cluster munitions, a highly controversial topic, decided to send those to Ukraine, saying that it was a difficult decision, but one that was necessary as they are continuing that counteroffensive against Russia. Now, in addition to more security assistance long term, another issue that is going to be up for discussion at this summit will be a possible roadmap for Ukraine to eventually join NATO. As you heard, the president there say he is not quite ready for Ukraine to join NATO at this moment. There are some allies who want to see a more concrete timeline for that to happen. So that is certainly up for discussion at this summit as the U.S. and other allies are still trying to project this image of unity, even if there are some disagreements when it comes to that path for Ukraine to join NATO.",

Sweden had applied for NATO membership last May and Turkey has been blocking that because they are frustrated and believe that Sweden is harboring groups that Turkey believes are terrorists.Now, the president has said that he is optimistic Sweden will eventually be able to join the NATO alliance, but it's unclear whether that can happen at this summit. One issue that the two leaders did discuss was the prospect of F-16 fighter jets that the U.S. could sell to Turkey. That is something Turkey has been calling for quite some time. And the president suggested it could be linked to their eventual agreement for Sweden to join the alliance.

China, in other words, Xi's China is not Putin's Russia.Now, whether or not there is that stable point he said yes, but he didn't elaborate on it. And I think that's what a lot of people are wondering. Is, you know, are we going to keep putting more blockages on various Chinese products? Are they going to retaliate? They've already started with restricting critical minerals. Now what do we do next? You know, that's the part where he was a little unclear. And I -- my guess is, they haven't figured that out yet. And you know, it's a dynamic situation. The technologies themselves are evolving and changing.

So, I said, you know, your most ardent supporters, people who think you've been a great president, people who think you've brought the economy back, you've restored relations with the world. Those people say, now what you should do is step aside and let another Democrat, the next generation of Democrats, come forward.And his response was interesting. After the clip you showed, he said, look, I think we're on the verge of being able to bring the world's democracies together, you know, to face this challenge of the autocracies. I think he really thinks in those terms. Notice, he didn't talk about domestic policy at that point. For him, the overriding challenge here is, what do you do about a world in which Russia is playing the kind of spoiler role in this, China is rising. And I think you're right, Jim, he worries a lot that if Donald Trump would have come into power, that battle against the autocracies would not take place in the same way. The United States would not be bringing together the democracies. After all, Trump often says that he has a great relationship with Putin and he's constantly criticizing NATO. He's often talking about pulling out of NATO. So, the stakes, if you think about it in Joe Biden's, you know, world view, are very high if Donald Trump were to be elected. The central premise that he is worried about, which is this battle between the democracies and the autocracies would go seriously awry. And I, you know, look, there's a lot of ego involved in running for the president. This is a job he's wanted since he's been in his late 20s. But I do think this substantive issue weighs very heavily on the president and the fear of what would happen to it if Trump, or frankly, a lot of Trump lookalikes were to get elected.",

Russia's war in Ukraine will be the big topic, and let's discuss with Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas.Congressman, thanks for joining us. As you know, Ukraine really wants to join NATO. President Biden says the war has to end first. The president told our Fareed Zakaria, if NATO is -- Ukraine is a NATO member, I should say, other NATO countries might be required to join the war. What is your sense of it? Is now the time for Ukraine to be part of NATO or should that be held off until after the war with Russia is won? REP. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-TX):  Yeah, obviously, Jim, it's a very tough call because I've been supportive of every single package that has come to the Congress to support Ukraine in defending itself from Vladimir Putin and Russia's aggression and their invasion of Ukraine. But President Biden is right. Historically, NATO has not admitted nations that are in the middle of a conflict. I think that we can work with NATO -- work with Ukraine so that once the conflict has ended, they can be admitted to NATO. But it would essentially be an automatic declaration of all the nations of NATO declaring war by agreement on Russia and that's, of course, not where we are. It would be very dangerous for the world.",

But a top House Republican supports the move. Let's listen to this talk about on the other side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX):  I don't see anything wrong with that because quite honestly, Jake, as you look at the counteroffensive, it has been slowed tremendously because this administration has been so slow to get the weapons in. These weapons would be a game changer. They are highly effective in particularly hitting flanks of troops inside of Ukraine. They would be a game changer in the counteroffensive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, 50% in the last few months.But, again, for Greg Abbott and for Republicans in Texas, migration, immigration, immigrants, all of it is more of a political issue to them. It is a substitute for solving the real issues that Texans deal with every day like a power grid that's on the brink of failure, it seems like every week, sky-high electricity prices, an education system that they have allowed to falter over the years, a broken juvenile justice system, all of these things, you know, a broken health care system in many ways in Texas.

Officials continue to ask the public for help and say all tips are being investigated. The U.S. Marshals have offered a $7,500 reward and Warren County Crime Stoppers has offered an additional $2,000 reward for a total of $9,500 for information leading to his arrest. Officials also say that Burham has military training as a reservist, which can make him even more dangerous. Where is he now? This is what police had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL.
