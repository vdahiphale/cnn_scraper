So if you're the jury right now, all you know about is that Ethan wrote in his journal, \"I'm asking my parents for help, they're laughing at me, they're not doing anything.\"She is now testifying under oath that she never saw any reason to have to get any help at all. Here is what the jury is not going to find out, because it is privileged. Ethan said it to a psychiatrist after he was arrested. The psychologist is talking about this. He says, you know what, I was lying. I didn't ever ask my parents for help. I was lying as I was putting it in my journal that I was asking them. I didn't. And then Ethan, at his sentencing, said, I have lied to a lot of people, and I did this all by myself. But the jury is not going to hear that. They're only going to hear, Boris, what you just said, those two things. So they're going to have to weigh the credibility of Jennifer versus really their credibility of the person not in the room, Ethan Crumbley. KEILAR: They're going, Jean, through all her Facebook posts, which are copious. And her attorney is asking her about the fact that she seems to have a lot more photos of her horses than she does of her son. Talk a little bit about, if you would, about why that is going to be, and has been, an issue in this case?",

Her husband, too.Ethan never went out there. She said maybe he went out once. So was it grossly negligent when you have a child who is just staying at, sometimes alone for hours, sometimes, we even heard, overnight, possibly alone. And that then gross negligence caused the death of those four students once he got the gun and went to the school and committed the mass shooting. It's important to see what her priorities were. We heard just a minute ago that Ethan didn't like to go to the horse farm. He was scared about the horse farm. And he didn't like pictures being taken of him. She just testified to that. She will probably explain it, but that is where the prosecution is going.",

That he was researching if Michigan had the death penalty because he wasn't going to do it if Michigan had the death penalty, but they don't, so I'm going to go through with it. That friend -- and the jury does not know this -- but he was actually -- and there might be some hints to it in the trial. But he was taken out of state and to a rehab facility in Ohio. And the jury doesn't know the extent of it and we don't know the extent of it, but he was taken out of school, out of state immediately. And that was the best friend of Ethan's.
