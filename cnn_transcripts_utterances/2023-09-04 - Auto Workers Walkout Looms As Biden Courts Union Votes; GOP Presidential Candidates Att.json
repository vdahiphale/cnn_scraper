I mean, the core problem is that EVs have fewer parts than conventional internal combustion engines so they take less labor to assemble. So the unions are worried about losing jobs in this transition. The way Democrats have tried to assuage those fears is by arguing that they can bring more of the supply chain home, particularly from manufacturing batteries and offset any lost jobs and assembly that way. The problem is, is that the companies are arguing that these new battery plants, which they are often doing in collaboration with foreign companies, are not subject to the national agreement, and they are locating them largely in red states, right, like Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia where unions aren't strong. So you get that concern that you heard from President Fain right there at the end, which is that in the long run, they will be trading union jobs in blue states that pay $32 an hour or so, for nonunion jobs in red states that pay $16 an hour, and that is a real rub in this transition that President Biden is trying to accelerate.",

Democrats did very well there in 2018, 2020 and again in 2022.They don't need a big fight with the UAW in that environment. It's worth noting that Biden lost his biggest tool to try to encourage this EV transition center on union labor when Joe Manchin stripped out of the Inflation Reduction Act a provision that gave bigger for the EVs that were produced now they're trying to maybe make a dent with subsidies and grants to encourage the companies in this direction.

So, my prayers go out to him.They're going to have to answer these questions, however. I mean, I would just push back and say imagine if this happened to Joe Biden, you know, imagine the 24-hour news cycle we recall when Hillary Clinton just got overheated, how we could not stop talking about that in 2016. So, this is going to be a question that Mitch McConnell has to answer, Mitch McConnell's family has to answer. And at the end of the day it's really up to the people of Kentucky who he represents. Do they want somebody younger, more vibrant? Do they want somebody who is of full health? That is a question that's left up to them. I dare not say that Mitch McConnell should resign or retire. I wish we had younger elected officials. But sometimes, there are decisions that need to be made by your family, yourself, your doctor, your loved ones. And I think this is that. And we need to have a younger generation of elected officials from both sides of the aisle. Both parties are extremely old. Both party's leadership is extremely old, and I think there's an entire generation of young people who can lead. Sometimes old people need to get out of the way. But I think this is a decision for Mitch McConnell. This is a decision for his family, and God bless Mitch McConnell.",
