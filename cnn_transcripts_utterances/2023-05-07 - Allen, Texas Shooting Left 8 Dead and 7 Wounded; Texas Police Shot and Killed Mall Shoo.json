He is very quick to call for action. He -- we are no longer in a phase where a president of the United States would see a report like this and talk about thoughts and prayers and not immediately pivot to what he sees as the legislative solution. That is exactly what we have seen from President Biden. In the wake of shootings, he has said, how many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress take action? That was the statement that President Biden released after that shooting in Louisville, Kentucky last month. And we have seen President Biden in the wake for these shootings quickly talk about a need for a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity magazines, safe storage laws. And what we've also heard from President Biden more recently is that he believes he has done all he can from an executive action standpoint and that ultimately now the burden rests on Congress. We know, of course, that the dynamic in Congress, though, remains unchanged. Republicans control the House of Representatives, and even in the Senate, Democrats have a slim majority, certainly not a filibuster proof majority to be able to move the kind of legislative solutions that they would like to see.

Investigators say they later arrested a suspect who reportedly confessed he received his orders from Ukraine. The Ukrainian secret service -- security service, rather, is neither confirming nor denying its involvement in the blast. Prilepin has a telegram channel with some 300,000 followers. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was killed in an explosion in St. Petersburg last month. The Ukraine has denied any role in that attack. Meanwhile, a Russian mercenary leader says he's laying groundwork for his possible pullout from Bakhmut. Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his troops would withdraw by Wednesday because of a lack of ammunition. And now, Prigozhin says, Wagner will hand over their positions to the forces of this man, notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. He's an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and also has a private army fighting in Ukraine. So, for more on all of this, Sam Kiley joins us from Kyiv.

They're intrigued by the extent to which he constantly and frequently and very publicly criticizes the Russian ministry of defense. Complains about a lack of ammunition, allows photographs, indeed, points to pictures of his own dead soldiers or allegedly dead soldiers on the Bakhmut front line, and constantly claims to be on the verge of victory. If they were to do a pullout of Wagner and a replacement with Kadyrov's Chechens, this is relief in place. A rip as the military, we call it, will provide the Ukrainians with a delicious opportunity when their enemy is at its most vulnerable to a counterattack. And I think we could imagine that that would be an almost certainty. This is something that the Ukrainians, I think, who are on the backfoot at the moment in Bakhmut would relish. Kim.",

The Turkish foreign minister says the move from Khartoum to Port Sudan is temporary but necessary after the car the Turkey's ambassador was fired on in the Sudanese capital. Funerals have begun in Serbia after two mass shootings in as many days. Services were held Saturday for a security guard killed along with eight children when a gunman went on a rampage in a school in capital Belgrade. Police say, a 13-year-old is in custody and undergoing psychiatric assessment. A day later, eight more people were killed in a separate shooting in villages south of the capitol. The country has declared three days of mourning and there's anger and sadness across Serbia.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I don't remember a center Belgrade. I remember the NATO bombings and other things but the city has never been centered. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, he's been a world leader on this issue and he's often led the way well before many other people to highlight just how important the climate major crises are and how we've really got to move much faster to address these interlinked crises.",

I mean, you touched on one of the central questions that's been, sort of, a theme during this coronation time. And looking at that question of the relevance of the monarchy, I saw one statistic that popped out. Among young people, 38 percent said they preferred an elected head of state, and 78 percent said they weren't interested in the royal family. So, could this be an issue that gives the king and the monarchy more broadly -- more relevance, particularly with young people?",

And it's, unquestionably, there's real authenticity to his concern about these issues.But, I mean, there is the case that, you know, as I was saying, that a monarch, one of the things that they need to do is, of course, think about the long term and almost catch those issues that the governments aren't so good dealing with. And that, inevitably, obviously it's like the environment, sadly. And that -- and I think, obviously, we also know that young people are incredibly concerned about the state of environment and need to see faster action on this. So, I think there is an issue here that it's, sort of -- kind of, a good way to reach out to younger people and to enable and inspire young people to get involved. So, I think what the king has done through -- over many, many decades have created many opportunities for young people to speak up and be heard, whether it's on social justice issues which is done through things like the Prince's Trust and empower them to do so, or whether it's through these sustainability issues where time and again he has recognized the huge importance for young people to be able to have a voice dealing on dealing with the environmental crisis.

A 2010 study by the Harvard Business School graded them six sigma, which means they have a 99.9 percent efficiency rate. Their first brush with British royalty came in 2023 when the then- Prince Charles met the dabbawalas during a royal tour of India and was left impressed by their work. Since then, they formed a close association with the royal family. They were invited to King Charles's wedding to Queen Camilla Parker Bowles in London in 2005. VISHNU KALDOKE, SPOKESPERSON, MUMBAI DABBAWALLA ASSOCIATION (through translator): The dabbawalas have good relations with the royal family. So, keeping this in mind, Prince Charles is going to be crowned as the king of Britain after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. So, we are very happy.
