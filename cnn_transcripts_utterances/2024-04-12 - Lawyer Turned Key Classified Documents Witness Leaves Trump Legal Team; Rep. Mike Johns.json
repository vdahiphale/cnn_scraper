I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. This is CNN New Central. And breaking overnight, CNN got word that a key attorney to Donald Trump turned critical witness has left his legal team. Evan Corcoran was hired to help Trump in the classified documents case, but he became a central part of the very indictment because of the meticulous notes and memos he took about his interactions with Trump. The indictment referred to Corcoran as Trump Attorney 1 at least 20 times. And it was from Corcoran's notes and memos that we learned that Trump allegedly misled him about the whereabouts of the classified documents, encouraged him to lie to the Justice Department and withhold these documents allegedly. If the case ever goes to trial, prosecutors could potentially call Corcoran as a key witness. And this morning, we know he is out of the fold. And as Maggie Haberman told us overnight, that is disquieting to Donald Trump. His departure comes just ahead of a hearing today for two of Trump's co-defendants in that case. Trump aide Walt Nada and Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos de Oliveira both hope a judge will toss the obstruction cases against them. First, let's talk about Evan Corcoran. CNN's Katelyn Polantz with us this morning. Corcoran out of the fold.",

When it happens in just a few hours, job security may be top of mind for the House Speaker as Marjorie Taylor Greene threatens to oust him from the speakership.Before Mar-a-Lago, though, Johnson will try to evade another blow to his leadership. Next hour, a national security bill that Trump convinced Republicans to tank just 48 hours ago will head back to the floor for a vote. CNN's Alayna Treene has more on this. Alayna, we will all be talking about the FISA bill a little bit later as Congress looks at that. But you have some brand new reporting for us that just dropped on the event that involves Mike Johnson and Donald Trump. They're going to be standing side by side, correct? What is the issue they'll be talking about?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly right, Sara. House Speaker Mike Johnson is trekking to Mar-a-Lago really as he faces a threat from many of House Republican colleagues to strip him of the speaker's gavel. And I'm told from some of the source is familiar with this meeting and how it was set up that this meaning today between Donald Trump and Mike Johnson, a really joint press conference, I should call it, was part of Johnson's idea as he faces this threat, showing his ties to Donald Trump.But, look, the two are going to appear side by side today at Mar-a- Lago at 4:30 P.M., and they're going be discussing what they argue are state proposals and lawsuits to have non-citizens be allowed to vote. Now, of course, it's important to point out that non-citizens and migrants here, undocumented in the country, are not able to go in federal elections. And those who do cast their ballots illegally face steep fines, deportation and even prison. But, course this has been a main topic of Donald Trump's as we look forward to November. He has really been stoking fears around immigration, undocumented immigrants in this country, whether it's about election security or about crimes that they have allegedly committed in the country. It's something that has been a focal point for Donald Trump and Republicans ahead of the elections. And so I think that's very important to keep in mind here. And, of course, Mike Johnson also has a chief person who has really helped peddle Donald Trump's false claims of the 2020 election being rife with fraud. And so that is another element to this as well. And it comes, as Mike Johnson is worrying about that FISA vote on the House floor today. And he's heard threats from his colleagues. Here's what Marjorie Taylor Greene, someone who is being a chief leader of this threat to strip him of the speaker's gavel. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  I think the motion to vacate is also being supported by quite a few members in our conference. That's an internal House issue with our elected speaker of House, totally two separate issues. Hopefully they, have a great meeting tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. And President Biden is trying to offer a bit more relief to student loan borrowers, trying to address a key issue of concern for many voters, including young voters heading into November's election, the Department of Education announcing this morning that they would use an existing program to cancel an additional $7.4 billion in student loan debt. That is something that would impact about 277,000 borrowers.This increases the total amount of debt canceled by the Biden administration to $153 billion for nearly 4.3 million borrowers. That's the most student debt canceled by any president in the White House. Now, this comes after just a few days ago, President Biden unveiled a sweeping new plan to reduce and cancel student loan debt for millions of Americans, essentially a do-over from his previous student loan forgiveness plan, which was struck down by the Supreme Court. The hope is that this plan would be in place by the fall, right before voters head to the polls in November. But it also marks Biden's latest attempt to show voters that he's trying to drive down costs for them at a time when many voters continue to hold pessimistic views about their own personal financial state but also President Biden's handling of the economy. The president did get some tough news this week when a key inflation report showed that prices were ticking back up, showing how stubborn that issue has been for Biden in this campaign. Now, the Biden campaign is also eager to really draw an economic contrast with former President Donald Trump. Campaign officials tell me this morning that the president is preparing for a three-day, three-stop swing through the battleground of Pennsylvania. It will kick off on Tuesday with a stop in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where the president is expected to make arguments relating to tax policies, saying that he is working for the middle class while former President Trump's policies are working for the wealthy. That's an argument that they believe will help voters heading into, or help them with voters heading into November's election.",

And it is something that IDF spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, made a point of mentioning in his briefing late last night, the importance of this visit, that they discussed the threat coming from Iran.But he pointed to the fact that, for Israelis, this shows that the United States does support and have Israel's back, that ironclad support that President Biden has talked about. And why is that important here right now? And, why's that important for the IDF to speak about? Because people here are rattled, not over-nervous, but they are concerned about the retaliatory strike that Iran it says that it's going to strike back at Israel's interests. It's not saying specifically where or when or how and there's much speculation about that. And that's what's causing concern here, coupled to the fact that there is a sense among many people that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sort of getting adrift of President Biden. And this raises concerns in people's minds about how much support they will get from the United States. That's why these statements are important. That is why this visit is being played up by the IDF and people are being told about it in the briefing. And the other thing, of course, the spokesman was telling people here, which again intended to settle people's nerves, saying that Israel is well prepared for any Iranian threat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
