      "sentences": "Yeah, John, the FBI is saying that they were able to arrest 18-year-old Alexander Mercurio before he could go on this killing rampage that he was allegedly planning to carry out in the name of ISIS. And look, the FBI is pointing to a series of messages that date back all the way to 2022 when they say they almost stumbled upon Alexander Mercurio on his online chat room as they were investigating a completely different issue related to cryptocurrency.But ultimately, as they continued to monitor the messages between who they later learned to be Mercurio, they noticed that he was expressing pro-ISIS views and was increasingly talking about carrying out actual acts of violence as being radicalized online. But a law enforcement official is telling CNN that these efforts to plan and carry out an actual attack seemed to intensify after last month's attack in Moscow -- the ISIS attack against a concert hall in Moscow that left over 140 people dead. They point to this video that was posted -- allegedly posted showing Mercurio swearing an oath of allegiance to ISIS, standing in front of an ISIS flag with what appears to be a knife. They also point to a series of messages, again between someone who Mercurio thought was -- could help him join ISIS overseas but was actually working for the FBI. And the first message -- or one of the first messages is from March 21, 2024. It says -- Mercurio types, \"I have motivation for nothing but fighting, like some kind of insatiable bloodlust for the life- juice of these idolators; a craving for mayhem and murder to terrorize those around me. I need some better weapons than knives.\" So a couple of days later, on March 25 and 26, Mercurio again messages the same person allegedly, and -- but seems to outline what his plan was to carry out this attack against churches in Idaho. He says, \"The plan is basically this -- equip the weapons and storm the temple, kill as many as possible before they inevitably disperse/scatter, then burn the temple to the ground and flee the scene. Then move on to the next church, rinse and repeat for all 21-plus churches in the town until killed.\" So the FBI is saying that Mercurio clearly making his intentions -- or stating his intentions in those messages. He -- they said that he was planning to carry out this attack on April 7 but again, was taken into custody before that. And as you mentioned, he does face up to 20 years in federal prison. We're waiting for him to make his first court appearance here in the next day or so.",

His former vice president, Mike Pence, calls that a slap in the faceto voters who backed him in 2016 and 2020. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has been pushing for a federal 15- week abortion ban, said he \"respectfully disagreed\" with Trump. Accordingly, Trump demeaned the normally subservient Graham all over social media. CNN's Alayna Treene is with us now. How does the Trump team think this is going so far, Alayna?",

      "sentences": "Well look, I think they were anticipating some criticism from the right and anti-abortion advocates. But, of course, Donald Trump was frustrated and disappointed that some of his top allies were coming out and publicly showing that they disagreed with him on this.And I think the key thing here to keep in mind, John, is that this isn't a total change in Donald Trump's position. He had long said that he believed that abortion should be up to the states. But I think the significance of it is that this is going to be the position that they hold until November. At least that's what his campaign advisers tell me now. And that comes after he had flirted with a 15-week or 16-week ban. And many of these people who criticized him, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and Marjorie Dannenfelser -- she's the president of SBA Pro-Life, a leading anti-abortion group -- they had been in Donald Trump's ear for over a year now trying to get him to support a national ban on abortions after a specific number of weeks -- mainly, 15 weeks -- and that's where a lot of this is coming from. But look, I do want to share with you some of the criticism that Donald Trump logged at these allies of him. He said that Lindsey Graham \"...is doing a great disservice to the Republican Party and to our country.\" He also pointed out that Democrats in Congress would never allow a national abortion ban to pass. And then, while criticizing both Graham and Dannenfelser, he said \"That they should proudly get on with helping Republicans to win election\" -- he said that in all caps, \"rather than making it impossible for them to do so.\" And I think that point about winning elections is really where a lot of this comes down to. We've reported extensively on Donald Trump's conversations with these people about abortion. And the key thing that he keeps bringing up, not just privately but as we saw yesterday in public, is that he believes that they need to take a stance that will allow him to win in November. And he believes that seeding this to the states and really punting this to the states is the way that will help protect Republicans from this large vulnerability. But at the end of the day, I think the bottom line here, John, is that regardless of some of these Graham and Dannenfelser's and Mike Pence's disappointment in Donald Trump on this, Democrats who -- or excuse me, Republicans who are against abortion are still going to choose Donald Trump in November and not Joe Biden. I think that's the key thing to keep in mind here.",

And one of the reasons is because the company is being valued in the billions of dollars even though it generates very little revenue and its main product, Truth Social, is shrinking in terms of the number of users. So I talked to NYU Professor Michael Ohlrogge and he told me this stock seems to be completely untethered to fundamental value. The reason why that's important is because that companies have really high valuations, they tend to be more volatile. They don't have much to fall back on. This is how volatile it is.

And one group, in particular -- they're from the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center -- just this week, they announced that their blood test was able to identify key biomarkers associated with pancreatic cancer as well as a key protein. And this approach showed that their test was 97 percent accurate in detecting stage one and stage two pancreatic cancers in their study.Now, this is early research. It hasn't been published in a peer- reviewed journal. But they say that this shows promise that we are getting closer to developing a blood test for early cases of pancreatic cancer. And having a test like this, John, would change the landscape for patients out there because we know that pancreatic cancer -- it's incredibly deadly. It only makes up about three percent of all new cancer cases that are diagnosed. But it's the third-leading cause of cancer deaths, and that's because it's typically diagnosed at an advanced stage. And when you are diagnosed at an advanced stage, sometimes surgeons may be more reluctant to operate if they know that your cancer is likely to come back or if it has spread. In the pancreas itself, John, it's tucked behind the stomach so it's difficult to get to, so the procedure is complicated. But if we diagnose more patients at early stages, surgery can be more successful and that can enhance their chances of survival. So all eyes are on these blood tests that are in development. And hopefully, John, we'll hear more from either these researchers or other groups of scientists of just how well their tests are doing as they look into this possible future for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.",
