Israel says the deal falls well short of its requirements, but it is sending a delegation to keep the talks going. Meantime, hostage families have gathered outside the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, you see the video there, they are calling on Israel to use this opportunity to bring home their loved ones. Negotiators have been discussing a deal for the release of hostages taken from Israel in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Meantime, in Gaza, scenes of celebration after Hamas accepted the agreement, at the same time though the IDF says it will continue to operate in Gaza and the Israeli government says it is continuing a military operation in Rafah to the south. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem. Nic Robertson is in London. Jeremy, to you first. You've been following these fast-moving developments. I do want to get to what we know in terms of latest out of Rafah. We had heard from someone on the ground there earlier who said that they could hear the celebration in tandem with the sound of those airstrikes.

We don't even know yet whether this Hamas agreement is to the same framework that Israel had helped craft more than a week ago and right now, the Israeli government and the Israeli military say that they are pressing forward with this ground operation inside of Rafah, which began today in terms of setting the stage for that. It began today with about 100,000 people in Eastern Rafah being ordered to evacuate northwards, and now, we are starting to see what the Israeli military is describing as precision strikes inside of Rafah, although we do not have a sense yet of whether any Israeli troops have actually moved into Rafah. There is no indication of that as of yet. But in the meantime, the Israeli War Cabinet is saying that they believe that this latest proposal from Hamas is \"far from Israel's necessary requirements,\" but they are committing to sending a working level delegation to meet with Egyptian and Qatari mediators. It is not clear yet whether that meeting will take place in Doha or in Cairo, but it does signal at least a willingness on Israel's part to continue the conversation, but certainly it also makes clear that a deal is far from being achieved here and it is certainly is not hours away as those celebrations in Gaza would have you perhaps believe. So, this is certainly a critical moments where we could see a deal start to come together in the coming days, but it is also very clear that one is not yet wrapped up as of yet.",

And tonight, they are once again in front of that military headquarters calling for the Israeli Prime Minister and his government to agree to this deal, which appears to be on the table, which Hamas says that they have agreed to, although again, we don't know all of the details of it and we don't know how much it diverges from the initial framework that Israel helped craft with Egypt.",

He said that Trump's fixer, Michael Cohen, was paid some $420,000.00 in 2017. Most of that money came from Trump's personal account cited as a legal expense. This though, is a big part of the prosecution's argument, which says the money Trump sent Cohen was in fact reimbursement for Stormy Daniels' hush money disguised as a legal expense, Katelyn Polantz joins us now from Washington and Katelyn, I think for folks watching this from a distance, this can seem like minutiae here, an accountant, lots of attention to the paper trail, but explain how this fits into the case, what they are alleging here is this was Trump's personal money from a personal account, not legal expenses at all, but reimbursement for hush money.",

That is a very important part of the case because what the case needs to do here for the prosecutors if they want to convince the jury is they have to show every single step of how this money was billed by Michael Cohen for reimbursement because he had wired $130,000.00 to Stormy Daniels to pay her off and they are also going to have to show how Donald Trump himself was aware of these payments and that they were not just for legal retention fees to keep Michael Cohen on staff as a lawyer. They are trying to prove that this is money being paid to Michael Cohen to reimburse him for that money to Stormy Daniels. And so what you are seeing is the step-by-step of that process in 2016 and then into 2017. First Jeff McConney overseeing the accounting department at the Trump Organization, setting up how those invoices were coming in from Michael Cohen asking for the reimbursement of $130,000.00 plus $50,000.00 more to be paid out to Michael Cohen, $35,000.00 a month.

It sounds from the evidence that he would know that he was paying these things, calling them legal fees. From earlier testimony, we know he was trying to deal with quieting down this Stormy Daniels information. So there are some things that are being put together, but they certainly haven't got the whole thing tightly wrapped up yet with respect to the thing that's very important, which is that Donald Trump knew what this was, what it was for, knew it was being mislabeled and intended to do it in order to have an influence over the election.

This is I think really the kind of the quicksand that Netanyahu finds himself in at the moment, Paula, because on the one hand hehas this political goal of destroying Hamas, that is, as you pointed out, an absolutely unrealistic goal because Hamas is more than just an organization. It is an ideology, it is also an essence in organization that can morph with the times and with these kinds of impacts. And it is an organization that will in some way survive this kind of operation. These kinds of operations are not going to really change the way in which Hamas operates. It may mean different players, it may mean different leaders. Hamas as an organization is not going to die because of what the Israelis do. That's in spite of their goals and in spite of the Israeli efforts in this particular case. Now, when it comes to the hostage families, you know, Netanyahu may be right in the sense that the first series of hostages that were released were basically released to some degree because of Israeli pressure on Hamas, as time has gone on, we've seen it become much more difficult for Hamas to release the hostages, it's also become much more difficult for the Israelis to get the hostages back. Both in a military operational sense as well as in a diplomatic sense. And so, this is kind of the situation that he finds himself and it's going to be difficult for him to achieve any of the goals, whether it's destroying Hamas or getting the hostages back.

Now their political wing is active in Qatar, so that organization will continue to survive in one way or another. But it is definitely a physical risk to Hamas' leadership. And also to many of the military elements of Hamas, because they are, in essence, being very easily put into cannon fought or motive, I can call it that, as the organization tries to resist the Israeli efforts, even though, of course, they've accepted this particular peace proposal, Hamas is definitely, in essence, at the whim of the Israelis when it comes to these bigger military operations, although they can mount smaller operations against the Israelis, not quite at will, but they can certainly still conduct operations that will cause damage to Israeli forces.",

Because it is clear that the regional allies have tried to do what they can to get Hamas to the table, even though Israel claims that that's a ploy.

But one thing that has been hampering their efforts is their lack of effectiveness and frankly, lack of seeming, lack of an ability to control the Israelis on their end and to provide any guarantees that will hold up in these negotiations. So, as Bill Burns is in the region trying to get these negotiations closer to fruition, Prime Minister Netanyahu is going in to Rafah. The IDF is going in to Rafah. And reportedly, the Biden administration was told about this the night before. And so, it's really difficult for a negotiator. This is an any peace process in any conflict situation. There has to be a guarantor in the process in order to make the negotiations to give -- to give guarantees to each party, to get them to take risks and make concessions that they don't want to make. There has to be a guarantor. And so far, the U.S., which is in the natural position to play a guarantor, has not really been able to do so effectively.

Of course, end of last week, you had Hope Hicks, who was quite a -- quite a close advisor toTrump speaking about her knowledge of Trump's desire to essentially kill this story about the Stormy Daniels alleged affair. Today is more about the finances behind it, because that is essential. It is essential to the prosecutor's case here that there was money spent to quiet this story. The Trump was aware of it. It was his money and that he was involved and had intent to use this money to kill this story. So today, really, you had accountants, you had employees of Trump organizations speaking to where that money came from and Trump's part in the decision-making about that money. And one of the witnesses testifying in effect that not only was Trump signing the checks, but he knew where this money was going. And that is, while somewhat small bork compared to the broader outlines of the case, it is essential to the prosecution's case as they see it and as is required if they're going to prove that he committed felonies here.",

But before I let you go, I do want to ask you, in terms of the White House, and I know how closelyyou've been following this, do you believe that they can and will put more pressure on Netanyahu? As I said, you've been covering this closely. I know we don't have a lot of time, but any thoughts?",

The question is, is itenough pressure to move Bibi Netanyahu here? He has his own calculations, his own assessment of any potential deal with Hamas, but also in the view of U.S. officials and others. He has his own political calculations, which is the potential of the right wing of his coalition leaving if he goes further than they're willing to go here. So, we're caught in the middle of that tension right now.",
