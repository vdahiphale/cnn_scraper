Even as Republican election officials argue it could be illegal, Donald Trump's allies pushed it through. Plus, we'll go inside Trump-world, on the drama in North Carolina. The Republican, Trump endorsed for governor, refusing to drop out in the wake of CNN's explosive exclusive report, revealing that he called himself a Black Nazi, on a porn forum. Plus, a fed-up Florida Sheriff now publicly identifying kids, arrested for threatening violence, calling on parents to do their jobs, saying that if they won't, he will. Tonight, he is my source. I'm Boris Sanchez. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening and thanks for joining us. I'm Boris Sanchez, in for Kaitlan Collins. A battleground state election board just made a move that could upend the entire election, if that rule change stands. We're talking about Georgia, where Vice President Kamala Harris stumped today, where Donald Trump narrowly lost in 2020, and then demanded that election officials find him votes, ultimately leading him to criminal charges. Now, four years later, new concerns are emerging, after the pro-Trump majority, on Georgia's election board, voted today, to force counties to hand-count all ballots on Election Day, despite objections from the Republican Secretary of State, and Republican Attorney General, warning, that might be illegal. The three Republicans on the panel got a very public shout-out from Trump himself, last month.

A pleasure to share this evening with both of you. Karen, how big a concern is this for the State of Georgia? One that Democrats clearly think they can win. KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, SENIOR ADVISER, HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 CAMPAIGN, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, DNC: Yes, it's a big concern in Georgia. But I think you have to take two vantage points on this, having done elections in Georgia. This is a strategy designed to sow chaos. That we will have lawsuits. There will be a lot of back-and-forth in the coming weeks. We have 46 days to the election. Ballots have already been printed, all of that. One of the concerns is you can't even train ballot workers in time on how to do this. And there's lots of concerns about what's the chain of custody of the paper ballots. There's lots of issues here. So that's a separate issue. The larger issue is, again, sowing chaos, because if you -- part of what they were doing was giving themselves the authority to delay certifying the election. And what that means -- that throws not just Georgia into chaos, but the whole election into chaos. It also provides a rationale, potentially, for Donald Trump, something I think we all believe he will do anyway, to claim that there was a problem with the election. I mean, on the debate stage, he said, our elections are a disaster, right? So, it's a way to create -- if people are seeing stories that there was some problem in Georgia, right? It's a way to throw the whole thing into chaos, like he tried to do in 2020, and just basically slow down the system, and buy himself time as he tries to fight it out again. So it's, yes, there's a Georgia-specific problem, but it also creates, potentially, a national problem.",

On the other hand, I will just say, I do think there are Republicans, in Georgia, who do want more certainty in the outcome of the ballot counting, and they just, they want to feel like there are many eyes on it as possible, to give them, the people of Georgia, the most confidence they can have that everything was counted properly, and so on and so forth. So, I don't want to cast any aspersions on the motives here. But it does strike me that the logistics of this would make it difficult.

And it was really fascinating. And what she said about her family, I thought was beautiful. Because frankly, a lot of us have been impacted by divorce, either as children or as adults. Kamala Harris is A-plus-plus, in figuring out how to make a blended family work. Many of us wish we had families that work as well as hers. And I think we -- I think we should be lifting up Kamala Harris' example. You don't have to have everybody fighting, and not speaking, and this one's mad. You can't be on the same space -- WhatsApp groups together, just because there was a divorce.
