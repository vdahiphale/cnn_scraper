So if they come in here, you see the very little territorial gains made by the Ukrainians in all these areas right here. And the reason for that is, like you mentioned, the dragon's teeth. These are concrete barriers filled with not only concrete but rebar, and what they do is they actually are barriers.And as you can see here, you look -- you see the -- right in front of us you see the dragon's teeth. And as the vehicle -- the infantry fighting vehicle is moving forward it is actually trying to get into a trench and it's moving through that trench. It's at an extremely vulnerable point right here. But think of this -- hundreds of miles of this kind of stuff. We've got a 600-mile-long front right here and all of this is area that is defended in one way or another, some of it more heavily than other areas. But the basic idea is that at every step of the way there is some kind of a defensive area. And it's especially true in places like Crimea and it's also true in parts of the eastern front around Bakhmut. So this is a very significant area for the Russians to try to hold and, of course, for the Ukrainians to try to regain.",

This is a UJ-22 model attack drone built by the Ukrainians. They are able to use this. It has the range to go from Ukraine to Moscow and it has potential payloads of weapons that could potentially cause the damage that we saw at that high-rise in Moscow. So these are very, very important weapons for the Ukrainians to use. It's part of the Ukrainians' asymmetric war effort and that makes a really big difference because, on the one side, you have the drones. On the other side, you have what the Russians could do against those drones, and that includes the areas of electronic warfare.

The first thing that any school system can do, particularly middle school, is they can remove the cell phones. It's not necessary for the kids to be walking around with cell phones in their hands or their back pockets, especially during the school day. I think that we have an unhealthy relationship with technology. And I think that the schools, by allowing these cell phones at school during the day, whether they allow access to social media or not -- you know, a video can be taken and shared hundreds of millions of times; whereas, a story of a kid falling or getting hurt can only be told. And I think the influencers that the kids follow encourage this type of behavior. So I think removing the cell phones is the first step. And I also think that schools need a parents' bill of rights. Parents need to know how to report what's going on, and that's the foundation of Mallory's Law that we helped fund -- find. I also think that you have to have a policy.

GROSSMAN:  Well, we started seeing evidence of it towards the end of fifth grade. So, in September of sixth grade, which would have been September of 2016, we started reporting in writing to the guidance counselors, her teachers. So we started really early on pointing out some of the things that would be defined as bullying. And we didn't ask the school at that time to really define it. What we asked them to do is make the behavior stop. And that, I think, is the most important. You know, schools get caught up -- is it bullying? Is it not bullying? In our family, we don't care what you call it. We just want the teasing, the harassment, the intimidation, the exclusion -- we wanted all of that behavior to stop. And their solution was to isolate Mallory fuller -- more, and then put her in with the guidance counselor. I don't know any sixth-grader that wants to sit with their guidance counselor to have lunch.
