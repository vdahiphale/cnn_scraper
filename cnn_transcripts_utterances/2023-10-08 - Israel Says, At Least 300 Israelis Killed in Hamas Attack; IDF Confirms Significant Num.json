I'm Laila Harrak.It is 10:00 A.M. in Israel where Israel's war against Hamas is now into its second day. The death toll on both sides has been staggering. At least 300 Israeli deaths are now confirmed and Palestinian authorities say more than 250 people in Gaza have been killed. Thousands more have been wounded and Israel confirms many of its citizens have been abducted. Well, the IDF says up to 1,000 Hamas militants poured across the border and into nearby Israeli towns. And disturbing video shows civilians being rounded up in one of them, presumably to be taken to Gaza as hostages. Well, joining me now, live from Tel Aviv, Israel, is Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht. He is the international spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. Sir, good day. First, I'd like to ask you, can you give us an update on the latest situation on the ground? Are battles still under way within Israel? LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPEAKER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: So, yes, we have still -- hi, Laila, thanks for having us on. We're still in the fight. As you said, Hamas unleashed war on the state of Israel. We still -- as we speak, there's fighting in seven locations, seven communities and one military installation around the Gaza strip, and our soldiers are fighting there, Special Forces. We're sending them, mobilizing a lot of infantry and Special Forces down to deal with this situation on the ground. Dire times here in Israel, Laila.",

Our goals will be probably decided today, tomorrow, by the government. We're doing this in a composed way. But we will respond severely to this inhumane attack, Laila.",

And then when we're striking severely inside the Gaza strip, we'll do everything we can to minimize the collateral damage and evict people that are not involved and tell them to move north, south, et cetera. Sadly, Hamas attacked the main crossing into Israel. Before this happened, we had thousands of thousands of workers coming into Israel, bringing in a good living to Gaza. They destroyed the Erez crossing. And they also - that was one of their main breach points. That's how they got into Israel with pickup trucks. I mean, again, the visuals were like (INAUDIBLE).

Officials have acknowledged that the lack of a speaker of the House of Representatives in the U.S. and a permanent U.S. ambassador to Israel are unique challenges at this moment, as the U.S. tries to get support in a timely and fulsome manner to Israel.

We will not ever fail to have their back. We'll make sure that they have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves. In the street, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas just days after they mark the holiest days in the Jewish calendar. It's unconscionable.

And I think there're two things which point in opposite directions going on, from all the calls and what I'm hearing and reading, which is, on the one hand, yes, that Zionist Israeli Jewish society is rallying around this moment of unprecedented chipping away at their sense of security.The psychological impact is significant, and that in large measure is probably the intention of the resistance movements. So, the protest, as people will be familiar, will remember, every Saturday night, huge protests. Some reservists were refusing to serve in reaction to the attempted judicial overhaul by the Netanyahu coalition. So, on the one hand, society's mobilized in that way but the other thing that's going on is the polarization, which preceded this is deepening because people are asking, how the hell did this happen. Has the government been focused elsewhere on its judicial overhaul? And I think the real question is, will people also ask the most pertinent question of all, which is, can we get security if we don't have a different approach to the Palestinians? Because let me put you in the room of conversations that folks like myself have literally every week with officials and policymakers. And those conversations go something like this. Situation is terrible, getting worse, what can we do? And then you run through the options. And everyone acknowledges that there is an insecurity and instability to maintaining this kind of aggressive occupation. And so they say, well, Israel is going to have to do something to get out of the extremism of its current policies. Okay, how does that happen? Are you going to hold Israel accountable? Are you going to change Israel's cost benefit equation? Are you going to allow the U.N. to do something, the International Criminal Court to do something just to shift Israel's perception that it can get away with this forever? Are you going to ban settlement products? Are you going to change your military sales to Israel? And the official, if it's a western official, basically looks at you and says, no, no, I can't. And then you look at that official, and if they're an honest person, you say, well, you know what you're telling me here, you know where this goes next. And you get that grimaced expression, because this is where it goes next. The lessons to the Palestinians is the only option you have, all the political, diplomatic avenues are closed to you. So, Palestinians are going to turn to resistance, and the resistance movements will strengthen. Unfortunately, that's the reality.",

I think you're right to say that in the very short-term those are unlikely to move forward. But there are people who speak to both sides.Unfortunately, America and the Europeans have ruled themselves out of that equation because they don't maintain connections to the Hamas side. But there are regional actors, the next-door neighbors in Egypt, the U.N. maintains channels. The fact that there are prisoners of war/hostages being held means that there is that opening.

      "sentences": "Well, look, Laila, from the outset of these escalating tensions and violence on both sides of the conflict, we have heard condemnation from world leaders, particularly here in Europe. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as well as the E.U.'s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, both expressing condemnation at the violence and calling for restraint, calling for this not to go to an escalated stage further.But, of course, on the regional side of things as well, this has really raised alarm bells. We've seen key players, including Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, all calling for restraint, and also offering their hand in being able to mediate some sort of de-escalation of tensions between the Israelis and Palestinians. We have also have from the Turkish government, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, calling for the utmost restraint, saying that Turkey stands ready to provide support when it comes to mediation. But, of course, there have been some remarks from regional leaders who have placed responsibility on both Israel and the international community for failing to uphold the rights of the Palestinians, characterizing this latest attack by Hamas as a response, a reaction to that failure, as well as crimes against the Palestinian people and their rights. Take a listen to the statement from the Saudi Foreign Ministry issued yesterday saying, the kingdom is repeating its previous repetitive warnings of the dangers of the situation blowing up as a result of the continuing occupation and depriving the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights. That is a sentiment which has been echoed not only by Qatar and Kuwait but also the Arab League. Meanwhile in Egypt, an important player in this conflict, as it has been for decades now, we've heard from the foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who said that he is working with international partners with influence in order to try and quell the rising tensions on both sides. But, of course, we also have heard from Iran, which has expressed solidarity with not only the Palestinian people but with Hamas. This statement issued yesterday from Major General Rahim Safavi saying, we congratulate the Palestinian fighters and will stand by their side until the liberation of Palestine and Holy Jerusalem, according to state media. And, of course, there has also been expressions of solidarity from Lebanese group, Hezbollah, backed by Iran. And, of course, just in the last few hours, of course, this morning we have heard from U.N. Peacekeepers saying they have observed an exchange of fire on the border between Lebanon and Israel. So, that is, of course, another point of concern for regional leaders around a potential escalation of this conflict.",
