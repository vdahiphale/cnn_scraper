And later, the high stakes tomorrow especially for Chief Justice John Roberts, as the Supreme Court takes up the question of keeping the former president off the ballot under the 14th Amendment. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with the breaking news. The second on what President Biden has said would be ongoing reprisals for the drone attack on American forces in Jordan, which wounded dozens of troops and killed three -- Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, and Specialist Breonna Moffett. Tonight's reprisal came in the form of a daring drone strike on a target in Baghdad. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon with the latest. So what more do we know about the strike?",

      "sentences": "Anderson, this drone strike was carried out Wednesday night, Baghdad time, in the city of Baghdad itself. The target, according to three US officials, and here you can see the results of that strike was with  Wisam Mohammed Saber al-Saedi, a head of logistics, as well as in charge of drone operations and rocket operations, according to a source familiar with Kata'ib Hezbollah and the Popular Mobilization Unit, which fall under Iraq's military forces there.Kata'ib Hezbollah is an Iran-backed militant group inside of Iraq, one of the most powerful there, that the US holds responsible for carrying out attacks on US forces in the region. This is part of the US response to not only that drone strike that killed three US servicemembers and wounded scores more in late January, but also approximately 170 other attacks on US forces that have resulted in more than a hundred injuries, many of them minor, but crucially, the one that killed three US servicemembers at the end of last month. This, of course, looks very different than what we saw on Friday, when the US carried out sweeping strikes across Iraq and Syria, hitting more than 85 targets. There, the US went after facilities, munitions, weapons. Here, and if we can pull up that video again, you can see how precise and accurate this was. According to US and Iraqi officials, this was targeted at the vehicle that al-Saedi was in, going after him directly, and the US says, this is part of that response. There will be more to come suggesting the US may go after other leaders of militant groups they hold responsible for attacking US forces. Anderson, US Central Command says according to early indications, there were no civilian casualties or collateral damage as part of this strike. But according to Iraqi Police, there was at least one other person inside that vehicle.",

The Iraqi government called this new US aggression and said it undercuts understandings between Washington and between Baghdad, so you see some of that frustration boiling over.Some Iraqi politicians have vowed to try to remove US and international forces from the country. And part of it is the anger over the strikes, especially without that prior notification. Now, it's worth pointing out here, Anderson, that Kata'ib Hezbollah, again, the Iran-backed militant group that the US holds responsible for many of these attacks on US forces is not only part of what's called the Islamic resistance in Iraq, which the US holds directly responsible for the deadly strike, but it's also part of the Popular Mobilization Units and that falls under Iraqi government military forces. So there you see some of the friction created when the US goes after targets in Baghdad. The US sees these as terrorist targets and part of organizations that have targeted US forces. The Iraqi government sees this differently, and how this friction plays out, well, we're about to find out, as we see how the US and the Iraqi government move forward here despite the anger that we are seeing.",

And that established the record that he engaged in the insurrection. In the main case that was mentioned in Paula's piece, that was just a Secretary of State determination. And the law in terms of Section 3 or the Colorado law at issue here doesn't lay out the standards by which the court is able to make that judgment as to whether he engaged in the insurrection. And so, I think the absence of the guidance on how that decision is made is something that the justices will need to dig into in order to determine whether there is a substantial basis to take the drastic step of disqualifying a candidate.",

And in terms of just the specifics of the strike, we are told that there was a lot of consideration given to the timing and the specific execution of the strike to make sure that they could avoid the loss of innocent life. Of course, central command so far has said no casualties that they know of, no civilian casualties that they know of. And you can see when you are watching that video just how important that caution would be given that you see this is an area with cars and with people going by. But, Anderson, it's very clear White House officials saying this is a part of the message that the president wants to send clearly. And that message is, we will not hesitate to defend our people and hold responsible any and all who seek to harm Americans.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY LAHIKAINEN, MOTHER OF IAN ALEXANDER LAHIKAINEN DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN CANCER (voice-over): My name is Mary Lahikainen. I'm calling because I want you to know my son's name. Ian Alexander Lahikainen is my only child. He was 25 when diagnosed with brain cancer, the worst glioblastoma. We were told from the beginning, it would take his life. So it went on for a number of years. But he was left with daily seizures. His longtime girlfriend left, too much for her. He planned to marry her. It was just the three of us -- mom, dad and Ian. The time was full of love and laughter, but also terrifying MRIs to see if the other shoe, as they put it, finally dropped. October of 2019, they offered to try to just keep him alive, no more talk of a cure. This meant constantly at the hospital. Ian wanted to stop. I didn't want to lose him. I talked to them for three weeks. And finally, on Halloween, I asked him to tell me what he really wanted. I want to stay home, mom. I want to live, not just survive, he said. Even if you know it could happen, I ask. Yes, he said. I said, OK, I'll tell everyone to stop calling, no more appointments, no labs, no MRIs. My heart was breaking. Ian looked at me with a huge smile. Oh mom, I'm so happy. On February 29th, 2020, I held him in my arms. I could feel his heart pounding in my chest. I said, it's all right, Ian, I've got you. I love you. And I felt his heart stop. I was the first to hold Ian when he was born and I was the last. (Inaudible) he smiled and told me I was his best friend. What a gift that was. All throughout his life, we were goofy pals. Ian knew that he was my favorite human. I'm so lost without him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
