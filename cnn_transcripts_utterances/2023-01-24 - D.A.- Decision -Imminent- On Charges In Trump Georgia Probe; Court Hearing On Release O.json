Willis said they talked to 75 witnesses. You know, we know they brought in people like Rudy Giuliani, like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, like former Trump adviser, Michael Flynn. You know, we know, in addition to that call you referenced, the Trump/Raffensperger call that set it off, they've been looking into the fake elector scheme. They've been looking into false claims of election fraud before Georgia state lawmakers and threats to election workers. So there's a lot that they have been digging into. It's unclear how much of it made it into that report. But there was a pretty clear signal from Willis we could see more action in court moving forward -- Abby?",

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been pleading with the West to send more tanks for their war with Russia. And a Ukrainian official calls these tanks the real punch of democracy. CNN's White House reporter, Natasha Bertrand, is joining me now. Natasha, the U.S. initially was reluctant to send the tanks. So what has changed? And will this allow other reluctant ally, namely Germany, to follow suit and send Ukraine what they have been requesting?",

Because Germany did not want to be seen as being out of lockstep with the United States on this issue. Now, at the time, U.S. officials were adamant that now is not the right time to send the U.S.-made Abrams tanks because they're extremely heavy. They require a lot of fuel. They are costly. And they're broadly inefficient. That was the argument they were making this week. Well, fast forward to this week, a lot of conversations have been going on behind the scenes between U.S. and German officials to try to figure this out. Because the U.S. really does want to see Germany or I should say Ukraine get these German made tanks not only from Germany but from dozens of other European countries who have those tanks in their inventory. They do believe that they could make a significant difference on the battlefield there. So talks have been ongoing between the U.S. and German officials over the last several days. Now it appears the U.S. is preparing to announce a significant commitment of these Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Though we should note those tanks are not going to show up on the battlefield immediately. Those tanks require a lot of training and logistical things to work out. But it's a step toward breaking the logjam between the U.S. and Germany that we saw play out so publicly last week -- Abby?",

Two, this whole situation has managed to bridge the partisan divide in Washington. Listen to what Senator Richard Blumenthal said about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.
