We will take you live to the DNC. And that's where we begin our coverage with the opening day of the Democratic National Convention in just a matter of hours. The United Center in Chicago will be full of delegates ready to celebrate Kamala Harris' run for the White House. For four days, speaker after speaker will make the case that she is the right person to lead America into the future. Democrats come into the convention riding high, buoyed by a series of polls over the weekend that showed Harris opening a small but significant lead on Donald Trump. Harris' boss, President Joe Biden, headlines the first night and later in the week, we'll also hear from former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. And finally, Harris takes a center stage when she gives her acceptance speech Thursday night. Let's go to Chicago. And that's where CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak is right now. Kevin, a month ago, this was not where President Biden expected he would find himself. He was assumed to be the Thursday night key speaker. Instead, he will be speaking tonight, obviously, having bowed out in support of his vice president at the top of the ticket. And tonight really will be a celebration and a night of respect, for not only his decision, but his accomplishments in this administration as well.",

For our more analysis of what we're going to hear from Democrats this week, we now welcome in CNN politics senior reporter, Stephen Collinson. And, Stephen, it is good to see you again. So no doubt there is a lot of enthusiasm and momentum going into this convention. And it's not just based on how the polls have really bounced ahead for Kamala Harris. And she's been at the top of the ticket now and really closing in that margin that Donald Trump seemed to have in leading weeks ago. But there, as we've known a vibe, over the past three weeks has grown with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement amongst Democrats. Given that, as we heard from Kevin, there's still a lot that people don't know about Kamala Harris. Maybe that's surprising. Maybe that's not, given that she's already been the vice president for three and a half years. So, what does she need to accomplish this week?",

Harris hasn't been the most high-profile vice president.In recent decades, we've had people like Dick Cheney and Joe Biden himself who played much more prominent roles when they were the number two to presidents. And I think there really is a need, as Kevin was saying, for the vice president to explain to people what she's all about, what she would do in office, what her instincts. It's interesting. I've been talking to some democratic strategists recently. And they argue, and this is based in their own internal polling, that the vice president isn't seen by many voters as complicit in some of the downsides that Democrats see -- another voter see from the Biden administration. She's not necessarily blamed for the high prices and inflation that have occurred under Biden's watch and with which the Trump campaign is trying to saddle her. So she has a little bit of running room, but she is going to be, if she's elected, the head of state, the commander in chief, we know very little, incidentally, about what her instincts are on some of the major international questions like Ukraine and China, other than the fact that she's followed the Biden administration line. So there is a lot that is unknown about how Kamala Harris would be as president.

Again, we mentioned the enthusiasm and the increased unity within the party surrounding this ticket. That's not to say that there aren't concerns about what we could see this week, specifically outside of the convention, maybe even inside. And that's regarding staying with the foreign policy theme, specifically the war in Gaza.

Anthony Blinken held a roughly three-hour meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem earlier today. We should note though that Israel and Hamas are blaming each other for delays and new obstacles in reaching a truce in what is now a 10-month-old war. This as Hamas claims responsibility this last night for an explosion in Tel Aviv. This video, widely circulated on Israeli media and geo-located by CNN, appears to show the moment of Sunday's blast. Israeli police are calling this a terror attack. Hamas called it a martyrdom attack, which is how they describe suicide attacks. CNN diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv. Let's be frank, a suicide attack in Tel Aviv in the midst of highly sensitive negotiations is not a good development. I mean, the luck with this one was that only the bomber was killed, someone was injured. How much of a challenge will it be now for negotiators to overcome that?

As they go back into those negotiations, they will be fully aware that Hamas is apparently starting a new wave of this type of terrorist attack on the streets of Tel Aviv, where there haven't been such suicide bombs in almost two decades. So that has to have a negative effect. But that's Secretary of State Antony Blinken's message here. You have to work through that. And he feels that he got some positivity in those in the long discussion with the prime minister that there's a commitment, not just to send the negotiators back, but actually move the process forward. And even a bit of discussion about the day after in Gaza, which is something Prime Minister Netanyahu hasn't been willing to get into. But again, to your point, this offers reason for -- reason for flexibility in the eyes of the mediators like the United States and the eyes of some of the right-wing cabinet members of Prime Minister Netanyahu.

And Hamas said, no, that's a red line. The same for the actual border crossing point, the Rafah crossing, that's a red line for Hamas because Israel wants to maintain control of it.

The Iranians, however, Bianna, they came out today and theysaid that to them they are -- that they say still coming retaliation and the ceasefire talks to the Iranians are two very separate issues. Nevertheless, the ceasefire talks, a major topic here in Tehran. Obviously, the Iranians watching all this very closely just to give you an idea of how important the Palestinian issue is to the Iranians. I'm standing here on Enqelab Square, which is one of the main squares in Tehran. And you can see there next to the big Iranian flag, you actually have a flag of the Palestinians. And then you also have that Palestinian flag in those lights that are coming up there, together with the Iranian flag as well. So here in Tehran, this issue is ever present. Also the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh ever present as well. There's a lot of posters depicting Ismail Haniyeh. The Iranians are essentially saying two things about these ceasefire negotiations. On the one hand, they are saying they want a ceasefire. They say they want these talks to succeed. But on the other hand, they're also saying that they're not very confident that these talks will succeed. And one of the reasons is actually something that you already managed as well -- or that you already mentioned as well. The Iranians are saying that they don't trust the Israelis in all this, specifically, they don't believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is serious about those talks. They also have a lot of issues, of course, with the United States. They say they don't believe that the United States is an objective mediator. But on the whole, I've heard Iranian politicians inside the parliament also tell me, they hope that a ceasefire will happen. The spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry came out today, and once again said that to the Iranians, the topic of the ceasefire and the topic of their retaliation are completely separate. Iranians are saying that the retaliation will still happen. They believe they need to retaliate because it is a deterrent against possible further attacks coming from Israel. However, the Iranians have also said that they don't want to further aggravate the situation here in the Middle East and certainly don't want a wider conflict that, of course, could also involve the United States, Bianna.",

And he talked about how much America can change when devoted public servants give their lives to service. And so that's one reflection.

This happened multiple times over the last nine months. D.C. then refuses to use leverage to force Israel to keep to the established parameters. And then D.C. then talks about Hamas not accepting. And we're going to repeat. Let's be clear, the deal that was on the table was the one that Biden put out in May, which he insists was actually an Israeli deal.",

You had an Israeli soldier killed on the northern border today from Hezbollah fired, and you have Iran promising a strong response to the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran.

It's actually inside of Israel where we've seen document -- documents around how, over the past nine months, Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged negotiations multiple times. The Haaretz has documented this tremendously well, I think, over the past seven to eight months. And what we've seen, again and again, is that we get to this point where the Biden administration talks about we're very close to a deal, and then it gets sabotaged. And unfortunately, there's one more element to it. The sabotage comes from Netanyahu, but Netanyahu does that because he knows that, irrespective of any red lines, the Biden administration puts out, even if he crosses those red lines, as he's done before with Rafah and going to the Rafah and so on. The Biden administration will not use the leverage that it has on Israel to hold Israel to account and move these negotiations forward. There's been a lot of talk about pressure on Israel by the United States. I think it's quite laughable because it's always been rhetorical. It's never been about protection of Israel as the United Nations Security Council. It's never been about the provision of offensive weapons. It's never been about financial assistance. It's always been about talk. It's always been about rhetoric. And I think Netanyahu knows that. And Netanyahu is far more concerned with domestic pressure, particularly within his own cabinet from the far-right than he is with engaging with his closest ally, the United States of America.",

But as we should note, Hamas fighters live amongst the people of Gaza. They live in tunnels. They place their forces in schools and under schools and under apartment blocks and so on. I asked if he accepted any responsibility as well for that and would not answer, Bianna, that basic question. And what I was trying to get to there were some comments from residents of Gaza who placed the blame as well on Hamas and said that they want this to stop and that they find the fighting as drawing more suffering on them as opposed to any resistance against the Israeli occupation.
