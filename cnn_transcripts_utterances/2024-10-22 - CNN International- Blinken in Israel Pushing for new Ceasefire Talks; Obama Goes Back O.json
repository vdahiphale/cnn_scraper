We've heard from one of the directors saying that it's a hospital that's been there for more than 40 years. They have no political affiliation. He's actually been inviting journalists, U.N. members and Lebanese army into the hospital to try and show them that there is no truth to this. One of his quotes says this, the Israeli allegations are baseless and are a pretext to justify attacks on Lebanon and its institutions. He also goes on to say, though, that they have started to do some kind of evacuations of patients and staff because they're concerned that if the IDF believes that this does house Hezbollah infrastructure, that they will target at least nearby. We have seen that happen with another hospital, the largest public hospital in Beirut. And it comes just a day after we're seeing these financial institutions, which the IDF says is affiliated with Hezbollah, being targeted as well. So, there is a real concern within these hospitals. And what we're hearing from officials is that this is how it happened in Gaza. That IDF said this is affiliated with Hamas, and then they targeted these hospitals. So, there is a very serious pushback from officials in Beirut at the moment.",

Specifically, it's where the Israeli military started in operation more than two weeks ago, saying that they believe that Hamas was rebuilding, regrouping, and this was where they needed to target them. But there have been thousands of civilians stuck there for days now, because they weren't able to evacuate as the military wanted them to. They say that it was simply too dangerous. We're hearing from the Gaza civil defense that some 600 people have been killed just in the past couple of weeks in these areas of Northern Gaza. Now they don't give the breakdown of militants versus civilians, but the footage that we are seeing shows a lot of women and children in these hospitals. And we're also hearing more concern from the U.N. on the ground saying that even their workers can't get food, they can't get water. They have been denied the ability to send medical equipment into the few hospitals still working in the area by the Israeli military, something the Israeli military denies, but they say it is an absolutely desperate situation in Northern Gaza at the moment.",

So, I think we're going to hear that from Xi Jinping himself. He is expected to address the delegates at this conference. In addition, would not be surprised as Xi Jinping perhaps talks about the six-point peace plan concerning Ukraine along with Brazil. It's a plan that was presented during the United Nations last month. It's something that Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has slammed.
