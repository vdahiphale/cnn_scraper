More now from CNN Oren Liebermann report again from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Rising tensions in the Middle East with U.S. fighter jets carry out a series of strikes in Iraq, against Kataib Hezbollah, one of Iran's regional proxies. The U.S. said the Monday strikes targeted drone facilities used by the militant group and its affiliates. Mourners leading a funeral procession through the streets of Baghdad, as U.S. Central Command said the strikes likely killed a number of militants. President Joe Biden ordered the strikes after Kataib Hezbollah recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the Monday drone attack on U.S. forces in Iraq. The attack injured three U.S. service members the Pentagon said including one in critical condition. In a statement, the National Security Council said the president places no higher priority and the protection of American personnel serving in harm's way. The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue. U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria had been targeted approximately 100 times since October, when the Israel-Hamas war started. The U.S. has tried to calibrate its retaliatory strikes to send a message to Iranian proxies in the region without sparking a wider war. Last month, the U.S. also carried out strikes against Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, killing at least eight of their fighters, according to the group. Iraq's government has condemned both of the attacks calling them hostile acts that are unacceptable under any circumstances. The unrest has not been limited to land. Over the weekend, the U.S. is a one way attack drone launched directly from Iran struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean. No U.S. Navy ships were in the vicinity. The attack caused no injuries. But it did spark a fire on the ship according to Central Command, as it raised concerns of a broader conflict the U.S. has been trying to avoid.",

One thing American officials will tell you is they think that these various strikes, while perhaps not coordinated, out of Tehran, certainly encouraged in Tehran, are all part of a broader response to the Israeli action inside Gaza, and that as long as the Gaza conflict goes on, they think these attacks will go on.And these ranges that you heard there from will and from aren't from the Red Sea, where obviously there's been attacks on shipping to the attacks in Syria and Iraq. And, of course, Hezbollah's actions out of out of Lebanon. So this poses sort of two big strategic questions for the US. One is, how do you establish some determines here without triggering that border war that you were just discussing? And the second question is, what do you do in the border relationship with Iran, to make it clear to the Iranians that this is not in their long term interest?

He's attacks with one exception have not been launched out of Iran. And because he doesn't want to escalate, and you can understand why that would be. We've got enough issues underway in the Middle East already.

I think what they're finding as they moved out of the northern Gaza Strip, into the southern part of the area is that it is a much different kind of fight.That is where the Hamas leadership is. It requires them to actually break down doors, to go into tunnels. It's just a different enterprise for them. And that is why he's hinting at, this will be a longer and different kind of fight. The Israelis have proven thus far to be impervious to international criticism. Reasoning that no matter what they did that they would be criticized. So I suspect whatever is being said, on the streets of western capitals is not really moving them. It's more the complexity of the fight that they're confronting.",

With the Wasoko app retailers are able to place an order at any time for essential goods such as rice, soap, toilet paper and get those products delivered to their store free of charge, at the same day or the next day. With that Wasoko actually handles all of our operations ourselves, sourcing these products in aggregate at the best price as possible, from manufacturers such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, but also local companies who make up the majority of our supplier base as well. From there, we operate our own distribution centers where last mile delivery fleet of local logistics providers integrate with our technology as well to make the deliveries to the shops quickly and conveniently to enable those goods to be made available for those communities. Wasoko has been on a very long and often very difficult journey, starting our business all the way back in 2016. We've expanded now to six different countries not just in Kenya but also in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and most recently into the Democratic Republic of Congo as well. The biggest challenge for us in growing has definitely been managing and maintaining the adequate levels of products, to make sure that we're always available for our customers across markets. What we see is that as a result of a lot of challenges in the supply chain that oftentimes goods are not available from manufacturers even when there is demand for them in the market. Our biggest achievement has been building up this customer base over 200,000 shops across the six countries in which we operate. There are over 10 million of these mom-and-pop stores across Africa so there's still a long ways for us to go. But we're very excited about the traction that we've achieved so far. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He wanted them to rot in hell.He aired his grievances on social media especially against President Biden and special counsel Jack Smith. Here's Kristen Holmes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, former president Trump continuing his quote/unquote Christmas messaging into the week, posting on Truth Social on Tuesday, \"Biden's flunky, deranged Jack Smith should go to hell.\" Now, this of course, comes after his posts on Christmas Day where many world leaders or former world leaders were calling for peace and unity in a time of war. This is what Donald Trump was doing on Truth Social, posting \"Merry Christmas to all, including Crooked Joe Biden's only hope, Deranged Jack Smith, the out-of-control lunatic.\" Goes on to say, \"May they rot in hell. Again, Merry Christmas.\" This is not the typical messaging you would see from any sort of world leader, but it is a message you would see from Donald Trump who has made an entire political career of being the victim and airing these kinds of grievances, particularly when it comes to his legal cases. Donald Trump's agenda is to play this out in the court of public opinion, and he does believe that this rhetoric of attacking Joe Biden, of attacking Jack Smith is working for him because he sees those poll numbers. And when you look at that, when you talk to senior members of his team, it is clear that he is not going to tone down this rhetoric, or this language at any point. And it's not just these attacks that we see out on Joe Biden, or Jack Smith, but it's also his aggressive anti-immigration rhetoric. As he has continued to ramp up that language, those poll numbers, at least in Iowa, have continued to rise. So right now, there is no political pressure on him to tone it down, to pull it back at all. Now, obviously, this could change if he's the GOP nominee, if he does go up against Joe Biden in a general election and need to find more moderate voters. But again, that remains to be seen.
