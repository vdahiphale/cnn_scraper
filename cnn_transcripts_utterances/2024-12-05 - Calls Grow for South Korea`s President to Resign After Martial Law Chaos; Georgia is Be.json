Critics say the country`s ruling Georgian dream party has become increasingly authoritarian, and in recent years, has moved away from the West, deepening ties with Russia, which the party denies.

It comes from the Latin word vermi, which means worm. Many of us face an almost daily dilemma craving salty, sweet, or savory ultra-processed snacks over healthy ones, even though we know processed foods aren`t good for our health. Guilty. So what is an ultra-processed food? They`re foods that have been significantly changed from their original state by the addition of artificial flavors and colors, preservatives, sweeteners, emulsifiers, you get it. CNN`s Meg Tirrell caught up with researchers trying to unravel why ultra- processed foods lead to a lengthy list of issues like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and why it`s so hard to stop eating them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sam Srisatta has been living in this hospital room at the National Institutes of Health for two weeks.

He`s a participant in a clinical trial, one of the first of its kind, measuring his movement, his blood, his gut microbiome, even the air he breathes, all to try to better understand how our health is affected by ultra-processed foods. (on camera): Oh, I think your food is coming in. And we saw the kind of food he got and -- eggs and spinach and yogurt. But we don`t know. That could be processed. It could be unprocessed. That`s part of the trial. (Voice-over): Ultra-processed foods contain additives and ingredients you wouldn`t find in your own kitchen. They were shown in the previous NIH study to drive overeating and weight gain, according to researcher Dr. Kevin Hall. (On camera): Are ultra-processed foods just junk foods? DR.",

But there`s a lot of things that people would be surprised are in the ultra-processed foods category and could potentially be healthy for you. So things like whole-grain breads that you might buy from the supermarket. Most of those are considered ultra-processed because of some of the additives and preservatives that are in there, as well as how they`re manufactured. But there`s a lot of debate about whether or not all ultra- processed foods are bad for you. TIRRELL (voice-over): And that`s what this trial is trying to find out.",

Their energy density or how manycalories are in each gram of food, and their hyper-palatability, when foods contain just the right combinations of salt, sugar, fat, and carbs to make us not want to stop eating them. (On camera): This is where they prepare all of the food. And they don`t just prepare it; they weigh it before it goes up and when it comes back after the participant has eaten. (Voice-over): Each day participants in the trial are offered a total of 6,000 calories and researchers measure how much they choose to eat. The trial is a month long and each week has a different diet, minimally processed or different kinds of ultra-processed. Sam was in an ultra-processed week during our visit but one with foods Dr. Hall doesn`t expect will drive him to overeat. TIRRELL (on camera): How is that ultra-processed?",

It`s not just eggs. Our yogurts, the pancake syrup that was in the yogurt, those all have ultra-processed ingredients in terms of added flavors, added sweeteners.
