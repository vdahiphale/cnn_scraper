Ukraine's Air Force says Russia launched an intercontinental ballistic missile today during a morning attack.We are working to get information on what was targeted and any reports of casualties or damages. Ukraine's military also says it shot down six Russian cruise missiles during the attack. I want to bring in CNN's Clare Sebastian who joins us live from London following all these developments. So, Clare, what more are you learning about this breaking news on Russia launching an intercontinental ballistic missile?",

We don't know which kind they didn't say and we are still sort of trying to verify these reports and look into reports of potential damage. The head of the military administration in the city of Dnipro says that an industrial enterprise was damaged and there were two fires in the city as of now. No reports of any casualties, so all the information is still very much trickling in, but obviously this comes in a climate of escalation really in this war. This is a week in which Ukraine has now reportedly used both U.S. ballistic long-range missiles and U.K.-produced storm shadows on Russian soil, something that Russia has made very clear that it views as an escalation. Russia has also been rattling the nuclear saber, suggesting Putin signing a decree this week updating the country's nuclear doctrine, which seems to lower the bar for a first use of nuclear weapons. Now, to be clear, what we're hearing from Ukraine suggests this was the missile itself. There's no suggestion, of course, that a nuclear payload was involved. But clearly, this adds to this sense of escalation. And, of course, it comes a day after we saw several embassies close in Kyiv, including the U.S. Embassy, over concerns about a potentially significant air attack. So all of this together really adds to this sense of heightened tensions at this point around this war.",

That is why they have been public with those, sort of, nuclear efforts and why we see the intense saber-wrappling, which by the way has been a hallmark of this conflict so far, intensify in recent days. Obviously the context here is that the West, the U.S. and the U.K. and France have allowed these missiles now to be used on Russian soil in response to what they viewed as an escalation by Russia bringing in North Korean troops at some 11,000 or more believed to be in the Kursk region where Russia has been amassing forces ahead of what's expected to be a big push to get Ukraine out of there. So the West believed that they were responding to a Russian escalation. Russia now, it looks like trying to show that it can escalate even further, Rosemary.",

The chairman of that committee, Michael Gass, told me ahead of that meeting that he had some reservations about releasing it because he contended it was not completely done yet.Democrats said this is all an effort to bury damaging allegations against Matt Gaetz, potentially undercutting his ability to become the Attorney General of the United States, and they argue that it should be released. Now, this is not over yet because Democrats say that they plan to force a vote on the House floor and that vote will have to occur under the rules of the House. It would have to happen within two legislative days, meaning that this could happen since we're running up to the Thanksgiving recess. It could be punted until after Thanksgiving, but the vote would have to happen in some form, at least by that point when they return after the Thanksgiving holiday. The question will be if Democrats have the majority of the House to force a vote to actually force this report to be released. That means they would have to ensure that at least three Republicans break ranks, join with them to move ahead on this issue. One Republican earlier this evening indicated he would in fact vote with Democrats on this issue believing that the public and Republicans and Democrats need to see this information. There might be a vote in the House to release that report. Would you vote to release that report? REP. DERRICK VAN ORDEN (R-WI): I think it's very important that everybody has as much knowledge as possible so that they can make an informed decision. That sounds like a yes. That's a yes. So if the rumors are true about Mr. Gaetz' conduct, then there should be referrals to other agencies. And if they're not true, then there's a whole lot of people that owe him an apology.",

The second point is that this was an ICBM. It was an RS-26. It is designed to be carried nuclear weapons, but it's possible the Russians offloaded the warheads and simply by the missile as a signaling move, a move. In other words, to send a message to the West in response to the use of ATACMS and Storm Shadow. So clearly, it was a signaling move rather than an actual attack, per se. It hit Dnipro.

So they are trying to send a message. They're trying to basically send the west. Look, the use of these Storm Shadows and ATACMS missiles, maybe is challenging Russia's critical interests. And so they're trying to intimidate us into backing down here. And I think it's important that we don't back down. I think we really do need to make clear to Russia that Ukraine has a right to defend itself. I think the other point to make is that if indeed this is a signal to the West to back down and an implicit nuclear threat, then if we do back down, the Russians are only going to do this again and again and again. They will see this as an opportunity to use the threat of nuclear weapons. Even actual use of weapons without the warheads per se to try and intimidate us.

One Jane Doe alleges she was drugged and sexually assaulted in 2004 when she was 17 years old at one of Combs' infamous July 4th white parties in the Hamptons. In a lawsuit filed late Tuesday, Jane Doe alleges she lost consciousness after being served a drink, the lawsuit stating, when she awoke, plaintiff's underwear was missing, and she felt throbbing pains in her vaginal and anal areas. All three John Does claim they were sodomized by Combs after being given spiked drinks, and one accuser alleges he was sexually assaulted during a 2001 casting call for a music video. Combs denied the new claims. His attorneys telling CNN Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone, man or woman, adult or minor. Instead, shifting their focus to another lawsuit filed against Tony Buzbee, a Texas attorney who has been leading the charge against puns, representing dozens of alleged victims. In a new statement, Combs' team says Buzbee suits are shameless publicity stunts. That lawsuit against Buzbee was filed by an anonymous male celebrity who claims the victim's attorney is extorting him with wildly false, horrific allegations that baselessly rope him into the sweeping allegations against Combs. Buzbee, who denies the extortion claims, told CNN in an interview last month that his firm was looking into other public figures who his clients have alleged were involved in Combs's misconduct. TONY BUZBEE, PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY: I'm not going to name an entity or an individual in a lawsuit that I cannot show was complicit in some way.",

Now his criminal trial is currently set for spring of next year, but as he has been detained Combs has been trying to be released from jail.Two separate judges have denied his bail request and he has a hearing coming up this Friday where a third judge will hear from his lawyers as they try to get him released from jail as he awaits this trial. Now there's been a lot of back and forth from both sides. It seems like there's a different filing every day in this case. But prosecutors have said that they do not believe that Combs should be released because they allege that he has been obstructing this case. They say that he has been paying inmates in jail to use their phone accounts. He says that he has been trying to tamper with witnesses. So it'll be interesting to see what happens on Friday, which is the next major hearing. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
