And Nikki Haley is back with a blunt message for her party. Also, Trump and Elon Musk are going up against one of America's biggest unions. What they said that set off the UAW President, Shawn Fain. He'll join me live, after calling Trump probably the worst four- letter word that a union guy can. And also tonight, we've just learned that the official, who ruled against a Team USA's bronze medal appeal, assuring that the medal went to a Romanian gymnast, has been working for Romania for years. We're going to get reaction, from an Olympic legend. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, several prominent Republicans, who once bucked Donald Trump, are now backing him. Let's refer to this as Exhibits Y and Z. Former Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, and former Arizona governor, Doug Ducey. Burr, as you may recall, is the former Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and he'd voted to convict Donald Trump, at his second impeachment trial, in 2021, for inciting an insurrection.

Former Republican governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has just said he is going to be voting for Donald Trump, in November, along with another 2020 election denier, who is seeking office in his state. That's Republican Senate candidate, Kari Lake. But that would be the same Doug Ducey, who was pressured by Trump to overturn the election results in his state. We all remember how angry Trump was, on Election Night. And then, it led to this moment, where Ducey famously silenced a phone call from Trump, in 2020, as he was certifying his state's election results. The way we knew is because Hail to the Chief was his ringtone. We'll take that moment there, to where we are now, when Ducey tweeted out that he is going to be voting for Trump, in November. It seems like a lifetime ago. But Ducey is joining an overgrowing list of Republicans, including the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, the former U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley, the Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, just to name a few, who have either warned Americans about Donald Trump, or were asked by Trump himself, to defy the Constitution, and have chosen to endorse him, and vote for him, to put him back in office, nonetheless. I want to start, tonight, with my excellent political panel, who is joining me here. I've got a lot of you here. But Shermichael, I want to start with you, as the Republican who is here with us. And I just wonder, when you look at this, these instances, it was just kind of remarkable to see the back-to-back of Doug Ducey, and Richard Burr, coming out and explaining that they are going to be supporting Trump, in November. How do you explain this about-face from these two Republicans?",

And his explanation was really hard to understand. Ducey may have political aspirations. What is clear is that supporting Trump as the nominee is in the minds of a lot of Republican politicians. The toll they have to pay, to be members of the Republican Party now. And we saw that at the Republican convention.

And so, I think that highlights and really articulates this real challenge that Republicans have. It is a moment that where they are trying to stop the momentum that we see with Harris and Walz, that's going on right now. And certainly, they are trying to get in line, to Shermichael's point about power. They are trying to consolidate power. But it's also true that for anyone who's looking at this, these are people, and it's not even -- and for Ducey -- in Ducey's case, this isn't even something that is old news. This is something that is relatively recent. As late as 2022, he was saying things about Trump, including, he is a fraud, he is dangerous to democracy. And now, here we have him endorsing him.

The balance of Congress, right, is also -- is also, right now, I think, at the grasp of the Democrats, being able to seize the House. We've got the Senate, which the Democrats can have power, in the Senate.

And Dr. Igor (ph) was so spot-on. You're looking at some people, who are looking at short-term interest, individual interest that is, over long-term gains for the party. Now, we know this is going to be a hotly-contested presidential race. We know it's going to be decided, across a few states, with maybe 10 percent of the American overall electorate. It's not enough to just super-size or energize, rather, your base. You're going to have to figure out some kind of way, to increase those margins, by at least 4 percent, nationally, I would argue. And that does mean, to Nikki Haley's point, reaching out to some of those suburban White moms, where Republicans used to dominate with, a decade ago. It means also targeting some of those low-propensity voters, who may feel that the political climate is completely detached from their current reality. And you are seeing a bit more of that effectively showcased on the Democratic side than the Republican side.

But I have to -- I don't want to disrupt the flow here, Kaitlan. I do have to go back to the initial question, and Shermichael's point. Because this thing about, well, it's all about power, so you got to go where the power is. It reminds me of what Trump said, many years ago, that he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue, and he could -- and his supporters wouldn't leave him. There are things you can do that should cause your supporters to leave you. And I think of people like Liz Cheney, and I think of people like Adam Kinzinger, and I think of people, like Jeff Flake, and people who were willing to say, there's something more important than my own political advancement, and the Constitution is one of them. Actually, Joe Biden should go to the inauguration, not because it's polite, but because we should have peaceful transfers of power in this country.

When you look at -- when you put these two candidates side by side? I mean, Donald Trump left workers behind in 2019, when he was president. Lordstown Assembly workers in Ohio, their plant closed. Donald Trump said, don't sell your houses. And he did nothing. Those workers got sent all over the country, to try to find work. And under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they put a battery plant, in Lordstown, Ohio. Those workers are now coming home. They're coming back to Lordstown. The workers that Trump left behind. That's just one example of many. They saved a dying community in Belvidere, Illinois. You think about, in 2019, when GM workers were on strike for 40 days. Donald Trump was President. He did nothing and said nothing. You know who was standing on the picket line with those workers? Kamala Harris was, shoulder-to-shoulder, with striking workers. So, there's a very clear contrast here. And I believe we're going to keep putting the facts out there, for our members. And this is an opinion. This isn't party politics, as we tell our workers.

This is not a particularly precise single-actor targeting activity by the Iranians, I suspect.I bet they kind of took a spray-and-pray effort to get as many different folks that are within the first or second circle of the campaign, so they could get a foothold, start sending spear phishing emails to senior officials, that are actually a part of the campaign, and they could then get inside and get to some of that sensitive information. I would also note that this likely is happening to the Biden and the Harris, the -- previously the Biden campaign, and now the Harris campaign as well. It is not one campaign. It is multiple actors, going after all campaigns, and probably down at the Senate level as well, multiple -- several of those campaigns have probably been targeted as well.",

However, things may change tomorrow, you never know.I mean, I think I read something today, and heard from a couple of people that even Flavor Flav has come up with a bronze medal to give to Jordan (inaudible) to give this bronze medal back. But what I did read is she does have to return it, I believe, sometime this week, and they are not going to give another look at this case. However, it's baffling to hear that there is proof that the American judge did get there, within 45 seconds, well under the allotted 60 seconds of time, to appeal the score. So, it's very frustrating. However, just think about this. We're talking about a bronze medal finish, at the end of the Olympic Games. We're normally talking about the champions. We should be talking about -- and of course, Simone -- Jordan Chiles is amazing. But you would think that everyone would be talking about Simone Biles, or Katie Ledecky, or these other amazing feats of these athletes that ended up on top of the podium. However, because of a mistake of a judge, and this appeal process, we're talking about her bronze medal finish on the floor exercise.",
