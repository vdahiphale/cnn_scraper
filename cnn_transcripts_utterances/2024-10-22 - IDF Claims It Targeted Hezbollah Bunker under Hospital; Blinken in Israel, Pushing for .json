Antony Blinken has been meeting with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials tools today. This trip to the Middle East is Blinken's 11th since the start of the war in Gaza and comes amid pessimism in the White House that any headway can be made on ceasefire talks for either Gaza or Lebanon. On the outskirts of Beirut today, destruction from an Israeli airstrike near Lebanon's largest public hospital, that was Monday night, health officials report at least 13 deaths, including a child. Israel claims it targeted a Hezbollah bunker under the hospital filled with cash and gold. The hospital denies that. And just a short time ago an attack just outside Beirut, captured in this video, Israel had warned residents there to evacuate the area immediately, saying it was targeting Hezbollah facilities. Matthew Chance connecting us this hour from Jerusalem. And these images we have just got in to CNN about a strike just some minutes ago, Matthew, what more are we learning about that and the hospital strike earlier?",

Israel saying it's been targeting financial centers or financial buildings affiliated with the Hezbollah militia. It's been targeting banks from a Hezbollah-linked financial institution in various parts of the country in Beirut and in the south and east of the country as well. One of those hospitals that was attacked, again, as you rightly say, Israelis say they were targeting a vault underneath a hospital in which there were gold and other things like that they were trying to take out. At the hospital as you mentioned, also have denied that. What we do know is that there has been a death toll, at least 13 people killed in the strike on the hospital in Beirut. And large areas of that facility have been damaged as well, including the pharmacy. Windows shattered, other buildings damaged by this incredibly large Israeli strike on this medical facility. And so that's something that the Lebanese authorities are condemning. In terms of Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, he is still in meetings as we understand it right now with officials from the Israeli government, including Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss what prospects there may be for some kind of ceasefire or some kind of pulling back from the brink in this increasingly volatile and violent region, Becky.",

But it's not entirely clear exactly how they're going to do that or if they're going to be able to actually accomplish that goal because a senior State Department official on the ride over with the secretary of state told reporters that the U.S. really doesn't know what the next few weeks in the region are going to look like. And one of the key question marks right now, of course, is the leadership of Hamas. After Yahya Sinwar's death, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, they really don't know who is calling the shots for Hamas inside of Gaza. And that is a main question mark for them when they try and discuss how to get back to negotiations with Hamas, to actually bring about end to the conflict in Gaza, which President Biden said very clearly last week he believes is possible after the death of Yahya Sinwar. It's just a question of how they actually get there. And so U.S. officials are going to be focused on trying to push that forward during these meetings with Israeli officials. The meeting between prime minister Netanyahu and the secretary of state lasted this morning for more than 2.5 hours. So it was intensive meeting. We don't yet have a readout of that. But he's also meeting with other Israeli leaders today. And once we find out more about what was discussed, we will be able to kind of get a sense for how realistic it is that they are going to actually be able to push forth an end to the conflict. Of course, there'll be other issues discussed as well:  the ongoing back- and-forth between Hezbollah and Israel and, of course, the degrading humanitarian situation in Gaza, because the Biden administration has put an immense amount of pressure on the Israelis to try and make sure that more humanitarian assistance is getting into Gaza. And there's a timestamp for that. They need to do that within the next few weeks or they could jeopardize the flow of U.S. weaponry to Israel.",

Do you get the sense from the State Department that they share that real sense of urgency? We are, after all, 14 days away from the U.S. election at this point. This Biden administration will continue, of course, until the back end of the year, beginning of next. But this could be an outgoing -- well, it will be an outgoing administration as a Biden administration. Some of these players could carry on were Kamala Harris to continue.

And there's only two weeks here to the day to the presidential election. So even though they feel that urgency, however, these realities of the U.S. presidential political dates mean that, for them, those are influential factors. They know that the Israelis are keenly aware of U.S. politics. We know that  prime minister Netanyahu had a phone call with former president Trump in recent days. So they're concerned about the impact, of course, that that could have. Meanwhile, they feel like they have no other option but to continue pursuing a path to try and push forward an end to the conflict. Whether or not they'll be successful, they really don't know. But they don't have really many other options at this point.",

They'recalling it, one Kremlin aide, the biggest foreign policy event to take place on Russian soil ever. They're promising 36 countries will be represented, 22 of them at the highest level. Obviously, there are now nine members of the BRICS, the alliance. And you say having expanded this year, I think clearly Russia wants to make that point it's emboldened by what's happening on the battlefield in Ukraine. It's looking ahead to the U.S. election in two weeks' time, which, of course, thrown into question the issue of the future of U.S. aid for Ukraine. And it's taking this opportunity to try to build this coalition, to try to exploit that lingering sense of anti-U.S., anti-Western feeling among many of the countries represented here and try to bring more people, including the global South African countries and the like, into this coalition. So I think that is clearly the type of rhetoric we're seeing, that all the talk of how these economies are growing and the West is in decline, in terms of actual, concrete deliverables, this is the 16th BRICS summit since it was first set up in the early to mid 2000s. And clearly thus far we haven't seen a whole lot from the BRICS in terms of deliverables. This time, I think Russia would like to see that change. They are pushing for this sort of financial cross-border payment system as a counter to the Western SWIFT system that they have now been cut out of as a result of sanctions. They want to erode the power of the U.S. dollar. And they are getting some traction on that among the BRICS members. So that'll be one to watch. But I think it's interesting to listen to how Putin presented this in a press conference that they held ahead of this summit. Take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  We never refused the dollar as a universal currency. We were blocked from using it. Now 95 percent of all external trade of Russia is carried out with our partners and national currencies. They did all this with their own hands. They thought everything would collapse. But no, nothing collapsed. It's developing on a new basis. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he has held a bilateral meeting, for example, with the prime minister of India this afternoon, who did urge for Russia to work for peace in Ukraine. I think this international spotlight, combined with Russia, will be its slow and costly progress on the battlefield and the looming U.S. election. All of that is not going to contribute to a mood of compromise among Russian officials. And certainly, quite the opposite. I think they're feeling emboldened right now, Becky.",

Now listen to what authorities are alleging. They say they were basically operating a criminal sex trafficking ring, where they would recruit young men, sometimes as young as 19 years old with aspirations to be a model. And they would recruit these men from all over the world, internationally, inside the United States and bring them to certain locations for sex parties. And we're told by sources these sex parties would include drugs. They'd include alcohol in some cases. The allegations say that they would pump these men with medicine -- not medicines but basically Viagra, to basically stimulate them in order to conduct these acts with these men. Some of these men are alleged to have been former models with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Some are alleged to currently be employed by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Now this indictment includes a dozen counts. The allegations range from December of 2008 to March 2015. During that time, at least some of it, Jeffries was the current CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Now if you remember, some of these allegations might actually sound familiar. That's because the BBC did a widespread allegation --  or widespread investigation on these allegations last year. In fact, CNN reached out to the BBC about these allegations that were reported by the BBC. And Abercrombie &amp; Fitch said that they were launching that their own investigation inside the company. They said that they were appalled by these and disgusted by the allegations. So it does seem like now they are criminally charged. We're hearing again that they will be in court in separate locations today and then eventually make their way to New York for in the Eastern District. We are expecting a press conference later today to give more details of what's alleged in this indictment -- Becky.",

Trump heads back to North Carolina today and former president Barack Obama out on the campaign trail in Wisconsin and Michigan for Kamala Harris. Let's get you more  now on the state of play with CNN Politics senior reporter Stephen Collinson. Let's start with a new poll from \"The Washington Post,\" Stephen.

They like to bank theirvote so that they can then use their resources to go after less willing voters, the people that haven't turned up to cast an early vote or a mail- in vote. And it's very useful to them. Republicans historically have been less keen to vote early and the party has pushed it less. But this year it's changed a little bit, notwithstanding the fact that Donald Trump seems to regard early voting some kind of fraud in action. Republican Parties throughout the country, especially in key swing states like Georgia, have been pushing their voters to get to the polls early. So while there is record breaking turnout at this point, we don't know exactly who is voting. Are these people that would have voted anyway? And they're just banking their vote early? Or are they low propensity voters who are the most valuable voters that the campaigns are going after in these final days to try and get them out of their houses and down to the polling places? So it is a good sign, I think, for democracy and it shows that the country is engaged in this election, that people are voting. Or perhaps it shows that both sides fear for the country if the other side wins. But this time I don't think we can say that it's necessarily an advantage for Democrats.",

You saw yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris campaigning with Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who has turned against Donald Trump. She's trying to get wavering Republican supporters out. She's addressing, the vice president, Hispanic voters today. It's a little bit counterintuitive but some of Trump's wildness and extremism that we've seen playing out over the last few days may actually help him with some of those voters who don't usually vote, who agree with him on many things and his far-right positions on immigration, for example, and foreign policy.

Security Council resolution 1701 and 1559 would have perfectly led to (INAUDIBLE) executed, Israel need no such conditions. But having our experience that neither of them were really implemented, it's clear that Israel cannot afford the Hezbollah deployed a few, few yards from its civilians once again. So I think a way should be found to rearrange the authorities and the capacity to execute of UNIFIL or any other body and to make sure that 1701 and 1559 will be literally implemented. If this offends Israel, we'll be ready to consider kind of no further conditions.",

Probably has something inhis mind that he doesn't share with his members of cabinet and so on. So it seems, on the face of it, that his only strategy is basically to continue the war. I should tell you, honestly, that the recent successes of Israel, both in the south, killing Sinwar, and the (INAUDIBLE) death and (INAUDIBLE) and the other, on the other side only knows (ph) the killing of Nasrallah is a major part of its leadership. And much of each army work it has now (ph). These are very impressive achievements that resuming a way, the kind of respect to Israeli capabilities and the self-confidence of Israelis contribute to better deterrence. But nothing can compensate for the total absence of strategy. I keep repeating it. If you don't know which, which quote (ph) you want to reach, no wind will take you there. We have to have a plan, how we see the end game, how to put an end to it. Any kind of conflict has to end at certain point. We felt an political arrangement, a bag of diplomacy and security. And we should know, we have, we are not going to recompel (ph) Lebanon. We are not going to destroy or eliminate Iran from the map of the history. And so even to deploy against this axis of chaos, as Netanyahu calls it, we need an alliance with the Americans, with the neighboring (INAUDIBLE) including Saudi Arabia. And we need to deploy to them together with them to face this alliance so far -- (CROSSTALK)",
