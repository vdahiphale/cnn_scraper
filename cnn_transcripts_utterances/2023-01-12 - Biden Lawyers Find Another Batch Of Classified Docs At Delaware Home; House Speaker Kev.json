The White House just confirming details of another batch of classified government documents, this time at President Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.We're also just learning that Attorney General Merrick Garland will be making a statement at 1:15 p.m. Eastern time at the Justice Department. The Justice Department just putting out a press release a short time ago announcing that. We are working on details of what exactly that announcement from the Attorney General could include. Let's start with Paula Reid, who has been gathering much more on all of these for us. She's joining me now from Washington. Paula, what are you hearing now?",

      "sentences": "Kate, here is what we know. The White House has just released a statement revealing that additional government documents with classified markings have been found at President Biden's Wilmington home.And in a statement, they described specifically where these were found, two different locations. They said, \"All but one of these documents were found in a storage space in President Biden's Wilmington residence garage. One document consisting of one page was discovered among stored materials in an adjacent room.\" So what we have, we take a step back, we have we know 10 pages of classified documents located in a former office here in Washington, D.C. back on November 2. We know some of those materials were top secret. They covered things like Iran, the United Kingdom and Ukraine. Now we're told that that information, that discovery was a pretty close hold, but it spurred Biden advisers to search other locations. And here, finding in two different locations additional documents with classified markings. We are told, though, that he had a Rehoboth home that has been searched, and no documents have been found there. But the big question, one of many big questions is, well, is this it? Were there any other locations that have been searched? Are there potentially any other documents out there? We also don't know, Kate, with these classified documents, what was in them? How many specifically, were there? So right now, the next thing that's likely to happen is the Attorney General, he is making a statement at 1:15. What will he say? We don't know. Of course, it's possible that he could tap a special counsel to take over this matter. It's also possible that he could announce an intermediate step. We know he has tapped the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review that initial batch of documents found here in D.C. We were told by our sources that that review was completed, they didn't expect to take any additional investigative steps. So it's possible that he will announce an extension of that review. At this point, we don't know. But certainly, all eyes on the Attorney General this afternoon, and what he does with this new information.",

One of them maybe not even in a locked container. So I think probably, you know, I don't know what Biden will -- what Garland will do.

      "sentences": "Yes. In this new statement, they say that as in the previous case, they immediately notified the Department of Justice and provided the documents. In that initial statement, it said that they had notified the National Archives initially, a person familiar with the matter clarifying that that first statement is indeed true.They notified the National Archives first and handed over the documents to them. But, of course, now we know that things have changed. The Department of Justice is conducting this sort of preliminary investigation, this review of this situation. And so, they went directly to the Department of Justice in this case, providing them the documents. And that is one of the things that White House officials want to make clear is that they are being fully cooperative with the Department of Justice in this case. Of course, the White House hopes that that is where this ends. This is a White House that very much does not want to see a special counsel appointed into this matter. We do know, of course, that in previous cases, whenever a special counsel is appointed, you'd never really know where they are ultimately going to end up with their investigation. They can start an investigation, it couldn't become fairly open ended and ended up in a completely different place. So that is certainly a scenario that this White House wants to avoid. But it is notable that they put out this statement today, clarifying the situation with the second batch of documents. Clearly, they were feeling the public pressure of the revelation of these documents, which was reported yesterday by CNN as well as other outlets. But they wanted to -- you know, there are still a number of questions that they are not answering, including why it took so long for us to even find out about this. You know, we learned about this initially through reporting. The White House then confirm that they found this first batch of documents reporting revealed that a second batch was found, now they are again confirming here. So hopefully, for the White House, they are hoping that this puts a bow on it. But again, we've seen before where -- when we think that they have addressed questions about all documents being found. It's not the case. So we'll see whether or not there's more still to unravel here.",

I will say that the Special Counsel regulations say that only where a criminal investigation into an individual or a situation is warranted, should a special counsel be appointed. So if you take that literally and the U.S. Attorney in Chicago decides that no full blown investigation is warranted, then a special counsel should not be appointed.That said, Merrick Garland is very cautious and conservative on these matters. So I wouldn't be at all surprised to see him appoint a special counsel, although I do think he would want to go back to the U.S. Attorney in Chicago first to see if these facts changed his view or kind of where that stands before considering a special counsel.

A number of reasons why I believe we have lost jobs to China or lend to intellectual property, because many times we don't speak with one voice from America. What I am trying to accomplish is get members on both sides of the aisle from all different perspectives, not just from the militarily, from financial, from agriculture and others to bring those jobs back to America, to make sure China's not with inside America buying our farmland and others. Get a level playing field for competition. We watched during COVID For our medical supplies them controlling 50 percent of the market. We watched from our medical pills and others what they control. This is something that is very not just disturbing to me, but for the future of America.

I had a very good conversation with the President when he called me and I told him I'd like to sit down with him early and work through these challenges. Because, yes, your question earlier, Paul, the House is different. The American public made a decision where they fired the Democrats and they put us in charge.We put out a commitment to America to tell them exactly what we would do if they gave us the power. And in this first week, we continue to keep that commitment. We repealed 87,000 IRS agents. We created a select committee on China to bring the jobs back. We continue to work for the -- going after accountability in this government, the church style committee of where we're going. We just stopped the rate of our pretreat petroleum reserve so it won't be sold to China anymore. We continue to keep our promises and you'll watch it week after week after week. Yes, ma'am?",

And you're going to tell me other Democrats couldn't fill that slot? He cannot get a security clearance in the private sector.So would you like to give him a government clearance? You asked me questions about Santos. You asked the questions about Swalwell. Not only was he getting a clearance, he was inside an Intel Committee. He had more information than the majority of all the members. Did you ever raise that issue? No. Which you should have. You're going to tell me there's 200 other Democrats that couldn't fill that slot, but they kept them on it. The only way that they even knew it came forward is when they went to nominate them to the Intel Committee. And then the FBI came and told the leadership then, he's got a problem. And they kept them on. That jeopardized all of us. Adam Schiff openly lied to the American public.",

Jessica Dean is on Capitol Hill. And Senior -- CNN Senior Political Analyst, Nia-Malika Henderson is also here.

Or, you know, what we're seeing with a lot of these hardliners getting the fruits of their labor last week where they're getting assigned to these plum committee positions.He wants to be talking about oversight, about targeting, the Biden administration. He wants to talk about investigations, things that he believes are good for Republicans, and that's what he wants to be talking about. But Kate, what remains is, George Santos is a major distraction up here right now. You heard him talking about how he's going to let that all go through the House Ethics Committee. The political reality is that they have this tiny majority, of course, it's only four seats. If they do a special election for George Santos seat, that could very well be a democratic pick up and take his majority down to even three seats. So he's certainly not inclined to do that. But every day, we're getting more and more and more lies and accuracies from George Santos, who told us just yesterday and then repeated it today, that he will not be resigning. And in fact, Kate, at one point, he said, he'd resigned if 142 people called on him to resign or voted for him to resign. We're not quite sure what to make of that. But that remains a distraction. And the other reality remains that McCarthy is certainly going to have to please a very wide spectrum of Republicans as he moves forward on things like the debt ceiling, which he also talked about. And that is a looming crisis here that we are probably barreling toward, is how are they going to solve the debt ceiling problem and get that fixed.",
