There's an underground entrance where the Secret Service can drive him into the building and then bring him up to the upper floors where he'll be processed by the federal marshals.He'll be placed under arrest once he comes into the building and then the processing begins. It's a standard thing. They're doing an electronic fingerprinting of him. These usually involve photographs. And certainly, for Walt Nauta, we expect he's going to be booked with a mugshot. The former president of course is very recognizable and so we don't anticipate that the marshals will take new photographs of him. And then from there, he'll go to the courthouse and a judge will read him the charges and he'll have a chance to enter his plea. The question of his release, Jake, we known that we don't expect that he's going to be -- there's going to be any issues with him being released. The issue we expect, however, to come up is whether he can communicate with anybody who might be considered witnesses. That's of course is an issue of witness tampering which has been a concern in this case already. Jake?",

They were concerned, obviously, that one of the things of bringing this case in Washington was the issue of venue.And the fact is, the former president left Washington several hours before Joe Biden became president, and one of the things the Trump lawyers raised was the issue that he was still authorized to have these documents for those several hours that he came down to Palm Beach and was still president before Joe Biden took the oath of office. So, that was one of the things that they decided finally, again, in recent months, Jake, that they need to fix that situation by just bringing the case down here despite spending months collecting evidence and testimony from witnesses in the grand jury in Washington. The question here, of course, is this is a -- perhaps a friendlier venue for the former president. He won this state, of course. And the other issue, Jake, is the question of whether they'll have to litigate again to use some of that really damning witness we saw or -- I'm sorry -- testimony we have from Evan Corcoran, his attorney, who recorded some of the things that the former president was saying to him. All of that, of course, will play out over the next few months. Jake?",

At this hour, there are few barricades outside of this courthouse, and it is still unclear whether Miami police plan to separate the supporters of the former president from the folks that are going to be out there protesting the former president.

That sentence is merely background in a case about a navy contractor who lost his job because his security clearance had been revoked. And that narrow case is what the court decided on unanimously.

This case has absolutely nothing to do with any of these issues. In fact, it wasn't even unanimous, Jake. I think it was like there were four dissents in the case.

Has to do with the fractures within the Republican caucus right now in the House. Kevin McCarthy cannot do anything on the House floor because his hard right flank is in open revolt, is punishment for how he muscled through the debt ceiling lifting deal with Biden. They're furious about it, they won't let anything happen, the whole House is shut down. So this is a way in which he can try to get right with the right wing by being out there really, you know, waving the bloody shirt on the Trump indictment, but it doesn't really speak to the substance of what's going on here and the real legal peril that Trump is in in that courtroom in Florida.",

Trump is, of course, accused of mishandling classified documents after leaving office, he allegedly stored secrets on topics such as the country's nuclear capabilities in places such as this bathroom in Mar-a-Lago, a hotel and resort.Joining us now to discuss the seriousness behind it all is Jamil Jaffer. He's the executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University. Jamil, thank you so much for being here. So, let's go over this. In the indictment, there's a table listing out 31 classified documents Trump kept at his Florida Mar-a-Lago property. Twenty-one of those were marked top secret, which the federal government defines as exceptionally grave damage to national security should the information be exposed. What types of consequences are we talking about here? JAMIL JAFFER, EXEC. DIR. NATL. SECURITY INSTITUTE, GEORGE MASON UNIV. SCALIA LAW SCHOOL: Well, you think about it, right? It's not just the top secret documents. There's another 10 of them that were compartmented, sensitive compartmented information, that means signals intelligence, human intelligence, and the like. On top of that, another eight in special access programs so sensitive that the actual trigraph, the descriptor of what kind of classified material it was is redacted out of the indictment. So we're talking about some of the most sensitive secrets the government has, some most sensitive collection methodologies. So, simply putting those in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago, putting them on a stage at Mar-a-Lago, any of that, that's all crazy. These things must be kept in a sensitive compartment information facility under a locking key with an armed guard response right outside.",

And so I think we'll find that out that that was actually the case that intelligence officers targeted the Mar-a-Lago compound going forward.But even beyond that, the real problem here, this is the kind of material that you store in a room under locking key inside a safe, inside a room that's alarmed with baffles around to prevent signals from getting out, and an armed guard response right outside if the room is breached, none of that.

There were many, many of these questions.And the prosecution put a number of witnesses on the stand today, including the people that went over the searches that looked at the data, that looked at her movements the day that he died. And also a financial expert was put on the stand to talk about the death, to talk about the life insurance policy money, the fact that she got about $1.3 million after Eric's death. So the prosecution pointed to that as essentially the motive here for his death, for the killing of Eric. And the defense also putting essentially their arguments out in the open for the first time through these documents and this hearing, saying essentially that being bad with money doesn't force someone to kill someone or doesn't make you a killer. Also saying that the testimony from the drug dealer has evolved and saying, look, she essentially doesn't make sense and she's being told what to say by officers. And it was really interesting to see here the judge denying her request for bail, but also saying and citing a lot of the prosecution arguments and evidence.
