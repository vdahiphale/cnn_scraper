      "sentences": "Erica, this Turkish drone strike happened yesterday in a base near Hasakah, near the Turkish- Syrian border, so in northern Syria. Initially, U.S. central command which controls U.S. military operations in the region says there were no U.S. troops there. But now in an updated statement, they say that U.S. troops were put at risk from the Turkish drone strike on that base. That base is used by the U.S.-led coalition forces to defeat ISIS, as well as by Kurdish forces who are U.S. partners in that region. The Kurds did say that two of their fighters were killed and three others injured.U.S. Central Command says there were no injuries as a result of the strike, but again, underscoring that U.S. troops were put at risk from this Turkish military operation from the drone strike on that base there. They would not provide any further information on where exactly the U.S. troops were related -- were, in relation to that strike, or what type of risk. Earlier this morning, the top U.S. General, Joint Chiefs chair, General Mark Milley spoke with his Pole - spoke with his Turkish counterpart. They wouldn't give a detailed readout but crucially they did say the two spoke of several items of mutual strategic interest. And this puts the U.S. in a difficult position, which is why this is so significant. Turkey is a NATO ally, and they play a critical role in, for example, the Green Deal with Russia as well as the ascension of Finland and Sweden to NATO. At the same time, the SDF forces of the Kurds are necessary in the D-ISIS coalition. The U.S. now finds itself in the middle of that.",

And just the debris field was so wide it covered at least four lanes of traffic. And it was at that site that a 15-year-old Canadian- Israeli was killed. More than 14 were injured across both sites, including the U.S. Embassy is saying two Americans. Now, this type of attack is the kind that Israel has not seen in many years. This is a coordinated, well-organized attack. Police say -- police said that it takes technical sophistication to plant these types of bombs in a planned way and detonate them remotely. And this is bringing back many memories for many people of the Second Intifada when suicide attacks were almost a regular occurrence on buses and bus stops. So far, though no militant group has taken responsibility. But the Israeli prime minister is vowing to find who is behind these attacks, Erica.",

This, of course, is related to that threat to literally shoot up a synagogue. Police arrested the man on Friday night at New York's Penn Station. And all of this comes amid a disturbing rise in antisemitic attacks against the Jewish committee -- community rather.Joining me now is Jonathan Greenblatt. He's the CEO and national director for the anti-Defamation League. You know, what has stood out about this very disturbing threat? Also, some of this initial reporting, the New York Times had that reporting the initial tweets about this threat were actually flagged to authorities by an online security analyst with the UJA-Federation of New York. Can you just give me a sense? Based on your conversations with both law enforcement and communities trying to do their own work here, how tough is it to stay on top of all of these threats? JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO &amp; NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: Well, it's incredibly difficult, Erica, and I should say we're so grateful for the FBI, the NYPD, ADL, and the community security initiative were coordinating throughout the weekend until the individuals were apprehended and arrested. Keep in mind. They literally had come into the city -- to New York City with a high- capacity firearm, knives, bulletproof vests, and a swastika arm patch. And their intent was to attack and kill people in a synagogue. So, we're grateful that law enforcement did this. But in our environment today, social media makes all this so much more difficult. The analyst to identify this person was sitting -- sits with the ADL center and extremism team, and we have never seen such a flurry. I mean, as you mentioned in the intro, last year was the highest number of antisemitic incidents we've ever seen. And so much of this violence starts with words. And so many of the words, the antisemitic rhetoric, you know, ignites online, where platforms like Twitter, or Truth social, or Facebook are literally the frontline today of antisemitism.",

And once you start hating Jews openly, that tends to create space to hate other minorities openly. So, our hearts go out to the victims, the people wounded, their families and the tragedy in Colorado Springs and the LGBTQ community has a reason to be concerned. We've seen some really ugly rhetoric.Frankly, on some cable news shows on talk radio indefinitely online targeting gay people, trans people, it's really quite alarming that that attack happened on the eve of the Day of transgender visibility. Now, GLAAD is doing some great work to try to stop this. And I'll share today, Erica, just last week, ADL and GLAAD announced a strategic partnership. We literally have a new analyst joining our team from GLAAD just to track anti-LGBTQ extremism and hate because we see it's so interrelated with the kind of extremism and hate that often targets the Jewish community.

And he knew this was going to come out right during the beginning of the World Cup. Portugal is set to play Ghana tomorrow. So, I'm told, reading from some of the sources from ESPN, that the other players, they were barraged with questions this morning by the press, tons of cameras, and a couple of the players got a little bit annoyed having to hear these questions about, yes, Ronaldo, he did it again, as Ronaldo himself said, I speak when I want to speak. He's made a living out of this, obviously what he does on the pitch, but what he does off is why he's one of the most popular humans on the planet. But it sounds like it's ruffling a few feathers the wrong way within the team.
