I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with Donald Trump spreading a new and false conspiracy theory to attack Vice President Kamala Harris over a familiar obsession for the former president. His latest lie that Harris is using artificial intelligence or A.I. to create images of, quote, fake crowds, as he calls them. Of course, there's no truth to that claim. And you can see right here, Harris objectively brought out big crowds at her events. We were there. We have the video. That's clearly bothering the former president, who is once again saying without any merit that the press is in on the alleged plot, which it's not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They said, oh, she had a big crowd. Oh, the crowd, the press is talking about the crowd. In New Jersey, I had 107, 000 people. The press never even talked about it, because they're fake. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Harris victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would likely mean that she would win the presidency. So, let's break down these numbers. CNN's Harry Enten is live in New York. Jeff Zeleny joins me here in Washington.Harry, first to you. The economy is obviously a big issue for voters. I mean, they're going to be voting on that, like they do just about every election. What are the polls showing on that issue just three months out?",

So, despite that, she has seen an increase.Clearly, President Biden and Bidenomics was a challenge and a bit of a weight on the Democratic Party and voters. But, look, we're hearing she's going to talk more about strengthening the middle class, lowering prices. She'll actually be appearing with President Biden on Thursday this week for the first time, really, in an official-like setting talking about the work the administration has done to lower prices on things, like the cost of insulin, and other things, but she has to sort of explain more what she'll do on economic policy. Housing, I'm told, is a central concern for her. Of course, it's a major concern for Americans. The price of housing simply is a key inflation indicator. So, we will see what she does. But she's gaining by not saying exactly much what she will do. They have to put some meat on the bones. I'm told they will do that this week.",

But apparently the Harris campaign has a big ad buy out right now. I mean, that is going to -- or Trump has a big ad buy coming out to sort of, I guess, blunt some of this momentum.",

I mean, as we are now 85 days before Election Day in November, a week before the Democratic Convention, the Trump ad buy that is coming out is just, we're learning about it this morning, some $23.8 million. A lot of it is going to Georgia. A lot of it is going to North Carolina and he's traveling North Carolina this week. She is as well. We're told the vice president will be traveling to North Carolina later this week.So, now the battleground is back to what it seemed like it would be at the beginning of this campaign. It's no longer just those three blue wall states. They are very important. But they've also -- both sides clearly see North Carolina at the center of this. And that's very interesting, perhaps the most interesting development here. The Trump campaign is slightly more worried about North Carolina than they were. Of course, this is a red state that President Obama won it in 2008. It's not been won by a Democrat since then.",

And this came in direct response to Politico saying it had gotten these internal documents. Some of them, as you said, were vetting documents for J.D. Vance.Now, they do point to a report that we had seen the day before Microsoft had put out the saying that Iran was ramping up its efforts to try and interfere with the 2024 election, that they had targeted an unnamed presidential campaign, then the Trump campaign making a direct link to them saying it was them that was hacked. Now, I will tell you, the Microsoft report never said anyone was successful in hacking. It just said that they tried to hack a top campaign official get sending a spear fishing email, obviously, as we've come to be familiar with those. Now, here's what the Trump campaign responded to Politico. They said, these documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States. They were trying to interfere with the 2024 election, and so chaos. Microsoft not giving us any other details, the FBI, they're not saying anything. The campaign wouldn't even say if it contacted law enforcement. Obviously, this is a far change from what we saw in 2016 when Donald Trump was encouraging Russia to release any emails it had from Hillary Clinton. Now they're saying that we shouldn't release any kind of information received from this, quote/unquote, hacking because the fact that it's hostile governments, Russia, obviously a hostile government, but this is their line right now. We still don't have the details that link what Microsoft put out there to what happened in these documents that were obtained by Politico.",

      "sentences": "It certainly keeps the controversy going and all our eyes very much on this, because it is, of course, the performance of all these athletes, Jim. It is also one of those iconic images that we've had from the last couple of weeks, which we'll remember saw Rebecca Andrade, who won that floor routine for Brazil, saluted by Simone Biles on one hand and Jordan Chiles on the other, the first all-black floor routine women's gymnastics podium. An iconic image, even as it was first published. The question now of whether Jordan Chiles' bronze will hold is now what we're going to be talking about for the next few days. We don't know exactly how long this is going to take because we know that Team USA is appealing that decision. Essentially, immediately after the scores were published, the Romanian Ana Barbosu was in position to take the bronze. It was an appeal by Team USA, which meant that the difficulty score that was attributed to Jordan Chiles' routine allowed her to pip at the post, the Romanian taking that much coveted third position and that bronze.At the time, the Romanians had been outraged. There had been heard outraged, appealed, expressed by their prime minister in the shape of his refusal to attend the closing ceremony all together because two of the Romanian gymnasts felt they've been (INAUDIBLE) by the judges, and as a result had been penalized in terms of their overall medal count. This now we heard on Saturday meant that because that appeal said the International Gymnastics Federation was lodged just seconds after that one minute deadline, it meant that they reverted back to the Romanian taking bronze. But that appeal that's now being made by Team USA, clearly full of promise. What the Americans are saying, essentially, Jim, is that they now have video evidence for that, photographic proof that they didn't have access to before that will allow them to show that, in fact, the appeal was lodged within that minute, within 47 seconds. So much hangs in the balance. The Olympic hopes of both these gymnasts, of course, the medal count of each country, Jim.",
