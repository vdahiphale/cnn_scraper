I'm Amara Walker, in for Kate Bolduan.We begin in Kentucky, where nine U.S. service members are dead after two Black Hawk helicopters crashed overnight. These photos from local radio station WKDZ show the crash site in Trigg County, which is just north of the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Now in these photos, smoke and flames and what looks like to be a piece of the wreckage can be seen. Officials say the choppers were on a routine, what was supposed to be a routine training mission with night vision goggles when they collided. Let's get straight now to Dianne Gallagher live at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Dianne, what are we learning? I know officials just held a news conference.",

Of course, nine of those service members on board all died. We're told that, once they arrived on scene, they were dead, they were not transported. There were five on one helicopter, four on the other helicopter. Again, they said this was a routine training mission, a progression flight. They said that this was something that was basically a, quote, \"multiship formation under night vision goggles.\" According to the 101st again, it is right now being investigated to determine what did cause this flight, this crash. I asked if there was any sort of signal for help, any sort of alert that something might have been wrong before the crash happened. They said that that was not something that they had any indication had happened at this point. The governor of Kentucky also here today, trying to offer words of comfort. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY):  We're going to wrap our arms around these families and we're going to be there with them, not just for the days but the weeks and the months and the years to come. We're going to let them know that they are loved, they are special. And if they'll allow us to carry some of their grief, we'll do that for as long as we can.

An American journalist has been arrested in Russia and is being accused of espionage.

We know Yekaterinburg is a place where there are lots of Russian military installations. But it's not clear what exactly they mean and the details are not being made public. In fact, within the last hour or so, Evan Gershkovich has appeared at a court in Moscow, where he was taken in a minivan that -- we caught a glimpse of him. He was caught on camera going into the court. And that court designated the case top secret. They said that Mr. Gershkovich has not pleaded guilty, has not accepted guilt in these charges of espionage. And he has been basically set -- arraigned in pretrial detention, pretrial detention until May the 29th. And so it may not be, you know, until then, that we get any further details about what exactly it is that this \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter, 32 year old American citizen, has actually been specifically accused of.",

Jill, the timing and the context of Gershkovich's arrest are important, right? Because we have this war in Ukraine that's raging on. And just last week, the DOJ announced that a Russian spy was arrested; I believe it was in Washington, D.C. Do you have any doubt that this is a tit-for-that?",

Now I've been talking with U.S. former diplomats and what they are concerned about is it raises the level of concern because there have been laws and we've reported on them. We were affected. CNN was affected by this -- by these laws against spreading disinformation considered about the war. But this is talking about espionage. It is immediately raised to a top secret level so it will be very difficult to get any information about precisely what is happening. These cases are very hard and they take very long to adjudicate. They -- it is a complicated situation. And another diplomat that I spoke to also raised a red flag because of the role of the FSB in this. If you look at the statements coming out of the spokesperson for President Putin and the foreign ministry, they're both saying he was caught, Mr. Gershkovich was caught red handed, which could indicate, number one, this is an organized event, no question coming from a high level. And number two, there might be some type of evidence -- it could be ginned up evidence that could be presented. So I think we're in for a very long time, a very serious time, which really complicates for nations, as if they were not complicated enough. And don't forget you have two Americans at least who are held. And that would be Paul Whelan, who has been held -- he's charged 16 years condemned to prison also for spying, alleged spying. And then another American, Marc Fogel. So it's very complicated and very serious.",

And foreign journalists now I think are on notice that they're going to be watched and followed very closely. And you know, you never know what the next step will be. But again, we're in a back, almost back to the Soviet days. As we know the last arrest for an American journalist as a supposed spy was back in -- I think it was 1986.

I just want to get your reaction. And, first off, you know, we did hear from two of your colleagues in the House on the arrest of Evan Gershkovich.

ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), MEMBER, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  This is very typical Russia behavior and that is to grab Americans, use them as leverage; in this case, reporter; make spurious allegations against them and detain them, you know, potentially for long periods of time.

Obviously the invasion of Ukraine, the way they're conducting that war.

He pretended to be somebody else.He is not the person he was claiming to be when he enrolled at Georgetown University and started spying against the U.S. We have 100 percent proof that he is a Russian, who was impersonating a Brazilian in order to spy on the U.S. The Russians do not have that evidence because \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter is just that, a reporter. He's not a spy. So, yes. No, I think we should draw that clear distinction and, again, recognize the lawlessness of how Russia is approaching this in jeopardizing American lives. And you're right.
