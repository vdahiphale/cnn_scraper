The top of the democratic ticket is complete and a new phase of the U.S. presidential campaign is now underway. Kamala Harris has chosen Tim Walz as her running mate. The 60-year-old Walz, a onetime dark horse in the race, is the plainspoken two-term governor of Minnesota and a former congressman. He's set to join Harris in Philadelphia later today where they are kicking off a tour of battleground states. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign just released this TikTok video contrasting Walz with the Republican nominee for Vice President, J.D. Vance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): People like J.D. Vance know nothing about small town American. It's not about hate. It's not about collapsing in. The golden rule, there's mind your own damn business. Their policies would destroy rural America. They've divided us. (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'll tell you, this has been an exciting development for Democrats over the last several hours. The Minnesota governor, he's a former teacher, congressman, Army National Guard veteran. He's receiving praise from all corners of the party for being really a consensus pick. So he enjoys the support of progressives and centrists alike. His supporters describe him as the Midwestern dad that America needs. And he's also adopted this weird framing now widely used among Democrats across the country. He calls the former president and other Republicans bizarre. And he does that because he says it takes some of the venom out of the contest that people don't need to be afraid of their opponents.

And the Trump campaign and Republicans already quick to paint him as a liberal, progressive. Whitney Wild, thank you so much. Well, as noted, Republicans are wasting no time criticizing the democratic vice presidential pick. And we're learning that some Trump allies are actually relieved that Kamala Harris didn't choose Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has already begun fundraising over Harris' selection of Tim Walz. The campaign is attacking Walz as dangerously liberal, a West Coast wannabe, and threatening that the Minnesota governor would, quote, unleash hell on earth. Jeff Zeleny joins me now live from Philadelphia. It's that last one that I think is a bit much, unleashing hell on earth, maybe taking it a bit too far. But really holding in on this idea of him in painting Walz and now along with Harris as sort of liberal West Coast out- of-touch elitist, appears to be the message that the Trump campaign wants to take.",

In the last couple years, in a second term as Minnesota governor, there's no question Governor Walz has signed very progressive even liberal legislation. He defends that. Some of it is a free lunch for students across the state of Minnesota. It is gun bills. It is tax credits for working families, things like that. He, you know, certainly defends that. But, Bianna, the arc of his career is actually quite interesting. He was elected to Congress in 2006 during a strong democratic year, but from a Republican district. So he certainly was a moderate Democrat and now is a progressive Democrat. And following that arc is what the campaign hopes to lean into. But look, the race now is to define Tim Walz, just as we saw the race to define J.D. Vance. So how he stands up under this scrutiny and pressure, over the next coming days, will certainly determine sort of this momentum and the trajectory of this going forward here. But for now, at least, the Harris campaign believes that Tim Walz is a great addition. We will see how they look tonight when they appear on stage for the first time here in Philadelphia, Bianna.",

Jeremy, so there's clearly a lot of enthusiasm amongst the party base now and we have a solid ticket in place. We know that it's going to be Harris- Walz. We'll see the two of them later together. First of all, your reaction by this pick as we've noted it throughout the top of the show, he was a bit of a dark horse just a few weeks ago and now here he is on the ticket. JEREMY THOMPSON, FORMER SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR, HARRIS 2020 CAMPAIGN: Yes, for sure. As we were -- first of all, thanks for having me on here. I really appreciate the time. Look, I will say this. You've seen the enthusiasm from the party come out since the announcement was made on social media and, of course, within the party. Because honestly, we're still right in the momentum from a few weeks ago. I think the thing that I think is really important now, of course, is that Democrats need to get out and tell America exactly who the governor is, what he stands for and really frame that before the rest of the world starts putting their opinions in there. And I think tonight at six o'clock, 6:30, when Harris and Walz stepped on that stage in Pennsylvania, is going to be the start of that long party, as we go into the convention.",

And, of course, anytime someone my age says, you know, the word brat, for example, it immediately becomes uncool.But the reality is, is, you know, we're looking at social media and political campaigns. We've seen it involved from just a tool for fundraising from a few decades ago to a tool to really tell the personal stories of who candidates are and what they stand for. I'll give you an example. During my time as social media director, you know, I worked with a team that traveled with the vice president as she was campaigning for president. And what would happen is she would give us stump beach and then she would go out into what's called the rope line where voters and supporters are standing by to really get to know her and meet her. And what our goal was is to show those interactions. Because people from all over those who agreed with her policies, who might have disagreed, would come and they would ask her questions from, you know, hey, I'm wondering how you're going to help fix the economy, for example, or hey, you know, I have this issue in my town that's really important too. One young woman asked the vice president. I am in a debate class and I really don't know how to succeed at debate. How can you do that? Someone else asked her, you know, what's your favorite type of taco, right? Those are the moments that are critical to show the voter base, especially young voters, because, well, we might be privileged to see that side of the vice president, that dancing, that fun, that joyful warrior side. Most of America doesn't see that and that plays a long way into making sure that those younger voters can see the person behind the policy. And that is critically important in a world that is moving so fast, where your media narrative is defined by social media, and where younger voters are looking for one thing, and that's authenticity at the end of the day.",

And we know there's still someskepticism in terms of voter turnout among younger populations versus the older population and voters. And so not to exclude them. We know that a real vulnerability here is cracking through those undecided voters, those Midwestern voters, those anti-Trump voters as well. How can this be done? What is the approach that can be taken on social media and the social media campaign for this ticket that doesn't exclude those voters? In fact, it tries to specifically target them.",

Social media is just one part of an inclusive campaign strategy. What's going to convince these independent voters and moderate voters, and those who might not be keen on, say, former President Trump, is going to be how the vice president gets out there and has those one-on-one conversations, how she shows up where they are at the end of the day, and how she leverages the new vice presidential nominee, Governor Walz, to really have those conversations at the end of the day. Look, most of America isn't on X, Twitter, right? Most of America isn't looking at Instagram every hour of the day. And we do know the older voters really are important when it comes to solving a lot of these issues in America. And so one thing that I think this campaign has done effectively and will need to do is make sure they get these two amazing candidates inside the spaces where these people are. So that means, you know, speaking at those small community centers, hosting those rallies in those swing states, as you'll see Harris and the governor do, over the course the next few weeks or so, but making sure you meet voters where they are specifically. The voters are there. They're waiting to hear your message. We need to do that in person.

And here's something that stood out to me in an interview that Walz gave to \"The New York Times\" just a few days ago. And he said in making the distinction between Trump and his voters, he said, I keep coming back to this. If they're not voting for us, there's not something wrong with them. There's something that's not quite clicking. So don't assume that they're just not clever enough to understand what you're selling them. That really stood out to me.

But putting that aside for a second and looking at this idea of it's not an us versus them, it's how do we reach the America that is looking for solutions to the common problems that we have. I think one of the things that's really important here is that we've all said, over the past few weeks, that we need to lower the tone of the political rhetoric in this nation. And it's going to take the courageous conversations like Governor Walz has been having about people who people say are on the other side, for example, of an issue to really help try and unify that and show that the Democratic Party can be a party of consensus. It can be a party that is meeting you where you are specifically. Look, I think one of the beautiful things about working on a presidential campaign, besides the lack of sleep that you get and the copious amounts of sugar you use to keep yourself way up at night, is that you learn that the people who are fighting to be in charge of this country and lead us into the direction that they are real people.

And there has been somewhat of a really upsetting and harmful smear campaign over the past few weeks, specifically targeting Shapiro and whatever people view his record on Israel, if you really take a deep dive, it's similar along the lines. If anything, he's been harsher on Prime Minister Netanyahu than some of these other potential candidates. But one thing that stands out is, obviously, that he is himself Jewish. This is something that Republicans are also pouncing on at this point.

And it is indicative of a larger problem wherewe're not having the conversations with one another as people and recognizing that there are issues that we all have to tackle all together as a nation. One of the things I think that is really important moving forward is that the Vice President and the governor need to move forward and quickly begin the process of speaking about the values the American people care about for the most. And I think the Vice President and President Biden have both come down harshly on the fact that, you know, there is no room for anti-Semitism in the party. But at the same time, though, as partners and global leaders, we really have to make sure that we are being the partners that the world deserves at the end of the day. And so I think as the vice president moves forward, as the governor joins the ticket tonight, and we move to the convention, we're going to see that healing process move forward. We're going to see people expressing their right to freedom of speech. We're going to see the candidates both try and find a way to bring that consensus together. But at the end of the day, we're trying to figure out, how do we take the American values of a better future of hope and take that and move that forward and communicate that? Because at the end of the day, when the new president is sworn in, whomever that might be, you know, we're going to have to move forward as one country and tackle these issues together.",
