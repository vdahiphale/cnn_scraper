I mean, across the southeast, we watched scenes of utter devastation that proved once again the sheer power these storms pack for hundreds of miles. Before and after satellite images show why there are now entire communities along Florida's Big Bend Region that will never be the same. Idalia now a tropical storm is almost nearly completely offshore but not before dumping massive amounts of rain in the Carolinas.And caught on camera near Charleston. A terrifying moment as a strong gust of wind sent this car flying. Now, one town hit incredibly hard was Horseshoe Beach, Florida. And Vic Micolucci from our affiliate WJXT is there.

A great guy named Lynn, this is his family home. He has retired here. He's a fishing guide in this town. He's a retired Army veteran, disabled and he says this has been in the family. This means a lot to him. He just repaired it after past storms. Now, he can't live in it. He's right now trying to negotiate with the insurance adjuster, he's trying to get some help right now throughout this terrible situation.

Delta Flight 175 was traveling from Milan to Atlanta on Tuesday when the plane was rattled by turbulence just before landing. In fact, the turbulence was so severe that 11 people needed to be treated at the hospital.CNN Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean has been following this story for us.

Some passengers described being lifted out of their seats during this turbulence incident. Most of the flight, they say, was OK.About 10 hours long from Milan to Atlanta. They're up at 40,000 feet. But the FAA says this incident really took place as this flight was descending into Atlanta, about 40 miles outside of Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. And the flight was down there at 12,000 feet when it encountered what's called severe turbulence. This is the video from onboard shot by a passenger. You can see some of the passengers being taken out by a stretcher. One of the passengers describes a passenger hitting an overhead bin hard enough to crack the overhead bin. This is the breakdown from the FAA. One member of the cabin crew received serious injuries. One member -- or three members of the cabin crew, minor injuries. Eight members of the passenger corps, minor injuries. So, a bit of a discrepancy there between the 11 taken to the hospital and the 12 reported injured by the FAA. The causes of turbulence are interesting here. Sometimes it can be things that pilots can see. Thunderstorms, frontal passages. Sometimes it comes with no clear weather feature. It can occur in clear air because of wind shear, that sort of moving layers of air, where the wind speed changes suddenly. It can also come off of a wave of a mountain. So, sometimes pilots can't even see this really, and it's the top cause of injuries on board commercial airliners. About a third of all incidents on commercial airliners involve a turbulence-related incident, Boris, and it's really a big serious issue for them. They've done a big report on this just a couple of years ago, Boris.",

Gas prices are hovering around historic highs for this time of the year at $3.83 a gallon. That's according to Triple A's latest figures. And a CNN review of federal data shows that for the week leading up to Labor Day, the record high was set in 2012 at $3.84 a gallon.Let's bring in CNN Business and Economy Reporter Matt Egan. Matt, always good to see you. So, what's behind the spike in prices? MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS &amp; ECONOMY REPORTER: Well, Rahel, what's weird here is that normally when the summer winds down, gas prices really cool off. That is not happening this summer. Look at this. $3.83 a gallon today. That is well above Memorial Day weekend when summer unofficially started, and 30 cents above Fourth of July week. So, why is this happening? One reason is because this is actually what Saudi Arabia and Russia want. They're cutting supply of oil. That is driving up prices. Another factor, and this is a surprise, is actually extreme weather, right? These triple-digit temperatures have messed with refineries limiting their ability to produce gasoline when it's needed the most. The good news is that gas prices are below the record highs of last year, above five. But look at this. The bad news is that this is historically high for this time of year. You can see the last 11 years, we're right up there against the record highs.",
