How much of a setback is it? Are people alarmed? INNA SOVSUN, UKRAINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Well, of course, we are alarmed, because for us, this war is literally a daily reality. I will tell you this. It's 7 in the morning here in Ukraine. We here in Kyiv woke up at 4 in the morning because of yet another air raid alert. And me and my son, who actually has a birthday day, had to relocate to the -- well, to the bathroom, so that we are not near the windows, in case there is yet another missile attack here in Kyiv. And this happens almost daily in our lives. And we are here, quite far away from the front line. The reality for those who are out on the front line is even much worse. And unfortunately, our daily life consists of news from our friends, from relatives who are learning about yet another friend of ours being killed or wounded in the war. And this is, of course, very, very scary reality for all of us. And we understand that the only way to fight back is to coordinate with -- with our partners, with our friends, who share the same principles that we do, that believe in democracy and human rights.

It's now the second biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine. And from what I know from German politics, it is on the right path. And the general agreement, among all political parties across the spectrum, both from the far-right and far-left, which are largely funded by Russians, of course, is supported towards Ukraine. But then, of course, in some other countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russians are trying to play politics and to put the people who support them in positions of power. And so we previously had Hungary which was a huge problem for us, in terms of providing not just military aid but they're also blocking sanctions against Russia, on the E.U. level. Yes, Slovakia is an unfortunate development to that matter, as well. But I don't think it is -- it is yet a sign of big change coming on the level (ph) so far. But we will have to wait and see.",

So he's doing everything in his power to -- to make sure that Western parties are not united on the issue of Ukraine's war. So any decision by the Western powers not to continue funding Ukrainian war effort will actually be a victory for Putin, in itself. It will not mean that we will give up fighting, but it will be a geopolitical victory for Putin. And that is something that decision- makers in Washington should remember. He is fighting to prove that he can change the politics, the policies of Western nations, particularly the United States.

Slovakia has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since the outset of the war, sending helicopters, artillery, and air defense systems. But Fico's basic argument is that sending weapons and ammunition only prolongs a war in which Russia will never accept defeat. And that is an appealing message in a country that is struggling with inflation, and the cost of hosting more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. Fico's party won by a more comfortable margin than some polls had predicted. But he will still need a governing partner in order to govern the country. And he had not ruled out pairing up with a far-right party that broadly shares his view on Russia and Ukraine, but that party didn't quite make the 5 percent threshold needed in order to take seats in Parliament. So it is more likely that he will now aim to work with the Halas (ph) Party, which has been more vague about Ukraine; on the one hand, arguing that Slovakia has given all it can afford to give; on the other hand, it says that Slovakia should continue to manufacture ammunition for Ukraine, which is ultimately good for the economy.

And the week of festivities continues in China as the country marks the 74th anniversary of the People's Republic, as well as the mid- autumn festival. Hong Kong held its first National Day fireworks show in five years, with police estimating more than 400,000 locals and tourists attended. And officials say they expect nearly 900 million trips throughout the country during the eight-day holiday period. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now with more from Hong Kong. I hope that wasn't a typo. But China's big holiday weekend, Kristie, is here. Will it deliver that bid economic boost for the country? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: That was not a typo, Laila. These are superlative numbers that we're talking about. China's mid-autumn Golden Week holiday is underway. This is, you know, one of the first holiday periods since the COVID-19 pandemic during which people can actually travel, now without restrictions. Nearly 900 million trips are expected to take place during this time. According to China's Ministry of Tourism and Culture, some 896 million domestic tourists will be traveling, an increase of 86 percent from the year before. And revenue from domestic tourism is set to reach some $107 billion. Trains are busier than ever. In railway stations across China, you see scenes like this, scenes of a surge in domestic travel, especially railway travel. According to China Railways, some 190 million railway trips will be made during this travel rush. Around 20 million passenger trips were, in fact, made over the first day of the holiday. But despite the surge in domestic travel numbers, China's overall outbound travel market is still quite low compared to pre-pandemic levels. China's outbound international flight capacity is down around 50 percent. That's much lower than other countries. And the price of the tickets, international flight fares are still much higher compared to 2019. Now, China's economy is struggling to recover after the pandemic, after zero-COVID. So many Chinese consumers are still reluctant to splash out on pricey overseas holidays. And so Chinese who are going abroad, they're opting for more cheaper Asian destinations, destinations like Thailand, which has, in fact, become a leading choice after it recently introduced a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists. In fact, according to Trip.com, hotel bookings to Thailand surged -- and this is not a typo -- surged over 6,000 percent, Laila. Over 6,000 percent compared to the previous year after this policy was announced. Back to you.",
