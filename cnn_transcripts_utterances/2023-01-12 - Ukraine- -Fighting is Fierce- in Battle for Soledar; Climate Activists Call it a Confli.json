Hello and welcomeback to \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching you are more than welcome. Ukraine reports intense fighting in the small town that has become the latest flashpoint in nearly 11 months of war. Well, Ukraine says for now, its soldiers are battling fiercely and are holding out. Its military also reports overnight strikes in the area killed 100 Russian soldiers that cannot be confirmed. The Kremlin continues to hold back on the claim from the Wagner Group Chief that his soldiers have captured Soledar. A spokesperson saying today that Russian backed forces has put in enormous effort there. But the main work is still ahead. Well, a clearer picture is emerging of the level of destruction in the town. You can see it in these before and after satellite photos, eerie scenes reminiscent of Mariupol leaving and other Ukrainian cities and towns before that were practically wiped out by Russian attacks. Ben Wedeman back with us this hour from Kramatorsk in Eastern Ukraine. You were close to if not inside, or certainly as close as you could get to Soledar you and your team Ben, for the benefit of those viewers who weren't with us last hour just describe what you understand to be the situation there? And why it is that this matters so much?",

And they say that after several days of having to pull back, they actually made some small advances in Soledar. Of course Soledar is really just a town of 10,000 people. The 46 says that they are now in control of the railway and the mine in that town. But what we saw when we were on the outskirts of Soledar is that the situation not only in the town, but around it is perilous. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice over): Medics load a wounded soldier onto an ambulance, another casualty from the embattled town of Soledar. It varies depending on the number of casualties on the front lines. Russian forces mostly troops from the Wagner Group, the private military company claimed to have control of the entire Soledar territory. The battle for Soledar may be in its final stages and it doesn't appear to be going well for the Ukrainians. And if indeed the Russians do emerge victorious, the villages around it may be the next to fall. Ukraine's helicopters still flying sorties, its forces aren't giving ground easily. One soldier says it's difficult but we're hanging in there. Despite the fighting, you guys staying put with her pigs and cows in her home in a nearby village. We won't leave she says.

There is in fact, a parallel army rising up in Russia with a completely parallel command. And it's not even controlled operationally in the battlefield by Russian Armed Forces.

The Belgian authorities also summoning the ambassador there in relation to this sentence laid against an aid worker Belgian aid worker. But of course, tensions are high at the moment. We saw just before the holiday period back in December, we heard from the European Foreign Affairs Chief Joseph Borrell. He met with his Iranian counterpart; they discussed the nuclear talks and the nuclear deal. He said that this was a necessary meeting, but also acknowledged that relations between the two are fraught and that was, of course, in relation to the brutal and deadly crackdown that we've seen in Iran. But now we are hearing and seeing of this wave of executions taking place and there are widespread calls for the Iranian regime to be held accountable in some way or other. We've already seen sanctions being placed on Iran. We've already seen ambassador's officials being recalled by European leaders. The question now is what more can be done? What leverage does the international community hold when it comes to holding the Iranian regime to account particularly when we are hearing warnings from groups such as Amnesty International Human Rights Watch, as well as Iran HR, a human rights group based in Norway, which has been keeping a close eye on these executions. Warning that we could see several more executions in the coming days and we are seeing that number of political prisoners detained in Iran rising by the day. These protests continue.

Bear in mind that this report is extensive. But here are some of the key takeaways. First authoritarian power such as that which we've seen in Russia or Afghanistan, if left unchecked leaves behind a sea of human suffering. And the report accuses world leaders of hypocrisy and trading away human rights obligations for short term political wins. It points to U.S. President Joe Biden's meeting with Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman despite promising to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state over its human rights record. And finally, according to Human Rights Watch in a vicious cycle, it says that ignoring violations carries a heavy cost and the ripple effects should not be underestimated. That's not to say that 2022 was without progress and hope. The report says it revealed a shift in power in the world that opens the way for all concerned governments to push back against these abuses. Well, joining us now live is the Acting Director of Human Rights Watch Tirana Hassan.
