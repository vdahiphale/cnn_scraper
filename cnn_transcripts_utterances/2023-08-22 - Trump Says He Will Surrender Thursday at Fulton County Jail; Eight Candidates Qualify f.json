And these are agreements, to be clear, between the D.A. and the individual defendants that have now been signed off by the judge.There're two components to each of these release agreements. The first of it is a cash bond. Donald Trump has agreed to a $200,000 cash bond. He doesn't have to write a check for $200,000. That's just in case he doesn't show. John Eastman has an agreement for $100,000. Kenneth Cheseboro, another attorney, $100,000. Ray Smith, $50,000. Scott Hall, $10,000. Expect to hear about more of these agreements being reached throughout the day. Now, the second part of these bail release agreements, which are I think more complicated here, restrictions on communications. The judge has entered an order, Donald Trump has agreed it to, that he cannot threaten or intimidate any co-defendants, any witnesses or any victims. And, interestingly, for Donald Trump, it specifies use of social media, including not just posting but reposting. And Donald Trump has been on a bit of a bender the last three weeks or so starting with this infamous Truth Social and many that followed that we won't re-circulate here that are much more specific and direct. And so there's a question about how are prosecutors going to police this. I think they're going to be looking for posts directed at a specific individual and they're specifically tied to this case. But keep in mind, Donald Trump does have First Amendment rights. He's allowed to talk about the case and he is in the middle of a campaign. So, we'll see how this gets policed.",

By the way, if anyone does not surrender by then, that enables the D.A. to send out cops, law enforcement, to go make an arrest. I think everyone will comply with this.Important difference here from what we've seen before. In the past, the surrenders have happened in the courthouses. This surrender that we'll seeing tomorrow and into the future will happen at the Fulton County Jail. Now, they're not going to be locked up. They're not going to be in cells or general population, but they are going to have to go through the processing at the jail. That will involve a search, typically medical screening, fingerprints. And then the mug shot, we're going to a question mark there because we don't know for sure. The sheriff has said, yes, we will take a mug shot of Donald Trump unless we're told otherwise. Georgia law actually requires mug shots for all felonies. If there is a mug shot of Donald Trump, very likely we will see it publicly fairly quickly given Georgia law. The other thing that's really important in the prior cases, the same day as the processing, there's been a court appearance. Here, there's not going to be a court appearance until sometime down the line which will be set by the judge in this case.",

You have for the kind of Republican base, that built-in support, that built-in trust of Donald Trump. And the feeling among some that he should be frankly treated as an incumbent, as the kind of heir to the nomination. And that is, I think, a large slice of the Republican electorate.But we consistently see him polling in kind of 50 percent of folks who are looking for an alternative, the type of people who might have liked what Donald Trump did but think that he has some baggage that might make him a less electable candidate. That's who those are kind of alternatives are trying to appeal to in this next debate. The problem for them is that that's not the majority of the Republican voters. There's still that huge group of people, as the focus group points to, as our reporting points to, that really kind of back him on this decision. Now, I think to Governor Christie's point, we don't know if that's going to last, right? If he takes some damage in this next debate, if he's someone who looks kind of increasingly weakened maybe from the trials, I could see Donald Trump coming back to use these platforms. We know he is not someone who shirks from any spotlight. But as of right now, because voters aren't going to pay -- because voters aren't imposing an electoral penalty on him for skipping it, I think that is really giving him the backing to be able to say, okay, maybe not this first debate, maybe not the second debate, I might come to the third one.",

      "sentences": "I mean, I think that there's a risk of that because so much of the DeSantis strategy has been kind of telegraphed for this debate. But I think Donald Trump is someone who enjoys a kind of known quantity aspect here, because people expect him to hit back at every moment.You know, Republican -- the Republican base is ready to excuse every new Trump action when you talk to voters over and over. They have a kind of built-in answer ready for you to say, if he says something you don't like, if he does something you don't like, it's okay because I know kind of his heart, right? That's the kind of advantage that the other candidates don't really have. And so this debate will be a chance for them to introduce and kind of create that sense of familiarity. I think what we see on stage with kind of Trump's absence speaks to the most electoral impact that could come from this because, really, this -- we have not seen much evidence that this is a competitive primary just yet. What would make it a competitive primary is if someone coalesces those kind of non-Trump alternatives. So, I think we're really going to see a fight amongst the folks on stage to really emerge as that Donald Trump alternative. You have Tim Scott, someone who is performing a little better in Iowa, who kind of sees his chances improving. You have someone like Ramaswamy who's made the kind of Trump laying his own. But I think Governor DeSantis is going to be in a tough spot because he is someone who has the name recognition, who has the fundraising, who has the apparatus as that number two, but those other candidates are not feeling deferential or not feeling very scared of his kind of campaign performance. So, he's going to have that pressure but he also has to perform because, you know, that two spot is up for grabs both with donors and with voters.",
