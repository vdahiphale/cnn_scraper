All we can say is what his team inside Russia have told us that they've searched and they've gone to two penal colonies, and he's not there. And then the question of, why now? Some speculate that because he is the most prominent, the most articulate and most followed, and the most internationally renowned opposition figure inside Russia, President Putin did not want him around and able to communicate with his following when he announced that he's going to seek a fifth term. And did not want a Navalny need to do his usual, quote unquote, spoilers, because he will be out there telling the Russian people why Putin is anti-democratic waging what he would call an illegal war against Ukraine, and basically doing what he always does.Now, Navalny has been in this penal colony for a while. He was sentenced to 11.5 years the first time and then another 19 years. He has been poisoned. The Russians deny it. The government denies it. But he was discovered to have been poisoned in about 2020 with Novichok, which is the same nerve agent that was used to poison two expat Russians here in the U.K., former spy and his daughter, the Skripals. And so his life is very, very precarious. And his safety is very, very precarious. I asked him directly why now that he was free outside Russia, why he wanted to go back to Russia, given the fact that Putin's government wants to silence him. This was a few years ago. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's the reason why ours -- the whole country is degrading. He's the reason why people are so poor. We have 25 million people living below the poverty line, and the whole degradation of system.

Zelenskyy was already set to be traveling to Argentina over the weekend for the inauguration of the president there. And since he was sitting the same hemisphere thought, it was a good idea to come here to Washington at this time. They decided to move forward with that trip at a time when that nearly $60 billion in funding for Ukraine are remains in limbo up on Capitol Hill.Now Zelenskyy will be here at the White House tomorrow afternoon. But he starts his day up in Congress, meeting with lawmakers. There will be a briefing with the full Senate and then a one on one meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson. Zelenskyy, a White House official argued to me this morning is really the best advocate for his own country and is hoping to be able to make this personal appeal to lawmakers to approve this aid. But that personal appeal doesn't necessarily guarantee that Republicans will get on board with passing this additional U.S. assistance from -- for Ukraine. Some Republicans have wanted the administration to outline a bit more of the path forward in Ukraine. And then there's also the issue of border policy as some Republicans are insisting that any aid for Ukraine or Israel also include changes to border policy in this country. Senators have been working for weeks trying to see if they could reach some type of agreement on that front. President Biden himself last week said that he is open to some changes when it comes to border policy. But there's very clearly a very tough road ahead. Lawmakers are set to depart at the end of the week. It's unclear whether they'll be able to get -- come together on that border piece. And the White House has been warning that time is running out to get more aid to Ukraine. Zelenskyy is expected to make that personal appeal, urging lawmakers to pass that assistance as he's here tomorrow.",

And one of the things that's happened since the last Des Moines register poll is some candidates have dropped out of the race, people wondering, oh, you know, get that one-on-one matchup with Donald Trump or fewer candidates.
