And tonight, first OUTFRONT, the mothers of Russian soldiers speaking out as Putin threatens to launch more of his newest missiles, hypersonic ones. And McDonald's is about to debut a new value menu after customers have been revolting over high prices. So what are the actual savings? This is pretty fascinating. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news on two fronts right now, CNN learning that Trump's pick for director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was on a government watch list this year as \"The Washington Post\" reports, the Trump plans to fire his entire team or the entire team that worked with special counsel Jack Smith. Well, let's start first with Gabbard, because sources are telling CNN that Gabbard was placed on the list because of her overseas travel pattern and foreign connections. Now, we don't yet know where Gabbard traveled or who she met with to prompt the alert, but we do know she has a history of siding with America's enemies. I mean, so much so that Russian state television celebrated when Trump picked her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLGA SKABEEVA, RUSSIAN TV HOST (through translator): She from day one clarified the reasons for Russia's special operation in Ukraine, criticizing the actions of the Biden administration.

And you hear Zach reporting the details and what the algorithm picked up the matching with the national security information that they would have had. What's your reaction? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): I wasn't surprised at all, Erin. I've had questions since the very first moment I heard that Tulsi Gabbard was nominated because she has a long history of affinity towards autocrats and dictators, the traveling to Syria, to making pro-Putin and pro- Syrian propaganda videos and interviews, some very disturbing conduct over the last couple of years. So it didn't surprise me at all. And, frankly, this is why you vet people, right? You know, Donald Trump has a history of just doing things impulsively. And some people say they like it, right? They look at his rallies and they say, oh, he speaks his mind. He's authentic. You know, he just acts by his gut and that might -- might make for a good political rally. But when you're talking about the national security of the United States and the person who is supposed to be in charge of our entire intelligence community, it's very dangerous.",

So he is putting the architect of Project 2025 in a central position to enact the agenda of Project 2025, and that's everything from federal abortion bans to weaponizing the military for his culture wars.

When did you pay for a ticket? How often are you traveling, where to and when are you coming back? And then and then there's randomness. There's other features.

Like this is one of the things that we have to just sort of keep our -- our focus on which figure out, oh, did they have this communication with the Russians or does she like, you know, the Syrians? It's just -- there's so much stuff about her that that it's -- like it shouldn't be this close.

So do you think something just recently happened that would have prompted this?RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: It does sound as though it would be more recent activity, more recent travel than something that happened way back in 2017, that that could be a data point. But the interesting part of this is the people who know this are inside the U.S. government. And the only way in which we would be able to find this out for Congress's purposes is through a background check. It kind of cries out for an FBI background check, the idea that the Trump transition team is hiring private companies to do background checks, they're never going to be able to find out what were the reasons that the alerts went off for the algorithm to identify her as a risk.",

We got rare access to an event in Moscow honoring the mothers of Russian soldiers battling in what the Kremlin still calls its special military operation -- mothers whose sons are fighting have been killed or injured. Oksana Medvedeva son Yegor (ph), was severely wounded on the battlefield earlier this year. He had surgery on his leg and the nerves had to be sewn back together, she says he also had surgery on his jaw, but it still has not recovered properly. He is still being treated. I am proud of my son that he is such a hero. While the Russians have been making significant battlefield gains recently, they appear to come at a heavy price. Moscow doesn't publish casualty figures, but Western governments believe the attrition rate among Russian forces is significant. To increase manpower, the U.S. and Ukraine say more than 11,000 North Korean troops are now also on Moscow's side mostly in Russia's Kursk region. Yelina Melina (ph) son Mikhail is still fighting in Ukraine. She won't say where, but acknowledges for him it's tough. He went through a lot of moments he doesn't like to talk about, she says. But I found out by chance I think he's a true hero. The U.S. and its allies continue to condemn Russia's president, urging him to withdraw from Ukraine immediately. But this week instead, a major escalation, after the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer distance, U.S. and U.K. supplied missiles to strike deep inside Russia, Putin hit back with a new intermediate range ballistic missile capable of delivering devastating nuclear warheads and he threatened to hit U.S. assets as well. We should we consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our objects, he said. Back at the event for soldiers' mothers, a Russian parliamentarian backing Putin up We are a strong country and we've been patient for a long time, she said. But in the case of mass deaths of our people, if the collective West does not sober up, we should proceed to more decisive actions. We can no longer lose any of our men. But for now, the battles continue to escalate and the losses continue to mount, as Vladimir Putin warns the struggle between Russia and the West. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Erin, tonight, more threats coming from the Russians against the U.S. and its allies.
