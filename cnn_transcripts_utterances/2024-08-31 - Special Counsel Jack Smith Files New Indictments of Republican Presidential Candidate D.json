I'm Alex Marquardt, in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour with the legal showdown in former President Trump's election subversion case. A new late-night filing last night setting the stage for a potentially contentious hearing next week in D.C.'s federal court, where a judge will decide how and when the case will move forward. The standoff comes as Special Counsel Jack Smith resurrected the January 6th case against Trump with a new superseding indictment this week. Both Trump's lawyers and the special counsel are at odds about how this this case should now proceed. Trump's team is pushing for his schedule that would carry the pretrial disputes through the beginning of next year, long after the 2024 election. CNN's Holmes Lybrand is covering these legal developments and joins me now. So Holmes, where do things stand now?",

      "sentences": "That's right. So I kind of want to rewind a little bit to July when the Supreme Court granted Trump this sweeping immunity on presidential actions. And because of that, as you mentioned, Jack Smith earlier this week, he filed a new superseding indictment. This superseding indictment focuses on Trump's actions as a candidate. It focuses on his actions as a private citizen.So going forward, as you mentioned last night, there was a fire knowing that both of the parties got to kind of say their piece about how they want to move forward. Now, Trump gave a very detailed schedule of how he thinks this case can move forward. It would push everything past January and to after the inauguration then, and maybe even into the spring of 2025, possibly even into the fall. Now, Special Counsel Jack Smith approached it a bit differently. He didn't offer dates, but instead he offered an expedited way of going about this where they could handle different motions and different issues like the immunity issue together, kind of parallel. These are just very different ways of approaching the case, and all of this will go back to the judge, as we mentioned next week. They will have a hearing. Both of these parties before Judge Tanya Chutkan where she'll get to parse out how they want to move forward. I know from speaking with multiple attorneys who have practiced before her that she likes to move fast. As you mentioned, as you'll remember, this case was actually scheduled for March of this year before the immunity stuff kind of gummed up the whole system. And she likes to move fast. We'll see if she can or how she views the case, hopefully next week.",

Vice President Kamala Harris slamming Donald Trump for saying that he will vote no on an amendment to Florida's abortion law. The amendment is on the ballot this November, and if enough Florida voters vote no, that would pave the way for the six-week abortion ban to stay in effect. The former president appeared to flipflop on this divisive issue in recent days. Earlier this week, he seemed to indicate that he planned to overturn the ban when he casts his ballot in Florida in November. Yesterday, he reversed course again. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks. I've disagreed with that right from the early primaries. When I heard about it, I disagreed with it. At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation that you can do an abortion in the ninth month. And, you know, some of the states, like Minnesota and other states have it where you can actually execute the baby after birth. And all of that stuff is unacceptable. So I'll be voting no for that reason. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And one of those debates, the CNN debate, which was conducted, as we all know, is where the rules were put in play, where the microphone will be turned off when a candidate is speaking. So ABC is following similar rules, but the now Harris campaign wants the microphones to be turned on. And they've been needling former President Donald Trump on this, because although the Trump campaign behind the scenes is saying we do not want this, the rules should stay as they were in June, the former president then himself saying on the trail this week that he doesn't really care either way. And so the vice president this morning needling him on that, saying, quote, \"If his own team doesn't have confidence in him, the American people definitely can't,\" sort of pushing him to also agree to having the microphones on. But certainly, this is a strategic play in some ways, because there was a moment in 2020 during the vice presidential debate where the vice president said, I'm speaking when then the vice presidential nominee, Mike Pence tried to interrupt, or was speaking. So this is an opportunity for her in the debate. And of course, every campaign is going to try to strategize this so that their candidate can look best.

We can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequences.

If she can deliver that, again, each question, bringing it back to that core message, she'll do great.And I think the whole debate and discussion about the microphones, right, is their hope that Donald Trump will keep doing what Donald Trump does. He's not doing so well right now. By all accounts, the polls, he's slipped. She's either tied or ahead and all the swing states. He can see the polls. He's starting to run scared.

SZUPLATWhat he thrives on is just throwing 1,000 things at his opponents and hoping they'll get disoriented and discombobulated, and again, get knocked off the message and the story that they're trying to tell the voters. So he's done that over and over. I think there was a really telling moment in the interview the other day where she was asked about his comments, about her suddenly becoming black, and that's clearly an attempt to turn this conversation into a big conversation about race in America. She wasn't going to have it. She wasn't going to play. She said next question, please. So she can do that in a debate. I think that will work to her advantage.",

But certainly, right now they will be trying to administer the first of these doses in those three areas, as I say, starting with the central part of the Gaza Strip on Sunday. And then on the assumption that it all goes smoothly, there will be hope that look, they've managed to do it once and avoid shooting at each other in those designated areas when the vaccination campaign is taking place. So there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do it again. But as I said, I think in the first instance, they will just be happy to get the campaign off. It's going to be three three-day pauses in the central part of the Gaza Strip, then the southern part, then the northern part over the first 12 days of September.

The sheriff also told WAPT the bus turned over on its side, leading to passengers being trapped. Six passengers were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash that happened near Bovina over 30 miles west of Jackson. A seventh passenger died in the hospital according to highway patrol. Another 37 people were injured. We also have learned that some of those who died were children. According to the Warren County coroner, siblings aged six and 16 are among the victims. Tow truck driver Keith Allison told CNN affiliate WAPT it took a long time for authorities to recover some of the victims because the bus ended up in a ditch and many passengers were ejected.

Officials say that the waterline failed after a series of breaks, forcing a sudden shutdown of overnight hotel stays. Park officials say that water restrictions will run throughout Labor Day when and hotels are near or at capacity.I'm joined now by Danyelle Khmara. She's a senior reporter covering border issues for Arizona public media. Danyelle, thanks so much for joining me. You've also reported on the pipeline for the podcast \"TAPS.\" And since 2010, there have been more than 85 major breaks. So when this happens, how does this impact the park?",

Typically, people that are visiting the park don't even realize when the pipeline has a break, and its more businesses that are within the park might have to revert to using disposable plates, constrict their water a bit. But typically, visitors to the park don't realize when these breaks happen.",

So like I said, typically all but the businesses in part with a normal break, which they happen quite often, typically, what they have to do is just go to disposable plates and stuff like that. But that's also businesses and hotels that are within the park. So having a restriction like this where the hotels are closed to visitors staying overnight is quite rare. But the hotels and the businesses that are outside of the park that are still quite close driving to the park shouldn't really be affected. The only reason why those businesses would be affected would be, say, if tourists were to cancel their plans and then there would be an economic impact to the surrounding area. But otherwise, the surrounding areas, the surrounding cities and hotels, they're' on a different water system. So tourists, hopefully, can still change their plans and find a place to stay in the surrounding area.",

So we're not talking about a flat pipeline that typically exists in municipalities, domestic pipelines. This is a pipeline that it is built literally into the sides of cliffs. It has to endure extreme weather variations. It has to endure different types of typography, not to mention changes in environmental stewardship as well. When it was built in the 60s, like you said, the type of technology that we have today just didn't exist back then.So they are working on building a new pipeline, which is a few years into a yearslong process. And they have new technology now that, fingers crossed, this pipeline will not be experiencing all the breaks that the current one does.",

And also the current pipeline is built out of aluminum. So the new pipeline, a lot of that will be encased in steel and a lot of it will the buried so that it is not exposed to the elements. They are predicting that the project will be done in 2027. But with a project as complex as this, literally imagine helicopters bringing in supplies, workmen, workpeople repelling off cliff sides for some portions to build this, there could be some delays. So 2027 is whether shooting for, and we'll just have to see how long it takes.",
