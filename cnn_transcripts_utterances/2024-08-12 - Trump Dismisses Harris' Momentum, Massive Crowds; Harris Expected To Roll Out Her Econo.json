And there are growing tensions here in the region of an all- out potential war. We'll have all the very latest developments, very, very important developments coming up in a few moments.But first new this morning, the Trump -- Trump campaign is placing its largest ad buy of the race, at least so far. And they're getting big on two-must win swing states. We're talking about Georgia and Pennsylvania. Meantime, in the Midwest, the former president is now facing warning signs and troubling polls which show Vice President Kamala Harris now leading in the critical blue wall states by a sizable margin. The fresh wave of Democratic enthusiasm has Trump once again making outrageous claims, saying this weekend with no evidence that Kamala Harris is using artificial intelligence, AI, to create images of, quote, fake crowds. Of course, there's no truth to that. You can see right here, Harris objectively brought out big crowds at her events over the past several days. And only moments ago, the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy offered Trump some advice on how to address Paris crowd size. He simply said, don't. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Question, what did she do when she was supposed to take care of the border as a czar. Question that they brought inflation. And she was the tie breaking vote when it came to inflation, when it came to IRS agents.(END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: New polling shows that for the first time in this presidential race, Americans think the Democratic candidate will do a better job handling the nation's economy. I want to bring in CNN's Phil Mattingly. He's joining us live from Washington right now. So Phil, walk us through some of this new polling. It's pretty dramatic.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's no question about it, Wolf. And I think when you look at the battleground states, when you look at the national polling, what you're seeing is a shift based mostly on Democrats coming home. This race has become the race that I think a lot of people expected in a very polarized electorate before Joe Biden dropped out of the race and was having serious issues with that Democratic coalition over the course of several months.However, the numbers on the economy are striking, and if you're the Trump campaign or Republicans who support that campaign, very problematic. You see right there the financial term -- Times-Michigan Ross Survey, Harris at 42 Trump at 41, that is a seven point jump for the Democratic candidate since the last time the survey was taken. The first time in the nearly year that the survey has been taken, the Democratic candidate holds an advantage. Now, it's not a statistically significant advantage. Donald Trump, still, in many other polls, holds a clear advantage on the economy. But the fact that Harris is not being tagged with kind of the economic doldrums that many people had placed on President Biden for month after month after month underscores a real concern for Republicans, particularly when you look at some of those broader surveys. Take a look at some of the New York Times-Sienna polling on those swing states in each of the critical blue wall battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, while they are within the margin of error, Harris has certainly bumped up from where Biden had been with a four point lead in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If you look at the national polling from New York Times-Siena, Harris still within the margin of error, but with a lead in that polling more than anything else, showing that there has been a jump. So, Wolf, when you put all of this together, it has certainly been a good few weeks of momentum, both on fundraising, on volunteers, on polls, no question about it. What the real concern is, is on the issues that Trump has long held a very clear advantage, perhaps that gap is closing as well.",

In large part that's because she's very aligned with where President Biden, where the Biden-Harris administration has been on the economy.[11:04:58] Now, over the weekend, she did endorse, proposal first put forward by former President Trump, no tax on tips, doing that in the critical state of Nevada, where that is very important for service workers in that state, putting a very explicit guard rails on what she would want to propose, which is a little bit different from the former president. When you talk to economic advisers, though, in the White House or who have worked for the Harris team, they talk constantly on bringing costs down critical components of President Biden's agenda that did not get over the finish line during his legislative kind of burst of success in his first two years, the care economy, home care, child care, things of that nature are areas where Harris has been focused on. Expect to see proposals along those lines. And more than anything else, there's a recognition inside the campaign costs have been too high. Inflation has been very problematic. That is an area where they need to focus, want to focus. How they decide to address that, though, we're going to have to wait and see in the coming days, Wolf.",

You can read anything you want in a lot of the polling and things are fluid as we try and get our heads around a very new race, where the campaigns are spending, that's what tells the story, and where the Trump campaign is spending a $37 million ad buy and ad reservations starting this week through the election, tells you all you need to know, with millions of dollars going to states like Georgia, $23 million for Georgia, but also states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, more than $4 million.Just a few weeks ago, Wolf, Republicans were pretty confident that despite what Democrats wanted with that state, that Trump has won twice, that was pretty much going out of reach. Now, clearly spending money there trying to defend that Republican held state. But more than anything else, when you look at these numbers, the combination of the 23 million in new reservations in Georgia and now with the new Pennsylvania money in total, more than 30 million in that state. That says everything, because, Wolf, Democrats can hold on to every single state that President Biden won in 2020. But if they lose Pennsylvania and Georgia, Donald Trump ends up with exactly 270 electoral votes, and Donald Trump would be the next president of the United States. That's why the Trump campaign going very big on those two states. Wolf?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They said, oh, she had a big crowd. All had a crowd the press is talking about the crowd. In New Jersey, I had 107,000 people. The press never even talked about it, because they're fake. I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size in history for any country. Nobody's had crowds like I have. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me.

If we -- I -- I didn't know how many minutes the -- the former president spoke there, but I wish he would have spoken about Kamala Harris's policies. Let's talk about them. Let's talk -- she ran for president before. She wants to take Americans guns away. She wants a single payer healthcare system. She wants to end fracking in Pennsylvania, on and on and on. Let's talk about those things.Let's talk about the failed Biden-Harris administration that we're currently in right now. She's trying to run as an outsider, which is really the consummate Insider. She's the current Vice President of the United States, so she's trying to divorce herself from the Biden- Harris administration. Her name is on the door. Tough to do. Let's talk about those things, Mr. President. Listen, talk about the issues. If we make this about personalities or crowd size, we're going to lose and you see that in the polling. The polling currently reflects that, because we're not talking about issues that matter to Americans. Run away, inflation, a porous border, crime, failed policies, and -- and Afghanistan, the Middle East. Let's focus on those. Let's drive those home.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, first, Wolf, just going back to the clip you played at the news conference last week. That was the oldest I've ever seen Donald Trump look. He looked old. And, you know, it was a reminder that if not for Biden's performance in the June debate, we would have been talking about how disorganized and at times incoherent Donald Trump was.You know, polling has shown it was completely eclipsed, because 75 or 80 percent of Americans said they worry that Biden had lost the physical and cognitive ability to do the job. But consistently, around half or slightly more of Americans have said they also worry that Trump is too old to be president. And with Harris as the backdrop now as Biden, that is suddenly, I think, a -- a weakness and a glaring issue. And -- and that press conference really underscored it. I mean, he was really incapable of delivering a coherent message. And I mean, it's hard to say what -- what he came out there to do, other than to insult her intelligence. Now, certainly on your question, yes, he continues to, you know, frame the election as we win or they cheated. Those are the only two options out there. And in the process, he reminds voters of the other aspects of his presidency that they didn't like. His retrospective job approval has been going up against Biden because voters were measuring him, mostly by the yardstick of what they disliked about Biden, which was inflation and immigration. Primarily with Harris as the -- as the foil, the comparison is different. And when Trump does things like call preemptively, call into question the validity of the election, he reminds voters of why his approval rating never reached 50 percent at any point when he was president even though they were broadly satisfied with the economy.",

So in this election, I think Democrats didn't want to fight this election on the economy, didn't want to fight this election on the inflation.

Donald Trump has been in a couple of debates since then. She does not -- she has not been in this debate format. So I think Democrats should give her a little bit of space to have maybe a slow start.

Breaking news overnight, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has just ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East, to the eastern Mediterranean, and asked a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group to get to the region as soon as they can. All this, according to a public Pentagon statement, and it comes as Israel is bracing for what it anticipates will be a large scale attack from Iran, which could come at any moment. And as pressure is building on Israel and Hamas to return, to resume ceasefire talks later this week.Joining us now are CNN chief international editor Nic Robertson. He's here with me in Tel Aviv, along with CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier, who's in Washington and retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt.

However, others are telling me, other diplomats in the region are saying, look, there still is space for diplomacy, but it looks more tenuous at the moment. And I think that's the position we're in by bringing in the USS Georgia, this nuclear powered cruise missile capable submarine, you give the United States the ability not only to support Israel and defend Israel from Iranian strikes, but also better support and defend U.S. troops in the region in Iraq and Syria.
