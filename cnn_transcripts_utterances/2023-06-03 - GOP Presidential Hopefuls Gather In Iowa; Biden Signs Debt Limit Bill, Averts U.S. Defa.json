It's called \"The Roast and Ride\" gathering and it's hosted by Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, Republican senator in that state. The state is the first in the nation for the Republicans' nominating process. Nearly all the party's presidential candidates and likely candidates campaigned at the event which just wrapped up. Donald Trump was a prominent no-show. CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us now from Des Moines. Jeff for candidates this was a prime opportunity to mingle with a crowd of politically plugged-in caucus-goers. What was the reaction though to Trump not being there? Was that a -- an oversight on his part, do you think? Did he miss an opportunity there? What did you hear from folks?",

I mean, certainly Republican voters here, some 900 or so, were sitting for several hours watching all the speeches at Senator Joni Ernst's \"Roast and Ride\" as she calls it.In fact, we just talked to her a few moments ago. And she said she did extend an invitation to Donald Trump a few months ago. And she said it was her sense he does not like to attend multicandidate events. Translation, he does not like to be in the same room at the same time as his rivals. That's why he decided not to come today to Iowa. He was here in the state earlier this week talking to voters and holding some small meetings. But Jim, for the candidates who were here, there really was a sense of -- it was far more about the Biden administration and having Republicans win back the White House. Of course the question is which Republican is the strongest to do that. There was very little mention of Donald Trump at all. A lot of support for his policies, of course, but it was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who decided to fly back to Iowa, after being here a couple of days earlier, who met the crowd. He, of course, is trying to turn this into a two-person race. It's not quite there just yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTSI (R-FL): I think American decline is a choice. And I'm running for president because I think if we choose another path we can restore American greatness. And that is the task that's before us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

His wife was with him, one of his children was, as well. So this was a chance for Republicans to make their case, begin making their case for this field is getting much larger. By next week, ten Republican candidates will be in this race. And just doing the math on that, that certainly advantages Donald Trump because he has a base of supporters here. But Jim, when you talk to voters, several have sort of fond memories of the Trump policies, but many are looking for a different personality. So that, of course, is the central question hanging over this entire Republican race. Will enough voters move away from him, or will he sort of run away with it. Again, Iowa, of course, is the first stop on the nominating process. That comes in the wintertime, likely in January, Jim.",

Recall just last week we were talking about that breakthrough between President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy when they reached that tentative agreement. Now a week later, and just moments ago this afternoon, President Biden signed the debt ceiling bill into law. And during those remarks, President Biden did give a shout out to Kevin McCarthy saying that he commended him and that these were good faith negotiations. Now of course the White House has faced criticism from its own allies on the left who said that there shouldn't have been negotiations to begin with or concessions. But as you heard there from President Biden, the White House line here has been that not everyone was going to get what they wanted. And the other part of this too, is we're seeing President Biden take that victory lap. For weeks we had not heard much from the White House, hearing mostly from Republicans as the negotiations were under way.

Well, officers made their way inside the home and found that murder/suicide scene. Per the Bristol County D.A., the preliminary evidence right now is that Scott killed his son -- again, 8 years old -- with what's being described as a sharp object before taking his own life. Now, there's a back story on Scott here. The Bristol County D.A. had been actively investigating the March, 2019 disappearance of Dante's mother, Lisa Hazard. The 28-year-old was last seen leaving Scott's home where this murder/suicide happened on her way to a drug rehabilitation program back in 2019. That's per her missing persons report. And she was never seen or heard from since. And then it was just two weeks ago that investigators actually served a search warrant at that home in New Bedford, Massachusetts. However, if anything came out of that or even the warrant itself, that is still under seal. So we don't know much. But the investigation is ongoing, and we understand that Scott was, quote, a person of interest in the disappearance of that woman. So that case is still moving forward. And meanwhile as you mentioned, Scott is the son of the late Major League Baseball player George \"Boomer\" Scott, per the district attorney's office. He played in the late 60s, in the 70s as well and he died in 2013. Again, just an absolutely heartbreaking story right now that's unfolding in Massachusetts.

Another line that you've heard sometimes with respect to Donald Trump is, well, if he had classified documents, it's the same as if he robbed a bank and had the money or if he had drugs. That is dead wrong, as well, because you have to prove that the person had knowledge and intent. If that was true, if it was like a drug case or a bank robbery, then automatically Biden and Pence and Trump would all be guilty of a crime, but they're not because it's all about knowledge, it's all about intent.

I think it's widely embraced.When you look at how careful this bipartisan group of experts has come together to make recommendations, how careful they've been about really renaming these bases after real true heroes. True heroes to our country, not people who fought against our country, but true heroes who have made our country better and stronger. There's a lot of enthusiasm about the new names of these bases, even though there are, of course, some people nostalgic for the old ones. This change is long overdue. There's a lot of support from the military itself. And so it's -- it's heartening and encouraging to see it finally come to pass.",

When I think that service -- and I think this speaks of the vast majority of servicemembers -- they weren't thinking about Fort Bragg, the man or whatever his ills were during the Civil War. They were thinking about our camaraderie, what we had endured together, what that service at that base meant in terms of what we learned, in terms of discipline and leadership and followership and teamwork and the units that are stationed there, the 82nd Airborne, and others, and the Special Forces. I think all of those things are what comes to mind. From the communities -- I saw a lot of pushback in the communities of saying this is unnecessary, let's focus on having our tanks, planes, and ships flying safely or operating safely, and having the best trained military to defend the nation. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to move forward. I just thought it was a bit of an unnecessary distraction. The community often opposed it. And it's just -- I just don't think this is what most soldiers in this modern day were worried about or thinking about as they thought about their service.",

You're in harm's way together. You're focused on taking care of the men and women to your left and your right and accomplishing the mission. So we have to be careful about constantly highlighting our differences rather than what unites us. And I think this is just going -- taking us back in time to an era that not really many people are very focused on until we kind of force it in front of them. When I'm talking to soldiers and veterans who served at Fort Benning or Fort Bragg or Fort Gordon, many don't know who the person was. They do know their fellow soldiers that served with them. They know the pride in their unit and service. And you know, fine, we did it, we'll move forward.

Lots of people see things they don't understand. I think this is an actually good opportunity to combine citizen science with data from radar, from the FAA, data from commercial and scientific satellites that NASA operates.
