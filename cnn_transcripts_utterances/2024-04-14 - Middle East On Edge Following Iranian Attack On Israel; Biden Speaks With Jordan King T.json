The United Nations Security Council will hold that emergency meeting following Iran's significant attack against Israel. Israel Defense Forces now say Iran and their proxy forces in Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon launched around 350  rockets and missiles into Israel overnight, most of them shot down before they could do any damage. But these attacks are threatening to escalate and already volatile, very dangerous situation in the Middle East. Today, Israel's War Cabinet met to go over options for a response to Iran's unprecedented first-ever direct attack on Israel from Iran. Cabinet Member Benny Gantz vowing Israel \"will exact a price from Iran. President Biden meeting with other G7 leaders virtually looking for a diplomatic path forward. CNN has our correspondents around the globe covering all of these late breaking developments for us. It is a rapidly developing situation that is unfolding right now in the Middle East. And I want to start with Jeremy Diamond. He is joining us from Jerusalem. Right now, Jeremy,  what are you hearing from officials there about today's War Cabinet meeting?",

      "sentences": "Well Wolf, Israel's War Cabinet met for nearly five hours today. The topic of discussion was of course, to focus on how Israel will respond to this unprecedented large-scale attack that Iran launched against Israel in the early hours of this morning, more than 300 missiles and drones directed at Israel, and although only a few of those ballistic missiles actually made it through Israel and the United States air defense assets in the region hitting an Israeli air base and causing what the Israeli military has described as light damage.Despite that, the Israeli government and its military have vowed that they will respond no matter what. The question now, Wolf, is the scale and the scope of that response going to be? And despite the nearly five hours of deliberations, I am told that the Israeli War Cabinet meeting ended today without a clear decision about exactly how Israel will respond. Instead, the Israeli million military has been tasked with coming up with additional military options for the Israeli War Cabinet to consider. But in the meantime, we are hearing from some members of Israel's government, including the former Defense minister, a member of the War Cabinet, Benny Gantz, who has said that Israel will \"exact a price from Iran\" in a way and time that suits us. The Israeli Prime Minister is also already coming under pressure from his right wing, including the Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of them saying that the Israeli response should be firm with Ben-Gvir saying, Israel should \"go crazy\" in its military response against Iran. Iran for its part has said that its attack against Israel has been concluded. They have described it as retaliation for that Israeli strike that took out a senior Iranian commander in an Iranian consular building in Damascus, but they have said that if Israel carries out an attack on Iran, then Iran will once again retaliate, a very dangerous back-and-forth, Wolf that could quickly escalate.",

The Turks passed that message on to the Americans and obviously, it ended up, so the Israelis were aware as well.And it really wasn't a huge surprise that it happened given how much talk about it, proceeded attacks. We know that the Iranian foreign minister in the preceding days was in touch with many of his counterparts across, for instance, the Persian Gulf region as well. And in the aftermath of last night's strikes, what we are seeing is that there was a really sharp intake of breath across the region for many of the regime's that are very concerned about the spread of the conflict from Gaza well beyond there. [15:05:01] You have, for instance, a lot of popular anger at Arab regimes that have condemned Israel, but really done little else to help the people of Gaza, so what we heard, for instance, is King Abdullah had a conversation  with President Joe Biden in which he said that the best solution to avoiding an escalation, avoiding perhaps even a regional war is to stop the Gaza war immediately. And I think the impression of most of the leaders in the region is that the United States does have the wherewithal, the influence over Israel to actually make that happen. And certainly the events of last night really underscore the need for some sort of calming down of this situation, not just between Iran and Israel, but the heart of the matter, which of course is the war in Gaza -- Wolf.",

There doesn't seem to be an agreement even though we saw William Burns, the head of the CIA, coming to the region, meeting with Qatari, Egyptian officials, Israeli officials, trying to work something out, but it appears yet again, after months of trying, these negotiations are not bearing any fruit.Now, for instance, Hamas says they simply cannot come up with 40 hostages that fit the categories that the Israelis are looking for. Women, children, the elderly. They say that until there is some sort of cessation of hostilities in Gaza, at least temporarily, they are not even a people to find out who is where as far as the hostage is concerned, who is holding those hostages. So a ceasefire regardless, an unconditional ceasefire would perhaps prepare the grounds for a breakthrough on the issue of the hostages, on the issue of the more than 8,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. But certainly, the desire, the demand of regimes across the region is that the war in Gaza, six months, almost 34,000 people dead, the war has got to stop.",

But of course, Wolf, the focus here at the White House is trying to contain the risk of a wider regional conflict.This has been front and center on the minds of US officials here since those October 7 terrorist attacks. Now, President Biden did meet with the G7 leaders today in a call that was meant to \"coordinate a united diplomatic response.\" The key word there is diplomatic. During that call, they talked about -- and they put an emphasis on non-military actions, and US officials have since described the call as constructive, but they wouldn't provide details as to what actions specifically were discussed. But what is the resounding message from that and also from the White House is that the US will not participate in a response with Israel in terms of any retaliation against Iran. In fact, in the call that the president had with the Israeli Prime Minister last night, the president made clear that the US will not participate in any offensive action against Iran. Instead, advising the Israeli prime minister to think strategically and carefully about his next steps. Now, the US assessment here is that Israel was largely successful. They were able to defend themselves and there was no major damage to infrastructure within Israel. Take a listen to what National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby had to say about last night's attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: If you think about what they threw at Israel, several hundred drones and missiles over the course of a few hours, and what damage did they cause? Not very much. I mean, it was an incredible effort by Israel, but also it shows that Iran is not the military power weight that they claimed now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's discuss what is going on right now with Democratic  Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. Give us your perspective because you're well plugged in. How unprecedented was this Iranian attack against Israel? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Wolf, we've never seen anything like it. Certainly, we don't remember a time when Iran launched attacks directly from its soil onto Israeli soil. Now, thankfully, President Biden, working with our regional partners, including the Jordanians, were able to shoot down most of these missiles and drones before they did damage, but what i would say is that at this point, we should focus most of our attention on the national security supplemental sitting before Congress because right now, somebody else said the other day, \"A Churchill or Chamberlain moment.\" Either we stand up to aggressors from Tehran, to Moscow, to Beijing and deter aggression and pass the supplemental or we appease them, and that is at stake in Congress, and so that is what we have to do there. And then finally, I would just say that the parties have to be forced to the table and we have to come to an immediate halt to hostilities linked to hostages being returned and massive humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip.",

And we, in the US will also have the space, so to speak, to pass the National Security supplemental. Any kind of escalation, any kind of wider war or hostilities there will make it harder, not easier for us to do the work that we need to do in Washington. And so I would just respectfully request our friends to not escalate and take this to a wider regional war that could spiral out-of- control, instead, allow us to do our work past the national security supplemental help fund the David's Sling, the Arrow Program, the Iron Dome Programs, which proved so successful last night in defeating those missile attacks.",

And so from that moment on, what happened about 10 days ago, the US and its allies, they were really preparing for a significant retaliation by the Iranians and they prepared as such, they moved assets, and what were told is that the Destroyers that were moved to the Mediterranean, they in fact did intercept a number of ballistic missiles between four and six according to a senior military official and US aircraft, both on land and on sea, that took off by land and by sea, they also shot down more than 70 drones and a patriot battery, which is that sophisticated air defense system the US has really all over the world, that also took out one of the ballistic missiles. So by and large, Israel's own air defense system, the Arrow Defense System, that really was very productive to say the least. It took out the vast majority according to military officials of those ballistic missiles that were incoming, but the US military, the UK, other allies in the region, they were also extremely active last night in helping Israel take this out. And so it is that kind of firepower that you're going to continue to see really stay in the region and help the Israelis.",

It was a risky operation, but it did not escalate any further.

This cycle can continue and spiral out of control.And also, Wolf, take another real concern into consideration, which I am sure is on the top of the mind of the many decision-makers in the Biden administration, which is that if Israel indeed attacks Iran on its own soil, it will clearly demonstrate that Iran's regional deterrence and its conventional military capabilities have not been able to secure Iran. And that means that Iran would start looking for alternatives and given how close Iran is to the verge of nuclear weapons, it might seek an alternative in the ultimate deterrent, which only comes in the form of nuclear weapons and that would make a region that is already in so much turmoil that much more dangerous",

Do you currently follow any anti-Trump group or organization on any social media site? Do you have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case?

It's expected to last six to eight weeks. So law enforcement really on a state, local, and federal level, needs to have this delicate balance of protecting the public, the former president, while also allowing business as usual.

Let's get some analysis from Suzanne Maloney right now. She is the vice president and director of Foreign Policy at the Brookings Institute here in Washington, a think tank.

There has been a lot of violence over the years, but typically has taken place either coming from proxies of Iran such as Hezbollah or it has taken place on other grounds, especially in Syria, where Israel has attacked Iranian targets in the past. Iran has never struck Israel proper, although it has certainly aimed at Israeli diplomatic facilities and other targets all around the world. And so we are very much in, I think a new stage of this war and one that is extremely dangerous for the region and for the rest of the world.",

Whatever their feelings on the war in Gaza or on the broader question of Arab-Israeli peace, Iranians are tired of war. They are tired of the conflict and differences that their government has with the rest of the world and they are quite eager for a more normal situation in their own country as well as in the wider region.The leadership of course, sees it very differently, since coming to power in 1979 on the heels of an Islamic Revolution. Tehran and the Iranian leadership has very much been oriented toward at animosity toward the West, but especially toward the United States and Israel. This is a precarious moment, of course, because Iran's Supreme Leader is 85 years old. He is likely to be passing from the scene over the course of several years and Iran will have to go through a succession process. And so that leadership too does not want war, but of course it feeds on the hostility and the conflict and the antagonism with the West and especially with Israel.",
