I mean, it has been since October 7. I mean, we are three -- four months later here.And there not only are there over a hundred innocent civilians inside Gaza -- we believe inside Gaza, are from all over the world, mostly Israel. There are also those six Americans. And part of the toing and froing now is as it was always, Wolf, about Hamas and what Hamas wants in exchange for that when it comes to its prisoners inside Israel, but it's also about the length of the ceasefire. And as that relates to what Israel wants to do, which is go into southern Gaza, go into Rafah, and clear out the rest of the tunnels underneath. And also they hope to clear out the rest of the leadership of Hamas.",

They want to have buffer zones.Just that alone is the opposite of what the U.S. wants. The U.S. wants Gaza to remain an independent nation, an independently run area, and they want the Palestinian Authority to maintain control. That is not what Prime Minister Netanyahu wants. So, this is -- it's a big question mark as to when they get there to whatever post-war is. And whenever it is, but also what it looks like is already a big part of the discussion.",

Former President Trump and his sons just filed an appeal on that massive civil fraud judgment in New York. We have details just to ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:52:08] BLITZER: New this morning. Donald Trump, his adult sons, and two former Trump Organization officials are now appealing the $464 million judgment in the New York civil fraud case. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is with me here right now in the NEWSROOM. Paula, what can you tell us about this?",

They believe it was unfair.They've always believed this entire case was unfair. They believe it was politically motivated, and that he did not commit fraud because there was no victim. All the banks and insurance companies went home happy. But, Wolf, it's unclear that that's really going to be a winning argument on appeal. Moments ago, one of his lawyers, Alina Habba, issued this statement saying we trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious fine, and take the necessary steps to restore the public faith in New York's legal system. But again, if you look at the opinion here, the verdict, it's very detailed and it's unclear what basis in law the Trump team thinks they're going to be able to overturn this case on. Now, the other question, Wolf, is how he's going to come up with the cash. He either has to post cash or post a bond while this appeal is going forward. And it's unclear if he has enough in his coffers to cover this.",

One from Florida and one from Texas because both of those states have passed laws restricting the ability that social media companies have to moderate what is on their platform.Now, the states have argued that social media is the new public square. And you should have something akin to a First Amendment right on those platforms. Of course, the First Amendment right, we all know, that's about the government infringing on your First Amendment. You don't currently have protections for businesses moderating what you do on their platforms. So, an organization has sued to block both of these laws, saying, look, you can't do this. And this could potentially have unintended consequences. Because if these social media companies, Wolf, they cannot restrict in any way what's on their platform, we're talking about hate speech, threats against judges, and misinformation about the election. It was interesting a short time ago, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, she focused on of all things, et Cie, and why they need to control what's on their platform. Let's take a listen to what she said.
