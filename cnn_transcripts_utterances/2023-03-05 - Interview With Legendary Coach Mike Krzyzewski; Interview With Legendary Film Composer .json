So when they get a shot with 2.1 seconds, you have to call a timeout at that second when the clock doesn't stop. So our guys called a timeout but they're at the other end of the court, and I met them as they were coming to the bench and I was saying then we're going to win.And I asked Grant Hill, can you throw the ball 75 feet? Now we ran the same play a few weeks earlier at Wake Forest and Grant Hill threw a curveball that almost hit a lady in the stands, not in the end zone, but on the side, so I was basically saying, can you throw it? And Grant will tell you that when he said yes, he felt like he already did it. And then Christian, I looked at him and I said if I bring you up to the baseline, will you catch the ball? And we had a couple options. And he then, and only his unique way because he's such a great competitor, he said, Coach, if Grant throws a good pass, I'll catch it. And I wanted to say, you promise? You know. I -- and when we left, when we left the bench, I thought we had a chance and that's what happens when you have that period of time that you are with -- look, we had a great team and Grant did throw a great pass. Christian had the courage to take that one dribble to get good momentum and then he hit it and that shows you, though, Chris, how hard it is to win that tournament because if he misses, we don't win our second national championship. And sometimes it's one play like that, not necessarily in the game for the championship, that puts you in a position to win. That's why I think it's the toughest tournament in sport to win.",
