U.S. President Joe Biden arriving to meet Germany's President and Chancellor and to receive one of Germany's top honors too as he leaves the White House soon.Later they'll be joined by the French and British leaders. The agenda expected to feature discussions on the path to a ceasefire in Lebanon, a resolution to the of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as well, particularly after the death of the leader of Hamas. The leaders are also expected to discuss how to put Kyiv in the strongest position possible, going into the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. Officials getting ahead of things there. That's a gathering of 57 countries supporting Ukraine's military efforts that meets every few months. We'll bring you any headlines that come out of the meeting but we are currently awaiting the President to leave the car. You can see they're lined up there but the German President will need to be there to greet him as well. So they'll be getting into position as well and then the U.S. President. But as I say there are key meetings later on today particularly between Germany, France, U.K. and the U.S. who are allied with their efforts in relation to Ukraine and the Middle East. Now officials and experts are now analyzing what may come next of Hamas after the death of its leader Yahya Sinwar. Senior Israeli officials say Sinwar's brother, if he survived this week, could continue the group's hardline negotiating contacts -- tactics rather. U.S. officials are optimistic that President Joe Biden and Israel's Prime Minister are more closely aligned on a diplomatic resolution after Sinwar's death. And more now from CNN's Nic Robertson. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Once dubbed by the IDF a dead man walking, the IDF says these are Yahya Sinwar's final moments recorded by a drone in the Gaza house where he died. According to the IDF he was discovered during a routine patrol, the building hit by tank fire, his body spotted in the rubble. YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):Sinwar died while being persecuted and on the run. He didn't die as a commander but as someone who only cared for himself. ROBERTSON (voice-over): In life Sinwar had cultivated a tough image, feared and fetid at home in Gaza, universally reviled by Israelis, vilified for his leading role in Hamas's brutal October 7th slaughter of at least 1,200 people in Israel. Journalist Ehud Yaari was one of the few Israelis who met him.",

They have a new and escalating phase, but they've been so debilitated, haven't they, by the Israeli operation.

It's very clear that the Iranians have stepped in directly to support the whatever is left of the leadership in Beirut on the ground. But they do still have the resources, and they are continuing to carry out military operations, as well as, in Lebanon, trying to also care for those displaced within their own constituency.",

Most likely, going after the nuclear facilities is not something they would be doing at this particular moment because of the repercussions, including the fact that Iran will then double down. It may go underground with its nuclear program. I mean, the ramifications are far too big. We're on the eve of an American election.The other target could be the oil installations. But again, the global repercussions, the economic global repercussions of that are far too big. So I think they are much more likely to go after the military installations.",

We'll talk about that a bit later on. President Biden, as he starts to leave office, but he's getting a full military guard there and the red carpet is out. This is a ceremonial welcome.

A preliminary autopsy report reveals that Payne died from multiple injuries, including external and internal hemorrhages after falling from what authorities in Argentina said was the third floor balcony in his hotel room.When police announced Payne's death, they said they were directed to the hotel after a 9-1-1 call where they were informed about an aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. CNN's affiliate in Argentina has obtained that 9-1-1 call. Take a listen. HOTEL RECEPTIONIST (through translator): Well, we have a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol, and well, even when he's aware, he breaks things up. He's tearing the whole room apart. And, well, we need someone to be sent, please. 911 OPERATOR (through translator): That is under the influence of alcohol and drugs, yes? HOTEL RECEPTIONIST (through translator): Yes, that's right. And we need someone to be sent to us urgently because, well, I don't know if the guest's life is at risk.

At one point this year, we saw McDonald's, a global brand, offer meal deals that we've seen in other parts of the world to encourage people to come in and spend money. So it really is a global concern, considering China is the world's second largest economy.Here's what's at play. One, people aren't spending, but two, there's been a lot of issues with the housing market. There has been a crisis in the housing market, to put it bluntly. And that is a big deal because many Chinese families, in fact, some estimates up to 70 percent of Chinese families have their wealth in housing. So that has a direct impact on how people spend money. The Chinese government would like to see growth. They've set a growth target, Max, as you mentioned, of 5 percent for this year. Some economists may see that as lofty. It is important to remember the Chinese economy is growing. It's just slow growing. Max, you're not seeing the big gains that were celebrated many years ago. So China is having to deal with this adjustment.",

Some stimulus measures have been taking place, but they've been very bank focused, very fiscal focused, interest rate focused. For us to expect for Chinese citizens to be given cash to spend, to encourage spending, that's not something that we will likely see.But there is big global pressure for the Chinese government to do something more. We saw some housing incentives that were released earlier in the week. And it all goes back to the fact that when we have an economy this big, an economy of more than a billion people, there are so many stakeholders from around the world, such as McDonald's, as I mentioned, such as Apple. So the Chinese government is seeing pressure to do some very aggressive actions by so many different fronts -- Max.",
