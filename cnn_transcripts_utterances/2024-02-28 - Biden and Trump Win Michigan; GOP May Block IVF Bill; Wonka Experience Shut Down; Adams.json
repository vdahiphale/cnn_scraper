Biden captured roughly 81 percent of the vote, but 13 percent of Democrats, 100,000 strong, voted uncommitted. A protest of the president's support for Israel and its war with Hamas. After failing to mention the uncommitted voters in an initial statement, the Biden campaign later acknowledged the protest, saying that he, quote, \"shares the goal of many of the folks who voted uncommitted.\"On the Republican side, Donald Trump looking formattable, trouncing Nikki Haley by more than a two-to-one margin. But many Republicans, of course, still refused to back him. And that is a major concern for the campaign in a general election. In a call to supporters, Trump looked ahead to the general, telling them, quote, \"we win Michigan, we win the whole thing.\" Still, Nikki Haley staying in the race for at least another week, telling CNN's Dana Bash she'll continue to campaign and she's looking forward to Super Tuesday, now just six days away.

This was a pretty significant message that these voters sent to President Biden. OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It really is. I mean, look, these were wins, but with some general election warning signs. There weren't really expectations that Joe Biden was going to lose this primary. There weren't expectations really that Donald Trump was going to lose this primary. But if you want to start on the Biden side of things, yes, there was a large movement led by Arab American activists over Joe Biden's handling of the Israel Hamas War. Now, before this they said victory for them would be getting 10,000 votes. We had seen in previous elections, this campaign or not, that usually uncommitted is double that in most cases. They got over 100,000 votes in this state based on that movement, and likely some other motivations for people voting that in other parts of the state as well. So definitely they are declaring it a victory because for them they wanted to be able to send a message to President Biden that there is a large community that is upset. And when you look at President Biden's margin of victory in this state in 2020, it was around 150,000. So, this is a relatively - a huge slice of that if that, again, persists to the general election. What's even more interesting, as we made our way from Waterford a little bit earlier here to Dearborn, Michigan, this city is home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the country. And based on the city's unofficial results posted, uncommitted actually beat Joe Biden here, 56 percent to 40 percent based on what's come in so far. Total, though, around 11,000 votes. All of that said, Joe Biden did win this primary by a large margin. And a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, though, did put out a statement acknowledging some of the uncommitted enthusiasm we've seen, saying, \"President Biden shares the goal of many of the folks who voted uncommitted, which is an end to the violence and a just and lasting peace. That is what he is working towards.\" Now, on the Republican side of things, Donald Trump obviously won this state by a large margin. But Nikki Haley got around 27 percent of the vote. That's close to 300,000 votes. Showing that there is enthusiasm there. But, at the ended the day, you've got to win states to win delegates, and it shows a pretty tough path ahead for Nikki Haley.",

I mean governors like Brian Kemp, Greg Abbott, DeSantis, Mike DeWine, they did very well among pro-choice voters in their states. But if you look at the swing states, places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, in those governors races, you know, 65 percent of the state said they wanted abortion to remain legal in all or most cases, and upwards of 75 percent of those voters did vote for the Democrats in places like that.And the - this - the whole eruption of this debate about IVF just -- just -- just underscores how powerful these concerns are going to be.",

The mayor's comments follow a series of high-profile incident involving migrants in New York City who have been accused of violent crimes, including a recent shooting of a tourist during a robbery at a clothing store in Times Square.Our panel is back with me now. I want to show a little bit of what - you know, let's hear from Adams himself on this. Listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: I don't believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city. There's some people that feels that they should be able to remain here, keep doing the actions until they eventually convicted. I don't subscribe to that theory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the juxtapose is, there are two separate issues, but they are - they are blurred into one just horrific issue in Georgia.And I think Democrats have this wrong.

But while there's a majority that disapproves of the way Biden is handling it, that doesn't mean there's necessarily a majority for the alternative that Trump is offering, which is mass deportation, using the National Guard, internment camps, restoring family separation at the border. The country does want to move to the right. I mean there's a poll out yesterday. Now we're up to 60 percent support for the - for the remain in Mexico policy, which was so controversial under Trump. So, there's no doubt. But the question on so many fronts, I think, is, will voters who are dissatisfied with the way things have played out under Biden be willing to take the leap all the way to what Trump is offering, which on many fronts is much more militant than he ran on in '16 or '20.",
