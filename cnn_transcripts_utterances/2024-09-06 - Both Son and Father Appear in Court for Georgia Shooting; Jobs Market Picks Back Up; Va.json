We'll see whether or not they have had assigned counsel, defense attorneys who will be present. The next step would be to talk about potential bail or release and then set forth a schedule for the next appearances that will take place going down the line. It's a very procedural hearing, but there are going to be some aspects to look for here, specifically relating to representation for each individual person and whether or not they're - what plea they're going to enter.

We covered this all together with the Crumbley case.But this case is a bit different. And also that arrest was so fast for the father to be arrested so quickly. Usually, you would see a more protracted investigation, especially with these novel theories of law. And so today you're seeing both being arraigned at the same time. So, at this point, there's going to be different issues with respect to each individual defendant. First, we have a minor. Now, he's automatically being charged with an - as an adult in this case because of the severity of the actions and the allegations in this case. But, will they challenge that? With respect to the father, is he going to request bail? We don't know exactly what's going to happen as this plays out. But I will say, it will be interesting to see the probable cause affidavit against the father because that arrest and the charges, four counts of involuntary manslaughter, a legal theory we've seen before, ignoring a risk that was apparent, specifically in this case, that there was a violent propensity of his son and then having a gun accessible. We know that he purchased the gun that was used in the shooting in December of 2023 and gifted it to his son. That's going to be the legal theory. But there's another charge here, second degree murder. That is a completely different legal theory than we have seen before. So, what, if anything, his defense attorney is going to raise in this arraignment, we'll - we'll see as time goes on.",

That's less than expected. We were hoping for around 160,000. The better news is that the unemployment rate actually fell. So, a lot of people that were on temporary layoffs, last month, in that July number that was weaker, actually came back into the workforce. So, that's a good sign. The danger and the slight warning sign in these numbers, the revisions to what we saw in July. July actually was the big fear factor, the recession warning that people were talking about. Those numbers were revised lower. So were June's numbers. So, there's a little warning sign in the revisions. Again, next month, this is a very important point until next month's data, we'll watch that to see whether we see revisions again. But if you look at the past three months actually overall, this does show a little bit of a pickup in the amount of jobs that were added, net over the month, but the revisions lower to June and July are a warning. Where we were adding, construction, health care. Where we lost, a little bit in manufacturing. There will be some alerts.

I'm not convinced at this point that that's going to matter.In an interesting way, Donald Trump has been able to target and penetrate voters despite the cash deficit when compared to the other side. Does it help Kamala Harris buy more ads, get to more places? It certainly does. But in a unique way, Donald Trump has seemed to be able to penetrate that despite the cash default.",

And these voters that we're talking about, you need robust field operations. And that's where the Harris campaign has a massive advantage over Trump. She has like seven to one in the battleground states of offices open, of paid staff on the ground. And that's the question.Also, I want to point out that it's not 2016. Trump has a huge negative that he didn't have there. He's running for the third time. He's kind of capped at these numbers. And he's got to find some way to change this race. And having Kamala Harris and her money sitting on top of him in these battleground states is not going to be helpful in the final 60 days.",

And he's right, the money does help in terms of opening up field operation offices You need them to be able to target voters in those states.What the Trump campaign is doing this time around, from my understanding, is depending on other outside groups that support the campaign to do that work on the ground, I would also push back a little bit and say, this race is still close, despite the deficit, despite not being able to put as many ads in some of those battleground states, you're still looking at a race that's in the margin of error. You're looking at a state like Pennsylvania, where 16 percent of the voters there are still undecided.",
