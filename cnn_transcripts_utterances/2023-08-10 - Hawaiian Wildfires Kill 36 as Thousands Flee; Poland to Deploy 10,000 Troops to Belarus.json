But they definitely are some most battle hardened people, battle hardened mercenaries that that very tough group has. A lot of them have combat experience in Bakhmut, for instance, which, of course, was, I wouldn't say by far but was definitely one of the toughest battles in the war in Ukraine. And if you look at some of the way that these mercenaries have been speaking online, in some Telegram channels as well, they have been saying, look, if they're called on to march to Warsaw, then that is saying that they would be willing to do. Wagner believes that they are the best part of Russia's armed forces. They believe they are the only ones who would be capable of taking on a NATO military. And they certainly seem to right now be in a mode where, if they are called to do so, it could be something that they might be actually willing to do. And of course, the Poles understand that.

As he was leaving the school and being ushered into a car, gunfire rang out. It was at least 12 shots, 12. And all the people who moments before were cheering him on had to dive for cover. Officials say this was a targeted attack against the man who once described his own country as a narco state run by a political mafia. Authorities say nine people were injured. Villavicencio, a 59 old activist, journalist and politician, who was running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks on August 20th, he would frequently speak openly against corruption in his own country and had recently said, Becky, that the mafia had subjugated his homeland. Just to give you an idea of how bad the security situation in Ecuador is, seven of the eight candidates in the election were under police protection. The attack happened less than two weeks before the August 20th election. But officials say it will still go on as planned. In a video shot at a rally just a few days ago, Villavicencio he was refusing to wear a bulletproof vest because he said the people, his supporters, were his bulletproof vest. Now he also said that he had received death threats from a known drug trafficking gang in Ecuador. And current Ecuadorian president, Guillermo Lasso, vowed the killing will not go unpunished and announced a 60-day state of emergency -- Becky.",

At least 17 people have been found dead on the shores of Myanmar after a boat carrying Rohingya migrants capsized. Officials say the boat was on its way to Malaysia when hit a storm on Monday. Dozens are still missing. A rescue official says only eight have survived so far. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reportedly fired his top general as part of a military shakeup that happened during a military meeting which state media said was focused on preparing for war. That report seemed to allude to the U.S. and South Korea as agitators in what they called a grave situation on the Korean Peninsula. FBI agents have shot and killed a Utah man while trying to arrest him. Craig Robertson was accused of threatening U.S. President Joe Biden in advance of his visit to Utah. Law enforcement agents say the suspect pointed a gun at them while they gave him commands. He was facing federal charges, including threats to the president. China is slamming U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed new rules, limiting U.S. tech investments. Its foreign ministry is calling the U.S. restrictions in China a blatant act of economic coercion. Also, Chinese military -- minister of commerce said that China reserves the right to take its own measures and that the new order will disrupt global supply chains.

But they are making a distinction here, that this again is not intended to slow down economic growth in China or affect the Chinese economy so much as prevent any of that capital from aiding Chinese military. Of course, as you mentioned, there has been condemnation from the government of China that says that this would slow their economic growth and this is an action that they do not agree with. It all underscores these really delicate relationship with U.S. and China right now. And the actions that the U.S. has been taking to curtail any sort of actions that would aid the U.S. capital into Chinese military but also, trying to establish a better communication channel with China. We have seen over the course of this year, a high-level official traveling to China to try to mend that relationship. It is quite clear that this is a fragile relationship, one they have to navigate very carefully. But in addition to this being a national security action, as officials have described here, at the White House, they are also noting and President Biden has noted the importance of semiconductors and bringing jobs to the United States. It's just part of his Bidenomics message that he is taking into the 2024 presidential election. So there are a lot of different themes that are coming together with this type of action that the U.S. is taking. But ultimately, again, the framing here, it is a national security one.

Kuwait is also banning the movie, claiming that it promotes unacceptable behavior. Barbie's ban follows anti LGBTQ rhetoric from some prominent figures around the Middle East. The year of Lebanon's Shia Hezbollah movement Hassan Nasrallah referred to homosexuality as \"sexual perversion\" in a threat during a speech in late July. LGBTQ people in Lebanon faced online harassment and death threats after the leader's speech. In Iraq, media regulators banned the terms \"homosexuality\" and \"gender,\" saying they should be replaced with the words \"sexual deviance.\" Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq have also been burning rainbow flags at protests.

Sign up to cnn.com or on the CNN app. A deal has been struck for a star striker. Tottenham have accepted an offer from Bayern Munich for England captain King Harry Kane. The German Champions League leading target has signaled that he wanted to move. So how did this deal finally get made? And, indeed, is he on the move? That is the big question. Patrick Snell joining me now from Atlanta. As a Spurs fan, let me just put it out there.
