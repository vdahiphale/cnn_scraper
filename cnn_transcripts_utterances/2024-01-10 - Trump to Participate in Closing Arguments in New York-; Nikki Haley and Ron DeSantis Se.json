As the House hearing got under way, the target of that investigation, Hunter Biden, surprised the committee and walked into the committee hearing, leading both sides to effectively start shouting and accusing each other of essentially saying, what are you so afraid of?

I want to take a listen to an exchange that happened in the hearing room just moments ago. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  First of all, my first question is, who bribed Hunter Biden to be here today? That's my first question. Second question, you are the epitome of white privilege, coming into the Oversight Committee, spitting in our face, ignoring a congressional subpoena to be deposed. What are you afraid of?

Democrats also made the point during the hearing that there have been several Republicans who have defied congressional subpoenas, including last year, when the January 6 Select Committee wanted to hear from a number of House Republican lawmakers.

That prime-time matchup happening right here on CNN. It will happen tonight. You see that little thing in the right-hand corner? That's nine hours and 39 seconds. You have got a lot of time before this happens, so get your popcorn ready. Donald Trump will also be in Iowa, but not on the stage with his top rivals. Instead, he is participating in his own solo town hall. CNN's Eva McKend is joining us from inside the debate hall this morning. Eva, you have been talking to a lot of people. You have been seeing things ramp up. What can you tell us tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is shaping up to be a fierce debate.That's because there are still voters here in Iowa that are undecided. Governor DeSantis, Nikki Haley, they are trying to appeal to those voters, make the case for why they are the clear Trump alternative. Policy differences, those should also come into focus tonight. And we're hearing from Governor DeSantis' deputy campaign manager, who sort of telegraphed Governor DeSantis' plan for the evening, and that is to try to push Haley into answering questions that they feel as though she has previously evaded. So we could get some fireworks. I will tell you, from being out on the campaign trail, that things have really intensified in recent days. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I like being underestimated. So I could sit here and say this, but you know what? I think that being the underdog suits me better. So buckle up. I think it's going to be an interesting ride. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have been waiting for this. I have done 150-plus town halls, and it has come to this moment. Don't complain about what happens in a general election if you don't play in this caucus. It matters. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
