Israel says Hamas has used Al Shifa to cover up an extensive terror infrastructure underground, something Hamas and hospital officials deny.

We know that the conditions in Al-Shifa were just so dire that it put their lives in danger. So now the Egyptians are telling us they are waiting.

The tunnel makes a sharp left turn, and at the end of another path with concrete walls and an arched concrete top, a metal door they say they have not yet opened because they fear it's booby-trapped. IDF spokesman, Admiral Daniel Hagari, says some of the Israeli hostages taken on October 7th were also brought through the hospital. He says the body of Noah Marziano was discovered 50 meters from the compound. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We have evidence that they were holding hostages in Rantisi, but also we have evidence that they were bringing them to Shifa Hospital. We're still looking for the places they might have held them. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): This is not proof of a Hamas command center or headquarters underneath the hospital, but Israel continues trying to build its case that Hamas uses the sanctuary of the hospital for cover, which Hamas and hospital officials have denied. The IDF's ability to continue its operation in Gaza and the credibility of Israel are at stake here, as the number killed in the fighting surpasses 12,000. according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF says one of its missions is to destroy Hamas.

They had shown us on Thursday what they say was an exposed tunnel shaft in the vicinity of Al-Shifa. But we've seen a real expansion of this, of course, in the last 24 hours or so.Also, the videos showing a camera being lowered into that tunnel allowing international journalists like our own Oren Liebermann in to see the tunnel shaft itself. And now we have this CCTV footage, which the IDF claims shows hostages being brought into Al-Shifa on the very day of that Hamas massacre in southern Israel on October 7th, which would show, although we cannot verify the authenticity of this or the identity of those shown, but would show that they have been using this complex since the beginning. This video you're looking at here showing what the idea says is an injured hostage being brought in, clearly still bleeding. Now they have said that these hostages are, one is Nepali, one is Thai. Hamas, meanwhile, is questioning the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, questioning the authenticity of this and saying that all it really shows is that anyone who needs medical treatment at Al-Shifa was given that medical treatment, although of course one of the hostages that we see, the purported hostages in these videos, was not injured. So what you see is this campaign from Israel to really try to prove its claim, as it has been claiming for weeks now that Hamas is operating a command-and-control node under the Al-Shifa hospital if it can conclusively prove that. And we can see that they haven't conclusively proven that yet. They haven't in the case of that tunnel under the hospital. They haven't gone through that blast proof door. They assume that it leads to the hospital, but they don't know yet. But if they can prove that, then it would show, amid mounting criticism of their operation there, that the hospital is being used for military purposes. And then it loses its protected status under international law. But as I said, pressure is mounting internationally. Meanwhile, we're hearing from the White House that the hostage negotiations are progressing closer perhaps than they've ever been. I think those CCT videos in particular add extra urgency to that.

He said that the situation is incredibly difficult. And he was on the right bank of the river, let alone the left bank, where there are Ukrainian Marines trying to hold onto this territory. They obviously want to push back the Russians so that they can't hit the city of Kherson the way that they are hitting it at present. It's a current constant, I should say, bombardment. We spoke to the governor of Kherson who said last week on one day they had 700 strikes. I mean, this is about terrorizing the population, but it's not just about protecting the city.

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Houthi rebels seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea Sunday afternoon, just hours after the Iranian-backed group's military wing had warned that in retaliation for Israel's war on Gaza, they would target any ship flying the Israeli flag or owned or operated by an Israeli company. The ship in -- we're talking about, the Galaxy Leader, flying under the flag of the Bahamas was bound for India from Turkey. Israeli officials insist the Galaxy leader is not Israeli-owned, and that there were no Israelis among the crew. In a statement, the Israeli military described the seizure as a very grave incident of global consequence. A spokesman for the Houthis later confirmed that their forces had seized the ship, which he described as Israeli. He said the crew were being treated in accordance to Islamic values and warned that any Israeli ship would be a legitimate target for Houthi forces. The Houthis, along with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria and various militias in Iraq, are part of what is known as the Axis of Resistance led by Iran.

She says that her tax payments were impeccable in Spain and in every other jurisdiction.

      "sentences": "Well, the governor told us that ever since authorities released those two images of the person of interest, they've received a ton of tips, the photos seen far and wide around the world because of L.A.'s global connection. What is in focus right now? First and foremost, life becoming easier for thousands of people. The Thanksgiving holiday here in the United States, of course, right around the corner. So easier travel for thousands of people who are coming to our corner of the country for a warmer holiday with their friends and family.Also easier for the people who live in and around downtown L.A. who don't have the luxury of staying home and working through Zoom. Finally, the structural tests of the concrete coming back much better than expected. All of those things discussed by not only the governor of California, but the vice president of the United States. Listen. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I was acutely aware of what closure of the 10 would mean for so many people. Hard working people, families, many people who when it was shut down, they can't work from home. Their work requires them to be present. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): You can be assured of one thing, safety first, quality, foundational in this effort. It wasn't just speed that we were after. We wanted to make sure this thing was safe. VALERIO: So we return for a moment briefly to the person of interest. Some fascinating characteristics that authorities have released, saying that the man was likely wearing a knee brace on his right knee and also possibly has a burn on his left leg. The man being described as somebody in his 30s, ethnicity unknown at this point. But I thought it was also important, it was recognized that in this time of so many tough and terrible headlines around the world, this is certainly a moment to be celebrated. Civic authorities saying that scores and scores of electricians, engineers, carpenters, union members coming together to make sure that this vital transportation artery, not fixed in a matter of six months, but rather eight days, and that is something certainly to celebrate.

And what happens here can affect large parts of the globe. In 2010, ash spewed into the atmosphere by a volcano here brought transatlantic air travel to a virtual standstill for weeks. Iceland's government says this time around the effects could also be devastating with both Grindavik and a geothermal power plant nearby which provides energy to Iceland's main international airport and the possible path of lava.",

The main problem isn't even the size of the possible eruption, but the fact that it's so close to urban areas, geophysicist Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson from the University of Iceland tells me.",

But farther east, you're looking at the main concerns to be rain, which could be heavy at times and some gusty winds in the Midwest.And then down to the south, the main concern is actually going to be the potential for severe thunderstorms. The main threats there will be damaging winds, hail, and even some isolated tornadoes, especially places like Shreveport up to Memphis and all the way back down to New Orleans. The timeline there is really going to be the afternoon and continuing into Monday evening as that low pressure system continues to progress eastward. By Tuesday, now the big concern is going to be a lot of the folks traveling in the air. A lot of those connecting hubs like Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, up through Washington D.C. and New York could all end up seeing some delays as we go through the day Tuesday and even continuing into Tuesday night. And by Wednesday morning we start to see more of the impacts across areas of the Northeast. So for Monday specifically, we are looking at more of the delays early in the morning. Still out West places like Denver, where you've got the rain, snow mix, Las Vegas for high winds. By the time we get later into the day Monday, now you're talking more than Midwest and the Southeast. And then by Tuesday you start to see a lot of those delays potentially spreading into areas of the Northeast such as New York and Washington D.C. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
