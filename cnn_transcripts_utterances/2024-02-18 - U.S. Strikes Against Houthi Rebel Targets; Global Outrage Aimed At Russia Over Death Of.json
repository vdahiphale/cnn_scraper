      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Washington, D.C. And we continue to follow breaking news out of the Middle East.The U.S. Military has conducted a new round of strikes against Houthi controlled areas of Yemen and targets in the Red Sea. These new strikes hit anti-ship cruise missiles and vessels, and also included strikes on the first unmanned underwater vessel the Iranian-backed rebel group has used since the attacks in the Red Sea began. The Houthi attacks have forced some of the world's biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes, which could potentially cause a shock to the global economy. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis is covering these developments for us. Katie Bo, what is the U.S. Military saying about these new strikes?",

      "sentences": "Fred, the U.S. Military carrying out five strikes against targets in Houthi held areas of Yemen. Three anti-ship cruise missiles one drone boat, and one underwater drone. Now the U.S. Military in a statement saying that this is the first time that it had seen the Houthi rebels employ one of these underwater drones. But at this point, we don't really have any more details than that in terms of how the military identified this potential target where it was, and what potential risk that the use of this kind of underwater drone could pose to either commercial shipping in the region or to military vessels in the area.The U.S. Military saying in a statement that it had identified these targets, quote, \"because they presented an imminent threat to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in the region,\" and saying that these actions will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels. This is just the latest round of U.S. Military strikes against Houthi targets. The Houthis being an Iranian-backed rebel group that control large swaths of territory in Yemen that for months have carried out dozens of attacks against both commercial shipping as well as military targets in the region in what they say is support of the Palestinian cause inside Gaza. These latest strikes follow another series of strikes, literally just a couple of days ago, on Friday. The U.S. striking two other Houthi targets. Again, an anti-ship cruise missile and a drone boat. The big question now at this point, Fredricka, is do these U.S. strike have an impact on the Houthi decision-making, the Houthi attacks, right? Do they actually deter the Houthis from carrying out further attacks? The Houthis have said publicly that they have no intention of stopping their attacks on shipping until the Israeli invasion of Gaza is over, until the Israelis are out of Gaza and hostilities there have ended. Also true that we have not seen the pace of attacks from the Houthi is in the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden slow. At the same time, the U.S. doesn't really have a great sense of how big the Houthi arsenal really is, right? How many military capabilities they retain. U.S. intelligence gathering inside Yemen, inside Houthi controlled Yemen, is a little bit anemic. And so I think a big question for U.S. officials who are watching this situation closely is how much capability do the Houthis retain and how long can they keep this up?",

And she was trying to recover it so the family can have a funeral. But when she got to the morgue, it was closed and the people there said her son's body wasn't there. And so there was some confusion around that.Subsequently, the Russian authorities have said, look, we're not going to give the body back to the family so it can be buried until such times we've finished all our medical examinations, all our, you know, sort of forensic work, postmortems to determine what the cause of death was. But the Navalny team, you know, his political allies, his campaigners in the anti-corruption group that he ran, say that this is just the Russians -- the Russian authorities trying to hide the body, trying to hide the real reason why Alexey Navalny suddenly and without warning died late last week.",

She was killed in the entrance of her apartment building in St. Petersburg in 1998. And my good friend Boris Nemtsov who I warned not to go back to Russia in 2014 and he was murdered also in February of 2015.Navalny was arrested after he returned to Russia upon his recovery after he was poisoned in Siberia by the Russian government. There is ample evidence that he was poisoned. He was miraculously saved in Germany by doctors and then he decided to go back and fight for freedom in Russia and immediately was arrested and put in increasingly harsh conditions above the Polar -- above the Arctic Circle in the Polar Siberia and there he met his demise. Now the fact that the body is not remitted to the family and cannot be flown to the West to do an independent autopsy, and now they are also leaks that there are bruises on the body suggests to me that this young, relatively young man of 47, in good health before the poisoning, was murdered in the gulag.",

And Navalny thought he'd live long enough. He was, what, 20 plus years younger than Putin? He thought he'd live long enough to participate in democratic politics in Russia one day. Unfortunately, today we see the ratcheting of the political conditions in Russia.Putin is cleaning the deck, so to speak, as the war in Ukraine continues, and there are leaked materials from the Estonian Intelligence Services that Putin is going to expand the war to the Baltic States after he wraps up the operation in Ukraine, that he will be able to wrap up if our Congress continues to stall on providing assistance to Ukraine. And Putin's ambitions don't stop there. Putin is working closely with Iran to support Hamas and other terrorist organizations in the Middle East to support Iran with potentially nuclear technologies, buying thousands of drones from Iran. So the connection is the battlefield is not just Europe. It's also the Middle East. And Russia, of course, is in the pocket of China today.

They did not turn up those bodies after about three days of searching the complex, but what they did find they say is weapons on the complex as well as medicine with the names and photos of Israeli hostages. But what is clear is the damage to the hospital itself, which was shelled late last week and then subsequently raided by Israeli forces. The World Health Organization saying that it is not functional anymore. We do know that there are also still people who were sheltering at that hospital. Thousands of people who have since fled. But what is also clear is that while a lot of military activity has focused on Southern Gaza, Central Gaza has been getting hit very hard by the Israeli military over this weekend. 68 people killed in strikes on Saturday and an additional 18 people were killed in airstrikes on Central Gaza today. The videos are quite stunning. One after the other you see children being brought in, killed or injured. Two health officials at that hospital in Central Gaza say the majority of the victims who were killed or injured were children.

Right now, in Chicago, we are trying to do everything we can to address the serious needs that we can have, in terms of these humanitarian needs. We have, right now, unfortunately, as you mentioned, these tragedies that keep -- that keep amounting because of the serious conditions that are being created. We have a governor in Texas that is treating this is a -- as a war zone. He's not treating these like a humanitarian crisis. We have people arriving in flip flops and without jackets often times. We have arctic weather. And, again, in this case with the -- in the case of John Carlos is -- this is a tragedy. When we see this -- again, we are all familiar with the strep throat in Chicago. Unfortunately, when this becomes a more serious and aggressive type, and we've seen a lot of disease, this is -- this ended up in a tragedy. The medical examiner ruled as a natural cause. And, again, we, as the city, as a community, we are an immigrant community, we're urging the state -- for instance, to win state access and (ph) document the patients to be able to access medical care. Something was called last year. We are also asking the federal government to please urgently have the same resources that we did. And we employ in Chicago for us to receive 29,000 Ukrainian refugees that are also fleeing violence and adding a need. Right now, again, we are deeply heartbroken in our community, that we have a young boy that is no longer with his family. And now, and only few months ago, we also had a three-year-old little girl that died in transit from Texas to Chicago.

And it more than lived up to the heighten (ph). They came up with this idea, after Sabrina scored a record 37 points in the WNBA's three- point contest, winning it over the summer. And, Sabrina, she went for a shooting from the NBA three-point line. And just put on a show, clearing the first rack completely. She would go on to finish with a great score of 26, which would actually have tied for the best score in the real three-point contest. But she was going up against the best shooter of all time, Steph Curry. And Steph would get hot late, end up winning 29 to 26. Now, Sabrina saying afterwards, she hopes this event going to inspire kids across the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It felt like a good time to revisit similar events from recent history to maybe provide some new context as to what actually happened, as well as to hear directly from the folks who were there in the center of the storm. So, tonight, in the new CNN original series, \"UNITED STATES OF SCANDAL,\" I'll explore some of the most sensational political controversies and talk to some of the most famous or infamous political figures of the modern era, to try to dissect the truth from the spin. Now, in the first episode tonight, I'm going to speak with former Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich, best known for serving time in prison for trying to sell the Illinois Senate seats that Barack Obama vacated when he was elected president in 2008. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROD BLAGOJEVICH (D), FORMER GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS: Let me reassert to all of you once more that I am not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing.
