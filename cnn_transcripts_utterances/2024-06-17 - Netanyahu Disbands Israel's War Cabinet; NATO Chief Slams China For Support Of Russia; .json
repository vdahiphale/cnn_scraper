Tonight, Israel's Prime Minister disbands thecountry's war cabinet while the military announces a tactical pause for aid deliveries on one route into Gaza. We will explain what all of that means, of course. Then, strong words from the NATO Secretary General as he calls out China for their support of Russia's war in Ukraine. We are live in Washington. Plus, an extreme heat waves surges across large swaths of the United States with one wildfire at California causing thousands to evacuate. That and of course, and much more just ahead. But we begin tonight in Washington where NATO's leaders set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House is happening in the next hour. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has already arrived in Washington with some very direct language on the war in Ukraine. Earlier on Monday, if you remember, he said Beijing should pay a price for supporting Moscow. This is what he said. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, SECRETARY-GENERAL, NATO: Publicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he's taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China is fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. And at the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we'll move to the Middle East because Israel's Prime Minister has disbanded his war cabinet, overseeing key decisions on Gaza as he faces increasing political pressure on multiple fronts. The move by Benjamin Netanyahu was expected after opposition leader Benny Gantz quit the war cabinet this month, citing, if you remember, a lack of war strategy. But dissolving that cabinet also allows Mr. Netanyahu to sidestep demands by far-right ministers to be included. The shake-up comes as Israel's military insists, the fight against Hamas continues in Rafah and across all of Gaza. It says it should have made that clear when announcing a daily tactical pause along a southern route meant to facilitate that route, facilitate their aid deliveries. Now, U.N. agency say they have not yet seen improvements in aid distribution. I'll have more now on the logistics of that tactical pause with our Paula Hancocks, who has the details for you from the Israeli side of the Kerem Shalom Crossing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): So, this is the Kerem Shalom Crossing, and the Israeli military has brought us here to show us that there is aid here that is waiting to get into Gaza. They also said there's more than a thousand trucks on the other side just inside Gaza, that is waiting to be distributed. Now, the IDF has announced this tactical route, which will be from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., and it will be a safe road from the Kerem Shalom Crossing they say, and up the Salaheddin road, which is the north size artery in Gaza. Now, we have spoken to international aid groups, to the U.N. within Gaza about this, and they have said that they have used this route before, they're not sure what's new about this passageway. But their concern is the lack of police, the lack of law and order within Gaza itself. So, it is very dangerous for them to be able to come and pick this aid up. It's something I asked the IDF spokesperson about. Are you going to escort these trucks, the military will escort them?",

At that same time, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister demanded entry into it. He wanted to say over how the war is handled. So, Netanyahu just went ahead and dissolved the war cabinet. Now, the decisions will be made in the security cabinet, which existed -- has existed all along during this war. But it wasn't in charge of managing the war itself, and Israeli officials saying Netanyahu will conduct consultations there, but it's not clear who he will consult with. What's clear to Netanyahu after years upon years of being at the head of Israel's government is in a security cabinet effectively from his perspective, he makes the decisions.

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying, \"we are prepared for very strong action in the north.\" But the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable, battle-hardened foe Israel has faced on its borders since the 1973 October war. After its gorillas forced Israel to pull out of south Lebanon 24 years ago, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill.

Analysts believe Iran has provided Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated long-range missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and beyond. Until now, Hezbollah has mostly limited its strikes to military targets along the rugged, mountainous frontier, hitting Israel's extensive network of surveillance posts. It also says it has taken out an iron dome battery, the backbone of Israel's missile defenses, and has used ground-to-air missiles to shoot down three top of the line Hermes 900 drones.

MADOWO (voice-over): In 2007, Britain's Ministry of Defense dismissed over 2,000 claims of rape from mostly Maasai and Samburu women, saying, \"There was no reliable evidence to support any single allegation.\" The government in Nairobi lost the case files without explanation. A Royal Military Police investigation concluded that most of the Kenyan evidence appeared to have been fabricated. One Kenyan official called it a cover-up. They did not conduct DNA tests on any of the 69 mixed-race children alleged to have been born as a result of rape by British soldiers.

The U.S. Surgeon General is calling for urgent action to help curb children's use of social media.Dr. Vivek Murthy is demanding Congress to require labels on the apps, excuse me, as it does with cigarettes as well as alcohol. Writing in the New York Times, he describes the mental health crisis among young people as an emergency and argues that social media is a huge contributor. Speaking earlier on NBC, Dr. Murthy said labels should help parents and to our children, really better understand the risks of social media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Not only have companies not demonstrated that their platforms are safe for kids, but there is growing evidence of harm. It shows us, in fact, that when adolescents spend more than three hours a day on social media, we're seeing an association with a doubling of risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. And the average amount of use per day among adolescents is nearly five hours. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And also, since he put out this advisory last May calling for changes and more study of the impacts to mental health from social media use in children. I asked him if there were any specific legislators that have already come forward and said they are willing to bring this forward because this does require an act of Congress to put this kind of warning label on something. And he said he didn't know of any specific ones. However, we have seen some legislators already out on social media platforms saying at least that they are supportive of the idea of this. We are reaching out to them to see if they're actually planning to introduce this legislation. But, you know, the Surgeon General is saying he was discouraged that we haven't seen more change in the past year since he put out that advisory. And so he is hoping to see change here. As you pointed out in the introduction, he cited a lot of data points that are concerning to him, including the idea that kids are using social media, on average, up to almost five hours per day, according to a Gallup survey. He also cited a JAMA psychiatry study that found that kids who use social media for at least three hours a day have double the risk of mental health harms, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. So he's calling this a profound harm, really along the lines of what we've seen with cigarettes and alcohol. And that's why he's calling for this warning.",
