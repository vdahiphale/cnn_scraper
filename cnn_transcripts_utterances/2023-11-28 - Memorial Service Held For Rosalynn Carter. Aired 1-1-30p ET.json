And I think we saw that in just -- just having a conversation with her, you could tell that she was somebody who -- she stood up for what she believed in. And I think that what happened with the Reagans afterwards was just -- as Anita was saying, it was so disheartening for her, because a lot of the work she had done for mental health was undone. And I think also there was this feeling that she had that she wasn't appreciated by the Washington elite. She wasn't -- she didn't kind of have dinner parties with Katharine Graham. And they famously got rid of hard liquor at the White House. They sold the Sequoia. He didn't want \"Hail to the Chief\" played. It was all this kind of folksy Southernness.",
