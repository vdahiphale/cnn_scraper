The Trump investigation is much more expansive, is much more significant in part because of the volume, the difference of volume in materials that have been recovered, but also because Trump's conduct has raised questions about possible obstruction.

Because, presumable, the Defense Department and elsewhere in government, a copy probably exists. So, they want to know if there is a version that is unaccounted for. And so from a national security perspective, they have to track that down. Then from a prosecution perspective, they have to determine whether or not he or someone else is withholding that document.So, they executed a Justice Department/FBI search at the Mar-a-Lago residence. What they never did is they didn't execute a physical search pursuant to a search warrant, a court-ordered search warrant, at the other locations. Instead, they're serving subpoenas, which require compliance by the Trump team. But that's different then had they executed their own search, and I still think there's a question out there as to whether they would do that.

He was basically attacking the DOJ, attacking CNN and our excellent reporting, not really offering much of a defense, and also trying to claim that Trump did two things. One, he declassified, and he also personalized this document. I think both of those arguments really are called into question by Paula and the team's incredible reporting.First of all, there is just no evidence that it has been declassified, and that might be contradicted by Trump's own comments. And the idea that he made a national security document a personal document just, I think, would stretch credulity if you would have put it in front of a jury. But I do think what you are hearing now from the Trump team is really not a whole lot of new information, and I said as much to Jim Trusty on Wednesday. There's no real explanation for Trump's actually conduct, as reported by CNN and as put forward by the Justice Department, as they have been engaging in this investigation.

The answer is no.And why was he talking about -- even if he didn't have the document, why was he talking about classified information, and then said, of course, according to our reporting, I'm not supposed to be talking about this, which shows you that he knew that he shouldn't be talking about classified information, which also might show us that he hadn't really declassified it as he said he waved his wand and he could declassify anything. So, it's very important but it does tell you something about the cavalier way in which Donald Trump has always treated classified information. It's almost as if he wanted to impress these people writing a book for Mark Meadows. And the tape recording of it is, because he feels like he's been so burned in the past, that he wanted to make sure that they accurately recorded what he said.",

So, there's still a lot we need to learn about what really happened here, where that document might be.

So, Mike Pence took responsibility. He said they weren't supposed to be there and the Justice Department does its job and it all gets closed up.Complete opposite with the situation of the former president, which is that documents were retained, the Justice Department went down and talked to him and tried to get them back, he refused. You end up with this execution of a search warrant, which really is quite a dramatic event, to have to execute a court-ordered search warrant at the residence of a former president. And you have this investigation that has now continued month after month after month and involves now not just the issue of the mishandling of classified information but also the potential of obstruction. And that's where I think this new reporting really plays in. Is there a document is out there that has been withheld, not provided after a court order, a subpoena to obtain it, according to legal process, and is it out there somewhere or was it destroyed, or did it never exist?",

      "sentences": "I've been talking to White House officials throughout the day. One thing they continue to focus on is that the president wanted to talk about just how serious, just how high stakes the last several weeks have been, the gravity of the moment, something underscored by the fact that he was willing to make this address from the Oval Office, his first Oval Office address. And that is certainly reflected in the excerpts that we have seen so far, talking about a crisis averted, talking about the highest stakes of moments.The president also talking about the agreement itself, saying, no one got everything they wanted but the American people got what they needed. We averted an economic crisis and economic collapse. We're cutting spending and bringing deficits down. Also goes on to make clear that entitlement programs, like Medicare and Social Security, which he committed to ensure were not touched, were not touched, and that almost all of his legislative agenda that was enacted over the course of the first two years was protected in this agreement. I think that's kind of a frame to some degree when you talk to White House officials, the fact that they are able to keep the primary priorities of the House Republican majority out of the agreement but most importantly that ensured the country didn't default. And you pair that reality, particularly given how much of a cloud this has been over the administration, over the U.S. economy and the entire country for the last several months, with today's very, I think, jarring look into where the U.S. economy is. Yet again, once again, U.S. jobs, monthly jobs report coming in higher than expected, showing the economy remains on a robust pace at this point in time, kind of going against all projections over the course of the last seven years, 339,000 jobs added, a pretty significant upward revision in the month of April as well. I think it brings together a moment where I think the president and White House officials know they want to ensure everybody knows just how dicey things were over the course of the last several weeks and also why that leads into the coming weeks and months where White House officials believe they can make very real progress, Alex.",

But House Republicans went in hoping that non-defense spending would be slashed by 20 percent, right?So, in terms of who moved, who compromised, I think that the president feels like he can confidently look the public in the eye and say, look, I protected the things that I consider priorities. And he also wants to get out ahead of what progressives have been saying because of the changes that will happen to some anti-poverty programs. They have carve-outs for veterans, for the homeless, et cetera, but there has been a loud contingent saying, look, he did not protect the most vulnerable. So, I think that Joe Biden wants to, as people talk about the narrative, right, he wants to stop being underestimated and he wants to come out and say, look, this is what it looks like when things function, because that's where the bar is now, functioning.",

I mean, he's certainly been more critical as president of MAGA Republicans and of the threat to democracy that he believes they pose. But he did not, through this process, spend a lot of time banging the table and warning that Republicans were playing with fire, who mostly held his own fire and focused on reaching a deal, which from their point of view, he would have had to do any way in the budget process, because Republicans in November of '22 won one chamber of Congress.So, I think he can basically say to the left of the party, I didn't really give away anything in this debt ceiling negotiation that we might not have had to give away any way in the budget, and that we are talking about, yes, what could be meaningful cuts in for the programs, but, overall, this entire process, the ends and the means were so disproportionately out of whack. We are talking about potentially tanking the domestic and global economy were these Republican demands on 15 percent of the federal budget, the domestic discretionary spending, not enough to materially change the long-term impact. So, from Biden's point of view, avoiding disaster, given what the stakes were on the other side, seems a very acceptable outcome.",

And I think that the president, as we saw with his confidence about democracy, he does go out of his way to underscore the stakes when he thinks the stakes are indeed high enough, and wants to kind of punch through the noise on that.",

Fred Pleitgen in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for us tonight, thank you very much for all your terrific reporting.And joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. He's on the House Intelligence and Armed Services and Committees. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. The Biden administration has been clear that they do not want Ukraine to carry out cross-border attacks inside Russia. Do you agree and do you think that there should be consequences if these attacks grow? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, Alex, the Biden administration has been clear that they don't want the Ukrainians to use U.S.-supplied equipment and intelligence and information to conduct cross-border attacks into Russia. But they have also been very clear that this is the Ukrainians' fight, that the Ukrainians have the ability to defend their sovereignty and homeland and that we give them flexibility to decide when and how they do that. We are not going to dictate the terms of that. We will assist them, we will do table top exercises, we will provide advice and, of course, equipment, but we have been very clear that the limitations that we are placing on the Ukrainians are with respect to our equipment and supplies and the direct aid that we have been providing to the Ukrainian people.",

And we have heard from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, cautioning that providing those jets, those F-16s to Ukraine, that will take a considerable length of time, effort and money, General Milley said. Do you think it was a mistake to not green light these jets earlier?",

I think we should have provided those a month ago, because it's critical for the Ukrainians to be able to strike deep into those supply lines. And they have been doing that with drones, with special operations forces, but that long range fire would be very critical. And we have absolutely no reason to believe, Alex, that the Ukrainians will use any of our assistance to do anything in Russia. They respected our wishes. It would be not to their advantage to do that.Now, with regard to the F-16s, I have been pushing the Biden administration to provide those more advanced fighters. Now, it could be F-16s, it could be something else. Now, the point is they need fourth generation advanced fighters to be able to combat the long range fires that the Russians have. There's different ways to do that. But the main thrust of my position and other people's position in Congress, who have supported the provision of these more advanced jets, is that we have to help Ukrainians fight the fight now and win the battles that are going on, but we don't have the luxury of ignoring the long-term reforms and modernization that Ukraine needs to get ready for a longer fight for Russia, if that's what happens.",

And we are learning that behind the scenes, she's gone to two firms that did research for the Trump campaign and she sought information for them about the work that they did for the campaign.And, essentially, what they did is they looked into Trump's claims of voter fraud, and in some cases, they debunked voter fraud allegations that were given to them by the campaign. In other cases, they provided more information to the campaign. They clearly refuted what Donald Trump was peddling publicly. And so it's clear she's still gathering more information behind the scenes before she makes these potential indictment announcements. This step is interesting because it could shed light into the fact that, look, people around Donald Trump knew that these voter fraud claims were baseless. They were still making efforts in Georgia to try to overturn the 2020 election. So, it could get to the mindset of some of the people involved. It could also help develop a pattern of activity across a variety of swing states. It wasn't just Georgia where they're peddling these allegations. It was a number of other states where they were trying to make these voter fraud claims stick. But they were hearing from these experts that that just wasn't the case, that the facts were not there to support this, Alex.",

And tonight's message in this address will be one of victory for the president, because it comes less than 24 hours after Congress passed that bipartisan bill allowing Washington to pay its bills, right? To raise the debt ceiling. A major win for the president, and it does follow weeks of tense negotiations, and some very dire warnings of economic catastrophe. A deal that cuts spending and extend the debt ceiling coming just days from what would have a devastating default, right? And we had heard that from bank CEOs, not just from politicians. Tonight's speech also coming on the heels of what was a blockbuster jobs report, nearly 340,000 jobs added in the month of May. That was a stunning number, and it did send the Dow surging more than 700 points. So this is a significant event, this Oval Office address the first of his presidency. Phil Mattingly is live outside the White House were the president will be speaking just a few minutes. Of course, Phil, this is a Friday night, it is a summer Friday night.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erin, when this is put in the schedule last night, it was certainly an interesting development for a president that is never given Oval Office remarks in an even incapacity before now, despite the kind of historical significance of that moment, but also the timeline itself.The way it has been framed, to me, from White House officials and I think you can see this from the excerpts we've seen from the presidents remarks that he will be given shortly is this is a moment after the passage of this legislation on its way to the White House that underscores two things. One, just how grave the lawmakers try to negotiate this, just how great this was potentially for the U.S. economy. I think it's something that White House officials in the president to underscore. This is an, despite the fact, it feels like we've had these moments repeatedly over the course of the last ten, 11, 12 years. This one was different. This one is very dicey for a period of time, and yet, the White House negotiators, with their House Republican counterparts, were able to reach an outcome, a bipartisan outcome and a very big vote in the House that the president will emphasize. But also one that White House officials believe on net is a win, or at worst may be a wash in the sense that it does not dramatically affect any of their major legislative priorities the president got across the finish line over the course of his first two years. Even some of the issues that progressives have had with this legislation, they feel like work requirements specifically, they were able to mitigate some of what Republicans wanted. I think more broadly, they feel like they kept out the vast majority of the Republican priorities in this agreement. But more than anything else, Erin, I think particularly on this day we can see that jobs number, the wreckage of the U.S. economy's durability, and stability over the last several months has really defined the predictions of Wall Street, of economists, is the fact that the issue of default is off the table, it has been hanging over the White House and the president for the better part of the last six months. Getting this off the table, given where the economy still is at this moment in time, and looking at weeks, and months ahead where these major legislative buyer tolls and self-imposed crises are simply not on the radar there was an opportunity here to turn the page. That is something the president will focus on.",

I also want to bring Jeff Zeleny, Van Jones, Rina Shah, and Michael Smerconish in just these couple of minutes here before we anticipate the president will enter the Oval Office. Michael, this is Biden's first speech from the Oval Office. But as I mentioned, it is a summer Friday. What do you make of his choice of venue and time? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\": I find it very unusual. I think he is entitled to a victory lap, but listening to fill, it doesn't make sense to me that the purpose is to educate about a grave danger averted. If you are such a grave danger, then a week ago would've been the appropriate time to deliver these remarks. The cynic in me says it's intended to dilute the image of the president taking that stumble at the Air Force Academy, and to end the week on a positive note because he did have a major achievement.",
