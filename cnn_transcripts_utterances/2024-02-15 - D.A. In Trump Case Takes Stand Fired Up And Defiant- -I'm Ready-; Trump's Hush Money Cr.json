Will the judge let her stay on the case? Plus, Trump's first criminal trial date is set, beginning just weeks from now with a verdict in a criminal case as early as May. Michael Cohen, central player in the New York hush money case, will be OUTFRONT tonight. And new details this hour emerging about what may have caused the deadly mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration. I'll speak to a man who was shot along with his wife and child. What he saw just before the gunman opened fire. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening and welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett. And the breaking news tonight: I'm ready to go. Those are the exact words of a defiant Fani Willis. She is, of course, the Georgia D.A. overseeing Trump's election interference case as she took the stand for hours today in a high-stakes hearing, which just ended, a hearing that focused on her relationship with Nathan Wade, who is her top prosecutor in the Trump case. And it was a show. Trump and his allies' lawyers pried into salacious, deeply personal details and Willis's private life. And Willis did not back down, turning the tables on them.
