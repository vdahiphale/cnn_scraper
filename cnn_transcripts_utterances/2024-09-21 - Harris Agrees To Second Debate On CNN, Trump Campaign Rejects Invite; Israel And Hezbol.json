Of course, just days before the election. Harris is now challenging her political rival to another face-to-face showdown. But is Trump up for more? We're going to have more on that just a moment.Also today Trump is campaigning in the key battleground state of North Carolina as the Republican candidate for governor in that state faces a major scandal with just 45 days to go until election day. CNN's Steve Contorno is live in Wilmington, North Carolina, where Trump just wrapped up that rally. Steve, first off, what did Trump say about the possibility of this second debate with Vice President Harris?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Although good entertainment value, a lot of people said, do it, it's great entertainment. I've already done two. The problem with another debate is that it's just too late. Voting has already started. She's had her chance to do it with FOX. You know, FOX invited us on and I waited and waited. And they turned it down. They turned it down. But now she wants to do a debate right before the election with CNN because she's losing badly. It's too late to do another.

Of course, some states have restricted abortion to the point that women are concerned about getting access to health care and whether they can get treatment if they are in dire need of health. That's something that Vice President Harris has made a central part of her campaign. But, look, it's clear that the women's vote is something that Trump is really worried about at this stage of the race, and take a look at these numbers in North Carolina, 60 percent of women telling Quinnipiac in a recent poll that they would support Harris over Donald Trump, and that margin between Trump and the Democratic ticket is larger than it was four years ago when it was Trump versus Biden. So clearly, he has some ground to make up there in a state that is growing quickly, changing fast and has many new women voters, especially in those suburban parts of the state.",

Just remember, you know, the first debate against Joe Biden, Trump won that debate significantly and now the debate against Kamala Harris, even Republicans were saying he got his clock cleaned.He wasn't prepared on and on. And for him to now say he's not going to debate again, I think plays into this narrative, look, these guys are scared. They're scared about everything. They want you to be scared. They want you to be scared of immigrants. They want you to be scared of women making their own choices. They want you to be scared of another political party. That's how they are. And so for him to be afraid to debate, I think plays right along with that kind of theory of the case. DEAN: And I also want to talk about the rhetoric that's being used by the Trump campaign in your state of Ohio. Obviously, we have seen so much fallout from that debate and what was said on the debates stage about pets in Springfield, and now to where we are today. The mayor of Springfield this week granting himself temporary emergency powers to address bomb threats that schools and public buildings have been receiving. What in your mind is the bottom line fallout here within your -- you're there in Ohio. What are people saying and how are they responding to all of this?",

And literally like bomb threats at schools, they don't care. Bomb threats at universities. They don't care. Bomb threats at city halls. They don't care. It just shows that they're in -- even and almost admitting that they made the story up and they just use this beautiful town of Springfield, Ohio, as a pawn in their little game and that they still don't care.And I think, you know, behind the kind of immigration thing, of course it's important, and how that happened, and behind all of that is people are coming to the realization that they just don't give a damn about average people. They will use them. Trump did that in all his business dealings. J.D. Vance did that when he started a fake opiate charity in Ohio and said he was going to take care of people overdosing, and didn't spend a nickel on them, spent all the money on his own political operation and a campaign consultant and a poll that he ran out of his opiate charity for himself. Like they don't care. And I think it's all in line with past behavior, and I think those are the kinds of issues that, especially women and we're starting to see that resonate in the poll, but men, too, are like these guys are, you know, BS artists and we need to move on. And as for Republicans, what I'm hearing a lot is we are voting for Kamala Harris, so we could begin the rebuilding of the Republican Party, which as a Democrat I'd say hallelujah, thank God, let's move in that direction.

It's one of the biggest military forces in the world. It has upwards of 170,000 rockets there, they are longer range, more accurate than anything in Hamas' arsenal.And they're a direct wing of Iran. I think the goal in Lebanon for Israel is to push Hezbollah back beyond what's called the Litani River. It's about 13 miles from our border in accordance with U.N. Resolution 1701, which was passed back in 2006 and Hezbollah flagrantly violated that by moving right up to the Israeli border. Israeli citizens of that border areas will not go back to their homes.

Which couldn't come at a worse time, Jessica, because this is gearing up now. Voting is underway in some of these states. They can't be wasting their time standing outside while Hazmat teams try to make sure that they're not facing potentially poisonous materials in these envelopes. The FBI is investigating. The initial indications are that these packages did not contain anything deadly or poisonous. But, in some respects, the damage has already been done. Listen to this, Jessica.

The Quad Alliance has been at the center of his strategy in the Indo- Pacific as the U.S. is trying to look for ways to counter China's growing influence in the region. Now, as the president was heading into that private meeting, China was at the top of the agenda. The leaders were expected to discuss Beijing's moves, including its aggression in -- aggressive posture in the South China Sea. The leaders are also announcing a number of deliverables from this summit that will include launching their first ever joint Coast Guard mission between the four countries. They are also looking to pre-position more resources in the Indo- Pacific to try to prepare for humanitarian and disaster relief operations. There's also efforts to ramp up and provide more sophisticated technology to countries in the Endo-Pacific trying to monitor illegal activities in their waters, including illegal fishing. And then there's very personal component to all of this for President Biden relating to the Cancer Moon Shot. That's his domestic initiative trying to eradicate cancer. The Quad leaders will actually be announcing a new collaboration between all of their countries, a Quad Cancer Moon Shot specifically aimed at trying to reduce cervical cancer rates in the Indo-Pacific. Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers for women in that area. So these countries want to try to boost up testing, screening, treatment and also vaccinations. The president himself is also putting some personal touches on the summit as he has invited everyone here to his home state of Delaware. He's hosted each of the leaders at his private home for personal meetings between yesterday and this morning. And now the summit is taking place at his high school Archmere Academy. But all of this comes as the president really is trying to cement his foreign policy legacy heading into these final months that he has an office. His team has insisted that he wants to really engaged in this full, complete sprint in these final months to get as much as he can -- can get done on the foreign policy front. And chief among those is continuing to find ways to address and counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Of course, President Biden himself also trying to engage in some potential diplomacy with China. We do expect to see he and President Xi Jinping will be speaking on the phone in the coming weeks. That's something their teams have been working towards. But the White House has been insistent that the president continues to have his eye on the ball on foreign policy, even as his administration is winding down and he's preparing for the next president to take over once they're elected in November.",

He has been seeking this approval to use these long-range weapons, long-range missiles, and not just within Ukraine, but into -- further into Russia.Now, the president, just a few weeks ago, said that they were still working through whether that is something that they would be willing to allow. Because these weapons are provided by the U.S. and other Western countries, there would need to be some us sign-off. So at least by saying that they're working through that, it shows that there could be some openness on the president's part relating to that. Now, President Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris is also expected to meet with him. So we believe that will be a key focus as Zelenskyy is insisting that the use of these long-range weapons deep into Russia will be key to their victory plan as they've been fighting this war now for years.",
