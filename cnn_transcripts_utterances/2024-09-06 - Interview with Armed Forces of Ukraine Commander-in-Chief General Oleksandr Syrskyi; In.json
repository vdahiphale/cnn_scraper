I'm Bianna Golodryga, New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin in Ukraine, and with Christiane's world exclusive interview with the country's top military commander. In her first television interview since he was appointed commander-in-chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi spoke about the strategy behind the Kursk offensive, the status of the city of Pokrovsk, low morale among Ukrainian troops, and much more. The interview comes at a crucial time in the war, with the country hit by a wave of enormously heavy attacks, from the east to the western City of Lviv. Vladimir Putin this week said that his main aim is now to capture the Eastern Donbass area and that his army, quote, \"has accelerated its offensive operations.\" Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government is undergoing major changes with the biggest cabinet reshuffle this week since February of 2022. Christiane sat down with General Syrskyi for a wide-ranging interview held at an undisclosed location near the front line. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In Poltava, more than 50 people. Strikes all across the country. SYRSKYI (through translator):  I believe that Russia is trying to force us to give up and break our will to resist by hitting our civilian objects and damaging civilian infrastructure. By targeting our civilians in this way, they are trying to break our will to win.",

Tell me from your words and your view, what was the strategic purpose of the Ukrainian operation into Russian Kursk? SYRSKYI (through translator):  First, the enemy, Russian troops, had previously intended to use the Kursk direction as a foothold for further operations against our troops. In addition, they continued to shell our settlements daily, which caused us to suffer losses, primarily among the civilian population. For us, this direction was always a threat. Therefore, in assessing our capabilities, we chose the weakest point in the enemy's defense and the enemy's structure, and this direction was chosen. This reduced the threat of an enemy offensive. We prevented them from acting. We moved the fighting to the enemy's territory so that he could feel what we feel every day. And we created our own security zone in the Kursk region. In addition, we took a sufficient number of prisoners. We created an exchange fund in order to release our military personnel who are in captivity.",

They have much more air superiority, for instance, more drones, they have more missile capability, they have more artillery capability. How do you assess the difference between what you have and what they have, and how do you make up for that difference? SYRSKYI (through translator):  You are absolutely right. Because the enemy does have an advantage in aviation, in missiles, in artillery, in the amount of ammunition they use, of course, in personnel, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, but this also motivates us. We cannot fight in the same way as they do. So, we must use, first of all, the most effective approach, use our forces and means with maximum use of terrain features, engineering structures, and also, to use technical superiority. First of all, by focusing on high-tech weapons. These are primarily unmanned aerial systems for various purposes. You know that we have created the world's first such kind of troops as the Unmanned Systems Forces. We have created a command, we have created units, we have created regiments, we have created battalions, which are now proving their effectiveness in various parts of the front line. Our best unmanned systems units are concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector. In addition, of course, we use maneuvers with force, reserves, and fire. Thanks to the actions of our government, the president of Ukraine, the minister of defense, we managed to reduce the difference between the ammunition used by us and the enemy. The proportion is actually one to two, one to 2.5. A year ago, this figure was one to 10, one to six. We compensate for this difference with unmanned systems. We are constantly working on improving them. Increasing their efficiency, improving the control system, ways and methods of usage. We are trying to maximize our technical superiority over the enemy to offset their superiority in terms of numbers.",

And you said when you took this job that one of the issues that you have to do is make sure you can replenish your ranks, draft, whatever it is, get more, more, more Ukrainians to fight.

They're these glide bombs, these terrifying things, and the drones. And there's just so much. I mean, it's almost World War I kind of, you know, attacks on them in the trenches. And they're there for a long time with no real hope of rotation. What do they say to you when you go to see them and talk to them? SYRSKYI (through translator):  We speak the same language. We understand each other no matter who I am talking to, whether it is an ordinary soldier, a rifleman for example or a brigade commander or a battalion commander. You know that I have been in this war since 2014. Since the beginning of the full-scale aggression, I have been participating in combat operations as the commander of the operational and strategic group. Now, I am the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That is, the front line is my life. We understand each other. I know all the problems that our servicemen, soldiers, and officers experience. Despite the difficult situation, we continue to carry out rotations. We didn't stop this process even when Avdiivka was happening, when there were perhaps more difficult times. The issue of rotations remains a priority for us. Of course, people get exhausted and need rest. That is why the units are either withdrawn to the rear for rest or sent to training centers, where they spend a month or a month and a half recuperating. In this way, people restore their combat capabilities, their moral and mental state, and get the opportunity to visit their families and friends.",

Especially when it comes to the formation of new units, or when a unit is formed and there is no equipment, no weapons, how should we perceive it? You plan to use a mechanized brigade, but, in fact, you use it as an infantry brigade. As a result, its combat capabilities and effectiveness are much lower.",

Of course, we will use weapons only against military targets, primarily against missile systems that strike populated areas almost daily. This leads to the loss of civilian lives. You know how many schools and hospitals have been destroyed in Ukraine. Of course, these are the airfields from which the strike aircraft of the Russian army, their aerospace forces, use missile weapons, use their guided aircraft bombs with gliding modules, which they drop to 70 kilometers or even more. And again, they hit schools and populated areas. These are the targets. Of course, we will use long-range weapons against these targets.

After successfully pushing the Russians back from Kyiv, and then there was, you know, the success in Kharkiv and success in Kherson, since then, it's been much more difficult and you haven't done as much as you perhaps were expected to do. What do you expect? How do you expect the war to go for Ukraine over the next six months, for instance? SYRSKYI (through translator):  It is difficult to predict for such a long period of time, but of course, we plan combat operations, we plan campaigns, we make appropriate calculations of our capabilities, the capabilities of the armed forces, our needs. And of course, we are committed to victory. And the help of our partners, our allies, would help us a lot. It would help us a lot if all restrictions on the use of weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation against military targets, I repeat, not against the civilian population, against military targets were lifted. The planned deliveries of weapons and equipment would allow us to bring our new brigades, which have already been formed and are in the process of being formed into service as soon as possible. Of course, this would have an impact on the overall level of our capabilities. That's how I see it. That is, only in the fight can we win. And we are all determined to win. And again, the Kursk operations show that victory is the incentive that boosts the morale of our military and our entire population. That's the only way to do it and no other way.",

I'll point to one other. In the Black Sea, the Ukrainians have made a devastating use of naval drones to effectively drive the Russian Black Sea fleet out of Sevastopol and to reopen the sea lanes of black of the Black Sea for Ukrainian grain exports. If you'd asked me two years ago or a year ago whether the Ukrainians would be able to defeat the Russians in the control of the Black Sea and restore their ability to export ship after ship after ship of Ukrainian food products to the world, I would have said it was very unlikely.

As you referenced, we saw it in the 2016 election cycle at scale. We did not see it in 2018 because there was some significant investment and activity by our Intelligence Community at pushing back on exactly the Russian actors who've been so engaged in 2016. We did deter some of that activity in 2020. But we have to be vigilant. We have to be constantly engaged cycle after cycle. And there's a number of bills in Congress that I hope we will move to try and prevent the use of artificial intelligence to generate what are called deep fakes, profoundly misleading audio and video messages that we've seen influence elections in other countries, in other democracies, in Taiwan, for example, in Slovakia. Earlier in this season, there was a deep fake of Joe Biden calling primary voters in New Hampshire, and that should have been enough of an alarm to get us to move off the dime.

Rachel Wiseman and Anastasia Berg explore the reasons for this global trend in their new book, \"What Are Children For?: On Ambivalence and Choice.\" They join Michel Martin to discuss.

And what we found was that, especially for liberals and progressives around the world, we have forces that are encouraging them to delay thinking about the question of children and, in fact, that are alienating them from the prospect of having children. And these include narratives of personal, romantic, and professional success that all demand that we reach certain kinds of levels of readiness. So, stability in our careers, certainty in our romantic relationships before we even ask the question of children. And at the same time, we have ethical pressures, especially those that are coming out of climate change debates that are making us question whether or not we can so much as justify having children given the present realities.",

So, basically, the idea that it's basically an economic issue at the heart of it. But, Rachel, your research indicates that even in countries that have those things, birth rates are declining, can you dig into that a little bit more?",

What we have found is that many people don't necessarily know why they're not having kids. The question is so fraught and so difficult to determine, even for oneself. So, it was very important for us to conduct both qualitative, which means open-ended question surveys that we've done with hundreds of millennials and Gen Z-ers years, and then we followed up with several dozen interviews where we engaged in conversations where we could explore the narratives, the explanations and the stories that people were giving that are related to this question.",

Well, he used this phrase, childless cat ladies to say that, you know, the Democratic Party is run by childless cat ladies. The implication being that they're selfish and weird, right?

And it's also worth adding that when people survey today are asked, what are the kind of conditions for a fulfilling life? They name many things as high priorities that are not consistent with what we think of as selfishness. People rate political activism and, quote/unquote, making the world a better place as one of the things that are necessary to lead a fulfilling life.

For my mother's generation, it was almost considered a given that, you know, she would want to become a parent. It was kind of an opt out situation versus an opt in situation. Whereas for young people today, they really feel like they need to be able to give a reason for why they want to have children, to have all of that figured out.

And the way I tend to hear that question is whether or not there's a possibility for liberals and progressives,i.e., those who are staunchly in support of reproductive rights for women to embrace having children as an unconditional good or something that's inherently good, not just one project among many that we should tolerate like we tolerate people's hobbies. I think that is possible. And I think one key to that is to notice that all the kind of goals that are identified with the left, if it's mitigating climate change, if it's introducing lasting social change, if it's healing our political system, if it's creating welfare in the nation, all these projects and pursuits, which are the definition of the liberal and progressive robust human future, they presuppose a human future, i.e., they presuppose that people will do their share in bringing about future generations. Now, that means that some people will have biological children. It also means that other people will be contributing to that human future in other ways, they will be political activists, they will be teachers, they will be journalists, they'll be mentors, they'll be godparents. Rachel's the godparent to my children, for example. So, there are many ways of doing that. But I think once we notice that having children is the bedrock of a robust human future, no matter how exactly we envision it, that is the key to that middle ground that you ask about. That's the key to realizing that embracing -- not just tolerating, but fully embracing the choice to have children and to raise them is not inconsistent with defending women's rights to choose their own reproductive agendas and fates for themselves.",

And the second thing I'd like to see is in our educational environment, giving us an opportunity to raise what we haven't discussed so far, which is the question of the worth of human life in the present and in the future. We see increased doubt, novels, and film representations today give us an image of ourselves as listless, as selfish, as incredibly self- absorbed, a kind of image that really does raise the question of do we deserve a human future?
