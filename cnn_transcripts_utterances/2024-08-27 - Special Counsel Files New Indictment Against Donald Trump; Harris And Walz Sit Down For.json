      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news tonight, a new indictment for Donald Trump. Special counsel Jack Smith with a brand new filing just coming out tonight before a major deadline, changing the legal scene tonight. Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb is OUTFRONT. And more breaking news this hour, Harris and Walz announced their first joint interview here on CNN. So what's going to happen? Plus, did RFK, Jr. commit a felony? Kennedy's daughter says he once beheaded a whale driving it from Massachusetts to New York on the roof of a minivan. Environmentalists are saying he broke the law, a bizarre tale. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: the breaking news, a new indictment for Donald J. Trump. In a total surprise to Trump, apparently, he was given absolutely no warning, special counsel Jack Smith filed this. This is the new indictment and now all in its 36 pages. It indicts Trump for January 6. So you might when you hear me say that be a surprise as Trump, thinking, didn't the Supreme Court say that Trump had immunity and shoot this entire case down? Went into the garbage? Well, yes, except in this indictment, Smith says its going to hold up to the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. It is not as long. Okay. Like I mentioned, 36 pages, the original indictment that Smith had filed that fell to the immunity decision from the Supreme Court was 45 pages. But 36 pages is still a lot. And in this, Smith stands by the four original crucial counts that Trump faced, which include conspiracy to defraud the United States. So this is crucial to emphasize those four core charges are still there, just to make the significance clear, we looked it up in the maximum prison sentence of those four counts combined, the maximum, is 55 years in prison. So, that makes it clear what Smith says will hold under the Supreme Court's immunity decision, 55 years. So to bolster his claim that this revised indictment holds and is consistent with that Supreme Court ruling granting broad immunity to president, Smith added new sections to try to show that Trumps acts on January 6 were unofficial. Unofficial is the crucial word that the Supreme Court used to say -- to say that unofficial acts of a sitting president can be prosecuted. So, Smith went back, looked at it and said, all right, I'm going to show you how these counts that could send someone to prison for 55 years were an official. In one new section he does that by writing, quote, throughout the conspiracies, although the defendants sometimes used his Twitter account to communicate with the public as president about official actions and policies. He also regularly used it for personal purposes, including to spread knowingly false claims of election fraud, exhort his supporters to travel to Washington, D.C. on January 6, pressure the vice president and misuse his ceremonial role in the certification proceeding and leverage the events at the Capitol on January 6 to unlawfully retain power. And then at another point, Smith writes, the defendant continued his lies through the day of the certification proceeding on January 6. That morning, the defendant gave a campaign speech at a privately funded, privately organized political rally on the ellipse in Washington, D.C. So you hear those words, personal purposes, privately funded, privately organized, unofficial acts. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT in Washington. And, Evan, the special counsel making these changes emphasizing this unofficial nature, but keeping those four charges that carry such a serious -- serious level of penalty if convicted, and surprise Trump with this filing today.",

You know, there were many who thought this might go away forever, or in large part. But this is a surprise filing and the foreign key charges are still there, that that would carry a combined 55 years in maximum prison time if someone were to be convicted of them. So this surprises Trump today. What are you learning about how he find out -- how he found out and what he's doing right now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Erin, surprised. The legal team also surprised -- the senior political team around the former president. And what's interesting to your point, there kind of been a sense and being on the campaign trail with him last week, especially that this was kind of in the rearview, was not a focal point as it had been for so many months leading up to the general election, of any of his campaign speeches, he would mention it in passing, sometimes particularly the Florida case that had been dismissed, Jack Smith's classified documents case.But it was not central despite the fact his rally-goers, his supporters are very much behind him on this issue. That seems like it's likely to change in the weeks ahead, as one Trump adviser, close associate told me we have a playbook for this. It's not necessarily a playbook they wanted to discover, but it's certainly one they found to be quite effective during the Republican primary when the former presidents steamrolled his Republican opponents and really kind of found himself at the height of power within the Republican Party, despite this being the third time he has been the nominee. And we've already seen some of that playbook rollout. You saw the former President respond on social media at length at one point and then a stream of responses since then. We've also seen the campaign already blast out a fundraising request that says, I will, quote, never surrender very similar language to what we saw throughout his legal issues earlier in the year. And that's important right now, particularly given his current opponent has raised more than half $1 since Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Now, I should note, the former president says that this is something that's being driven by the Vice President Kamala Harris. There's no evidence of that, just as there was never any evidence that Joe Biden was driving these cases. But once again, it is similar language, similar framing, and a similar effort to elevate something that for most politicians would be a significant problem. The real question going forward, this will likely be a focal point of some of those campaign trail remarks in the weeks ahead, willing he make appearances at the courthouse. Will the rest of the playbook rollout as it had before? That's an open question, but certainly we've seen a lot of this before.",

And so, lets go to Ty Cobb now, former Trump White House lawyer. Ty, you've had a chance to read through these 36 pages, obviously slimmed down just a little bit, not much, nine pages fewer than the original indictment filed last year. Keeping those four key charges and editing, emphasizing that it is in a personal private capacity under which Smith has the authority to make this indictment. Did he do it?

And I think the people that view this as a rescue or as, you know, some retreat by Smiths read this completely wrong. This is -- what happens in the ordinary course, if the Supreme Court takes an action that eliminates our approach that was previously available, you know, the prudent thing to do is to change course. The facts haven't changed. And as you pointed out, the charges haven't changed. They are the same charges and there are easily proved. BURNETT:  Right. And, of course, we should emphasize, as Evan did, it was a different grand jury, so there wasn't -- you know, there's no bias or prejudice by them and what they were looking at, new group of people looked at a new indictment and they came to a very clear conclusion that it was -- but it should go ahead.

This is a billionaire with 100 kids live in the life in Dubai.You know, it begs the question, why would you go someplace we are going to be arrested and possibly spend the next 20 years in prison? Phillips O'Brien raises the point, maybe its because you thought it was your best option, if you were choosing between that and some sort of death at the hands of Putin security services. Do you think there's anything to that possibly? Or is that conspiracy?",

I saw it. I was upfront and close witness to it while in Moscow, but I think from Putin's perspective, it's really her experience. He wouldn't want a Margaret Thatcher in the Oval Office and he doesn't know what he's going to get with a President Harris. So it's interesting question though.",
