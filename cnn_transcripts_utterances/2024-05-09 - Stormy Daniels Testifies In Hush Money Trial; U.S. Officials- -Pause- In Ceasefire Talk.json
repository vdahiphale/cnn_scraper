As U.S. President Joe Biden tells CNN, he will stop supplying certain weapons to Israel, which he acknowledged have killed civilians in Gaza in the past if the IDF goes forward and invades Rafah. This as sources tell CNN there is a pause now in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, as Israel steps up that military operation in Rafah. We do begin though in New York as former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial continues after quite a dramatic and sometimes contentious morning in court. Stormy Daniels, the woman at the heart of this trial and a key witness, returned to the stand this morning to continue a contentious, battling cross-examination. For three hours and six minutes, Trump's defense team tried to undermine her credibility, poke holes in her story, prove that she was only after money. Madeleine Westerhout, former director of Oval Office operations, personal secretary to President Donald Trump, is now on the stand. Katelyn Polantz joins us now. Katelyn, first take us through this morning and that contentious cross-examination as defense attorneys tried to, well, poke holes in not just her story, but in her credibility.",

Good to have you both on. And, Areva, I'm going to begin with you. Clearly, defense attorneys have a job and it's a reasonable job to call into question the credibility of a key witness here. The question is particularly in a jury trial with a woman on the stand, what you felt about how they went about that today, was it too personal? Was it too -- I don't know if demeaning is the right word. I mean, did it become so contentious as to -- as to damage the defense case here?",

Do you think it would have been smarter for the defense to take that course?

      "sentences": "Bingo. Good to be with you, Jim, and Areva. Listen, this was designed specifically and only not for the jury, but for Donald Trump. So let's first answer the question as to what would have been smarter to do. Obviously, what is the case about? The case is about whether or not invoices are falsified, right, records, ledgers, et cetera. What does she know about that? What value can she add for that?The smart place to make it clear, ma'am, you have no knowledge with respect to how bookkeeping is done. You have no sense of how the Trump Organization operates, do you? You have no information that can aid in this jury in making those determinations, would that be fair to say? Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Next witness. However, what I think today was about even, Jim, because this cross was done yesterday. You have everything you need. What is the purpose of cross? Not to get too inside baseball, to make your closing argument. So if the purpose of crosses to make your closing argument, you go in front of the jury and you say she had she hates my client. She hates the president. Well, it said what you have to tell anything other than what's true. But today, I think what they wanted to do was to try to humiliate her, right, and to try to call into question is relating to the affair because their boss, Mr. Trump, was hopefully, woefully upset, disappointed. How can you allow that? So, they came in not to add any value to the jury of 12, but to add to the jury of one. There was no need at all to go at it any further. This was done, but they needed to do it because of the fact their boss said so. And that's what today was about.",

So she knows what its like to be on both sides of the case, both as a prosecutor and a defense attorney.And by keeping her redirect fairly short, she sent a message to the jury that she he had gotten all the testimony she needed from this witness, and that this witness was in fact credible. I think she did a really good job. She didn't overextend which is what Joey talked about in terms of what the defense attorneys did today. You can exhaust a topic. You can start to bore and irritate jurors. Jurors' times are -- their time is very precious. They don't want to be in that courtroom any longer than they have to be. So lawyers have to be very sensitive to their feelings about their time and not go into extraneous and unnecessary testimony and definitely don't be redundant or repetitive.

But I think you've had witnesses to speak to the fact that this is a micromanager.This is a guy that knows what's going on. He knows what time it is. And I think that the theory of the case, conspiracy cover up. That's been the theme of the prosecutor since the outset, that'll be the theme to the conclusion of this. And the defense is certainly went at it. They've done their job, they've been doing a value in java trying to predict check their client. But I think at the end of the day, there's that major connection, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape number one, Jim, very briefly, the payoff of Stormy Daniels in connection to the election itself and happening in the aftermath of the \"Access Hollywood\", you have the checks and the ledgers all into evidence. You have Donald Trump personal bank account being paid paying these checks. I think you connect the dots and it would seemingly establish that there was a conspiracy and a cover-up business records were falsified. The intent was to change the outcome of the election to hide it from voters. And at the end of the day, you could talk about Stormy Daniels, but that's what we're here for, their ledgers, the invoices, the rest.",

He said, Israel is ready to stand alone if necessary, and quote, we will fight with our fingernails if we have to. We also heard from the military spokesperson Daniel Hagari of the IDF, and he said that Israel has the weapons that it needs in order to carry out its projected offensive in Rafah, didn't give any details about that though.
