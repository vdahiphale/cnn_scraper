Sources close to the president are telling CNN, President Biden is hoping to project a sense of calmness as the chaos plays out on Capitol Hill. Biden urging House Republicans to quickly elect a new speaker following the ousting of Kevin McCarthy so they can get back to work and address a number of issues important to the American people, like a long-term spending bill to keep the government from shutting down and funding to help Ukraine in its war with Russia.CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us now from the White House. Arlette, what's the Biden administration's sort of biggest concern as they're watching what is playing out, this unprecedented moment on Capitol Hill?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, President Biden is facing the reality of soon working with a new speaker. And that could have serious impacts on some of the immediate priorities facing this White House, especially when it comes to trying to secure more aid for Ukraine.Now, the White House has been quite careful with how they've reacted to the drama surrounding former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and this upcoming speaker's race, simply saying that the president wants them to act in a speedy manner. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean- Pierre, last night, saying in a statement, quote, \"because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a speaker. Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker, he looks forward to working together with them and with the Senate to address the American people's priorities.\" For the president's part, he is trying to stick to business as usual today. His focus being -- announcing this additional $9 billion in student debt relief that the administration has approved. But you have seen the White House, over the course of the past few weeks, really trying to highlight some -- what they are calling this split screen, with what the president's been trying to do and some of the dysfunction occurring up on Capitol Hill, including, as that government funding fight played out. Yesterday, you saw Biden's campaign tweeting out a split screen, saying while the president was focused on Medicare negotiations for certain drugs, the House GOP was focused on toppling their existing House speaker that they had elected. But there are some serious challenges facing the White House when you think of what needs to get done over the course of the next two months. They need to fund the government. That next deadline is looming about six weeks away. And then the White House is still trying to push for additional aid to Ukraine. Now, the White House has stressed that they believe that the support is there among Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate, but this could all hinge on who exactly the next speaker is and how they decide to proceed with an additional vote on Ukraine aid. So, these are things that the White House will certainly be watching in the coming days as they also try to adapt their own strategies to the future House speaker.",

But right now two of the leading candidates to replace him would be current Majority Leader Steve Scalise and chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan, who are both seen as perhaps more hardline than Kevin McCarthy. So, how are you better off with either of them as speaker than Kevin McCarthy? KUSTERLook, this disarray, the dysfunction that Kevin McCarthy frankly created when he agreed to the rules change back in January, you remember the 15 votes to try to get his speakership, he agreed to so many changes by caving in to the far-right extremists. And look at the chaos that has been, you know, brought down on the American people right now. So, I think there's an option here. We can work together. We can work in a bipartisan way.

Only a few days later, he went to Mar-a-Lago, stood with the former president, and from that point on he caved time after time after time again to this extreme faction. And I think what we need is a speaker, of whatever stripes, that's going to stand up for the institution, for Congress, working for the American people, and not lurching from one crisis to the next to the next.",

And it continues with the wing of their party that wants to take this institution down, that doesn't care about governing, and we need to get back on track. We have bills - let me give you a good example. The National Defense Authorization passed out of committee, I think the vote was 45-1, and it was a Democrat actually that voted against it.

Still, a lot of questions remain.We can tell you that five young people, 18 to 22 years old, were wounded in this shooting, four of them Morgan State students. All expected to survive. No life-threatening injuries as of late last night. It is quiet on the campus this morning. Classes are canceled. And, look, this is supposed to be a joyous time here at Morgan State. It's homecoming week. In fact, when this all unfolded last night, students were coming out of a big event where they were crowning Mr. And Ms. Morgan State University, an event that draws in families, alumni, and students were headed to a students center, another building, when shots rang out on the campus outside. Police on patrol hearing those shots, running in and finding those wounded students. And that is when this frantic search for a gunman unfolded, it began. SWAT teams combing through buildings, going room to room as students were told to shelter in place for hours. It is a tense time here as a shooter remains potentially on the loose. We heard from Baltimore's mayor late last night about the shooting. Here's what they told us.
