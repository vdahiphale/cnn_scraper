John and Kate out this morning. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. JIMENEZ:  All right, everyone, for the second month in a row Donald Trump has pulled in more campaign donations than President Biden. After a massive hall in the immediate aftermath of his criminal conviction in his hush money trial, Trump ended May with a staggering $141 million. Biden and the Democratic Party fell well short of that, even though they raised more than $85 million last month. CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us now for more on this. So Jeff, what do the numbers tell us here? Because obviously we're talking about a lot here.",

But very interesting, in the filings we have been poring over the Trump campaign has essentially erased the Biden cash advantage. This has been something that's been consistent month by month by month, President Biden and his team have outraised the Trump campaign. That changed in an instant around the time of Trumps guilty verdict back just to last month.Take a look at these numbers just from the month of May, as you were saying. The Biden campaign raised at $85 million. The Trump campaign raise $141 million. Many of those were through small-dollar donations, the Trump campaign says, was because of people are registering their concern, their outrage over that conviction. Now, what we don't know exactly is how much the Trump campaign has on hand at this moment. The Biden campaign going into June has a cash on hand of $212 million. They've already been spending much of that in battleground states in a big advertising campaign. The Trump campaign has spent far less than that. But there is no doubt heading into the summer months, the last of four-and-a-half months of the election, if you will, there is essential parity. Perhaps not a big surprise, and money was never going to be the driving factor of this race. Both sides will have a lot. But certainly, the Trump campaign erasing that financial advantage is one sort of hurdle they have climbed here. The question is going forward, how will they spend that money? Will they save it for legal fees, or will they invest it in television advertising campaigns as well?",

POLANTZ: Yes, Steve Bannon convicted two years ago on contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over information in that January 6 investigation, and he is going to prison. His report date is July 1. He is set to go to the Federal Prison in Danbury, Connecticut, and he is trying to get out of that or hold it off. It is not happening as of right now. A trial judge says he needs to go to prison, serve his time, four months, and now an Appeals Court as of last night, Sara, also said the same. Bannon is not very happy about a lot of things right now as that date approaches. It is possible he tries with the Supreme Court as well, but he is out there on his podcast, at speeches with conservatives talking about how there is going to be retribution for political opponents or perceived political enemies of Donald Trump. He said specifically about Andrew McCabe, one of the former top FBI officials in the Trump era, we are going to come and get you.

But that's a hard thing to explain to your family when their thinking, basically they don't want to have to live in this kind of fear and terror for another four years. What is really, to me, shocking and disgusting about the rhetoric is what it says about who we are becoming as a nation and the fact that a person who is quite possibly the next president of the United States is engaging in this level of absolutely fundamentally, anti-democratic rhetoric and behavior and ideation. Everything he says, it stands in direct contrast to the nation that we think we are, the nation that we have always been.

Obviously, there have been tons of special counsels who have beenappointed in the past in various forms and there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits that.

In both instances, they were convicted and there is really no sound legal basis for Bannon to put this off.

But certainly, I think this will be welcome news for the White House who has for so long been trying to neutralize this issue of immigration. It is a major political vulnerability for President Biden, and they have been trying so hard, really over the last several years to show that they have control over what is going on, on the southern border, and these new numbers do reflect significant decreases from some of those highs that we saw earlier in the Biden administration. Now, this new asylum rule that the president announced a few weeks ago, it essentially allows the president to shut down the border to asylum seekers when the number of people crossing reaches a certain level, 2,500 per day. That level has been reached well before the president made this announcement. So it essentially went into effect right away. It hasn't been universally popular.
