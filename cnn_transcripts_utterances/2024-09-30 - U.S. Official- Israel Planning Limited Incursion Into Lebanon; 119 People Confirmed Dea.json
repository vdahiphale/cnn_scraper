The U.S. believes that Israel could imminently launch a more limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon than what was originally planned, this is according to U.S. official. Satellite images provided to CNN by a source show around 100 IDF military vehicles gathered at a site near the Lebanon border.Sources also say that Israel Israeli Defense Forces have already carried out small raids into Lebanese territory, trying to prep for this larger incursion.

      "sentences": "The ground incursion would be Israel's latest advance against Hezbollah, which began intensifying its cross border attacks on Israel on October 8th in support of Hamas. And after days of bombardment on Lebanon, Israel executed a rare strike today inside the capital city of Beirut. The strikes follow the killing of Hezbollah's top leader, Hassan Nasrallah on Friday.Joining us now is Hagar Chemali, who served as the director for Syria and Lebanon on the National Security Council. She was also a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. Hagar, thank you so much for being with us. Sources are indicating that the smaller raids are part of preparation for a ground incursion by the IDF. What do you think that would look like? HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER DIRECTOR FOR SYRIA &amp; LEBANON, WH NATL. SECURITY COUNCIL: Sure, well, I -- I wouldn't be surprised that the ground invasion goes through because the Israeli government has been saying that they're going to pursue this now for the last couple weeks. And the way it would look, to be honest, it's hard to see -- it's hard to know for sure how far into Lebanon they're going to go. It's clear that they view Hezbollah as significantly weakened, and they are. Even for me, I worked in counterterrorism. I -- Hezbollah was in my portfolio. We have all been in the U.S. government. We had all been preparing for the showdown between Hezbollah and Israel since 2006 and expecting that when that would happen, it would be significant and enormous. But over the last 11 months, Israel has really diminished Hezbollah's well as military capabilities, and certainly its military mil -- it's -- its leadership and its organizational and communication capabilities. That said, their goal is to create this buffer zone in the south, a buffer zone that the U.N. has supposedly been supposed to be maintaining and the Lebanese Armed Forces as well. But clearly they failed at that mission. And so their goal is to create this buffer zone to ensure that the North remains safe. But that said, it's just, it's still hard to see their end game, their exit strategy, and how far into Lebanon they would go given that they know Hezbollah is this weakened.",

      "sentences": "When it comes to Israel's ability to defend multiple fronts, I wonder what you think their capacity is, because after October 7th, we talked about Israel potentially fighting a multi front war, defending against the Houthis in Yemen, obviously, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Now that it appears that they're ready to move into Lebanon, what are they able to do? CHEMALIBut it's clear that they view their operations in Gaza as -- as winding down, or certainly moving to a lower intensity phase of the war, that they feel that they've significantly dismantled Hamas's military capabilities, which I would agree with. The U.S. administration has said that as well. And their -- their view, and -- and they're turning their attention toward Lebanon at this moment, again, for the longest time, they had lived in this tit for tat world with Hezbollah, where they were exchanging this fire, and both, neither seemed to want a full scale war. Now Israel has pursued -- has -- has pursued this escalation because they want to return their citizens to the north, and they feel very concerned that the land in the north is empty, that that undermines the integrity of their territory, and could risk Hezbollah pursuing a ground invasion, just as -- as Hamas did on October 7th. But that said, there also seems to be a different calculation that has shaped -- changed along this war, which is that Israel is pursuing this the way you had the -- the series of big wars in its history, 1967, 1973, 1948, those wars, they change in length of time, but those wars all fundamentally changed the situation on the ground. And it's clear that the Netanyahu government changed its mind as they were able to dismantle Hez -- Hezbollah threat over the last 11 months. And clearly they view this as an opportunity to really undermine Hezbollah once and for all, so that they don't have to return to the status quo before October 7th.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It is a little ineffectual. Sometimes -- I understand, sometimes it feels like it can sound as though they're on another planet, because they're pushing this ceasefire, and they keep repeating this publicly, and yet neither Israel nor Hamas nor Hezbollah, none of them want a ceasefire. At the moment, they've made that. All of them have made that very clear. And -- and the U.S. knows that.At the same time, it is a worthwhile effort. The United States stop pushing for a ceasefire, even if that means they have to drag both sides to the table, kicking and screaming, because the risk of an all- out regional war, even though, I, like I said, I don't think Iran will get involved, but nonetheless, that risk is heightened, and that's certainly not in the U.S. interest. So they need to continue those efforts, even though they don't believe that it will happen before the election. And also, we have the hostages at stake, right? The hostages are still there, seven of whom are American. Four of them are -- are presumed to be alive. And so the U.S. has to continue pushing for that ceasefire -- ceasefire, and trying to -- to sway Netanyahu for in favor of -- of what the U.S. deems that in -- in -- and not just in the U.S. national security interest, but in interest of Israel's long term security. They have to keep trying, even if it's becoming increasingly more difficult, at some point they will be ready for a ceasefire.",
