Because I don't think we have a sub big enough to recover the \"Titan\" whole. I think we only have something that can attach a hook and then hopefully raise the \"Titan.\"",

With me is Daniel Strauss, senior political correspondent for \"The New Republic.\" Daniel, you have some very interesting new reporting, and what it does is it details the safety issues raised by one of the former employees in particular. Take us through what was raised? DANIEL STRAUSS, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW REPUBLIC\": The employee was David Lockridge. According to court documents which we obtained, in early January 2018, Lockridge voiced concerns about the integrity of the hull, the depth at which the craft could reach. There was a difference between 4,000 feet, which is the amount that it was supposed to reach, and 1,300 feet, which is the amount it was supposed to reach. As well as -- (CROSSTALK)",
