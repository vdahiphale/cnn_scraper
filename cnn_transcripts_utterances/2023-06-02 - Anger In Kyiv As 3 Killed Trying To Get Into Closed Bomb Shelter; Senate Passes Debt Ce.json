Meanwhile, only President Biden's signature is needed now to end the long political fight to suspend the nation's debt ceiling and avoid the first ever default in U.S. history. Late Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted 63 to 36 to pass the critical legislation after it cleared the U.S. House the day before. Following the vote, the president publicly thanked the leaders of both parties for making it happen. Mr. Biden is expected to address the nation from the Oval Office on Friday evening to explain more about it. We get the latest from now from CNN Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER (on camera): Well, after weeks of intense negotiations, and with just days to go before the default deadline, Congress has averted an economic disaster. The Senate on Thursday night passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling until 2025. And also limit future spending. And the final vote tally in the Senate was 63 to 36. They needed 60 Republicans and Democrats to come together to pass this bill and they did. Take a listen to Chuck Schumer talking about this bill after the vote. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): So many of the destructive provisions in the Republican bill are gone. Because we persist it. And we kept insisting that default is off the table. We will not be defaulting. And we will not be passing the hard rights extreme agenda, virtually no part of it. And that is thanks to the Senate and House Democrats and to President Biden.",

But, you know, now you've got leaders on both sides lauding the averting of catastrophe. Is there enough for both sides to claim a win or at least not a loss? MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that's the inevitable part of politics is that you claim victory no matter what. I think President Biden has reason to be pleased. He basically was able to protect most of the accomplishments he's achieved in the first couple of years. But more than that, he got a two-year reprise. We will not have to face this until after the 2024 election. And that's big for Biden, because a lot of Republicans wanted to use that issue in the '24 election as a sledgehammer to beat up President Biden. So he got some good things.

They need to reinvest into expanding and future proofing the resettlement program, so that they're less vulnerable when crises appear. Also creating new pathways to help bring Afghan refugees to safety like humanitarian admissions, human pathways, labor mobility pathways, family reunification. There's a very broad range of tools available. But regarding the schemes in place, governments should take a lot more steps to make them more flexible, more accessible, and more transparent. And besides that of course, governments need to uphold access to asylum and dignified reception for those who arrive in the E.U. territory.

So certainly at the end, (INAUDIBLE) response to refugees from Ukraine across Europe. We have been, you know, operational in many European countries. Seeing how civil society has rallied together. How citizens have stepped in, how governments have very quickly granted a durable and clear legal status for temporary protection, how the E.U. has coordinated their response. Now this is not to say that the response was without problems. There have been many challenges but it does show what is possible when the political decision is made to welcome.

And these are countries that have long hosted the vast majority, about 90 percent of Afghan refugees, worldwide, many more Afghans with other legal status also. And these are also countries that are facing severe domestic challenges.
