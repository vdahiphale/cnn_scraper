Well, after this attack happened yesterday, U.S. officials had told us that it had, all the hallmarks of an ISIS attack, both in terms of how it was carried out with the explosives and the high civilian death toll. And now we have this claim of responsibility by ISIS.[14:05:09] They say that it was carried out by two suicide bombers using suicide vestments. In fact, they say that the bombers were brothers themselves. The statement by ISIS, this claim saying that it was directed at what they called polytheists near the grave of their dead leader, Qasem Soleimani, of course, Iran's most powerful military leader. It was the fourth anniversary of his death yesterday, and you had all these mourners gathering at his gravesite. But this was really a classic sectarian ISIS attack. This was a major target of opportunity with so many people gathered at Soleimani's gravesite, highly symbolic. Directed by this Sunni terror group against the most powerful Shiite country in the region. Soleimani symbolized more than anybody, perhaps, the military power of Iran. He was backing and supporting Iranian-backed groups all across the region that, in fact, would often fight with ISIS and other affiliated groups in the region. So, this really does have all the hallmarks of an ISIS attack. The U.S. very quickly yesterday saying that the U.S. had no responsibility, and that Israel had no responsibility. Of course, Iran is always quick to blame Israel. But given the high tension in the region, the U.S. wanted to make clear that Israel did not have any responsibility here.",

And amid all of that, there has been an intense round of diplomacy, American diplomacy, aimed at trying to prevent those skirmishes from turning into a broader, wider conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, but also to try and search for a longer- term solution.And that is indeed the message that Israeli officials delivered to Amos Hochstein, this envoy for President Biden, who arrived in Israel today for these meetings to try and de-escalate that situation. Yoav Galant, the Defense Minister, as well as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, both telling Hochstein that, look, they want to try and find a diplomatic solution to prevent this situation from escalating further. But one way or the other, they will see the return of those 80,000 Israeli civilians who have had to be displaced from the northern part of Israel from that border with Lebanon to allow them to return to their homes and to have a situation where there are not these constant exchanges of fire. Those 80,000 people have been bringing to bear a lot of pressure on the Israeli government to allow them to return to their homes, to allow them to return to their jobs and their economic activity in that area. But for now, that is impossible because of the fact that we are continuing to see not only these exchanges of fire, but also, of course, as Israel appears to have taken this targeted strike in the suburbs of Beirut against a senior Hamas leader in recent days, risking the possibility of some kind of escalation. For now, that escalation doesn't seem to be in the offing. We've seen those regular exchanges of fire continue, but nothing broader. And so today, Yoav Galant, the defense minister, saying that the window of time, though, for that diplomacy to be able to take effect, to be able to achieve some kind  of a longer-lasting security and peace across the border, that that window of time is closing. And Netanyahu telling Hochstein, according to the Israeli prime minister's office, that whether, through or whether through another way that those civilians will eventually return to that area, that Israel will reestablish some sense of security for those individuals. Of course, a lot of bluster there and very much hinting at the possibility of a military solution to this problem if diplomacy fails.",

I mean, they worked right through the holidays. They were making filings. They're trying to limit defenses Trump can put on. They've also submitted discovery. You would think that some defense attorneys might think, OK, great, I'm going to get a preview of what you're up to. You're not going to get anything from us. That's not the way they see it. They see it as political. [14They're accusing the special counsel of trying to score cheap political points and turning the case into an arm of the Biden campaign by making these arguments, many of which are very critical of former President Trump. Now, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversees this case, she has put all substantive proceedings on hold. It's unclear how she's going to respond to this. She might just say, look, it's fine. If they want to file things, I'm not going to make any decisions. We know, because Jack Smith has told us, that he's doing this because he wants to take this case to trial before November 2024.He hopes, even while this case is on pause, while they resolve larger constitutional questions in the Court of Appeals, he hopes that will be resolved in his favor.

You have both the Colorado Republican Party, Trump lawyers, and the voters who brought this challenge all agreeing that they would like a decision quickly. And particularly the voters who filed this challenge, they have asked the Supreme Court to make a decision on Friday at their regularly scheduled conference about whether they're going to take this up or not. And then how long does it take them to make a decision? See my previous comment, they do what they want, when they want.There's an open question about  whether they'll schedule oral argument. Notably, the Trump lawyers in their petition, they did not ask for oral argument. They asked for a quick review and for them to just overturn the Colorado Supreme Court. So, it's unclear how long it will take for them to hear this case, to consider it. And then what they decide, they could go 12 different ways. But let me tell you, this is certainly the biggest test of Chief Justice John Roberts' career. I mean, these two petitions from the Colorado Republican Party and from Trump, they're arriving at a court that is, you know, they're still reeling from scandals, also some controversial decisions, including overturning Roe. So, he is going to be under enormous pressure, not just to take this case, but to try to build consensus and come up with some sort of narrow ruling that doesn't look partisan and also doesn't look like they're favoring Trump. It is an enormous task, but we don't know when they're going to tell us what they're doing. But, you know, that's just how they roll.",

There's enough going on right now in each of these cases that there's a little bit of truth that Trump can point to as being, you know, this is conspiratorial, that this is election interference.
