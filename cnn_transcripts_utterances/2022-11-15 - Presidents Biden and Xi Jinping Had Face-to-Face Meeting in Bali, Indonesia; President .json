He's due to talk infrastructure with Indonesia's president and has a meeting scheduled with Italy's new Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni. Well, earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the war in Ukraine with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. State media in Beijing report China is calling for a ceasefire and peace talks. Mr. Xi met with President Biden for more than three hours on Monday to discuss Taiwan, North Korea, and a range of other topics. The Chinese leader warned the U.S. not to cross its red line when it comes to Taiwan, but Mr. Biden insisted U.S. policy on the self- governing island has not changed. The White House says the president raised concerns about human rights in China and emphasized cooperation on climate change. Mr. Biden added that he expects competition with China but not conflict.

The president said that he did not find President Xi to be confrontational. Instead, he found him to be like he always finds them, which is open, straightforward. They were able to talk very candidly about the areas where they disagree. And interestingly, the president said that they were also able to talk about areas that they just don't understand each other. Where the red lines are, particularly on Taiwan. And he said afterwards, that they didn't have any misunderstandings -- misunderstandings. And the president said that he did not think that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan was imminent. So, the president was able to learn a number of things from his Chinese counterpart during those three-hour talks. But the president was also very frank that the disputes that the he had with President Xi going into the meeting are still disputes after the meeting. Things like, of course, Taiwan, the restrictions on technology, of course, human rights is always a big one. The president was frank that there was not a, this was not a kumbaya moment thing. Nothing was resolved per se in the meetings themselves. And instead, they have tasked senior level officials to start the diplomacy to begin resolving these things. And so, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to China in the new year. Other cabinet level officials will start talking to their own counterparts to see where they can find areas of common ground. And one key subject that talks will resume on is climate change. And of course, you cannot solve the climate crisis without the United States and China talking, they're the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gas. So, coming out of these talks, it really did, you do -- you got the sense that this was the beginning and that the diplomacy will continue from here and that certainly was what President Biden was hoping to accomplish when he walked in yesterday.

And what they have told us is that its CIA director, Bill Burns went to Ankara to meet with his Russian counterpart to discuss freeing Americans who are detained in Russia. Paul Wheelan, Brittney Griner among them.He also went to discuss risk, specifically nuclear risk, the risk to strategic stability. So, to translate that from diplomatic speak, this was essentially a chance for the Americans to give the Russians a warning about what would happen if they used nuclear weapons. Of course, Russian President Vladimir Putin, he seemed to give a not so veiled threat about using nuclear weapons back in September, though he backed off of that in October thankfully. So, the Americans as of late have been trying to deliver this message however they can. There have been phone calls involving, for instance, national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and now this face to face with Bill Burns, who has commonly been used as an intermediary for the Americans. He's a former Russian ambassador. He speaks Russian. He's also the guy that the Americans dispatched to Moscow before this war ever -- even began to warn Russia about the consequences of invading. Now, what's interesting here is that the Russians at first didn't even confirm that this meeting had taken place at all. Later, they did say, that it took place, but they only said that, look, this was at the invitation of the Americans and they didn't discuss anything about what exactly was talked about. The Turkish side was also eager to confirm that the meeting took place, saying that this is another example of Turkey and President Erdogan trying to broker peace on the international stage. Something that he has really tried to make his focus over the last couple of months. You'll remember that Istanbul previously held peace talks. Now, President Erdogan trying to coax President Putin back to the negotiating table with the Russians. The Russians ostensibly say that, look, they're open to negotiating. The problem is that the Ukrainians don't want to talk, and you have to wonder why the Ukrainians would want to talk given that the momentum seems to be in their court. But the Ukrainians, at least according to a presidential decree that President Zelenskyy signed not long ago, that would rule out the possibility of any kind of negotiations with the Russians after Russia illegally annexed four regions of the country.

Where did those talks end and what comes next in those discussions? ROGINTaiwan. What each side did was present their positions, the U.S. position is that, they want -- that we, the United States does not want to see either side, China or Taiwan unilaterally change the status quo. And China's position is Taiwan is ours and stay out of it. And that's not a negotiation, that's not a discussion. That's just two sides defining their positions. And increasingly, it seems clear that those positions are at odds for each other. Now, President Biden was very clear that he is not changing U.S. policy. He did not repeat his statements that he intends to send U.S. troops to defend Taiwan. Statements that he's made four times publicly in the past. At the same time, it was very clear that Xi Jinping's message was that Taiwan is a core issue to China, that any U.S. interference would be frowned upon. And because the U.S. is not going to stop helping Taiwan and because China is not going to stop being angry about that help, I think the U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan are destined to only increase.",

In September, it topped 80 percent and is forecast to go even higher by year's end. CNN's Rafael Romo reports on the growing frustration in the country.

One of the striking doctors showed CNN his space stub for the month of September, stating a salary in pesos equivalent to just over $760.
