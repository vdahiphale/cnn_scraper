Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Right after the ICC cited unlawful obstruction of humanitarian aid in its request for arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister and defense minister, a senior U.N. official warns it's getting even more difficult to transport food and supplies within the enclave, saying, we are running out of words to describe what is happening in Gaza. Meanwhile, the head of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Northern Gaza says the IDF wants to force it shut, and one shell has landed in the reception and emergency area. These pictures showing people who are trying to flee. The ICC action targeting both Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity has prompted furious condemnation from Israel and the United States. But France and Belgium have broken with those allies by supporting the court, Paris, backing its \"independence and the right -- and the fight against impunity in all situations.\" Bestselling author and historian Yuval Noah Harari has been thinking deeply on his homeland even the possibility of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Asking in an op-ed for the F.T., is there a way out of the Israeli-Palestinian trap? And he's joining me now. Yuval Noah Harari, it is always good to have you on this program.",

I hear, you know, all this anti-Zionist propaganda that people equate Zionism with racism without understanding what Zionism means. Zionism is simply the term for Jewish nationalism. It's just the simple idea that the Jews constitute the people, a nation, and as such, they have not just individual rights, but also a collective right to self-determination. This is the only thing that Zionism essentially says. It should be uncontrovertible -- incontrovertible. And it doesn't imply necessarily that there is no Palestinian nation, or that Palestinians don't have rights.

Tell me about them, and do they still currently in this environment have an important role, have shown up, you know, for their neighbors at this time?

There are also citizens of Israel with the right to vote to the Knesset, to the parliament. And on October 7th, one of the hopes of Hamas was that this group of 2 million Palestinian-Israelis will rise against their Jewish neighbors and also try to massacre Jews and so forth. And there was a lot of fear among Jews that this is going to happen. They're also coming to kill us. It didn't happen. On that day, actually, you saw that Palestinian-Israelis are coming to help their Jewish neighbors. Quite a, number of Palestinian-Israelis were murdered by Hamas while trying to say, for instance, rescue survivors of the Nova music festival and other massacres. There are Palestinian-Israelis kidnapped by Hamas to Gaza and held there. And the two most prominent leaders of Palestinian-Israeli parties in Israel, Mansour Abbas and Ayman Odeh, both of them, they flatly condemned the massacre. They said this is not the way of the Palestinian people or of Islam. They are still committed to peace. And I think, again, looking at them, they are the most -- the group that gives most hope in the region that, yes, there are people who can hold two thoughts at the same time, be Palestinian-Israelis and be in favor of fulfilling the right of the Palestinian people for self-determination without exterminating the State of Israel.",

You know, if you recognize that there is an Israeli nation with the right of self-determination and a Palestinian nation with the right of self-determination, so you need to somehow satisfy the rights of both people. Some people say, no, we'll have a one state, which will be, you know, this democratic Jewish Palestinian state providing rights and equality for everybody. It sounds like a nice dream. The problem with -- that history is often resistant to mere theory and to dreams. And many things that sound very good in theory, on paper, when you try to implement them, it can lead to tragedy.

A number of people who had explored it in that period, you know, were either injured or killed from their experiments. But Nobel got obsessed with this idea that there was, in a sense, a way to tame this extraordinary new chemical and he had this vision of what was described as the controlled explosion. But if you could figure out a way to kind of detonate it on command in a safe way and create a kind of portable form of it that could be transported without it absolutely blowing up that it would revolutionize civil engineering, that you could build railroads and, you know, carve out new mines and tunnels and build skyscrapers, even without cigarettes.",

No one is trying to kill the workers, but it was predictable that it was going to happen. You could see this was happening. The railroad industry was incredibly dangerous at that point. And so, the anarchists believed that there was actually a better way to organize society and that we had actually lived through it -- in during the Renaissance, basically, in small, you know, communities of artisans and guilds where there wasn't a lot of social hierarchy, there wasn't a giant government, there weren't giant corporations, there weren't these grotesque factories.

I mean, one of the crazy things, when we think about it, you know, 120 or 130 years ago, before this stuff was developed, if you -- there was no standardized form of identification. So, if you were arrested, you could just make up a name and they really had no way to figure out who you were. And so, there's a flurry of activity, in large part, as I document in the book, kind of triggered by anarchist activity, in -- particularly in Europe led by people like Alphonse Bertillon where they start developing these techniques of basically what we would now call biometrics. So, using photography, measuring body parts. And then the science of fingerprint technology starts to emerge right as the anarchist threat is starting to emerge as well. And they kind of co-develop alongside each other. And it's a fascinating history. And there's some really interesting characters in the -- in New York in that period on the either running the NYPD or part of the NYPD, particularly these two guys, Arthur Woods and Joseph Faurot, who really are largely forgotten, I think. Faurot kind of brings fingerprint technology over from Europe and he gets derided. They're like, that's just a fad and a London fad, even worse. But he kind of fights for this case and he builds a little rogue identification bureau inside of the NYPD and he wins a couple of cases and slowly starts to prove out this new science. And so, it's the -- in a sense, the battle between kind of two ideas, the idea of anarchism and the idea of terrorism and on the other side, the idea of using this new kind of state supported systems of surveillance and analysis and identification to keep that threat in check.",

And what became clear about two years ago is that these new language models could be harnessed in a way to make that process way more effective. And what we started to develop -- so basically, Google kind of reached out to me and said, hey, would you like to help us develop a tool that you've been kind of dreaming of your whole life? Like, why don't you come and help build it? Because we now have this technology that could be really extraordinary in doing this. And so, what NotebookLM does is basically, as you suggested this, instead of just chatting with an open-ended model based on the kind of general knowledge of the model, you give NotebookLM a set of documents that are important to you. So. in my case, it might be documents for a book that I'm working on or it could be your work documents or personal documents, whatever it is. And at that point, once you've uploaded them, it's almost as if the model becomes an expert in the work that you've given it to see, and it reduces hallucinations dramatically, it -- and it makes it much more personalized, right? It's able to talk about the information that you care about, not just kind of general information of the world. And so, for instance, I have -- in NotebookLM, I have one notebook where I have loaded up 7,000 quotations from books that I've read over the last 20 years, like my research notes, just that I've been collecting all these quotes from books. And I can go in there and say, OK, you know, what are some of the most interesting things about ant colonies or dolphins or the history of forensic science, you know, create a little overview with citations, with references and original quotes so that I can get a sense of the landscape in my research notes. And it'll generate that document in 30 seconds. And so, my ability to explore these vast troves of information and to basically -- the complex, laborious work of assembling the information can be done in an automatic way. And then I can -- I'm freed up to actually have the important thoughts and to figure out how to creatively put it on the page. So, I'm very excited about it.",
