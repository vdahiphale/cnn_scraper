Now with just hours to spare the U.S. Senate late on Saturday averted a government shutdown by a vote of 88 to nine senators passed the House bill that will keep money flowing for another 45 days.The White House sent out a photograph. You see it there President Biden signing the short term measure into law shortly before the midnight deadline. Now the deal came together with surprising speed in the end with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy abruptly changing course and asking Democrats for help. The result was a resounding bipartisan passage of a short term bill. But many lawmakers on both sides are very unhappy that the final bill did not contain additional U.S. aid for Ukraine, especially at such a critical moment in the war. Still, Senate leaders were relieved to have brought this showdown to an end for now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK SCHUMER, U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: It's been a day full of twists and turns, but the American people can breathe a sigh of relief, there will be no government shutdown. Democrats have said from the start that the only solution for avoiding a shutdown is bipartisanship. And we're glad that Speaker McCarthy has finally heated our message. In the end, more Democrats supported this bill in the House than Republicans proving bipartisanship was the best answer all along. MITCH MCCONNELL, U.S. SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Passing this measure. keeping the lights on will allow us to return our country to making headway on full year appropriations our colleagues have been working on literally for months, and it will give us the flexibility to meet urgent supplemental priorities both at home and abroad. Therefore, I would urge our colleagues to join me in supporting this important step in the right direction. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there will be a bipartisan outcome. And I always felt that if they had a bill like this, they get 300 votes in the House to get 335. And the Senate pretty much accepted it as is. So I'm not surprised this happened. Obviously McCarthy was under tremendous pressure. He was under tremendous pressure from his right flank not to engage in a bipartisan solution. But he did the right thing here. And I think that the, you know, Hakeem Jeffries was there as expected to provide a lot of votes and support. And so this is a good outcome. Now, that said, they're going to have to deal with Ukraine funding sometime between now and November the 15th or 17th, whenever this, this, this resolution expires, and they're going to have to negotiate the full appropriations bills all 12 of them for the for the next fiscal year.

And it didn't really translate into any help with these matters of governance, like funding the government or passing the debt ceiling. So he has to. So McCarthy needs to resort to bipartisanship, I think he has to marginalize those members that whatever that number is five to -- five to 15 or so of those hardliners, he's going to have to marginalize them. And the way he does that is by engaging in bipartisan deals with Hakeem Jeffries. That's the way out. Appeasement doesn't work, obviously. And I think the Speaker discovered this rather belatedly.

And under the current government, I guess, soon to be previous government. Slovakia has been a very strong supporter of Ukraine, sending helicopters, artillery systems, air defense systems, you name it. Under Robert Fico, well it is likely that it won't go away right away, because as you pointed out, he will need a coalition government.If you look at the results that we have so far, the vast majority of the polls now reporting Fico's government has or Fico's party one just over 23 percent of the vote. So nowhere close to getting the majority that he would need to govern on his own. He will need to pair up with another party. He has not ruled out despite his party being a left wing party. He has not ruled out pairing up with the Republic Party. But you can see there -- them there at the bottom with 4.8 percent. They actually missed out on the threshold of 5 percent to get seats in parliament. The Republic Party shares his view on Ukraine and Russia. So that's no longer an option. The other parties have much more moderate views. His most likely coalition partner is the third one you see there, the Hlas Party, that's actually an offshoot of his own SMER Party. They've been more vague on the Ukraine issue. What the leader has said, is that on one hand, Slovakia has given all that it can afford to give Ukraine at this point. On the other hand, Slovakia is a ammunition manufacturer. And so from a practical standpoint, they think that they should continue to supply Ukraine with ammunition because at the end of the day, it's good for the economy. So Fico will need another moderating force in order to govern and he actually has a track record of being flexible, being pragmatic, in order to govern So, as I said, likely that aid to Ukraine not going to be cut off cold turkey. You also have to understand Michael, where some of this attitude or where some of these views or why these views are resonating in Slovakia right now. Fico has framed this as more of a peace initiative saying that sending weapons to Ukraine just prolongs a war that the Ukrainians can't actually win. The Slovakia is also dealing with rising costs of living inflation like much of Europe. They're also hosting some 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, all of this straining the public curse (ph). And so this message of getting this war over with sooner rather than later is undoubtedly an appealing one. In terms of what happens next, it'll likely take weeks for the negotiations on a coalition to take place before the dust finally settles. Michael.",

You've had in fighting corruption scandals you name it, which is really weaken trust in government. So all of this makes for some fertile ground for the Russian viewpoint, Russian propaganda misinformation, perhaps disinformation to really take hold in this country. And what is especially interesting here is that Robert Fico himself was actually forced out of office by scandal back in 2018, how quickly people forget about that. This time around, he's branded his party. In fact, one of his campaign slogans is stability, order and social security.

The White House had made a deliberate decision some time ago to take a hands-off approach as the process unfolded on Capitol Hill. The messaging that we have been hearing from the White House over the last few days has really been this is the House Republicans problem to solve. They made a political calculation that if the government were to shut down at midnight, that House Republicans would end up shouldering much of that political blame. Of course, there is a sigh of relief tonight here at the White House that a government shutdown has been averted. But there are two very big outstanding questions. First is how the government is going to potentially secure more funding for Ukraine. That has been a big priority for many Democrats and White House officials as well.

Now for some portions of the central U.S. those records actually began on Saturday including the area around Brownsville, Texas, which means they could end up breaking records three or even four days in a row before we finally start to see those temperatures dropping back down towards normal.Take for example Sioux Falls, going from a high on Sunday of 93 degrees back down to only 76 on Tuesday. Keeping in mind however that that 76 is still actually above normal for this time of year just not quite as extreme as the high temperature will be on Sunday. Another location looking at that big drop, St. Louis going from a high of 91 on Sunday down to the low 80s Thursday before dropping back below average into the low to mid 70s once we finish out the rest of this week. Farther down to the South Dallas also looking at several more hot days looking at highs in the mid-90s once all the way through Tuesday of the upcoming week before finally dropping back into the 80s by the end of the week and possibly down even into the low 70s once we get some rain back into the forecast next weekend. Now this heat is going to stick around it's just going to start to shift as we head into the latter portion of the upcoming week. So you'll notice it starts to recede from the central U.S. really starting to focus more across the Northeast in the mid-Atlantic as cooler air begins to push into the central U.S. by Wednesday and Thursday of this week. That means into the Northeast. Those temperatures are actually going to be warming looking at already going from 78 on Sunday back into the mid-80s by Tuesday. Similar scenario for Boston going from 73 on Sunday up to the 80s once we get to the middle portion of this week.",

Just hours ago the Senate passing a stopgap spending bill to keep the government's doors open until November 17. For now millions of government employees and active military members will continue getting paid. President Biden Swain signing the bill into law pretty quickly after it was passed.He blames the near shutdown squarely on hardline congressional Republicans saying they created a manufactured crisis by walking away from an earlier budget agreement that they'd signed on to and demanding drastic cuts that were not agreed to in that deal. Now, Rory McIlroy and other members of team Europe confronted an American caddy as tempers flared on the greens of the Ryder Cup in Rome on Saturday. At this point, it's going to take a historic comeback for the Americans to retain the coveted golf trophy as the tournament heads into its final day. Here's Patrick Snell with a look at Saturday's action.",
