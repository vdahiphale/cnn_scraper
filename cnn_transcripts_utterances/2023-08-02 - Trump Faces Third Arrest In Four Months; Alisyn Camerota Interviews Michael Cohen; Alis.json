He is facing four federal criminal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, all in connection to his efforts to undo his election lost. The Secret Service says security will be at the highest levels. In a moment, I will ask former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen, about the defense that Trump appears to be using and what he thinks will happen next to those six co-conspirators. Plus, our resident fact-checker, Daniel Dale, goes through the 45-page indictment tonight to break down every one of election lies laid out in it. And former attorney general Bill Barr tells Kaitlan Collins tonight that Trump knew he lost the election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

According to \"The Washington Post,\" Obama told President Biden that Democrats are underestimating Donald Trump's political strengths in the 2024 election. Mr. Obama also promised that he would do everything in his power to get President Biden reelected.My panel is back with me. Jessica, doesn't Joe Biden know? Okay, well, here's what apparently President Obama told President Biden. He said that Donald Trump's political strengths are included in intensely loyal following, a Trump-friendly conservative media ecosystem and a polarized country. Doesn't Joe Biden know that or does he perhaps not take those things as seriously as he should?",

Literally no matter what. Twenty- five percent of Republicans say they will not support him no matter what. The remainder are persuadable. So, that's actually a bad number for Donald Trump. But Trump is -- but Obama is saying to Biden and I think to Democrats generally is, don't cheerlead for Trump to be the nominee, don't assume this is an easy win, we're a deeply polarized country, anything can happen, care for what you wish for, compete, take it seriously.
