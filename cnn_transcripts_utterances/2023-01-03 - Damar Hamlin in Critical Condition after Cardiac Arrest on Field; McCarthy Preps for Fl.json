To watch that, with a former -- you know, you're a former player on that same team. You know what it's like to be on the field, like, almost no one else. What did you think? COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Hi, Poppy and Don. We, you know -- seeing those images has scratched open a lot of mental wounds for me personally. I played six of my NFL seasons there in Buffalo, in that stadium. Played the same position. Played safety there. I've experienced injury, loss of consciousness. One time, I lost consciousness, didn't remember what happened till the next day. I have a titanium plate and four screws in my neck. So I'm thinking about what those emotions feel like during a moment like that. I also thought about all the players, the teammates who were rocked by this. This is a team who are tight like brothers. You're co-workers, but you spend more time with your teammates during the season than your spouse, than with your family. So there're strong connection there. These are players who have been through a lot, as have so many people in the city of Buffalo. These are players who mourned the deaths and then rallied for the city after the mass shooting about seven months ago in Buffalo. These are players who mourned and then rallied for the people who -- dozens of people who lost their lives just about a week ago in the tragic blizzard there in Buffalo. So this is -- these are young men who have been through a lot. Those are some of the things that I was thinking about. You knew something wasn't right when you saw him stand up and suddenly collapse. But I've been in situations where an ambulance has come on the field. So I could -- it just resonates, and scratches open a lot of mental wounds for me, having watched that last night.

It has to happen in the exact location at the precise timing.

      "sentences": "Yes. I was on a conference call at about midnight Eastern Time last night with the senior executive vice president of football operations, Troy Vincent, when the -- when this event happened.He's on the phone with commissioner Roger Goodell. They're on the phone with head official. They're on the phone with both head coaches, relaying messages real-time what the situation is. And ultimately, it came to the point where Troy Vincent asked the coaches if they'd like to have their teams to go back to the locker room, as you're seeing there. And then, at that point, the coaches basically assessed the mental state of their team and determined that what they had seen was too traumatizing, and it was not worth sending them back out onto that football field. So, to me, it's a step in the right direction. This has never happened before in the middle of a game, having it stop like this. And so, whereas before, there may have been a lot of calls for players' safety that rang hollow from the NFL. But this -- this was a big step to do this. It's showing that there has been a paradigm shift and that player safety is truly important, more important than the game that we play. I was on the field with my teammate for the Buffalo Bills Kevin Everett in 2007. We were covering a kick together. He hit the wedge, and he fell paralyzed to the ground. When I was playing at Stamford University, my teammate Kerry Carter, a running back, he was tackled by a player named Curtis Williams from the University of Washington, No. 25. He was hit. He was paralyzed from the neck down. Two years later, he lost his life due to complications from that paralysis. Both of those games, ambulances came to the field. There were players huddled. There were tears; there were crying, just like we saw last night. But those games went on. The one last night did not. I think that's a huge statement that's being made and that players, coaches specifically, are really understanding that player health and safety is the most important thing. And it should be. And that's going to echo down through the collegiate and high school and youth levels, which is vitally important, that we get to continue this paradigm shift.",
