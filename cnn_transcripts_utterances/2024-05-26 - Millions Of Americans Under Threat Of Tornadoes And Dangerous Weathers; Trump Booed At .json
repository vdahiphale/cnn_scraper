I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and we have breaking weather news.Tonight, roughly one in three Americans, that's more than 100 million people, are facing severe weather threats, strong winds, hail, and tornadoes. It's a day after violent weekend tornadoes killed at least 15 people, including children. And at this hour, hundreds of thousands of people have no power. The severe storms even forced a delayed start to the Indy 500 until further notice. We have Ed Lavandera on the ground in Cooke County, Texas. Let's start first, though, with meteorologist Elisa Raffa, who has been monitoring all of this. And Elisa, we talked to you yesterday when this threat was persisting. What is the greatest threat today at this moment?",

We now have this new moderate risk, a level four out of five, that has just been added from Nashville to Paducah, including Poplar Bluff, the bootheel there of Missouri, and then stretching into parts of central Missouri, where we could have a couple of strong tornadoes possible again, plus hail up to the size of golf balls and some intense winds up to 70 miles per hour.Again, this is the greatest risk right now for those tornadoes that could be on the strong side. We're talking EF2 or greater that we'll have to watch out for as we go into the afternoon and evening hours. Okay, looks like we have new watches that have just been issued. These in the yellow are all severe thunderstorm watches. In the red, those are tornado watches that have just cleared parts of Nashville. This is the new threat area for much of Missouri going into Illinois, where you can see we have these super cells that have been exploding. You see all these little discrete cells. Those can rotate. Those can pack those strong tornadoes. In effect, from Springfield down to Poplar Bluff and Paducah, and this goes as we go into the evening hours. I mean, and look at all of the warnings, the severe thunderstorm warnings there in the orange. Again, these are the storms that can rotate and produce some of those tornadoes. On this side, we also still have this line of potentially damaging winds up to 60 to 70 miles per hour stretching through Charleston, West Virginia, headed to the North Carolina state line. We have tornado warnings surrounding Knoxville, Tennessee, where even along this line we can still find those spin-ups embedded in the line of damaging winds. So again, incredibly busy. This is the threat that I just showed you for today. It moves to the East Coast tomorrow from Washington, D.C. to Charlotte, back towards Montgomery. You can see the storms really blowing up. This is that area of concern where we can find some of those violent tornadoes, and that fires up as we go into the evening hours here. The line dives South into the Southeast and could continue to fire up on Memorial Day. So, make sure if you have outdoor plans, you watch for lightning in the area. Jessica?",

You've got Hamas rockets demonstrating Hamas has capacity after eight months, almost nine months of war, continue with rocket launches, you've got hostages dying in captivity, you've got increasing Palestinian casualties and deaths. And right now, if you ask a senior administration official whether or not they have a way out of this, the answer would probably be no. DEAN: And so, to that end, a short time ago we learned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had rejected demands from the Hamas leader Yasser Sinwar to end the war and exit the Gaza Strip in exchange for releasing the hostages. Netanyahu's office saying that that offer only leaves Hamas intact to strike again, which they have pledged to do. And all of this is part of the ongoing negotiations over this potential ceasefire and hostage deal. And I'm just going back to what you just told us.
