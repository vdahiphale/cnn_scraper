Find out why some Republicans are just as surprised by their choice as Democrats.Joe Biden prepares to meet with China's President for the last time ahead of a new Trump era, as world leaders gather in Peru for the APEC summit. And the human rights group accuses Israel of carrying out war crimes in Gaza, accusations that Israel denies. Well as Donald Trump's Administration takes shape, some of his picks have raised some eyebrows say the least, but one has sent pretty much shock waves through Washington, even among some Republicans, Trump has selected Former House Republican Matt Gaetz to be the next attorney general. If confirmed, he would lead the same department that pursued a years' long sex crimes investigation against him. The Justice Department ultimately decided not to pursue charges, but the House Ethics Committee has been investigating Gaetz of allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, amongst other things. Gaetz resigned his House seat on Wednesday. He has long denied any wrongdoing and has been a strong critic of the Justice Department in the past. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Democrats are beside themselves, and this is a reaction that is many ways they see as a result of their own failings to stop Trump this election cycle and not only hold on to the Senate, but lose the House, and this is what happens when you have one party control and dominate an election like we've seen -- like we saw earlier this month.And for Republicans, look, there has been an interesting reaction to Donald Trump's picks. On the one hand, he has, early on, chosen from a very traditional well of candidates, and that quickly changed in the past 36 hours, when he chose Pete Hegseth, the Fox News personality, to lead the Department of Defense. And then the pics that you just described, Tulsi Gabbard being in charge of the National Intelligence, and Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. The latter of which has been especially poorly received in Congress, even among Trump's own party. Let me walk you through exactly who Matt Gaetz is, for our viewers who might not be familiar with them. He is a Trump loyalist, first elected to Congress in 2016 that same election that Donald Trump won, and he is from a very conservative part of Florida. He is -- he resigned his seat from Congress immediately yesterday, almost immediately after Trump made the nomination. And as you said, he is under a House ethics probe related to allegations of sexual misconduct. And as far as a legal background, look, he has a very limited experience practicing law. He did attend law school and is part of the Florida Bar Association, but he does not have extensive experience in a courtroom or on the justice side or on the defense side. So, it's certainly a pick that has raised some concerns, although Donald Trump is very much testing to see what he can get away with, with his new mandate and with his new control over his own party, and we will have to see if four senators are not willing to go along with it in the Republican Party.",

That means a total overhaul of the FBI. That means potentially targeting Trump's political enemies. And we will have to see just how far Matt Gaetz is willing to go to follow Donald Trump down that line, and whether there's any resistance in the Republican Party. And so far, that is the one through line among all Donald Trump's picks, whether they have been more traditional, unconventional or this third box of sort of fire brands and head scratchers, is that they are all people who are very, very loyal to Donald Trump, and that is what he values most.",

But so far, you know, we were hearing from some of the senators on both sides reacting to this with shock.I've spoken to several lawyers, including people who are well, have a lot of credentials, are very prominent in conservative lawyering in America, and its total shock there too. It's shock across the Justice Department, across Washington and across the legal community. One person could not even respond. When I asked them for a response, they said that you don't want my response. And then another person laughed, a lawyer, a very prominent lawyer out of New York, was just laughing in response to this. Gaetz has a long history here as a politician, very little of a history as a practicing attorney, no time spent as a prosecutor, which is extremely abnormal for someone who would be leading the Justice Department, which in this country prosecutes all of the cases across the United States where people, regular citizens, are accused of breaking federal laws. So having the chief law enforcement officer not really coming from the legal community is quite a difference than what is normally happening here. Also, Gaetz himself, unusual to say the least, that he had been under investigation from the previous Trump Administration and then into the Biden years, he ultimately was not charged. But he was very closely looked at by the FBI, by the Justice Department in a grand jury, and would theoretically have access to those files witnesses who testified against him in those secret proceedings. Here's just one more way to put it, from Ty Cobb, quite a prominent attorney in Washington, who also worked in Donald Trump's White House, protecting the presidency as a very prominent lawyer in the previous administration.",

And so there has been an effort in recent years, especially by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to try and restore the faith that career lawyers in the Justice Department have in the work that they do and in the people that they're working for. Gaetz would be someone who, instead, has already very publicly said he wants to tear down the department's work and even cheered on the dismissal of say the classified documents case against Donald Trump, when a judge said the Justice Department doesn't have the authority, they think they have in this case, he was cheering against the Justice Department, Max. FOSTER: Katelyn, it's going to keep you busy. Thank you. A tough, complicated relationship. That's how a Biden Administration official is describing the relationship between the U.S. and China, right now. The association between the world's two biggest economies is in the spotlight today as the APEC summit gets underway in Peru. U.S. President Joe Biden is set to head to the gathering in a couple of hours. He's expected to meet on the sidelines with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping on Saturday. It's a year since Mr. Xi visited the U.S. and looming over all of this a second Trump Administration. Some APEC members are concerned about the president-elect's threat to raise tariffs. China, meanwhile, is working on a charm offensive during the summit, backed up with a lot of money and investment, as Stefano Pozzebon now reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

China is now the top trading partner for the region. Few places represent this shift, like this brand-new mega port in Peru with a Chinese state-owned shipping giant, COSCO as its controlling shareholder. It's expected to be inaugurated on Thursday in a joint ceremony at the presidential palace with Chinese Leader Xi Jinping. The port is part of a multi-billion-dollar Chinese investment in Peru. And CNN got a sneak peek ahead of the opening. These massive cranes will run 24/7 once the port is operational in 2025 and allow COSCO's mega ships to travel to China directly, rather than stopping in Mexico and California, reducing shipping times to Shanghai by 15 days. It's going to be a game changer, says Carlos Tejada, a spokesperson for the Chinese conglomerate. Of course, there is a geopolitical impact, because we used to have to send our goods to North America, and that's no longer the case. Competition between China and the U.S. is in full show this week, as Peru hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Both heads of state are in town, but one is clearly ahead in the game. PARSIFAL D'SOLA, FOUNDER OF ANDRES BELLO FOUNDATION: We're going to have throughout the APEC summit, a triumphant Xi Jinping opening the port and the participation by President Biden with, to be honest, that I don't know much of an agenda, especially given the results of the election. It's a huge win for them. And this is not only happening in Peru. POZZEBON (voice-over): 22 countries in Latin America are now part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi is the signature policy on global infrastructure investments, according to the Andres Bajo Foundation. An entire continent who could find itself in the crosshairs of the looming trade war between Washington and Beijing. Donald Trump is not in Lima this week, but his plans for Chinese owned companies in the region are well known. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: They think they're going to make their cars there, and they're going to sell them across our line, and we're going to take them and we're not going to charge them tax. We're going to charge them I'm telling you right now, I'm putting a 200 percent tariff on which means they're unsellable. POZZEBON (voice-over): What a second Trump presidency will mean for South America remains to be seen. Trump wasted no time in demanding Mexico to do more to stop migration at the border in a phone call last week, what is clear is that any retaliatory action from Washington could tilt this region even further towards Beijing.

He had hoped to be preparing to hand off to a Democratic President, Kamala Harris.But now he's facing this reality where Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, as many world leaders in countries are grappling with what a Trump presidency will look like. Now this will loom large over President Biden's meeting with President Xi Jinping. The first time that they are sitting down in a year, and likely the final time they will meet face to face before Biden leaves office. Now, senior officials have already acknowledged that there won't be a long list of deliverables coming out of this meeting compared to meetings in the past, but they said that they will touch on a number of issues, including China's moves in Taiwan, China's support for Russia as it continues its war in Ukraine, also concerns over cyber and other issues as well. But really for Biden, this will bookend his efforts in trying to manage this relationship with one of the United States biggest competitors. You have seen the U.S. take significant steps to try to limit Chinese technology. They've watched with concern as China has engaged in these aggressive moves towards Taiwan and also the South China Sea. But of course, it all comes as they are now, as China, at least, is now grappling with what a Trump presidency will mean for the future of these U.S.-China relationships. Trump has promised to take this hardline approach when it comes to China, promising tougher tariffs. And also, as you guys were just discussing installing some China hawks in his administration, the potential Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, as well as the incoming National Security Adviser, Congressman Mike Waltz. But one thing that the Biden Administration has tried to argue is that they spent the last four years rebuilding and shoring up alliances in the Indo-Pacific. That is one way that they have worked to really serve as a counter to China's growing influence in the region. President Biden will be sitting down with the Leaders of South Korea as well as Japan, while he is in Peru in the coming days. And just yesterday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that fostering those alliances should be something that should continue on in the Trump Administration. Take a listen.

I remember being on the trip back in 2016 when Obama did his farewell tour after Trump had been elected.

But of course, after what's happened in Amsterdam, authorities have decided to take an even closer look at their security details. So, beyond those 4000 policemen and women, you're going to have 1500 stewards on hand and just fewer seats sold, there will be 20,000 people attending the match tonight, rather than the 80,000 that could be seated in the Stade de France, Max. So keener authorities to ensure that this goes ahead far more peacefully than what we saw in Amsterdam last week. Still, this is France's the country in Europe with the largest Muslim population, the largest Jewish community in Europe as well. And very strong feelings amongst the general public and the political classes about what's been happening in the Middle East, and specifically since the war in Gaza began. And so, there are fears, and as you said last night, we saw those protests that took place in Paris that this is not an issue that's likely to leave people decided to stay at home. And again, there were many people that turned out on the streets last night, even if those protests, pro-Palestinian protests. But also, there weren't, I think it's important to mention on the streets of Paris yesterday, Jewish groups, moderate Jewish groups who were calling for the kind of change in Israel's policy towards the Gaza strip that have been at the heart of so much of what's been spoken by European leaders as well. So, everything being done tonight that the streets of Paris can be kept safe, that Israel supporters can be kept safer than they were last week, the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, certainly.
