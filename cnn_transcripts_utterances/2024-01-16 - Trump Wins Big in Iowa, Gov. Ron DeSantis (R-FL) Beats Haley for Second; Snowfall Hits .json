      "sentences": "Yes. And if you want to get a sense of things, just look at the map. We just told you 98 of 91 counties were won by Donald Trump. That's all the red right here. The one county that Nikki Haley is currently ahead. She's ahead in Johnson County. It's the home of the University of Iowa, Iowa City suburbs. This is supposed to be the type of county where Nikki Haley was supposed to make some inroads against Trump. She's currently leading by one vote.And that actually underscores what we saw, and that is the Republican Party is still Donald Trump's party. Maybe there're some questions heading into the Iowa caucuses, whether or not that was the case. The polling seemed to say otherwise. Republican leaders throughout the federal and state ranks seem to say otherwise. Now, Iowa is also saying otherwise. And if you want to know why you say that, you can flip back into 2016 and see how Donald Trump actually did in the state of Iowa. He lost it. He lost it by about three points to Ted Cruz. And if you look everywhere you see yellow on this map were places where Ted Cruz won. Donald Trump had problems with evangelicals. He had problems in the suburbs where Marco Rubio scored a number of county victories as well. Flip back into 2024, that was not the case at all. In fact, if you want to see where Trump underperformed his 2016 results, you'll see no color whatsoever. He overperformed 2016 in every single one of Iowa's 99 counties. So, what does that tell you when you look at the map? Well, when you look at the entrance polls, there's some interesting things to pull away from it. One, obviously, Donald Trump was dominant in this race. But what was most interesting, I think, is if you poll out where he sits within the party, is Trump fit for the presidency, even if he's convicted of a crime? This is not just Trump supporters. This is the Iowa caucus. entrance polls for Republicans. 65 percent say even if Trump is convicted of a crime, he is still fit for the presidency. What about whether or not people identify as part of the MAGA movement? Obviously, a significant number of Donald Trump supporters, 78 percent say they do, but also 11 percent of DeSantis supporters, 3 percent of Haley supporters. The MAGA movement, whether you like it or not, is still central and core to the Republican Party. Now, you can talk about how this is just Iowa. New Hampshire might be different. South Carolina could be different as well. But the reality right now, even as we head into New Hampshire, where Nikki Haley is looking like she has some opportunity based on recent polls, is when you look at this map and you look at the polling and you look at where Republican leaders and officials have been over the course of the last several months, including almost the entire House Republican leadership over the course of the last couple of weeks, it's Donald Trump's party, and he is, right now, at least, on the path to be the Republican nominee, Poppy.",

You bump into everybody.And it was really telling to me that she was the only candidate there, along with a handful of us reporters who were going, Ron DeSantis going on to South Carolina, Donald Trump going to New York to attend the latest one of his many trials. It really says a lot about how Nikki Haley is focusing here and also about all the additional dynamics of the race. We are here at Shavashan (ph), which is a hallowed stop on the New Hampshire primary campaign trail. Behind me, there are bullets and boards covered with bumper stickers from the various campaigns. I came here with Mitt Romney back in 2011 when he was running for president, I think, was my first time visiting here. We're starting to get breakfast service underway, some of these New Hampshire voters trickling in. And some of the big questions here, one, what are those especially undeclared New Hampshire voters going to do here? They can vote in the Republican primary and indications seem to be that they would be open to voting for Nikki Haley. Two, what does Ron DeSantis do? Do his donors keep writing checks that allow him to stay in the race? And, three, how does Nikki Haley handle the question of Donald Trump? And we got some interesting clues from her speech last night, as well as from a new ad.

It was about a 30-30-30 split between DeSantis, Trump and Haley. Of those that think it was stolen, it was like Trump by a mile. I think Trump only actually got like 9 percent of the people that thought it was legitimate.So, that makes me wonder if we could go back in time and actual leaders of the actual Republican Party could actually convince people that the election was legitimate, which it was, would that have made a difference in where we are today? And that is showing me what the importance of leadership is, because when Donald Trump said it was stolen and every other second tier influencer in the GOP says, yes, it was stolen, you're now convincing the party that he's a victim.
