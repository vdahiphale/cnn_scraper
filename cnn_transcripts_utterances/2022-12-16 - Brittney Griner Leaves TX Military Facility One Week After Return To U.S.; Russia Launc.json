      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. We're going to begin with new developments on Brittney Griner. The WNBA star has just been released from a military facility in Texas. This is one week after returning to United States in that high profile prisoner swap with Russia. Griner leaving the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, surrounded by her wife, Cherelle, and other family members, the 32-year-old had been staying in a residential environment as it's been described.On the base, you can see pictures right here, kind of her journey home from Russia, she has been staying there and being monitored and being given treatment and being given all the help that she has been needing since returning home. She arrived in Texas last Friday, after she was freed from this Russian prison in exchange for convicted arms dealer Victor Bout. Abby Phillip, let's bring her in. We're going to bring in Abby Phillip in just a second. But let me start with -- let me bring in Patrick McEnroe. He's with me now. We're just kind of learning more, we're going to learn much more about how she is doing, Patrick. But just having this news of just -- this is another step and her long journey home, as she's now not only back in the United States, but now being released from this, leaving this facility.",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, Kate, this is great news. And I think the fact that she was able to spend a week there at their facility is just perfect for her. And now I think she can start to look ahead to the WNBA season. The good news, Kate is that it doesn't start until May that goes through the summer, the season for the WNBA. So that gives her I think plenty of time to reacclimate with her wife, with her family, and start to, you know, ease her way back into the athletic realm.I mean, obviously being in prison for as long as she was, she certainly lost a lot of her endurance and a lot of her, you know, not her skills, but certainly some of her ability to stay in shape. So this is great news, I think this is just gives her a perfect setup to come back and to ease her way back in, you know, emotionally, mentally, but also physically as she looks ahead to the next season. BOLDUAN: And this is -- and it's an unusual circumstance, right? Someone who's in their -- like the prime of their career and peak physical condition going in, and then, you know, living through and surviving through what she has and the conditions that she has survived in. What is the -- what do you envision being kind of the long road, the process back to getting her back on the court if she wants to be there?",

She's one of arguably the best players in the world in women's basketball. I think it's going to be the emotional side, and also dealing with the extra attention now. I mean, the media spotlight is going to be on her. That's understandable.From what I've seen of the way she's handled things and just you see the pictures. Obviously, we'll all wait to hear her first interview whenever that happens. She seems like I mean, just an unbelievable person that she can handle this and her talking to the people on the plane home, when she was released from Russia, you see those pictures right there, smiling, amazing to think what she's been through that she able to have that type of attitude. But I think Kate, that's going to be the thing for Brittney, that will be the most challenging is the attention. And also the responsibility, I think that she's now going to sort of be forced to take on to a certain degree, and how much will she be willing to take that on and to be a real spokesperson for human rights, you know, all over the world? So that's a lot on her plate.",

What does it do to athletes when they become a symbol of something more than they had even asked for, you know, becoming a symbol of -- because she came -- she became a political pawn for Russia, of course, but then now becoming a symbol in something that she never even asked for.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kate, I just want to just convey this morning that I'm hearing that Brittney Griner just a few moments ago took off from San Antonio, she's headed back home. They don't want to disclose exactly where she is going for security reasons, but is heading home after spending about a week at the Brooke Army Medical Facility where she was receiving care, as I know you got all we're discussing.This is an ongoing process for her. When I spoke to her agent this morning, she told me that it's really a continuing process even though she might not physically still be in that facility. And I just want to share one other thing as she got on the plane this morning, she was surprised by one of her teammates with the Phoenix Mercury, Diana Taurasi, who was there on the plane as well as the Mercury's General Manager, and the President of the Phoenix Mercury as well. So they met her on the plane, she didn't know that they were coming. It was a big surprise, but a homecoming for her because of the role that her teammates, and that whole franchise has played in bringing attention to her detention and really advocating for it, pushing it even beyond the WNBA and well into men's sports, getting the NBA on board to make this a top priority during their season as well. But it's just a clear sign that BG is being welcomed back in to the mercury family as she heads home with her wife, Cherelle.",

Just reading the first graph for all of you, she writes, it feels so good to be home, the last 10 months have been a battle at every turn. I dug deep to keep my faith. And it was the love from so many of you that helped keep me going from the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone for your help, really the first words we're hearing from Brittney Griner in this long, long journey.And you had a really important interview early on with her wife, Cherelle, about what this journey has been like for them.

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is the -- she is a pretty private person. And what her wife told me was that she's not really all that involved in politics, per se. But in her world, she is a towering figure in the WNBA in the world of basketball. And so now I think she finds herself with a huge platform, understanding on a deeper level, the impact that she can make, given the experience that she had, and her wife too.I mean, Cherelle Griner really took this issue on a personally. She was doing media interviews. When she sat down with me, the objective in that moment was to get the attention of President Biden. She wanted a meeting with the President, and or -- and a conversation with the President. And about a week later, after she sat down with me, that happened. And she pushed for that even to the point of risking, you know, an important relationship that would be critical for the release of her wife, with the belief that the public pressure was essential here. And so as we see BG really now stepping into her freedom. I don't think that we can expect to see her really publicly out there for a little while. I'm being told that she's going to, after this moment, she's going to be going home. She's going to be decompressing. She's going to be getting her life back. She's going to be recovering physically, mentally, and emotionally. But after she has taken her time to do that, she wants to take this moment that this thing that has happened to her and use it for good so we can expect that after some time after they've had a chance to recover.",

I think one of the things that I hear a lot from people who are involved in this is that the attention that they have brought to the issue of wrongfully detained Americans is something really extraordinary. And President Biden, like so many presidents are under pressure to bring many Americans detained abroad at home.But as you can see, and as I know, you know, Kate, the way that they have taken this issue on in the last several months, bringing home not just Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed, but almost a dozen other people abroad is a part of a shift within this administration to make this a huge priority. And just one more word about her playing for the Phoenix Sun, that's a -- of the Phoenix Mercury that is a big commitment, a big headline coming out of this. As you can imagine, having been detained in Russia for 10 months, there would be some real questions about whether or not she would want to take her life in a different direction to be more private. But clearly, basketball is something that she loves. She picked up a ball this weekend, for the first time since her detention in a clear sign to people around her that she wanted to be back in that game. And I think that that's a really important headline.",

And she will be playing again and fighting for other Americans who are wrongfully detained abroad, too big moments that we're just learning just now. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.Let's turn now to Ukraine, another big headline we're watching this morning. Russia launching a deadly barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine, explosions knocking out power and heating systems in several cities. Ukraine says that it's shot down dozens of missiles. At least two people were killed at a residential building in central Ukraine. Kharkiv's mayor describing the damage in his city as colossal. Will Ripley is in Kyiv with the very latest for us.",

I'm standing in front of the destroyed military vehicles from the earlier attacks. We can't actually take you to the scene of these latest strikes because Ukraine has very strict rules for filming these locations which are believed to be civilian infrastructure targets, power stations, designed to basically plunge much of Ukraine into darkness.And many people across Kyiv have actually lost power as a result of these attacks. We lost power at the hotel after hearing the air raid sirens and explosions earlier today. And the same situation is true for people in Kharkiv where much of the city has been without power, that city up in the north along with Sumi. And down in the south Odessa, also getting hit by these Russian missiles. But to think about dozens of missiles actually coming right towards Kyiv, even people who have lived here, and I've been covering this war say they don't remember an attack this big in quite some time. And it is certainly raising concern for the well-being of children here and across Ukraine who might have to survive now for hours, days, potentially even longer without electricity as a result of these attacks. UNICEF coming out in recent days, Kate, saying that the physical and mental well-being of nearly every single Ukrainian child is at desperate risk as a result of this constant Russian bombardment.
