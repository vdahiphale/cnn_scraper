This alleged leaker, he became the leader of the group. And he was essentially showing off the kind of access that he had to these classified documents and trying to convey to these members of this group that there were things that the U.S. government hasn't been totally honest or transparent about. So that seems to be the motive at this point. But again, this is going to raise a lot of questions moving forward about how the Pentagon disseminate such highly classified information and who can receive it, especially someone as young as a 21-year-old air guardsmen, John.",

She's going to be with us for a little bit. When we come back, though, shift back to politics. Democrats see a lot of reason for 2024 optimism lately. Inflation is easing and Democrats believe they benefit from new activism around the abortion and the gun safety debates. But it's not all happy talk in the party right now.Today, as we discussed the remarkable split over a party icon, the 89- year-old Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, she is home because of health issues. Prominent fellow California Democrat now publicly calling for her to resign, because he says her absence is stalling key priorities. We'll get some perspective from our senior political commentator for the president, David Axelrod, he joins us now. So David, as this plays out, let's start with Senator Feinstein. This has been a whisper for weeks among Democrats, you're well aware of that. Then it spills out publicly. Is this ambition? Is this frustration with the agenda? Is it generational change? California Democratic Party? Moderates versus liberals? all of the above?",

There was a piece written several years ago about concerns about Senator Feinstein's capacities to continue to serve. But now she's been absent for a couple of months. And that has had a material impact in that.She is a deciding vote on the Judiciary Committee. There are 12 nominations, judicial nominations that are being held in abeyance because that seat is not filled by a Democrat. That's been a source of frustration to Senate Democrats. So there are California motivations. You know, Ro Khanna who spoke out yesterday is the chair of Senator -- of Congresswoman Barbara Lee's campaign for the Senate in 2024. And so he has some interest in this. One of the interesting aspects of this, John, is that if she were to resign, as some have asked us, kind of has asked, the governor would replace her temporarily until the next election. And he has said that he would appoint an African American woman. Well, you can imagine that Adam Schiff, who has already announced his candidacy, Katie Porter, who has already announced her candidacy, are watching this with great interest.",

In Pennsylvania, the Senate race there, they had their best year in 40 years in Michigan in 2022, up and down the ticket.And in Wisconsin, there was just this very, very important Supreme Court race that will determine the tilt of that Supreme Court, the deciding vote on that Supreme Court. And, though, that was a nonpartisan race, there was a progressive candidate and a conservative candidate. The progressive candidate in Wisconsin, which Joe Biden won by only 20,000 votes, won by, I think, 130,000. And a lot of that race was about abortion rights. So, you know, the issue sort of palette for Republicans is not good in a general election. And this is their continuing problem. You've talked about it quite a bit. I've talked about it quite a bit. The issues that drive primary voters in the Republican Party are perilous for Republican candidates in the general election.

You know, the reason that Joe Biden was able to be elected president, and maybe he'll get reelected, again, is because he had enough of -- enough roots in the working class kind of culture of this country coming from the background that he did. That he did, you know, slightly better than Hillary Clinton, and you're the master of these numbers. But, you know, he did about 5 percent better among those non-college educated white voters. That made the difference in some of these swing states that he won. But Democrats can't count on that. Democrats have to sort of reorient themselves and reengage with those parts of the country.
