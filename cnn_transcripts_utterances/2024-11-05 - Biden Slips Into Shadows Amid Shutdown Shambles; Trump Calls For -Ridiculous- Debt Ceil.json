He's been around for some time, as you all know. And this is not the first time that we've had this strategy where we have said it is Congress' -- one of their number one jobs is to keep the government open. In this particular instance, you saw what Republicans did, with Speaker Johnson, obviously leading us to this mess to where we are right now, and they need to fix it, period. It is their mess to fix.

Senior administration officials, either not responding to requests on what the White House was doing to try to negotiate with leaders on Capitol Hill. And one senior administration official telling me, point blank, it's in the Hill's hands. Now, the White House is confident in that strategy because it's workedfor them before. Notably, in September 2023, House Republicans were able to reach an 11th-hour deal very close to midnight, where they did avert a shutdown in that moment, where the White House had similarly sought to pin the blame squarely on Republicans for failing to reach an agreement. So they're essentially ripping a page from the same playbook here. But while they're saying that their main priority is to avert a shutdown, they're also quietly preparing for the possibility of one. Karine Jean-Pierre saying that the White House has begun notifying employees of the federal government that they would be furloughed at midnight if a deal is not reached. So of course, they are saying that they're optimistic, there is still time for Republicans to reach a deal, but also preparing for that possible worst-case scenario -- guys?",

We know what he would say. He would say the same thing as Jeffrey -- Jeffries and Schumer, which is that Republicans had a deal and they walked away from it. And we know how much impact it would have, which is essentially none on the Republican decision making. But I think also it is clearly an extension of what we have seen, really, since he announced he was not running, you know, last summer. Which is that he has been extraordinarily recessed and stepping away from direct engagement with many of the issues the country is facing in a way that is an odd kind of coda to his presidency.",

They can move money around, essentially. So it's not like it's a firmdeadline. But there's always a little bit of uncertainty about when those extraordinary measures run out. Is it after, you know, a month, several months? And we have even more uncertainty, potentially, right now, because interest rates are high. And so the mix of debt that we would be able to roll over is a little bit more challenging to manage. So, you know, if -- if, in fact, something comes through in February that would be great. And in fact, I was a fan of -- of Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate the debt ceiling altogether. Sadly, not too many other Republicans believe that. You know, if, in fact, there is an increase in February, that would be fine. The fear is that if we have enough chaos going on right now, if there's -- there's enough turmoil and disagreement about these more basic things, it seems very unlikely that they're going to get their act together and decide on an increase by February 1st.",

And there are conservative Republicans in both chambers who are always reluctant to vote for increasing the debt ceiling. Democrats have tended to go along with it more quietly when there's a Republican in office. So, you know, Trump -- Trump's plans obviously involve a major increase in federal debt, extending the Trump tax cuts, which expire at the end of 2025, is a hugely expensive proposition, which has grown even more expensive from his various promises on the campaign trail. So it will be interesting to see whether Democrats take a different posture. I mean, certainly, as we saw again, Elizabeth Warren last night on with Kaitlan Collins on \"The Source,\" was saying Democrats would be happy to end the debt ceiling completely, to eliminate it completely, as I think Catherine was alluding to. But whether they whether they are now going to try to employ some of the tools that Republicans have in the past and try to leverage their vote to raise it for some policy gains, you know, I would have to think they may move in that direction after watching what Republicans tried to do to both Biden and Obama.",

So with his with his death, that really brings us into an area where we've conducted strikes on a bunch of ISIS camps and operatives, basically more than 75 targets. And this is part of a major campaign because the U.S. knows that ISIS is going to be trying to break out of those detention camps that exist in Syria.

So areas that potentially are threatened are the city of Zaporizhzhia. There's always a threat to Kharkiv, which is the second-largest city for the Ukrainians. And of course, with Kyiv being attacked -- and this is the aftermath of the latest attack where one person was killed -- that is something that becomes a critical factor. Because when you look at the broader map, you see that there are going to be a lot of possibilities where the Russians are going to try to keep this territory, and they're going to try to get the Ukrainians out of this area right here. And when we go into a more detailed map, this shows where the Ukrainians have Russian territory.
