On the eve of a crucial two day summit of NATO leaders, Turkey has suddenly dropped its opposition to Sweden's application for membership, setting the scene for yet another significant expansion of the Alliance just over three months after Finland's membership was made official.The meeting in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius is expected to be dominated by Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as Ukraine's long standing request to join a request opposed by the U.S. President. White House officials say Joe Biden will meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. President Biden though has welcomed the new set Sweden's membership has now been or been approved, which avoids the perception of division among NATO members.

Security officers hold protesters out of the Knesset or parliament before the vote took place. Every member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is far right wing coalition voted for the measure. Every other member of parliament voted against it. Now comes what they call a massive day of protests, a day of disruption. CNN's Hadas Gold has more now reporting in from Jerusalem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS  GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Israeli protesters planning a day of disruption on Tuesday as the Israeli government is now bringing the judicial overhaul plan back on the table after months where this judicial overhaul was frozen in place essentially, months ago after those massive general strike and protests that throws Israel into place the defense minister even coming out against his own government's plan. Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are starting to bring it back, it looks a little bit different. It's a little bit watered down and it's being done in a very slow, piecemeal fashion. But the legislation that was brought to its first vote on Monday night would strip this Israeli Supreme Court's ability of being able to declare a government action as being unreasonable. They have rather broad powers right now to say that even if a government actually didn't necessarily break any laws, that it is unreasonable and cannot stand and this legislation would attempt to strip that away. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has watered down other aspects of this judicial overhaul, namely, the ability of the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority, those have been taken off the table. But the other elements are still there. And the protesters and the opposition essentially are saying, we don't believe when the government says that this will be a softer version of this judicial overhaul and they are still taking to the streets. They've actually never gone off the streets, even while there were a compromise negotiations trying to take place with the really president's residents, even while this legislation was technically frozen in place. Israeli protesters were still taking to the street on a regular basis. And on a Monday evening, they were on the floor. The Israeli parliament trying to stay some sort of sit in. They were forcibly removed by Parliament security. And then on Tuesday is this day of disruption being planned from the morning until the evening is really protesters saying they're going to essentially try to disrupt daily life in Israel, including at the airport at Ben Gurion Airport, just outside of Tel Aviv, as well as add important embassy buildings throughout the country from different countries, and along the really the heart of Tel Aviv, downtown Tel Aviv and the main highway there. We've seen these types of massive protests in the past. And the goal of these protesters is to try to once again encourage important figures such as the defense minister, such as other ministers, who may be supporting their efforts to come out once again, against this judicial overall, even this piecemeal legislation, the slow pace that they plan to take it and to come out against it because for these protesters, the only way that they will really come off the streets is if this judicial overhaul is completely off the table.
