Look, Donald Trump said all these things this weekend talking about Arnold Palmer, vulgarity, a lot of stuff. Now, one of the explanations that you here, and there were some reporting from \"Politico\" last week, is that Trump is exhausted. He is saying things like this because he's exhausted. He's worn out.You're got some new reporting on this which has sort of an interesting take on that based on your conversations with Trump insiders. What are they telling you? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE BULWARK\":  Well, yes, I mean, of course he's tired. I just had our story move on Saturday morning, so I just tallied up the beginning of the month, October 1st to Friday, it's 18 days. He did 28 events in 26 cities in 12 states. He had done 21 media interviews, including seven long form podcasts. Now, all the media interviews were not challenging. They were generally with friendly audiences are friendly media reporters. But nevertheless, it's a lot of work. And in addition to that, he's flying across the country. He doesn't sleep very much. When he's on Trump Force One, the name of his plane, no one really lies down. That includes the candidate. At most, he sort of micro-naps, sitting straight up, putting his chin down, and grabbing a few z's, but it's not quality sleep. And he's on Truth social posting stuff at 12:48 a.m. railing against \"The Apprentice,\" the new movie that depicts his relationship with Roy Cohn. You add all that stuff together, it's tiring, and the reality is, he's 78-years-old. Yes, he's old. Yes, he's older. And having a rugged schedule like that and not sleeping a lot is going to tire you out. Now, the campaign tries to deny that he's exhausted and deny that he's tired. And indeed, when he goes to these events, you see he is very amped up and he's very excited to do them. But in the end, no matter how much the campaign wants to make him sound immortal, he's still a human being. It's a tiring schedule.",

Nikki Haley, reporting that Nikki Haley at some point might do an event with Donald Trump on the trail.

It's not just that he would like to have these Nikki Haley voters, about 1 million people voted for Nikki Haley in the primary in the seven swing states over Donald Trump, and they do represent an opportunity.But the more important thing for Donald Trump is this, just optics. We're at the optics stage of the campaign. You we had earlier on the show Kamala Harris is appearing with Liz Cheney, and that just sends a message about where she is. And the Trump campaign would like him to appear with Nikki Haley and just send a message about him working with her and reaching out to those voters. Now, just after my reporting last week about them being in talks, he was asked on FOX &amp; FRIENDS about this, and he said, yes, I'll do what I have to do. And then he proceeded to basically not quite trash Nikki Haley, but say, well, I don't know why everyone saw talking about her. I got way more votes. It's not the greatest way to want to campaign with someone, but nevertheless, it looks like it's going to happen. Nevertheless nothing is guaranteed in Trump world until it actually happens.",

She was a repository for a lot of Republicans who are upset was Trump, who just didn't want to see another Trump term or didn't want to see him run again. So he does have to do some work to get them back.At the same time, the Trump campaign isn't just focusing on them. It's big gamble its making is working with these outside groups trying to stir up and ignite and turnout more young male voters who in the past have not voted.

In other words, they're conducting raids, they are using airstrikes and so forth. They've done enormous damage to Hamas, the degradation of Hamas is very, very considerable, but they're not destroyed. There are still tens of thousands of Hamas fighters, extremists and there is plenty of recruits for Hamas 2.0.  So, the question is, will Israel lay out a policy that achieves security in Gaza and does prevent Hamas from reconstituting along with criminal groups and Palestinian Islamist Jihad, who are the only real authority at this point in time, again, very seriously degraded. By the way, it is very significant that Israel has taken control of the southern border between Gaza and the Sinai, which denies the ability to push weapons systems and material through the Rafah Crossing and underneath that southern border and the tunnels there. But unless there is security, you're right, we did learn this in Iraq. We were conducting clear and leave operations in 2006. It was only with the surge, which of course, I was privileged to command that we conducted clear and hold and build. Now, they don't want to re-occupy. We don't seem to want them to re- occupy, but unless that happens, there is no security and then there is no better future for the Palestinian people, which is something that should be sought. If you don't improve their lives, if they're trapped in this terrible situation, this humanitarian catastrophe that is Gaza for them right now, there will be many, many more recruits for Hamas. So it is incumbent, I think to secure it sequentially north to south, gated communities, then and only then could you bring in Palestinian security forces trained by the US and Jordan and contractors and Arab forces will come in if they don't have to fight Hamas. But Arabs are not going to fight Hamas for Israel. So I think this is unavoidable. And if it is not done, what you end up with is this enormous population, 2.2 million people jammed into an area with totally inadequate humanitarian assistance -- hygiene, shelter, and everything else.
