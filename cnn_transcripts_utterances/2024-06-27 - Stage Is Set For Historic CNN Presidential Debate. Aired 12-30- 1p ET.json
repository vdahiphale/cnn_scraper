And the polling shows that people, that, yes, the Biden campaign says, well, they're relatively close in age. True.But the polling shows overwhelmingly that the American people have more concerns about the President than they do about Donald Trump. State of the Union might have helped a little bit, but it hasn't moved the numbers. What can you do, or is -- or do you just have to have a vigorous performance and just ignore it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's that, because as we know, this is the top concern for people, and it's not going anywhere. These are people who already four years ago Biden was harmed by this problem in the 2020 primary, and he's only, you know, four years older. The prospect of an 86-year-old president at the end of his second term scares a lot of American voters.However, Biden can do something to minimize that, which is put the focus on Donald Trump, make it a referendum on him and also kind of show an energy and consistency that we've seen him do a couple of times. If we think about the convention speeches, if we think about the state of the union, he's been distant from the caricature that a lot of Americans have ingested from him. He's not as frail or as seemingly senile as TikTok will make him seem. And so I think tonight there's an ability for him to show a lot of people that. The issue for Donald Trump is he's often pretty close to that erratic caricature. And you hear that with him on the trail. Can he kind of infuse a different set of personality, an image that in the American voter tonight by focusing on policy, by focusing on what President Biden's weakness is? I think that's the big question. Because I think we know that Biden won't be as bad as that low bar that's been created, and we've seen them do that a couple times.",

That's what a little bit I'm getting from that ad, is the poking fun. And that's going to be, I think, a real potential challenge for Trump in the debate tonight.This debate is going to be a long, long affair. Biden may slip. He may have moments that we trace some of that weakness where Trump may think it's time to pounce. But knowing how to calibrate that properly is going to be, I think, a real challenge.

When -- even when you talk to some Republicans and people who aren't sure the tone of that, I think, we will see how much that's repeated.But one thing that former President Donald Trump rarely if ever talks about is Vice President Kamala Harris. His campaign is doing that now. So will he do that tonight? We're not. And is that something to draw a link to? But the watch me thing is something that people are going to take him up on that.",

He's going to be standing in Fulton County, Georgia, where he is a criminal defendant in a case saying he tried to illegally steal an election. When the President turns to him and says, here of all places, Mr. Trump, will you honor the results of the election? What does he say?PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: We've talked about how does -- is Trump disciplined? Who -- which version of him shows up? What can the President do to kind of needle him out into those moments? Those will be the key points where you're watching to say, however he handles this is going to define how he's viewed and how he operates during this debate. I think to pull back a little bit, this is baked in. Like, we know all of these things. Everyone in America knows everything about these two candidates. And the question of tonight and why we say the stakes are so high, it's not hyperbolic, why we say this is so critically important, it is not hyperbolic, is there's a subset of Americans in seven states that don't know which way they're going to go despite the fact they know everything about these two individuals.

I know a lot of people disagree, and particularly with Donald Trump, he's going to say that he won the election or something about that. You got Joe Biden right next door.
