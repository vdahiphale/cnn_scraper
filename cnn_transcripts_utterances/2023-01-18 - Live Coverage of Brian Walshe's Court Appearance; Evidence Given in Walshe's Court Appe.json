There were actually multiple controversial House Republicans who did receive committee assignments yesterday.But let's start with George Santos because GOP leaders were really debating how to handle him. They decided, though, that they felt like they needed to give him committee assignments because they didn't want to start this precedent where they punished members before they were actually convicted of a crime. However, multiple committee chairs said they did not want Santos serving on their committees. So there was some internal debate there. Ultimately, he did wind up on two low level committees, that includes the Small Business Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. So, then there's the other question of what was going to happen to Margorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar. As you may recall, they were both kicked off of their committees in the last Congress for incendiary behavior and remarks. They both spoke at a white nationalist conference. But Speaker Kevin McCarthy has long been promising to put them back on committees, likely recognizing that he was going to need their votes at some point to become speaker. And he made good on that promise yesterday. Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to be serving on the House Homeland Security Committee, which is going to have jurisdiction over the border. Paul Gosar is going to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee, which is where he served previously. And both of them are going to serve on the House Oversight Committee, along with other members like Scott Perry, Lauren Boebert, Anna Paulina Luna and Byron Donald. Some of those names you might remember because they were part of the group that was opposing McCarthy in the initial rounds. So, all of those members, including controversial members like Greene and Gosar, are going to have a major hand in helping to shape some of the most aggressive investigations into the Biden administration.",
