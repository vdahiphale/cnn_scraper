      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.While the U.S. is the most expensive country in the world when it comes to giving birth, it's far from the safest. A maternal mortality rate in this country has risen steadily for the past 15 years, according to the CDC. And their statistics are even more dire when it comes to Black women. They are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. The question is why? Why do Black women face more risks when they go to the hospital to give birth? That's the question that CNN anchor and new mom, Abby Phillip, has been asking since the birth of her daughter two years ago. Abby was well aware of the statistics and made some unconventional choices when it came to her own childbirth experience. Since then she's been surprised to meet so many other women who made the same choices that she did. Over the next hour, she takes us to hospitals and birthing centers around the country to show us why more and more Black women are turning away from traditional health care and finding other options when it comes to giving birth.
