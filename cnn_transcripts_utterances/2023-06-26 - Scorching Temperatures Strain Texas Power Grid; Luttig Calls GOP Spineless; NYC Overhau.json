That's why it feels so oppressive here in Houston.But Houston is not alone. Take a look across the state. Cities like Dallas, Ft. Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Corpus Christi, also in the triple digits, all week long. Corpus Christi with a heat index of 116. Now, all of this has prompted cities across the state to open cooling centers, like the one that you see behind me here in the city of Houston. Now, this gives a little reprieve to individuals who don't have access to air conditioning during the day. It gives them a few hours where they can come into these centers and cool off. All of this, of course, tests the power grid here in the state of Texas, which is unique because it's not connected to the rest of the country. ERCOT, the operator of the electric grid, issuing a weather watch that doesn't expire until Friday. So, it goes through Friday. I talked to the expert who predicted the grid failure back in 2021 here in the state of Texas, and he says that based on what he's looking at now, the power grid is expected to hold this week, given these triple-digit temperatures, but he says that Texas is not out of the woods.

It is not to change the hearts and minds of the masses of the new base of the Republican Party, it's to influence the GOP primary. It is to take those institutionalist Republicans who were kind of attracted to the party for the Reagan and Bush years, and to say, it's not your Republican Party anymore.

I think there's a lot of perception, and I dealt with it in talking about foreign aid as a congressman, there's a lot of perception that we're just writing a giant check, we're just giving it to Ukraine and saying, good luck. The reality is, a lot of that money is a value we assess to equipment that we're actually getting ready to rotate out of our stocks. It's a value to replace that equipment. Some of it is a value put on putting troops on Europe. We have a cost on that, as well. And some of it is money that we give to Ukraine to spend on American weaponry as they need to -- made by Americans, you know. And so they need to do a better job of explaining that this $100-some-billion really isn't quite that because, again, here's some old stocks of weapons we have, including HIMARS.
