I'm Sara Sidner in for the fabulous Fredricka Whitfield.We are learning more about Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A source telling CNN that after the election, former President Trump called then Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in an attempt to pressure him into overturning the state's presidential election results. Trump narrowly lost Arizona to Joe Biden by less than 11,000 votes, and sources say Trump also pushed then Vice President Mike Pence to help him overturn the 2020 election loss. CNN's Jeremy Herb is joining us now. What more are you learning about this pressure campaign, according to sources in Arizona?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Sara. Sources tell CNN that the then President Trump, he called then governor, Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, to pressure him on trying to overturn the election in the state. Specifically sources tell CNN that Trump asked Ducey to try to find the fraud that would allow him to overturn the election. Ducey acknowledged at the time that he had gotten this phone call from the former president, but he had not disclosed the contents of what Trump had told him.One of the other things we've learned from sources is that the president pressured vice president, Mike Pence, who also tried to go to outreach for Ducey. We're told that the former vice president, he did speak to Ducey about the election, but sources tell CNN that he did not actually pressure the Arizona governor as he had been asked to do. This all comes, of course, as the special counsel is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which includes outreach to states like Arizona and other states like Georgia. This week we learned that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, he was interviewed by prosecutors for the Special Counsel. Raffensperger, of course, he was the one who Trump told to find the votes he needed to win the state in Georgia. There are a couple of key differences between these two conversations, one of which, a source tells CNN, there is no recording of the call that Ducey had with Trump, while there was a recording that was released in 2021 of the call Raffensperger had. One of the more fascinating things about this episode with Ducey, though, is that we got to see Trump's efforts to pressure him. They played out in real time. The governor, he was signing on camera papers to certify the election. And we then got to see how he received a phone call with the ring tone of \"Hail to the Chief.\" Watch that here.

So it really is sort of an interesting scene in real time of how state officials were dealing with this pressure.We should note the former governor's spokesperson, he said in a statement that, frankly, nothing here is new, nor is it news to anyone who has been following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election. he certified the election, and he made clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by evidence to be brought forward. None were ever brought forward. The spokesman, he also told CNN that the former governor, he has not heard from the special counsel about this conversation.

Jeremy Herb, thank you so much.President Biden says he's now vowing to embark on a new path, as he puts it, to soften the blow for borrowers, student loan borrowers, that is. [14:05:00] This is after the Supreme Court struck down his student loan forgiveness executive order. The high court rejecting the program that would have forgiven up to $20,000 in loan relief to millions of Americans. It was just one of several consequential decisions handed down by the Supreme Court justices just this week. In a six-three conservative majority decision, the court gutted Affirmative Action in college admissions, ruling that colleges and universities can no longer take race into consideration as a basis for admission. And in another monumental case, the court sided with a Christian web designer in Colorado who refuses to create websites to celebrate same- sex weddings, saying it violated her First Amendment rights. CNN Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue watched all of this unfold there in person. You've been following this court for a very long time. What did you make of this court's rulings? Lots of polarizing, if you will, and precedent-setting decisions.",

      "sentences": "Sara, you're absolutely right. In the last few days we really saw just how robust this conservative majority is in all those cases that you just talked about. If you look at the Affirmative Action case in particular, it really is a good example of just how the liberals and the conservatives in certain cases are just seeing the law and the country in two opposite ways. In that particular case it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said he's never been a fan of these preferences.And he said, look, the schools have to have a really good reason to take race into consideration, and they did not meet that high bar. He insinuated that it's actually thwarting the goal of a colorblind society to take race into consideration. And his colleague, Justice Clarence Thomas, he wrote his own concurring opinion, and he said basically taking race into consideration actually taints the minority applicants. On the other side, you had the liberals who were just mystified. You had Justice Sonia Sotomayor who wrote for the three liberals, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson who wrote her own opinion, and they basically said, look, we don't live in a colorblind society right now. There is still discrimination and these programs helped ward that off. But they were on opposite sides. And if you think about the LGBTQ case that you mentioned there, there was a web designer, she did not want to create websites, new websites to celebrate same-sex marriages because she didn't believe -- that went against her religious beliefs. Again, the conservatives, led by Neil Gorsuch, they saw that case as really about the First Amendment, she couldn't be forced to create a product with a message that she didn't agree with, whereas the liberals on the other side said this doesn't have to do with the First Amendment. This has to do with discrimination. Again, they were in loggerheads. And in that student loan case, you had the conservatives saying Congress has to give its authority before you forgive billions of dollars of debt. And you had the liberals saying Congress did give its authority, you're just not listening. The way you're looking at the law is wrong. Roberts did earlier in the term rule in favor of the liberal position in two voting rights cases, but by the end of the term you really saw him back in his place as a conservative, and you looked at this majority and you saw a couple of things. First of all, there's six now, so they can lose one or two -- they can lose one member to the liberal side, as they did sometimes this term, and they can still prevail. But the other thing is, they are a young conservative majority. They are going to be doing this, changing the law, probably more decades.",

But the Supreme Court did say that you could write in an essay about your experience and how your skin color has affected you in your life. I do want to ask you about legacy admissions, because one of the things that people look at this as, legacy admissions, you just happen to be born to someone who went to this elite school and now you get preferential treatment. Do you think that those should also go away as a matter of policy? SEVERINOdon't measure the content of a person's character. And Harvard University has not let them go. This is this club that Harvard set up that was exclusionary. And let's remember who lost the most under the old system. It was Asian Americans. They were capped at around 20 percent, a hard cap. And now Harvard is trying to get rid of the use of the SAW. Why? Because Asian Americans tend to do quite well on standardized tests, and standardized tests level the playing field. So Harvard has this club where it wants to pick and choose exactly who gets in and who doesn't, and it cannot use simple color of a person's skin anymore. Life stories can be taken into account, but life stories don't revolve simply based on one's skin color. You could be rich, have every door open to you, and be African American. You could be poor and white and suffer tons of discrimination. You could have a disability. It's a matter of a person's ability to overcome obstacles that should be taken into account, and legacy admissions, I think, are a bad idea. And Harvard, if it wanted diversity, it could start with intellectual diversity. Only eight percent of its incoming students are conservative. That needs to change.",

Our education system is broken, particularly at the K through 12 level. I had difficulty going through school because they were government public schools, and it wasn't the best opportunity I could get. I wish I had the opportunity, as well as my colleagues, to have school choice, to have vouchers so my parents wouldn't have been trapped by sending me to a school that they had no other option to. That's a way that we can open doors for everybody. We start at the K through 12 level.And when you try to do this mismatch balancing at the end of it, you're going to give people a special boost that sets them up for failure. I went through the Affirmative Action programs. I knew a lot of my compatriots were being set up to fail because they were put in a place where they did not have the proper background. And that is absolutely demoralizing. And then you get locked into this idea that, well, maybe it's just racism, maybe it's some world obstacle that I can never overcome, and therefore I need this boost because I can't compete on my own. That is devastating to minority communities. And I'm so glad I didn't buy into that mindset. I saw an obstacle. I tried to go over it, and thank God I had my parents who stuck with me. But it's really about the opportunity of equality. That's the vision. And once you've taken off the shackles of racial balancing, the minorities will step up and deliver.",

You've got a very strong line of thunderstorms starting to slide into the city as we speak. So any travel on the major interstates like I-40, I-65, likely to have some delays there as this line goes through. Also, any airport travel, would not be surprised if there's delays as the line begins to slide in.And it's not the only area. That's the other thing to note. You've still got some showers and thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley, another cluster that is just to the west of Dallas. Really, as we go into the afternoon they continue into the evening hours, strong to severe thunderstorms are possible. We're talking damaging winds, large hail, and yes, even some isolated tornadoes. The best chance for that is really going to be across this area here, St. Louis, Louisville, down through Paducah, Kentucky. But basically, anywhere from eastern Kansas all the way over through eastern Pennsylvania has the potential for those severe thunderstorms, as well as that secondary spot located in western Texas. Now, we have that ongoing band now, but as we progress into the afternoon and evening hours, more of that is going to develop along the back side and begin to spread farther east into the mid-Atlantic and eventually into the northeast. We also will still have the potential for some pop-up showers and thunderstorms across the southeast, too, so any travel plans there could end up incurring some delays. Heat is going to be another big story. You've got areas across the southeast dealing with excessive heat warnings and heat advisories, as well as to the west where that next heat wave is really just starting to take shape out there. You are looking at, at least, two dozen cities to potentially break records not only this weekend, but also extending into Monday and Tuesday of the upcoming week.

They are really -- they are not trained military, but they are real fighters. So what do you do with them? So I think there are two differentissues. So if you look at the fighters themselves, they're useful to Russia, they could be useful to Belarus, and that's why you have the president of Belarus, Lukashenko, inviting them to help train his forces in Belarus, and also these reports of possibly building bases for them because, remember, the deal from Putin was join the regular military, go home to your families, or go to Belarus. So that's the forces. They could be useful. Then Prigozhin himself. Prigozhin is, as we've been saying, a loose cannon and a dangerous person in many ways. He is, or has been, pretty popular among Russians, kind of the tough guy, macho guy. So what do you do with him? If you kill him, you could alienate and really infuriate his followers.

This is a seasonal occurrence almost every year in the California current where we have spring upwelling. This is induced by winds. It brings nutrient rich water to the surface that fuels blooms. A lot of the times, these blooms are dominated by the particular plankton or microalgae that is causing this toxin.We don't always know when it's going to turn toxic. But there is something about the strength of the upwelling this year, the duration, and the mixture of nutrients in the water that is likely the cause of how we're seeing so much toxic production that the genes in these cells are being turned on to create this toxin.",

It wasn't quite as bad, but it was one of the worst we had seen in a while. I think my concern is that whenever we have one of these events in the last five years, I would say, each one seems to be worse than the last, where at least there's a sense that there's more toxin, the impacts are greater.When we saw an event like this last year we did not see nearly as many dolphins. We now have over 100 dolphins stranded and dead. That is unusual with respect to adenylic (ph) acid event. And so these are the things that cause us to take pause, to think while there are cycles in the ocean and there are years where these blooms are more common than other years, when we see them now and we're in one of those cycles, the toxins seem to be worse.",

But they're also asking for safer workloads and for better health care benefits. And they're also saying they would like to create a housing fund.

They essentially say that it's not the problem of the hotels. There's a number of hotels in the area that are going to be impacted if these workers do walk out. We're behind a Marriott property here. There are a number of Marriotts telling us that they are going to remain open. And so we'll have to wait and see exactly what happens over the next couple of days. But it is the holiday weekend.
