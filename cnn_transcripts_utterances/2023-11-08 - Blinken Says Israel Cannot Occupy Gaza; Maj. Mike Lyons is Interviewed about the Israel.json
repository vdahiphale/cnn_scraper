And that, like so many things in this conflict, in the war underway now, and whatever follows the war, the time period has not been defined.How long of a transition period is the U.S. willing to support? He seemed to be saying the U.S. will not support an endless one, but who's going to define how long of a security presence there is necessary for the Israeli military? To date those decisions have been principally Israeli decisions. How far to go into Gaza, what methods to use, what munitions to use, et cetera. They've been getting advice from the U.S., but they're making their own decisions. And that's yet another one that might, well, not just put it into conflict with other parties in the region here, particularly the Arab leaders, but there's a difference there between what Netanyahu is saying and what Secretary of State Blinken is saying. How they resolve that conflict, we don't know. But you bring up the other point as well, Sara, which is the issue of ceasefires, because, again, this has been something of a football back and forth between the U.S. and Israeli leaders. The U.S. has supported some sort of pause. But it was notable today to hear Blinken say, actually, it's Arab leaders calling for a full-on ceasefire who have to then explain how Hamas is kept in check if Israel were to stop military activities for a day or two days or three days. So, the U.S. at least endorsing to some degree Israel's position there, which is that we can't stop. We can't stop because Hamas remains a threat. And, frankly, that's what Israel has been doing, as we've seen these ground operations continue.",

So, he is going to hold another rally in Hialeah, Florida. Of course, he's trying to focus on what he believes is a growing advantage for him, and perhaps other Republican candidates as well, that is the broader umbrella of the Hispanic voters, particularly men.We've seen in poll after poll, survey after survey, including our latest CNN poll looking at a head to head hypothetical matchup with President Biden and former President Donald Trump, Hispanic men in particular are one area where Democrats are struggling with. So, we are told that that is one of the things that former President Donald Trump will be focusing on tonight, talking about socialism, talking about other things he believes that Democrats represent. Of course, you'll remember back to the 2020 campaign, even the 2016 campaign, former President Donald Trump carried the state of Florida. It has always long been a swing state. It certainly has been trending Republican in recent elections. So, that is one of the reasons he'll be in Hialeah. But, Kate, make no mistake, this is not simply a speech just to reach out to Latino voters. And, of course, they are not a monolith by any stretch. But this is going to be an opportunity for him to show grievances, which we've heard every time he holds a rally, talking about his indictments, et cetera. So, he does not want to be on the debate stage. He wants to hold a separate counterprogramming. But this is aimed first and foremost directly at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The former president will be surrounded by some Florida officials who have endorsed his candidacy over the Florida governor. But, Kate, when you sort of step back and sit here, this is the first debate in Florida in the governor's home state. He carried Florida by nearly 20 points last November. A year ago. Now he is struggling to be seen as the leading alternative and the former president clearly is wanting to take a shot at him tonight. So, that is why the former president will not be in this debate hall. He'll be holding a rally on his own. Kate.",

Most voters didn't like abortion, wanted it to be, to use Bill Clinton's term, rare, safe and legal with exceptions. But those politics don't exist anymore.

And so my hope is that the other folks in the field will see that there is an urgent need to defeat Donald Trump in the primary if we want to change this culture of losing in the Republican Party, and will drop out of the race and throw their support behind Nikki Haley, who stands the best chance to beat him.",

That's sort of all we're allowed to talk about these days.But what happened last night wasn't really about Donald Trump. Sure, we can talk MAGA Republicans or what have you, but it's about ballot initiatives that were unpopular with voters, it's about positions and ultimately candidates. We often say races aren't -- Democrats say this, Republicans say this, races aren't won or lost in Washington, D.C. Then we try and define it as to who won or lost it the day after. We also can look at the spending that was done. Every place where Republicans lost, they were massively outspent. But moving forward, we have five candidates on a debate stage who thus far really haven't taken on Donald Trump. And, you know, we've heard, you know, this phrase of -- so often of watershed moments. And the reality is, January 6th was a watershed moment. The 2018 elections, the 2020 elections were watershed moments. When your opponent gets indicted, that is a watershed moment for you to use, whether you're running for mayor, council -- city council, senator, what have you. But apparently, if it's Donald Trump, not only do you not attack him on that, you reinforce his messaging. And so for months now Donald Trump has been in a shored up, stronger position because of those candidates who ostensibly are running against him.
