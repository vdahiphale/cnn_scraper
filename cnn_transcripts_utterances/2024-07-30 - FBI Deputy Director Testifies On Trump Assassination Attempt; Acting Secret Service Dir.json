First, just your thoughts on what we have heard so far in the Senate. I know you've been monitoring it.REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Well, Dana, you know, first and foremost, let me just say the tone is completely different. And I want to give kudos to the acting director of the Secret Service and the deputy director of the FBI. Then we had from the now former Secret Service Director Cheatle, who was obtuse, frankly, was smug and really just sat behind an ongoing investigation. So I think being more forthcoming, being more transparent, the deputy director saying usually we don't give details of ongoing investigations. However, given the historic, unprecedented, nearly catastrophic nature of this assassination attempt, we're going to level as much as we can with the American people. So that's one. Number two, we didn't get to the bottom of what I think is the core issue yet and why I commend Speaker Johnson for setting up a bipartisan task force. Was President Trump denied resources? Was his core detail, which obviously he is not your average former president like a Jimmy Carter or a W. Bush, repeatedly requested and denied resources? The agents told me the day after the attempt that they were. Mayorkas immediately, publicly on CNN, said that's irresponsible and false. And since then, as did the Secret Service spokesperson, I confirmed Director Cheatle approved that denial and they've since walked that back. Today, what we heard is there will be no further denials going forward. But did we have some and why? Those are some of the things that really jumped out at me.",

We have an individual who's a loner. We have an individual who was focused on Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Hinckley traveled the 80 campaign, and we know that he followed President Carter. It just on March of '81, he happened to show up in Washington, D.C., and he saw an opportunity to try to attack President Reagan. So when it comes to the Secret Service, in 1981 was a watershed moment for us. We have people that are, for whatever reason, fixated on carrying out an attack against the president of the United States or one of our protectees. And in this instance, you have the assailant who was a loner. Obviously, he was researching. He had researched the Democratic National Convention. He had researched and Googled or used a search engine about the president, the former president. And so I think he had moved towards an idea that he was going to try to do something. And so when I look at this, we don't have a challenge with the FBI or the intelligence community. I think what we always try to wrestle with is trying to line up and see people as they're starting to head down a pathway towards violence. And it's something that we have spent a lot of time and resources in with our National Threat Assessment Center to try to gain a better understanding so that we can help our agents in the field as they're doing these protective intelligence cases and these investigations to be able to make a determination. Is somebody generally a threat or do they need mental health or do they need some other type of service? SEN. JACKY ROSEN (D), NEVADA: Thank you. I appreciate that. My time is over. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",

TOM COTTON (R-AR): At the onset, I want to express, as many members have, as President Trump did, the admiration and respect for the bravery and skill of the officers who were on site that day, Secret Service officers, as well as all the local law enforcement. As it happened, my nine-year-old son was watching with me that afternoon, and it's hard to get him to turn away from it. And he asked who all those men and women were who jumped on Mr. Trump. And I said, in layman's terms, those are his bodyguards. And he said, what are they doing? I said, they're protecting him from a bullet. And he said, actually? And I said, yes. He said, for real? And I said, yes. And it was hard for him to process that. But as a reminder, I told him that there are men and women in the Secret Service, in law enforcement, in the military, who are willing to die for our country. And it's an important lesson, I think, that everyone should take away from this, that you had very brave men and women on the ground there who were doing their job to protect this country, to protect a former president and a nominee for president, as they do every day for so many other protectees. Obviously, there were failures in the planning and preparation for this event. Mr. Rowe, we've heard that the shooter had a golf rangefinder. Was that not on the list of prohibited items at an event like this?",

And it feels like a lot of that was just the lack of common sense being exercised. Are officers not empowered on the front line to use common sense to say, like, if a guy has a laser rangefinder, he should be detained, or at least stopped, and that's why he's carrying it around?If you have a building like this that's not secure from 150 meters away, someone, even the front line, lowest level, most junior officer should be able to kind of like send up the red flag immediately and say, like, we need to halt everything right now and figure out what the hell is going on.

We'll look at it based on what the event size. We'll say, hey, listen, we're going to send 10 based on our protocols of screening so many. We have a flow rate of how many people we can put through. When it comes to a counter sniper or something like that, because I know that's been the subject of some media reporting where they have requested counter snipers. We do have a finite number of counter snipers. And so what we try to do is if we cannot fill that asset, and that's where we'll say, hey, we can't fill this assignment.However, through the field office, they will use local law enforcement resources. And so in those situations, for example, in the one that has been the subject of a lot of reporting with Pickens, South Carolina, they, in fact, did use local assets to be able to do that. And there were three counter sniper teams. They -- one of them was formerly with the Secret Service Uniform Division. And so they actually used the same practices that we use. So it's not that there was a drop in the capability. They actually used the best practices that we would use. So the asset may be denied by Secret Service between the war room and that conversation with the detail in the field, but that doesn't equate to a vulnerability or a gap.",
