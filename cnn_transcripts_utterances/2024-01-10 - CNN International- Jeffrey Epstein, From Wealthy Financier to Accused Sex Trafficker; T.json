They may only see the insides of the conference hall, but that's OK, because look. Thanks to SK Telecom, you can actually see the Las Vegas sphere in slightly smaller form within the conference center.Now, there have been so many big announcements at CES in the first day. From NVIDIA, new chips for PC computers. This is to enable better AI capability. From Honda, the launch of a new series of electric vehicles, the Honda Zero, ultra lightweight. Its very space age will be available from 2026. And perhaps the most entertaining moment, actually, from a Sony executive who managed to drive a prototype car partnered with Honda onto a stage using a PlayStation console. Plenty of gimmicks. I hope dearly that is not the future of driving. Sony actually also unveiled a mixed reality headset that's expected to be available later this year. No price tag on that. Which brings me perhaps to one of the biggest tech announcements of the week by a company that isn't even here. Apple, with a Vision Pro expected now to go on sale with pre-orders this month. Goes on sale February the 2nd in the U.S., retailing at $3,500. Now, quite aside from all the big announcements, of course, plenty of gadgets and gizmos. Robotics, wearable tech, everything has a bit of AI in it, it feels this year. So, we'll be playing with all of that. So, check in with us. I'm Anna Stewart at CES in Las Vegas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
