So this Supreme Court decision essentially allows Title 42 to remain in effect while those legal challenges play out, a process that can take months. In this five-four order, the justices delivered that victory to Republican-led states who sought to intervene in the case and block the termination of Title 42.Now, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented, citing and said with the liberals and his dissent is interesting because it really captures the moment we're in it. He says the current border crisis is not a COVID crisis, and courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency. This is a public health order that has been bouncing around the courts since April. And now we're at a point where, while the administration was preparing for it to end, it instead will remain in place. The Supreme Court said that they will hear arguments in their session beginning in February, which means that this will get a full decision sometime early to mid- next year. Amara?",

Croft was the final defendant to be sentenced. Yesterday, Adam Fox, who prosecutors say was a plot leader, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Let's go now to CNN's Jean Casarez. And, Jean, prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Croft to life. He got about 20 years, but that's still a longer sentence than the man who was considered the leader of the plot. Why is that?",

Everyone else was in Michigan. He really wasn't involved to the extent that the others were. He attended a few practices, but he wasn't into the recruiting aspect intently like Adam Fox was or getting the money or effectuating the plan.And, but then the prosecutor, Niles Kessler, came on, and this is an assistant U.S. attorney. He said, Your Honor, he was the spiritual leader here. He was the one that compared himself to a prophet. And then he went on saying that he was like an al-Qaeda leader or an ISIS leader, that he was the one that gave theories that there needed to be a revolution, that you needed, that were going to be the brand new founding fathers. Well, when the judge then was explaining everything, his sentence, you know, the rationale for it, he said, you know, Adam Fox was really against the COVID restrictions, and that's what made him begin all this. But Barry Croft was deeply embedded in this philosophy well before that because he felt there should be a revolution, that violence was the only way. And he instilled that thought into Adam Fox. And then Adam Fox went from there. So, in a sense, the judge said, Barry Croft is more dangerous in all of this. The defense had said, Your Honor, now that he's sober, he's different, and he understands. He can't even listen to what he may have said before. But the judge said, I take issue with that, because he did a PBS interview from jail several years ago where he exposed the same philosophies to an associate of his. So I really question that. So the result was almost 20 years in prison and then he will be out, and he's in his late 40s, so he will have life beyond this.",
