      "sentences": "Hello. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.The balance of power and the power struggle. Right now, House Republicans are on the cusp of taking control and are about to meet behind closed doors. The mission? Decide who will lead their conference and potentially succeed Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House. Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants the job, but we're learning at least one pro-Trump lawmaker will challenge him for the top spot. But Republicans haven't quite secured the majority just yet. The number of seats needed for a House majority is 218. And here we are, one week after the election, neither party is there. Republicans are inching closer with 215. So far, we will talk about some of those remaining races in just a minute. But, first, let's get to CNN's Manu Raju on the Hill. And, Manu, how do Republicans expect things to shake out with this leadership vote today?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is going to be a crucial first test for Kevin McCarthy, who is expected to get the nomination from his conference in just a matter of moments to become the next speaker of the House.Now, in order to do that, he just needs to get the support of a majority of House Republicans. But the big question is, how many Republicans will support him? Because in order to become speaker of the House in January, presuming Republicans are in the majority, he will need 218 votes of the full House. And with all Democrats almost certain to vote against him, that means he will need to keep most of the House Republicans on his side. And we do expect, if there is a Republican majority, it will be a narrow one, meaning a handful of defections could be enough to keep them underneath that 218-vote threshold, which is why this vote that's going to happen behind closed doors by secret ballot, is so significant, because we will know how much work Kevin McCarthy has in order to secure that 218-vote threshold. Now, he does have a challenger, Andy Biggs. He is a conservative member of that hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Biggs does not have the votes in order to become nominated the speaker, but his goal is to try to pull McCarthy below that 218-vote threshold in order to extract concessions, in which rank-and-file members as part of that Freedom Caucus want to exert more leverage, power over the speakership, weaken the speakership, something that McCarthy has resisted. They want to try to get him to the negotiating table, have him cut some deals, before they would ultimately support him. So this first test will happen in just a matter of moments. We will see how McCarthy does and then it's several weeks ahead that he tries to lock down the votes here, Ana.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  They didn't want to have an agenda.

Democrat Katie Hobbs narrowly edged out Trump-backed Republican Kari Lake. And there you see it, Hobbs up by less than 1 percentage point with 98 percent of the vote counted. So it's close, but this is a flip now for Democrats and a major blow to the Trump wing of the GOP. Lake was one of the most outspoken proponents of the former president's lies about the 2020 election and his baseless conspiracies about Arizona's elections process. And she ran a very Trump-style campaign. In defeat even, she's taking a page right out of the Trump playbook as well. Before the race was called, Lake was on FOX saying this election was -- quote -- \"botched.\" And, as of now, she's yet to concede, but she has tweeted, posting: \"Arizonans know B.S. when they see it.\" I quote her there. John, set the record straight on this Hobbs win.",

I will write that down, 18,000 votes. That margin is actually -- actually more than Donald Trump lost by. So she's doing worse than Donald Trump did in Arizona. And there were more votes cast in that election. Not only that, come back to this year. I want to show you Nevada, right? Again, I'm keeping that up there, 18,000 votes -- pardon me, Utah, for writing on you. But, in Nevada, for instance, in both the Senate race, only 8,000 votes separate the candidates in the Nevada Senate race, in the governor's race, 14,000 votes. So, again, both of those are less than the 18,000 that Kari Lake is complaining about. And both candidates in Nevada, both the losing governor candidate and the losing Senate candidate, they have called and conceded. They have already conceded, and there's one person in each party. So you can see what Kari Lake is doing compared to what other candidates have actually done across the country in this election year is just sour grapes.",

I think people think that crime is a problem. I don't think people like cancel culture. I think people think the economy is bad. But they didn't trust Republicans to fix any of it. They didn't understand what Republicans were going to do to fix any of it. And so I just think it turns out that people are a little bit more sophisticated than we thought. There is a constituency out there for democracy, for the rule of law, and for women's rights, and that trumped a whole bunch of other stuff. But even the non-Trump Republicans did not do as well, because I think they thought they could just demagogue crime and the economy with no answers. And it didn't work. It didn't work.",

And when so many stories are talking about him being weakened, 24 hours from now, we will see -- or from the speech, we will see his campaign put out information that he's raised a lot of money. And they're going to start to try and drive a narrative that actually he's not weakened. And this is the battle and the internal conversation, external conversation too, that Republicans need to have, because Mitch McConnell was right. We had a candidate quality issue. And the Trumpiest of the Trump the candidates, whether it's Doug Mastriano, or Kari Lake, or Dr. Oz, they lost, and they deserved to lose.",

He only takes them away one at a time. And so, as a lot of independent voters are looking at the Republican Party these days and saying, this MyPillowization of the GOP isn't what we want is a check and balance on the Biden administration, it's a real problem for Republicans, because it's really difficult to see Donald Trump on a stage congratulating somebody else who's the Republican nominee.

But the reality is that, as long as the House is in Republican hands, you're still going to have divided government. So I think it's important, though, for Democrats to have that extra vote. By the way, if one Democratic senator in a red state retires or gets sick or, unfortunately, might even die, the entire Senate could flip. If it's a 50/50 Senate, you're usually one bad accident from the thing flipping back the other direction. So I think the Democrats need the cushion. I think it would limit Joe Manchin's power a little bit, Kyrsten Sinema's power a little bit. But you still would have divided government.

Now, it's important to understand that this is just a single piece of intelligence reporting. It's not clear that this was the decisive factor for Russia in determining the timing of this announcement. And, certainly, it would have been far from the only factor. Military analysts had been clear that Russia had few other operational options at this point in time, except for withdrawal, and certainly had been planning this pullback for four weeks. But, that said, President Biden did hint publicly in remarks last week that the United States believed that the timing of the announcement, which took place the day after the U.S. midterms on Wednesday of last week, was more than mere coincidence. Take a listen to what he had to say to reporters on Wednesday last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
