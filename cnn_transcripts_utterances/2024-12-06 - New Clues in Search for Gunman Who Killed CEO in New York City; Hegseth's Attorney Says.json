Newly released photos show the gunman smiling right there while flirting with the woman. That woman, an employee at the hostel where he stayed, said she asked him to lower his mask during the exchange. That's why we have this picture. That's why the camera caught this moment.Investigators say the man used a fake New Jersey driver's license to check into that hostel and he paid in cash. We also learned the suspect arrived in New York City ten days before the shooting on a Greyhound Bus that originated in Atlanta. Now, it's not clear if he got on the bus in Atlanta or someone else -- somewhere else, I should say. With us now is CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. John, what people can't see is you were actually on the phone working your sources right up until the minute you come on. You just got off the phone. What is the latest?",

This guy looks like my high school teacher. I think I saw him yesterday. But, you know, the ones that will rise to the top are if they get, you know, four calls about the same person or if they do a background investigation into a name. And it turns out that person, you know, has a giant issue going on in the background about a health care issue. So, they're working through that.But, they now have a bigger palette to work from because, not just in flying in, doing the murder and, you know, disappearing.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Kate. Yes, that threat is not going over well. We've already heard from Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said it was reprehensible.But let's talk about where exactly Hegseth stands as of this Friday. We know that coming out of this week, there are no hard noes. That is according to his team. They are still optimistic that there is a pathway for Hegseth to get confirmed. And because of that, Donald Trump has not pulled his support from Pete Hegseth. The two of them spoke yesterday. We know that he told Pete, according to Pete Hegseth, that he had his full support, and that he's still trying to fight for every single vote. He has more meetings up on the Hill next week, but, of course the question is whether or not Donald Trump continues to maintain that support. We are told the reason that he has not pulled away from Hegseth is twofold. One, the fact that they do believe there's this pathway, that there aren't any hard noes, like what we saw with Attorney General Nominee Matt Gaetz, it was just very clear early on, but, two, a part of what is going on here is the fact that Donald Trump is being told by some of his advisers that they don't want him to seemingly lose again in a battle with lawmakers, that this could be some kind of power struggle. But at the end of the day, we know one thing. This looks very different from the Matt Gaetz situation for a number of reasons. One, Donald Trump isn't really rallying behind Hegseth in the same way. He is clearly lending his support, but he's not personally calling senators, and it doesn't appear that he's going to. J.D. Vance, vice president-elect, is doing that work for him. But on the other side of this, again, they are still being told that they see an opportunity here for Hegseth to be confirmed as secretary of defense. We'll obviously wait and see. One thing, Kate, to keep in mind, I was told by a senior adviser to Trump that if there are more allegations, more accusations, that could change everything.",

Listen, we should warn our viewers, if you are a little bit bothered by the influence of money in politics, you might find this segment disturbing because, yes, the richest guy on the planet bankrolled Donald Trump to the tune of $260 million. It's a staggering amount of money. It's also stunning because remember, Musk, he used to back Democrats. He donated to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, albeit by smaller amounts.He also, just two years ago, he said that Trump was too old to be president and suggested that he should ride off into the sunset. Instead, he ended up using his almost limitless financial power to bankroll Trump, and he donated to three super PACS. Now, we knew about America PAC, more than $200 million. This was the group that spent a lot of money in battleground states. But new FEC filings show that he also bankrolled two other groups that had emerged in the final days of the campaign, including RBG PAC. Now, this made an ad splash by linking Trump's abortion record to the views of former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Now, Ginsburg's great granddaughter ended up saying that the advertising there was misleading but it's very interesting that we didn't even know about this until now. Also, he backed another super PAC that was trying to persuade supporters of RFK Jr. to back Trump again in battleground states. He put all this together and he spent a lot of money to get Trump elected. Now, he's got the ear of the president, the future president, and he's also got this key role at DOGE, the government efficiency panel, that is brainstorming ways to slash government spending and also cut regulation.
