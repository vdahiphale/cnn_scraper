And we now have a key race alert. It is too early to call in the following states, Alabama, which has 50 delegates at stake, too early to call; Maine, which has 20 delegates at stake, too early to call; Massachusetts, with 40 delegates at stake, too early to call. Let's look at Oklahoma. Oklahoma, 43 delegates at stake, too early to call; Tennessee, 58 delegates at stake, too early to call.Now let's look at some of the voting as they're actually coming in, actual votes. Back to the state of Vermont, Donald Trump still in the lead, 10 percent estimated vote in. Donald Trump has 51.4 percent of the vote, 3,601 votes. He's 456 votes ahead of Nikki Haley, who has 44.9 percent of the vote. Again, that's with only 10 percent of the vote in, but still, at some point, we're going to see whether Nikki Haley is able to even make one stand in Vermont this evening, because we thought - she thought, her campaign thought, maybe she was going to be able to at least make a stand of some sort in Virginia.

You're not expecting Nikki Haley to beat Donald Trump in Tennessee. So the question is, can she do anything tonight? Again, to convince her donors it's worth staying on another Tuesday or another couple months and the like.At the moment, you see nothing. So you go back and look at the Vermont votes, just again, since you were here. No updates since you were here. You're watching a very tiny amount come in. You need them up in Burlington, you need them in Rutland, Montpelier's the state capital. Again, a more quirky state, a more independent-minded state, where, as you noted earlier, the Republican governor, who is no fan of Donald Trump, has endorsed Nikki Haley. The Republican senator, no fan of Donald Trump, Susan Collins, has endorsed her here in Maine. Does that matter anymore in politics, is it enough, that's the big question. Because one of the things, Donald Trump is now the Republican establishment. I think that's a fair statement. But he runs against that old Republican establishment. Anyone who had a title or was involved before he got here, he runs against them. And again, as you - just look at the map, and you pull it up, Jake, it's amazing. I just want to pop, we've already projected this, but you look at this, right? So we have a lot of votes to count still. We've projected this.",

And as John is saying, that college divide, normally you don't see the same kind of divide play out in a general election as you do inside a primary, but it speaks to the fundamental divide in the Republican Party. The Trump takeover of the party and where the party has moved in the Trump era. The divide between the Haley and Trump voters, as it comes to the education level, is the same kind of divide we're going to see between Joe Biden and Donald Trump come November. So you are getting a preview of that.I would just note, Jake, we are seeing, in some of these North Carolina results, the work that Donald Trump is going to have to do to bring some of that Haley support into the fold. Some of it will happen naturally, of course. They'll put on the R jersey in November, and they will vote for Donald Trump. But you can see here, among people who say they're not part of the MAGA movement, which is a significant chunk in North Carolina. Haley wins them, as you might expect, 50 percent to 45 percent. So I just take a look at that and say, okay, how much of that Haley 50 percent of those that don't identify with Trump's big political movement naturally comes to Donald Trump in November and how much remains resistant where Joe Biden can go fishing for votes? We could do this sort of demographic by demographic in these primary results, Donald Trump dominating inside his party. But there are pockets of voters that we will be asking about for the next eight months across these states as to what slice of these Republican primary voters remains so resistant to Donald Trump that they may actually be available voters for Joe Biden, maybe stay home, maybe vote third party.",

You say, oh, why does that matter?Well, this was a good one. Joe Biden, 155,000 votes nearly here, 154,000 in change here. Of the battleground states, that was the big lead, right? Every vote matters. If you're bleeding those Muslim- Americans who are mad at you, can you get the Haley voters? Well, look at the margin here. The other battleground states were so close. The other battleground states were so close in 2020 and also in 2016 that if Donald Trump is bleeding Haley voters, they're available to Joe Biden, that's enough to make up a margin, in a place like that, 20,000 votes. You come here. In a giant state, 7 million votes cast almost 81,000 votes is your margin, right, in Pennsylvania. You go down to Georgia, it's 11,000 votes. And so close elections are won on the margin, so where do those Haley voters go? Can Joe Biden shore up the bleeding he has in the Democratic base?

North Carolina is probably the greatest demographic, education-wise, political parties, tug of war, one of the greatest states in the United States to watch a 50-50 tug of war.So you see the circles there are where Haley's doing very well tonight. Then you go back to the 2020 presidential map. Overlaps, right? Those are the places Joe Biden won in North Carolina, even though he lost the state. So some Trump supporter might say, oh, well, they're just Democrats. No. They are Republicans, Jake. There are some Democrats, they're independents, but they are suburban voters who, if we were back in the day of George W. Bush, even George H.W. Bush, when Republicans won the suburbs on issues like crime, on issues like lower taxes, they're those kinds of voters. But we have seen in recent years since the Obama presidency and especially in the Trump age, more money in their pockets, higher education level, they tend to vote Democratic and they are voting for Nikki Haley tonight in North Carolina, and those are the very voters. Joe Biden, as Jeff said, lost by 75,000 votes, 74,000 and change in South Carolina. But that was a lot better than Hillary Clinton did four years before that. So we talk about, is Virginia back in play? I doubt it. Is North Carolina back in play? I doubt that too, except for that down-ballot governor's race. You never know.

It has the city of Houston, but then the county has been stretched out. It's an incredible, diverse - very rich, diverse. There's a lot of - Republicans were mad about the drop boxes down here. This is one of the states Gov. Abbott rolled back some of the COVID voting things down here. This was a huge battleground for voting rights in 2020, but it's one of the fast-growing.So you've got an urban area here that will be solid blue, and then you have some suburbs where you have a fair amount of Republican voters. And so you watch how that plays out. About half the vote in there already, Trump - getting 77 percent, if you round that up there in Harris County. But again, that's something we want to look at. Is Haley - and it's in the places where Haley did not campaign as much or spend as much, where maybe there's not as much attention on the race, does she stay above 30 or is she declining in these states? Now, the Trump campaign will make the argument - this is a Republican state and her number's lower if it stays like that and that's their way to make the case that - careful with the fire alarms. Now, I make the argument and I'll make it through November, suburbs in 2020 and 2018 in the midterm elections, the suburbs were Donald Trump's kryptonite, and we still see some evidence of his weaknesses in these primaries. So you keep making the case. But as they watch this happen, they'll look down here. Travis County is where Austin is. This is a strong Democratic stronghold. Doesn't mean there's not Republicans there. That's where the state capitol is. So we'll look for that as more results come in, in Texas to see if, in the urban areas, does it pull down ultimately that percentage? Is Haley getting enough votes in places? Because I just said, there's a ton of Trump, especially in these small, rural counties. I mean, if you go back, just take a look at the 2020 election. Democrats can win the cities and the close-in suburbs, even in a place like Texas, you think of it as a red state, but just look at that. I mean, this is what Donald Trump does.

Most of that vote's going to him.The question is, again, in the suburbs, like everywhere else, we have some Oklahoma. Oklahoma's another fascinating state. So many of these states demographically are changing. Oklahoma's a red state, you know, Oklahoma's a red state. But Oklahoma County, where Oklahoma City is, if you go back in time, you come back here, it's - Joe Biden, that's pretty close, right? That's pretty close. So there are a lot of Democrats in the Oklahoma City area here. So you watch this play out. Now we're back here, but you have, at the moment - at the moment, you've totally - total Trump red. So as he moves into the southern states and you move west, Trump is expecting not only to win, but to dominate. The challenge is, can Haley, again, let's just check on Vermont. It's close as we get more votes in Vermont. It's close-ish there, so you keep an eye on that one and then you come down here, where she's leading in Massachusetts. But at the moment, it's just Norton and Provincetown, that's all we have out of my commonwealth. Two very small communities have reported so far.

We're doing this in alphabetical order, as I'm sure you can tell. Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina. Tennessee, which we just called a second ago, and Virginia, which we called about an hour ago. On the Democratic side, we have another projection for you as well.

Let's bring you a key race alert for you right now. And right now, Arkansas, the polls just closed and CNN is saying it is too early to call the state of Arkansas with 40 delegates at stake. Polls closed at 8:30 Eastern Time. Right now, too early to call. And John King, once again, Donald Trump, and this has not happened in modern presidential politics for a non-incumbent. And then people can say, oh, he's like the incumbent. OK, but he's not. He's not the actual incumbent. People did jump into the race to run against him. There was a whole field.

The map tells you what you need to know. The delegate count tells you what you need to know. The percentage of it has actually jumped up even more. It's 88 percent of the delegates, so you're looking at the percentage. Donald Trump cannot mathematically clinch tonight but he can get within a hundred or so of what he needs, and he can do that next week. And so what you have here is, you know, he has remade the party in his image. There are still some Republicans who are trying to take it away, like take it back, right? That's over. That's over.

Let's take a look at the vote board in Vermont with 17 delegates at stake. Donald Trump maintains his lead, 48.2 percent of the vote. He's one vote ahead. When I was talking about the lead he maintained, I'm referring to this one vote. Donald Trump has 10,992 votes. Nikki Haley has 10,991 votes. That's about a third of Vermont's vote is in, a third estimated vote. Donald Trump has one more vote than Nikki Haley. In Texas, in the Republican primary, 161 delegates have staked Donald Trump far in the lead. 74.9 percent of the vote, 674,785 votes. That's almost 500,000 more votes than Nikki Haley, who has 19.9 percent of the vote. That's with a pretty big chunk of the vote in, 40 percent of the estimated vote in from Texas. Donald Trump off to a rather healthy lead there. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 40 delegates at stake. Donald Trump, again, with a sizable lead. It's only 2 percent of the estimated vote, but he has 60.7 percent of the vote, 8, 894 votes. That is about 3,700 votes more than Nikki Haley, who has 35.4 percent of the vote. Again, that's a minuscule amount of the vote there, 2 percent of the estimated vote in Massachusetts. In Maine, with 20 delegates at stake, Donald Trump has 71.2 percent of the vote. 71.4 percent of the vote, I'm sorry, they just updated it, 7,295 votes. That's more than 5,100 votes more than Nikki Haley, who has 21.3 percent of the vote. That's what the 10 percent of the estimated vote in. Donald Trump off to a very healthy lead in the state of Maine, which will prove crucial in November. Let us turn now to the Republican caucuses out west in Utah.
