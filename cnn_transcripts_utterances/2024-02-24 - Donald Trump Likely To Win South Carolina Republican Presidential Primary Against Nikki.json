They're having on Shane Gillis, a very popular comedian who, as it happens, a little backstory, he was brought on as a cast member for \"SNL\" back in 2016, and he was almost immediately bounced from the show because of some of his more offensive and edgy routines. The fact that they're bringing him back on to appeal to a different audience, to demonstrate that there or can be second acts when it comes to \"SNL\", I think it's a sign of maturity for the show and actually a sign of a larger change in our culture, a moving away from cancel culture, and an embrace of the fact that, look, comedy has got to speak to a lot of different audiences if it's going to be relevant.",
