All of them told me they were trying to figure out if there was any sort of evidence or witnesses that they did not know about in this case, particularly that would boost up Jack Smith's case.Now, a lot of this has to do is the target letter and that's potential charges. I'm told that when they saw those potential charges, is more robust and became much more clear that Jack Smith, the special counsel, had a bigger case he was trying to prosecute against the former president than what Trump's team had believed in the first place. And you have to keep in mind, Trump's team has been watching the investigation carefully. On top of that, there are a number of witness who've gone before the grand jury in the January 6th investigation who the lawyers were paid for by Trump world. That has given them a unique amount of insight into the investigation. Yes, still they are taken by surprise. So, clearly, here again, trying to figure out if there is a sort of evidence or witness they did not know about that has led to this. The other part of this, they're telling me this is going to be business as usual. If he's, indicted it will be the third indictment. I will continue campaigning. The thing to remember again is that he is a candidate for president once more. This is his third White House bid, and these legal issues have actually been bolstering his campaign, both the fundraising and polling. But I am told by advisers that they still did not know the long term effect of these legal issues. Obviously, we are in unprecedented territory. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Bridgewater, New Jersey.

Ukrainian officials said (INAUDIBLE) that way, and we've images coming from official sources in Ukraine showing destruction of ports, not just Odesa but Chornomorsk, which is down at the Black Sea coast.The agriculture ministry coming out on Wednesday and saying that most of the ports of Chornomorsk which is, by the way, one of the three that was included in that grain deal that Russia pulled out of, that much of that is now out of commission. It would take about a year, they estimated, to rebuild it. In addition, 60,000 tons of grain were also destroyed, they say, in the overnight air strikes into Wednesday. That grain destined to have been shipped through what were once a safe maritime corridors that Russia now says it will interpret any ship that is in that region as a potentially carrying military cargo. So, this will make it very difficult for any kind of semblance of this deal to be reinstated. President Putin also saying on Wednesday that the deal in its current form is pretty much dead, if the actions haven't already spoken to that. Obviously, that affects supply. Prices is the other thing. Wheat prices up again this morning, futures -- corn futures as well, that's on top of the 9 percent rise we saw in wheat futures on Wednesday, all of that, of course, heading in the wrong direction when it comes to fighting food insecurity around the world. But I wanted to show you, because when we see the ports in the overnight strikes coming into Thursday, they hit civilian areas coming under fire with 90 missiles launched on Ukraine's air force only managed to shake down five of them. We have footage coming out of Mykolaiv which shows that residential building on fire, 19 reported to be injured there. The regional chief saying fatalities as well but we do not have more information on that. And in Odesa, the region of Odesa itself now eight people confirmed injured in one death confirmed there by the regional chief, Christine. So this was another very destructive night.",

They don't do that.They have to decide two things, and that is, was a crime committed, or is there reasonable cause to believe a crime was committed, and that the subject of the proceeding were looking at if Donald Trump commit that. And so, the bars are pretty low in the grand jury to make that decision, and upon doing that, it's not even unanimous, right? Only 12 of 23 have to reach an accord as to whether it happens. And so, what grand jurors do is they generally indict people. They are an armed of the prosecutor. The prosecutor presents evidence and information. And after that evidence and information in a form of witnesses, in a form of documents, in a form of surveillance, in the form of anything else, then prosecutors then ask, Christine, that grand jury to vote out an indictment. So, what happens next is more process, meaning more information presented to the grand jury until ultimately they're confronted, that is the grand jury, with the specific charge prosecutors want to bring. And then they are asked to vote on those charges. I think based upon the target letter, of course, that Mr. Trump received, I think an indictment certainly should be forthcoming and would be forthcoming soon.

But the target letter certainly the essence of it, is informing the person who is the subject of the proceeding that, hey, you know, we have evidence that you may have committed crimes, and these are the various statutes we think you committed crimes on and we invite you, right, the subject of -- the target here being Mr. Trump to come testify before the grand jury. We defense attorneys never like to do that, because of course anything you say can and will be used against you. So, we generally don't know the grandeur.

That process consists of eventually after your client is indicted, the indictment itself is Chris Christie was alluding to, and that will delineate specific charges that you're facing and will delineate the evidence there, right? And that's what the legal team is waiting for that indictment and then much more than that, what ends up happening is that you are entitled to everything that the prosecutors have relied on, what reports, what documents, what emails, what text messages, what witnesses, what type of investigation.

Now, King, as you can see there in that photograph, he was not uniform, and he was at the border, he was on a tour of the joint security area when he suddenly dashed across the border. That photo was taken on Tuesday. Right before he broke away from the tour. He is right there in the bottom left and the black shirt, black and photos taken by another tourist who was there, a tourist from New Zealand. Her name, Sarah Leslie. And she said an American soldier shouted \"get him\" as King ran across the border. She was shocked when he did it. That one point thought it was a stunt, a TikTok stunt. We also learned what is happening to Travis during his time in South Korea. He spent 50 days in front of a detention facility doing hard labor for assault charges. He was released early last week on July 10th. He checked into an American airlines flight to Dallas on July 17th, but he did not board the plane, saying that he had a missing passport. Of course, Christine, all this comes at a time of high tension on the Korean peninsula.
