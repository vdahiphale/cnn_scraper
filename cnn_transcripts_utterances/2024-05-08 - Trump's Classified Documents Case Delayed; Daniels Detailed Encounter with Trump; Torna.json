One of these, a huge win. The other, infuriating him, as Stormy Daniels took the stand and detailed the alleged affair and payment at the center of Trump's criminal charges.First, though, the classified documents case in Florida now postponed most likely until after the election. Why? Because the judge has decided that it is going to be on hold indefinitely. CNN's Evan Perez is leading us off. Evan, this trial was supposed to start this very month. What is the judge saying as to why this is delayed for so long or indefinitely as we know right now?",

In this case Judge Aileen Cannon is now saying that there's too many pretrial motions for her to go through. There's eight of them that are pending. And she's now scheduled proceedings through - essentially take us through July, which really makes it almost impossible for us to get this trial date back on track and certainly before the election. Of course, that's been the goal of the former president, which is to delay this trial, to make sure it doesn't happen before the November election.Now, a couple of things that the judge cited as her reasoning. She said that obviously these are - these are issued - these national security issues were - present novel and difficult questions. She also said that there is going to be these two hearings. One of them - both of them, rather, in late June. There were kind of longshot items, including this motion right Donald Trump that challenges the appointment of Jack Smith as unconstitutional or as illegal.

And I think, yes, it was the right move by Judge Merchan to deny the mistrial. This doesn't quite rise to the level where you have to stop the trial and declare it over.But, Kate, if we think about this strategically, prosecutors have stressed to the jury throughout this case, they've stressed to the public in their public statements, this is not a case about sex. This is a case about business records. Falsifying business records. It's our bread and butter here at the DA's office. It's what we do all the time. We do it to ensure business integrity. OK, why then did prosecutors go into so much extraneous detail about the sexual encounter to the point where Judge Merchan sustained numerous objections. He found that the questions were inappropriate. And I have to say this also, Kate, prosecutors took some cheap shots yesterday in their examination of Stormy Daniels because for the first time ever they elicited from Stormy Daniels a suggestion that this sexual encounter may not have been consensual. She said she blacked out. She said, I'm not saying he drugged me. She said he was imposing. He was large. He was blocking my access to the door. That's way beyond the scope of anything she said before. And it's way beyond the scope of anything the judge was willing to allow.",

Necheles saying, while - \"now, while you've been refusing to pay President Trump the money that you owe him, you've also been making money by claiming that you had sex with President Trump, right?\" Stormy Daniels says, \"are you talking about the book?\" Yes.\" \"And you've been making money by claiming you had sex with Donald Trump for more than a decade, right?\" Daniel says, \"I have not been paid for interviews in the United States, if that's what you mean.\" Necheles says, \"well, that was not my question. My question was, you've been making money by claiming to have had sex with President Trump for more than a decade.\" \"I have been making money by telling my story about what happened to me.\" \"And that story, in essence, is that you say you had sex with President Trump.\" \"Yes.\" \"And that story has made you a lot of money, right?\" It has also cost me a lot of money.\" Why is this relevant in your mind?",

She sued Donald Trump for defamation. A federal court threw it out and said, now you owe Donald Trump his attorneys fees. And she said, I am going to go to the grave before I ever pay that money. She's defying a court order.Now, she said previously that that lawsuit was the product of bad advice from Michael Avenatti, who's now in prison for other reasons. She hasn't quite said that on the stand. I think that's something I would want to go back to if I was the prosecution here. That's how this all came about. And to the point of the excerpt you just read, Kate, Stormy Daniels has a financial interest in the outcome of this case. If this is a conviction, she sells more books. She's written books. She says she's working on two more. She gets on more podcasts. She gets more downloads. If this case results in a not guilty verdict or a hung jury, then the market on the Stormy Daniels enterprise goes down. There's just no way around that. So, she has a financial interest in this case. So too will we see Michael Cohen has an even stronger one, and that's fair game for both sides to bring up.",
