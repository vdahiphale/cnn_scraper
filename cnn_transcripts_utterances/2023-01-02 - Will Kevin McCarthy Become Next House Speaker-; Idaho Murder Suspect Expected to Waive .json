Right now, the man charged with killing four Idaho college students is planning to waive extradition. What more we're learning about him. Plus, tens of thousands of people are now paying their respects in person to former Pope Benedict and soccer legend Pele, two men who meant so much to so many. But we begin with the New Year's Eve machete attack on three New York City police officers. Sources now telling CNN the teen was on a terror watch list. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is in Times Square.

We have also just heard from police officials who told me Trevor Bickford has been officially charged with two counts of attempted murder of a police officer and two counts of attempted assault. Trevor Bickford remains in the hospital under police guard. And I should also point out that he has not yet been charged with any federal crimes. That remains an option. We have heard from law enforcement sources who tell us that the U.S. attorney of New York in the Southern District was weighing whether or not to charge Bickford with any federal offenses. Now, more about what we know of the suspect. We know that he traveled here on Saturday on an Amtrak train and traveled here to the area on New Year's Eve. He was carrying a backpack which included in its content a handwritten diary where he wrote about his desire to travel to Afghanistan to join the Taliban and his willingness to die for his religion. Now, as we know from the investigation and what police tell us, he approached one of the security checkpoints around the perimeter here of Times Square. That's where he approached the police officers, striking them on the head with a machete. He struck a second officer. A third officer fired his weapon, injuring a Bickford in the shoulder, and he continues to recover in the hospital. We're awaiting to learn more about the possible motivation, what exactly drove Beckford -- Bickford, I should say, to do this, and what more we can learn about why this happened -- Abby.",

His family was so concerned, they reached out to law enforcement. He was on a terror watch list. Does it matter whether or not he was directed by foreign entities, terrorist entities?

This goes back to that thing that we always say, see something, say something, raise concern. The thing that investigators and specifically the FBI are going to be focused on right now is, what changed? What changed from the moment that they interviewed him in mid-December to Saturday night? Was there more self-radicalization, like diving into different types of propaganda? Or was he directed? Again, don't want to speculate one side or the other, but that's what they're going to be focused on right now. PHILLIP:  Did anyone drop the ball here? He was flagged, as you mentioned, but he was still able to travel from Maine to New York to carry out this attack.",

And it's really a centralized repository of individuals who have been involved in terrorism or related activities. Now, the kind of bucket his quest to seek participation in Taliban -- with the Taliban and posting all of this stuff online is the related activity side of things, but what it doesn't do is, it doesn't restrict your travel around the United States, right? He didn't commit a crime yet. But he was of concern. His own parent -- I mean, his own mother raised the concern about him to law enforcement again. So there's different aspects of why he was placed on that on that watch list, but the restriction -- there's no restriction traveling on trains, driving in cars, going state to state. It really raises -- it's a tracking mechanism that allows law enforcement to understand the movements of people both out -- coming in and out of the country and in other investigative techniques.",

The suspect was arrested on Friday in Pennsylvania, and is expected to waive extradition at his court -- or court appearance tomorrow. That's according to his attorney.

They're also talking about how they are praying for those four families, those -- who have lost their loved ones, but they're also saying that they are supporting their son and brother. And they want to see this process play out in the court system before they make any assumptions about what exactly happened. And what happened here, exactly what the motive is, and if there's any kind of connection between Bryan Kohberger, the suspect and those victims, well, that is information that we are told is in the probable cause affidavit. And that's where we should learn more information, but that document remains sealed until Kohberger comes back to the state of Idaho. That's state law. And so he has his extradition hearing tomorrow. As you have said, his attorney has mentioned that he plans to waive extradition, so he could be back in the state of Idaho as early as tomorrow. It could take a couple of days. I asked the Moscow police chief exactly what that process is, how long it takes. And he says, for security purposes, they're not going to be revealing that information. But the Moscow police chief is keeping the tip line open, because they want to learn more about Bryan Kohberger. Yes, they have made an arrest, but they are seeking a conviction. And they want to know if anybody in this area or even across the country has come in contact with him, even all the way back to his childhood. They're trying to paint a picture of who this person is.

The latest in a series of storms into California which gave Oakland their wettest day in history Saturday, just under five inches, dropped as much as nine. So we have seen the water rescues. There is some snow with this, but significant icing it's going to set up. It's going to drop one to two feet of snowfall. So look at the warnings. You will see them here in pink, the advisories in purple. This is an ice storm warning to cover several states from Southern Minnesota back into Eastern Nebraska, significant, widespread icing, a quarter-of-an-inch to a half-an-inch. That's going to knock out power to possibly tens of thousands. Then you toss the snow just above that, this is one to two feet. And that's from areas, you see it from Kansas all the way up in toward the Great Lakes. So this event is winter on the north. And, again, we have the tornado outbreaks that are possible this afternoon, Texarkana up toward the Memphis area. Tomorrow, it slides a little bit more in the South Gulf Coastal states. But it's going to be these supercells tonight that will not only give us a flash flood threat, but the tornado outbreak. And sunset is at 5:21. So everyone in this region really needs to have their cell phone set on the advisories and their notifications, because, again, Abby, it looks like we could have an outbreak not just tonight overnight, but into tomorrow afternoon as well.

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, the math problem for Kevin McCarthy is only getting worse, not better.And that's despite the fact that he has made a number of key concessions to his critics, including making it easier to topple the sitting speaker at any given moment. He got on a conference call last night, where he walked through a number of these changes that he is now supporting. But on the call, he could not answer whether or not this would be enough to win him the speakership votes, despite the fact that a number of lawmakers who are frustrated by these concessions pressed him on and asked, is this going to be enough? If we support this, will you get 218? And he could not respond. And then I think, very tellingly, not long after that call, a group of nine lawmakers put out a letter saying they are still not satisfied with these concessions. They want them to go further. And then, today, two of the hard-liners, Bob Good and Ralph Norman, both said they are still planning to vote against McCarthy on the floor tomorrow. So, at this point, Abby, McCarthy can either try to make more concessions and more promises to try to win over these remaining holdouts, or he can just go to the floor and dare everyone to vote against him.",

Let's bring in CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for \"PBS NewsHour\" Laura Barron-Lopez. Laura, I mean, the next question is, what does tomorrow look like? These Republicans got concessions from McCarthy. They're still holding out. And McCarthy has said he is not going to drop out after that first ballot. So, what can people expect? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, we could very well see this -- multiple ballots on the floor. Representative Bob Good that Melanie mentioned said today on FOX that he thinks they're going to be 10 or 15 on that first ballot that do not vote for McCarthy. And then, after that, potentially, he said a more, an alternate that people really could get behind would emerge. But it's really difficult to see McCarthy getting the votes on the first ballot, but on the second ballot, or on the third -- how chaotic it's going to be on the floor, it's really impossible to tell right now. I also think that it's striking that, as everyone is preparing for this potentially messy, chaotic vote, President Joe Biden is preparing this week to head to Kentucky and appear alongside Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, trying to really strike this contrast and show that, as House GOP leadership is having this messy rise to power, that he is working with Republicans on the other side.",

And, most importantly, as I mentioned earlier, he gave his critics this tool that will enable them to call for a vote at any given moment to essentially fire him. And they are going to use that over his head any time that he doesn't do what they like. And you think about all of these issues coming down the pike that he's going to have to deal with in terms of government funding, the debt ceiling, a whole litany of things where there's going to be clashes between the conservative wing and the moderate wing. Kevin McCarthy is going to be at the front and center at the middle of it all.

But in talking to other Republicans, the conventional wisdom right now is that, if Kevin McCarthy drops out and is no longer in the race, that Steve Scalise would make a play for it and that he would be the automatic front-runner. He's very conservative. He's very popular in the conference. He's McCarthy's top deputy here. He already has a political operation and a vote-counting operation behind him. But he has been very, very quiet and very careful to not come out and look like he's trying to angle for the job. He knows that he can't. He's out there publicly supporting McCarthy.
