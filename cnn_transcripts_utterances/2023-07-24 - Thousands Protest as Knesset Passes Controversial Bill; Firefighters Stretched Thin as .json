Protests in Israel areratcheting up after the Israeli Knesset passed a key component of the government's package aimed at weakening the power of the courts. The bill strips the Supreme Court's ability to declare government actions unreasonable. Well, demonstrators are again taking to the streets to show their opposition, including many military reservists who have said they would refuse to serve if the package goes through. There have been increasingly urgent pleas from Washington, Israel's most important ally to rethink this legislation. And for the second time this week, President Joe Biden warned Israel's government against moving ahead with Benjamin Netanyahu's plan. So tonight we asked will the government's judicial overhaul succeed. Well, CNN's, Hadas Gold has been in the middle of the protests and joins us now from Jerusalem on the phone. Hadas just give us a sense of what you're hearing from the protesters on the streets, these people who have been protesting for over six months now.",

And they're also making their way down towards the parliament. The message we're hearing from these protesters and the message we're hearing from the speakers is saying we will not give up. This is actually a new chant that they have. They're saying we will not give up. We will not give up and tell us better here. They say they're not leaving. They're calling on everybody to take to the streets. And we are seeing protesters also take to the highways around here some trying to block them with the protesters take to the streets. In Tel Aviv, they say that they are going to continue fighting even though this bill has now passed because there are other bills in the pipeline for the judicial overhaul as well. There are more actions planned to be taken. And also this bill is already facing legal challenges legislation is trying to strip the Supreme Court's ability from declaring government actions unreasonable it's one of -- of the only checks on power on the Israel's government, because of the way the parliamentary system is set up here. And already we know there's a legal challenge being sufficient for the supreme court to issue an injunction to stop this legislation to being put into effect, that could lead to a very interesting legal battle where the Supreme Court could end up ruling that this new bill that strips their ability to declare things unreasonable is unreasonable in and of itself. But that's for the longer term. In the shorter term the stock market has fallen just a bit here, the -- has weakened a little bit against the dollar. And there are talks about a larger labor strike potentially going forward. Now there is also the question of the military reserve and thousands of military reservists had pledged not to heed the call to serve if this legislation passed. And so now the question is will they refuse to show will they refuse the call to serve if the conflict happens? And also what will happen will they be arrested for refusing? We have heard from Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and Former Prime Minister calling in those reservists to still serve until the legal challenges are done with the Supreme Court. He is asking them to please continue serving the country until those legal challenges are done. Now, there are some reports that Benjamin Netanyahu may be making payments. There's also of course, the question of how this could affect relations with the United States? President Joe Biden had made two statements in just the past week calling on Israeli leaders to slow them down to come to some sort of consensus negotiations before rushing through we heard from President Biden just last night. Obviously those calls were not heated and they pushed forward. Anyway, of course this was all happening also at the same time as Benjamin Netanyahu himself was just in the hospital. He was only released from hospital this morning after receiving a pacemaker -- from hospital to the - - so right on government lines and zero from the opposition because they left to the floor in protest.",

And, of course, by the massiveprotests we're seeing throughout now, I should also note that the proponents of this, the government, and also their supporters, who we have seen taking to the streets occasionally say that this is necessary. They believe that, you know, without a written constitution, they believe that the Supreme Court has overstepped and move on things that they shouldn't be able to rule on. But it's democratically elected politicians, democratically elected laws, and that they don't think that this legislation actually goes too far. They believe its fine, except parts of the overhaul happened soften in recent months. But for a lot of these protesters here, it's more of a question of just the whole idea of the overhaul and the government that is pushing it forward, because this is the most right wing government in Israeli history. And so for a lot of them, it's not just about the judicial role. That's obviously the main reasoning for them taking the streets, but it's also to the about the government itself and the people who are in power.",

I am calling on Israel to do what a new prime minister in 1996 did, when he came to Washington, and told the U.S. Congress. That Israel would wean itself off American economic assistance at that time is the United States was also providing something like $500 million in economic assistance to Israel. That Prime Minister was one Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel weaned itself off that economic assistance over a few years, is what I'm proposing here. And Israel, the U.S. is better off for it.

The legislation strips the Supreme Court have the power to declare government actions unreasonable.

Right now what they're shouting is actually what they're chanting is shame. They're shouting shame on the government, shame on the coalition for passing this legislation. And now the other chances they're chanting are things like we will not give up. Because despite the fact that this has passed, this is the first legislation of this judicial overhaul due pass, they say that they will continue to take to the streets, they will continue fighting. And we're going to see that through legal challenges as you know, the legal challenges have already been filed in the Supreme Court. They're seeking an immediate and injunction that the Supreme Court has stopped this legislation that could lead to a very interesting legal battle. Well, the Supreme Court will be ruling on legislation that, of course, directly affects its power and -- can they rule on. And we're also hearing from the labor union saying they may be calling a general strike. Keep in mind, the last time that labor union, which is Israel's largest, declared a general strike back in March, essentially shut the country down everything from the ports to McDonald's was shut down. So if this labor union declares a strike, we're going to see that once again, the shekel has fallen against the dollar. The Israeli stock market has also been taking a hit as a result of this legislation passing not only Government and for Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition. This is finally a victory after months of saying that this overhaul needed to start the process. They've been celebrating; they've been hugging one another. And they say this is just the beginning of what will really be a complete reshaping of the Israeli judiciary because they say the judiciary desperately needs reform, it needs rebalancing. But for these, for these protesters, they fear what taking away those powers from the Supreme Court will mean, they fear will mean government having unfettered power to make decisions without any sort of check on it. Because the way the system works here, the Supreme Court is essentially the only check on government power. And that's why these protesters say that they will continue coming out to protest, Lynda.",

All parties fell short of the 176 parliamentary seats needed to form government on their own. The center right People's Party won 136 seats, while Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is ruling center left Socialist Party, 122. Now the tough task of trying to build a coalition begins.

Hedoesn't think there'll be another set of elections; Spain has been plagued by those. But while that is uncertain, the coalition building how long it will take. One result seems pretty clear from this election, which is the Spaniards voted not to allow the far right Vox party into the government, the main Conservative Party issue said didn't get enough seats for the majority. And even with the added seats of the far right party, which used to be part of the main Conservative Party, they didn't get to the majority. So the far right has been advancing across Europe. It's governing in Italy with hard right Prime Minister Meloni, it's in the government in Finland, but the Spaniards on Sunday seem to be saying not here, not now. The coalition building, according to analysts, could be easier for the socialist prime minister, because he's already got one on the left. He's got the experience and the context. But a senior Socialist Party official told CNN this day, that this time for Sanchez this second attempt at a coalition could be a lot tougher for him. Because the nationalist parties in Catalonia, which are the area around Barcelona, and the northern Basque region, could try to extract a much higher price this time. In fact, one of the Catalan Nationalist Party leaders said on Sunday, they're not going to make Sanchez, Prime Minister again, if it comes to that, with nothing in exchange, she said their priority is Catalonia. They're not concerned about governing the state of Spain, Lynda.",
