Those are the markets than these are the main event: Red hot US jobs numbers, dashing hopes for a Fed rate cut in the near future. President Biden calls on Americans to defend democracy after the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings. And GameStop chares closing sharply lower on a volatile day that included a livestream from its mean meme stock supporter. Live from New York. It's Friday, June 7th, I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this this QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once again, tonight, a surprisingly strong jobs growth in the United States is dashing hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates anytime soon. The US economy adding 272,000 jobs net in May, that's far, far more than expected. And American workers earning more as well with wage growth coming in touch stronger than expected, too. Average hourly earnings are now up full 4.1 percent on the year outpacing inflation. On the flip side, however, unemployment rose to four percent for the first time in over two years. We will explain. Andrew Hollenhorst is the chief US economist at Citi, and he joins us now. Andrew, give me your take on these numbers. I know you've already decided it is going to have Federal Reserve rate cut implications because you've pushed back your expectations for when they first make a cut.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Julia, it certainly matters for the Fed when they see that 272,000 jobs number andwhat they're trying to do is cool this economy and bring down inflation. Those are the kind of jobs numbers that aren't necessarily going to do that. On the other hand, and you've mentioned it, we have the unemployment rate coming up to 4.0 percent, so that's kind of sending the opposite message. So a really difficult point for the Fed here, I think where they have to look at all this data, figure out what they're going to do. I think the jobs number alone is strong enough that we can rule out a rate cut in July and think that maybe September is when they'll be cutting rates.",

So you are saying September, I mean in the aftermath of this, certainly interest rates and investors in the bond market were onlyreally fully pricing the first cut by December. So it really did create a bit of a jolt in these numbers. I want to go back to what you said about sort of the offset with a four percent unemployment rate because there have been other signs of softening if you go to what we call the Household Survey, which is the real gauge of conversations with households themselves, that's weakening, job openings are weakening; so the picture is less obvious perhaps than this headline number suggests.",

Definitely more nuanced, more complicated than just the headline Payrolls Establishment Survey number,and there is a bit of a mystery in the data because we keep getting these just extremely strong Monthly Establishment Survey payrolls readings where the BLS goes out and surveys businesses. When they the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls people and asks them, are you working? Are you looking for a job, that's where the unemployment rate comes from. If you look at employment by that household survey measure, employment is only up about 400,000 over the last year. Compare that to payrolls that are up 2.8 million, so we just have a huge difference between these two surveys and if I were a Fed official, I would be paying attention to both and I would be looking at these other indicators that are suggesting we may have more loosening going on in the labor market.",

We need to see subsequent slowing in the inflation data, and then I think what we will hear from Chair Powell and what would keep are kind of fed cut view on the table is just keeping all of these meetings live and acknowledging how volatile and sometimes even conflicting the data have been that the Fed will be looking month by month at each of these data frames and making a decision based on the current data.",

Pat just describe this moment and how it feels first and foremost, because I appreciate this was seven years in the making or the fighting. PAT MCDONAGH, FOUNDER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, SUPERMAC'S: Yes, well, we in Supermac's are delighted as the European Court came down on our side because this started back in 2017 and even somewhat earlier where we applied for a trademark license or a trademark in the people, which is in the Alicante's realm, and which is the people who decide or will give out trademarks or who will license the trademarks, whatever we want to say it. And McDonald's objected to it, have said that there would be confusion between McDonald's and our company. And they objected to it on the grounds that the menu was pretty much the same, the color of the layout and color of the design was much the same as such. So we thought it wasn't anyways near. We have different types of products and different decor, different uniforms, et cetera and different color scheme. So basically, they objected to our application and we took a look at what they were doing and we realized then that has about 800 trademarks in Europe, a lot of them which they didn't use, but which they prevented other companies from using and accordingly, we looked at that the Big Mac was licensed foreign, was licensed for not alone, just a meat product, but also for chicken products and indeed for -- and we objected that. And this is the end result of that basically that McDonald's were told that either you use it or lose it, so what it really has established is that anyone or any company that is holding trademarks, unless than use them within five years, they lose the license for them.",
