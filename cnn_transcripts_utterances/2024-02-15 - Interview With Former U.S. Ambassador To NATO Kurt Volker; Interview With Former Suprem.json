Author of \"One Nation UnderGuns,\" about the fetish of individual ownership. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Today, NATO defense ministers presented a united front in Brussels, as America casts a shadow over the 75-year alliance. Not only Former President Trump publicly undermining collective defense and inviting President Putin to attack any NATO nation, but also the failure of Congress to pass a military aid bill for Ukraine. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan explained the stakes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Your allies are watching this closely. Our adversaries are watching this closely. There are those who say U.S. leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world don't matter or should be torn up or walked away from. We know from history that when we don't stand up to dictators, they keep going. And the consequences of that would be severe for U.S. national security, for our NATO allies, for others around the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker and General Philip Breedlove, NATO's former Supreme Allied Commander during Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Ambassador Kurt Volker, General Philip Breedlove, welcome to the program. Can I start with you, Ambassador Volker, because you are in Munich, and I want to say the belly of the beast, because I'm thinking that there's going to be quite a lot of spooked allies there, given what Trump is saying about inviting Putin to do what he wants with a NATO country, but also because of stalled military aid for Ukraine. What is the feeling that you're picking up right now? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO:  Well, European allies are clearly very worried about the United States. And it is -- as you said, it's partly the kind of language that Trump was using the other day where he was saying that he would encourage Putin to attack a NATO ally. And that he was bragging at a political rally. It was all in the past tense. It's not a prescription for the future. But even so, NATO was formed to prevent war, to defend allies, and to suggest that anyone should attack an ally and launch a war, unacceptable, and allies are very upset about that. The second thing is a more serious concern, which is whether the U.S. is someone they can really rely on in the future. Will the U.S. provide the required security assistance for Ukraine? Will there be more threats against NATO in the future? What is the U.S. commitment to NATO going forward? We have a large delegation of senators and congressmen coming to Munich, and I think they're going to be faced with a lot of questions about what allies can expect from the United States going forward.",

I think what we're really talking about now is the beginning of erosion of deterrence inside of NATO spaces.

I think at a fundamental level, they can say with conviction and clarity that a majority of Americans, a majority of American congressmen and senators, Republican and Democrat, strongly support NATO, strongly support Ukraine, and will continue to be committed to this alliance. The difficulty has been on failure to agree domestically over what to do about the U.S. southern border, and that has now empowered a small group within the House of Representatives to hold this package up that would otherwise be giving aid to Ukraine. They've got to explain how this going to actually get done.

Senator McConnell and Speaker Johnson, others that seem to haveworked out about linking southern border issues with Ukraine aid, getting it all done. And it was actually former President Trump who said, don't vote for the border issues, which caused the Senate to then separate them out and the Ukraine aid got passed in the Senate. Now, it's back to the House. And now, they may get rejoined again in some way. We have to see how they sort this out. But this what causes our European allies to ask, what are you guys doing? And can we rely on the United States going forward? What -- this genuine -- these are hard issues, these are serious issues, people's lives are at stake, and this getting hung up over domestic politics in the United States. Are you going to keep doing this? If I can come back to your earlier point in your question, though, about the future of Ukraine. I think the two-year anniversary is an important point to take stock where we can look at Ukraine today and say, they're going to survive as a sovereign, independent European democracy. They have tremendous support from European allies, from the United States, from Canada, from NATO, the E.U. itself. This going to grow over time. Everyone's expanding their defense industrial base. I'm confident the U.S. assistance will be passed at some point. And Ukraine is going to be on its way into the E.U. and NATO. So, we see a picture here where Ukraine survives and Russia is weakened. And that's going to be the end of the story at some point. What we should be focused on is how we accelerate getting to that end point. How do we provide the Ukrainians what they need to win the war? How do we provide them the economic support? How do we get to that stable end point in the end?",

Ukraine isgoing to end exactly how western policymakers want it to end. We will determine how this goes, because if we give Ukraine what they need, they will be able to take care of the Russians. They've done it strategically three times already in this war, north of Kyiv, north and northwest of Kharkiv, and operationally, to some degree, in the south. So, we just have to understand that western policymakers will absolutely determine how these ends. And what we're seeing now is the public faltering of support is affecting the soldier on the battlefield. When you're in that front line border trace, and you're in a ditch or wherever, and you are wondering whether the West still has your back, it's going to affect the way that you decide the actions that you take, and you have to begin to prepare for not getting that support. Even if we all believe it's going to happen eventually, they have to assume they may not. And they'll start changing plans based on the assumption that the West will not continue support.",

But what General Breedlove just said is the important factor here. Putin does not see Ukraine as his enemy only, he sees the West as his enemy. And the fact that they're putting a nuclear-powered ship in space, or that they're trying to beef up to a 1.5-million-man army, that's not about Ukraine, that's about us. So, we have to take this seriously. We have to prepare. But we have, ultimately, the economic and the military strength to reestablish security in Europe.",

Israeli soldiers and tanks are surrounding the hospital from all sides. Shootings and bombings still continue. BASHIR (voice-over):  Outside, Israeli tanks edge closer within the hospital's grounds. The Israeli military is heard ordering civilians to evacuate. The IDF says it entered the hospital after receiving credible intelligence indicating that Hamas held hostages on the complex, with deceased hostages possibly still present. Though CNN is not able to independently verify this claim. Israel's forces also say they have apprehended a number of suspects at the hospital, and they've opened a secure route for civilians to evacuate the area. But doctors and medical officials tell CNN Israeli snipers shot dead a number of people as they try to leave the medical complex. Among them, they say, this teenager. His lifeless body, seen here, just in front of the gates of the Nasser Hospital. A short distance away, a Palestinian detainee appears, said to have been released by the Israeli military and used as a messenger, according to medical staff who spoke to a journalist working for CNN on the ground to tell civilians here that they must leave immediately. But soon after, doctors say he, too, was killed under Israeli fire outside the hospital. It is unclear from the video what happened. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the incident. As Israeli drones scour the ground beneath, civilians nearby gather whatever belongings they have left and begin to flee. For many, this not the first time they have been forced to evacuate. The vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million strong population is now concentrated in Southern Gaza, ordered by the Israeli military to move south. But as troops push deeper into the besieged region, with the looming threat of a ground operation in nearby Rafah, warnings from the U.N. of a potential slaughter of the Palestinian people grow more tangible with each passing day.

Israeli soldiers are no different, except they're fighting Israel's largest and most brutal war in decades. In video, after video, after video, soldiers document the destruction of Gaza and rejoice.

So, on that basic level, they'd be horrified. But the distortion around the Second Amendment is a lot of issues, but, you know, a well-regulated militia involves the principle of consent and collaboration and accountability, and that's exactly what we now, now lack. You know, individuals buying assault weapons for their own use are not part of a well-regulated militia. So, we've drifted very far from those moorings.

And if you look at the discussions over the Second Amendment, you have these exemptions for individuals who may have conscientious objections to serving in the military. And they are persons, and Madison says this as he drafts it. But the people is a body of people. And a well-regulated militia is actually under the authority of the state. I mean, if you look at these state constitutions from which the Second Amendment emerged, they talk very clearly about the militia and any armies that are summoned by Congress or summoned by the state must be under the authority of the civil power. So, to put this in the language of political science, the militia is under the state's monopoly of violence. People think of it as an individual thing, but when you're in a militia, you know, you could be court martialed, you're under orders.
