This video from the Russian Defense Ministry shows what it says the skirmish with Ukrainian forces in Donetsk. Ukrainian officials said they have no information on the incident, and CNN has not been able to independently verify this claim.Meantime, a new video shows Ukrainian soldiers urging silence surrounding the start of their anticipated counteroffensive. The new video is circulating on social media. The top general in the United States, Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, says he believes Ukraine is well-prepared for the next phase of the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  So, I think it's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared, as you know very well. The United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided training and ammunition and advice, intelligence, et cetera, to the Ukrainians. We're supporting them. They're in a war that's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine. And it has greater meaning to the rest of the world, for Europe, really, for the United States, but also for the globe.

The reports of some of these attacks from the Ukrainians are taking place right here, the southern region not far from the eastern Donetsk here. And as Fred was saying, Russians are claiming the Ukrainians are trying to push through here to the Sea of Azov and cut off Russia in Crimea. Russia has occupied Crimea for several years in this region now for a year. So, this is what Fred was talking about, the goal the Russians see for the Ukrainians here.With us now is CNN Military Analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, great to see you. So, based on the area this is taking place in and also some of the video that's been published over the last several hours, what is it that you see here and how does this align with the idea of a Ukrainian counteroffensive? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, both Fred and you have said the right word, John, and that's momentum, generating momentum. What we're seeing in these early stages are some early moves. We can't get too excited about them just yet. This is a big chess match, as we've talked before. There will be some moves in some areas, some moves in others, and it's all to throw the enemy off. But what we've seen over the last 48, 72 hours are multiple things that give indicators of what is happening. This attack into Vuhledar, the attacks around Bakhmut by the Ukrainians, the Russian anti-Putin forces in three provinces like Belgorod and Smolensk and Kursk, all of these things are indicators of what might happen next. I can't give you any firm conclusions because I'm not looking at a map over the shoulder of General Zaluzhny, but I will tell you that this is exactly the way I would initiate an offensive operation, by moving in different direction with different forces.",

This is some video of the region around Crimea, where they've been for far more than a year. But you get the sense they've also done this in the east, in other areas.

      "sentences": "Well, two things about complex obstacle belts, John, and we'll start hearing that term more and more frequently as Ukraine goes on the offensive. First of all, they are complex. They consist of many obstacles, mines, wire, trenches, abatis, dragon's teeth, all those sorts of things. But the key to an obstacle belt is if they're overwatched by the enemy. So, in other words, it isn't just the obstacles that themselves that are difficult. It's the forces behind the obstacles.And what we've seen so far is some really low morale on the part of the Russians. So, I don't know what to conclude just yet. The obstacle belts themselves will be hard to breach. When I was a commander at one of our training center, this was a repeating mission that we would have U.S. forces go through, and it was always the most difficult mission, to breach a complex obstacle belt. But, usually, when that was happening, they had enemy forces playing the enemy on the other side of those obstacles. So, it all depends on what Russia does. So, this could be a very easy march for Ukraine or it could be a very contested and tough fight. I don't know what to tell you on that.",

That is the same aviation company that we heard about last year, fall of last year, for the last rounds of migrant flights, two planes, 50 or so migrants taken from the Texas border and flown over to Martha's Vineyard.And we do have new information, Kate, that the same attorneys who are representing those migrants in a lawsuit against Ron DeSantis, Governor Ron DeSantis, they are now on the ground there in Sacramento and offering legal services to those migrants. A big question, Kate, too, is whether there's going to be any sort of other flights happening anytime soon. We've been actually going through a ton of paperwork here, public records from the state of Florida, and we've reported that they have selected two other vendors, ARS Global Emergency Management and GardaWorld Federal Services, to execute these migrant flights. So, it raises the questions here whether we can expect at least two more flights.

And it's a good exercise, frankly, and proof that that protection, which was really put in place post-911, still exists. So they can scramble, they can intercept an aircraft that is not responding and heading for the nation's capital. We should point out an aircraft at 34,000 feet didn't ever really present a great threat to the nation's capital, but as it headed in that direction, you know, the military did exactly what it is supposed to do. And the fact that, you know, six fighters from three bases responded and were able to fire flares, try to get the attention of the occupants of the aircraft, proves that system works.

We also are hearing from some of the first responders on the ground is that there's very little debris left other than also quite a large crater. Brian Todd's being told by first responders.So, as investigators are now working through this, what are they looking at and what are they looking for at this point, Miles? O'BRIEN:  Yes. This will be a tough one, Kate, because clearly it ran out of gas at 34,000 feet and then just went straight down like a long dart. So, it would have impacted with tremendous speed and there wouldn't be a lot of big pieces left as a result of that. This is an aircraft which is not a charter aircraft. It flies under Part 91, which is just general aviation rules. And so there would be no requirement for any sort of flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder. It's possible it might be there. It could be in this plane. It could have been retrofitted later, but doubtful. So, this is going to be a difficult one to really solve. Maybe they'll find that smoking gun piece which shows that some sort of valve in the pressurization system gave way, causing an insidious loss of cabin pressure, and then everybody just kind of went to sleep. The time of useful consciousness at 34,000 feet without pressurization or oxygen is about a minute. BOLDUAN:  Wow. And, I mean, that just shows how quick the entire thing can change up there, and such a sad result for at least one family here. It's great to see you, Miles. Thank you for coming in.

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think of the folks we've heard a lot from, we've yet to really hear from Tim Scott and some others, but she sounds most like she gets the math. She's an accountant. She said it a number of times last night. The math is to add to the base, not subtract. That seems to be what Trump and Ron DeSantis want to do on repeat and then repeat losing. She, I thought, reached out to conservatives that might have been offended by Trump and moderates and independents who might not be willing to vote for four more years of Joe Biden. And I think she did that by hitting three Cs. She sounded like a conservative. We haven't heard a lot about conservatism, right, lowering the debt and the deficit, traditional things, in a while. She sounded compassionate, even when she talked about abortion, immigration, race, guns. She did it from a place of compassion, not punishment and revenge. And, finally, she sounded commonsense. She gave some tough talk to her own party on entitlement reform, for example. She gave tough talk to voters on what can and can't be done about abortion from the right, what can and can't be done about guns from the left, commonsense, avoiding conspiracy theories.
