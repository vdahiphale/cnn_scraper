Just ahead on today'sshow Hawaiian horror 36 people now confirmed dead as out of control wildfires rage in the Hawaiian Island of Maui. More than 11,000 people have been evacuated and thousands still are without power. Officials say it will take years to rebuild. Plus assassination in Ecuador, the candidates in the Latin American countries upcoming presidential elections has been shot and killed at a campaign event in the Capital Quito the very latest on the ongoing investigation and where this leaves the violence torn country just ahead. And inflation in America just released data shows headline U.S. consumer inflation rising for the first time in 13 months to a 3.2 percent annual rate, month-over-month. However, CPI rose two tenths of a percent in line with June's levels. Core inflation was pretty much in line with expectations too. And here's the market reaction U.S. stock futures still holding on to some solid games after a weaker Wednesday. Europe is on the rise for a second straight session and Asian stocks finished Thursday's session mostly higher, modest gains in China and news. The Biden Administration is placing fresh restrictions on U.S. tech investments there and on the very latest that the Chinese reaction later in the show. But first details of today's inflation numbers. Rahel Solomon is joining us live and Rahel, inflation still well above the Feds 2 percent target but not a bad report overall.",

      "sentences": "No, I don't think so Christina, good to be with you. So this is a report that needs some context. But Ithink by and large, most people would say is a solid report that shows continued moderation. So as you said, this is the first time in about a year that headline inflation actually increased, we can show you 3.2 percent on an annual basis. But Christina, this is a result of what economists called base effects. Essentially, this number has a lot to do with what inflation was doing a year ago, and a year ago, inflation was very low. And so this number looks a lot higher as a result. Essentially what it means is that it's a statistical quirk it's a mechanical quirk the way it's calculated. So let's look at what's happening on a monthly basis. Because Christina, I think that gives us a better sense of what's actually happening with inflation, as you said, on a monthly basis prices increasing 0.2 percent, or two tenths of 1 percent. That is holding steady from the month prior. If you look at core inflation, which the Federal Reserve pays especially close attention to because this is the area of inflation, where they can actually control food and energy not necessarily within the Feds control up core inflation also remain steady on a monthly basis, two tenths of a percent on an annual basis 4.7 percent so as you said, much higher than the Feds 2 percent target. When we look at sort of what's happening with prices in terms of categories, so shelter or what our viewers around the world might consider accommodations that were responsible Christina for 90 percent of the monthly increase that we saw in inflation. So shelter is still a big contributor there. But we saw declines in areas like airline fares used cars and trucks and medical care so some relief on that side of the equation. So what does the Fed do with this report? Well, we have a few more weeks before the Federal Reserve meets again and mid-September, mid to late September. And so they'll get another jobs report, they will get several more inflation reports. So they will still have more to digest. But I can say that there is some feeling that a report like this would actually give the Fed some encouragement to actually pause with the rate hikes. Citibank, in fact, saying this morning, that a report where we saw 0.2 percent inflation which we did, would give the Fed some room to perhaps pause but a lot more data to come. But I think it is still another report that shows moderating inflation, which is why as you pointed out, markets are still solidly higher on the news.",

A state owned power generating company says the plant is now running on a backup line. All of this comes after the Mayor of Moscow said that two attack drones were shut down as they approached the city on Thursday morning.

And certainly something that a lot of people in Moscow are having to get used to was quite interesting, because when the first drone attacks happened a couple of months ago, and of course, we've been covering this, as these things have been going on. The Russians really tried to downplay it, saying that the air defense systems there were working; they were taking some of these drones down using electronic countermeasures. But recently, they have been speaking of a very real threat. Of course, one of the things that happened last week was at the Financial District in Moscow, the Moscow City, as they call it was hit on two subsequent days. And it was a building that houses some financial companies, but also some government ministry offices as well. So that certainly was something was quite scary for a lot of Moscow residents. The recent drone attack or the one that happened overnight is also quite an interesting. One drone the Russians are saying was shot down near Kaluga. That's quite a way off southwest of Moscow, but one was right on the sort of highway ring that surrounds Moscow in the southwest of that it's called the -- which is sort of the major highway there. So that almost made it into the Moscow territory, again, showing that right now the Capital seems to be under fire quite regularly.

That is when the Head of the presidentialguard essentially overthrew his boss and declared himself the leader of Niger. And President Bazoum says he's not had human contact since August 4. Not even his doctor who is the one that used to bring him food and medicine. And he's not surviving, as you mentioned, on dry rice and pasta. And if they run out of gas, then they won't have any way to cook because where he's being held does not have electricity. So that is a situation that has led to the U.S. State Department saying they're concerned about his well-being and safety. The Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, who was in Niger on Monday, was not allowed to meet with President Bazoum. The last time he met with anybody was with the Interim President in Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno who was trying to mediate here. And after that he's not been seen from so there's great concern about how President Bazoum is doing even as the international community continues to call him to offer support and call for him to be released.

And I think, first he and other, he's not the only one but other officials who can need to be released. No one's going to find a resignation by someone who's being held prisoner, particularly credible, and their families have to be secure. Beyond that, I think we have to seek some sort of a solution that, though its sub optimal.

You mentioned Marvel, but also Lucasfilm Star Wars and Pixar and even just Disney's own in house studio that it said for decades, has turned out lots and lots of hits over the last many number of years. Very recently it's true. The box office attendance has been lower for some of those movies that Disney has put out. Maybe that's down to prior management from a few years ago instituting a different process of green lighting and creating films and that didn't seem to work seems to be one reason why Bob Iger came back as CEO was to reinvigorate the creative efforts at Disney. And he committed on the earnings call last night to improving the output, you know, making better movies are going to be more popular. They still have very strong IP, very strong franchises. There are supposed to be more Star Wars movies coming there are Marvel movies, you know, that have come out they've done well. I think they will continue to produce high quality content. Again, the question is what is the profitability of these? You used to have movies in the box office that would then go to pay TV services that would then go on to TV, as consumers are cutting the cord, a lot of that is falling away. And Disney made this plan a few years ago to put all of these first run movies onto their streaming services. So if they can generate those subscriber numbers at higher prices, then ultimately that's the big question is, how can their streaming business, turn a profit?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The brutal work here the world hasn't seen but wants its results. From the west they have words and weapons of support. But out here, it's them alone in searing heat, cloaked in dust in the southern counter offensive near Orikhiv, Ukraine has the initiative.",

WALSH (on camera): -- I'm pretty sure the tank was spotted by the Russians and so now we're moving fast out of here because they're expecting return fire. WALSH (voice over): The losses from their earliest assault evidence this or destroyed U.S. supplied Bradley armored vehicle. WALSH (on camera): In this thick dust these tankers moving forwards to fire Russian positions which they say are beginning to look in parallel, as Ukraine southern counter offensive pushes forward. WALSH (voice over): The 15th National Guard have lost many friends here, but also gained ground. It has been incredibly tough, but some faces we saw over the past week have brightened Robotine has got closer. Some of the assessment of their fight and the tools given towards it great to hear, they're being expected to do things no NATO army would attempt with equipment they'd scoff at. The Humvee we travel in with tires so threadbare no American soldier would be expected to drive it. They have no time for armchair assessments that they're failing. VITALY, TANK OPERATOR, 15TH NATIONAL GUARD BRIGADE: They are wrong. We have successes. It depends on how fortified they are. Above all, don't underestimate the enemy. WALSH (voice over): And that underestimation is visible here in the nearest town of Orikhiv pummeled by the main problem. Russian air superiority and the half ton bombs they drop. At any moment, it may not matter how much cover you have.",

WALSH (on camera): The wait now is for what they think is another missile to come in and land. WALSH (voice over): The smell of death horns, the rubble where entire lives have been torn through. WALSH (on camera): Now this was the main humanitarian aid point of the town and weeks ago, this was where the remaining locals would be hiding out getting shelter from airstrikes, but it's taken direct hit and quite a few people lost their lives when this explosion happened. You can still smell the explosive in the air. WALSH (voice over): In Moscow's warped world of targeting it is these men, the military medics who feel hunted the underground world in which they live is hidden as their last two triage points have been bombed. And then the three hours a day they spend above ground this is what happens. This is rare footage of their frontline rescues. The painkillers clearly not enough, the treatments given up to 100 miles an hour, over bumpy shelled road, it seems miraculous anyone makes it. In the back of this armored vehicle, not everyone has. These transfers perilous their vehicles bunched together, perhaps visible to Russian jets. Sometimes they don't all come back. On Friday, fellow medic, Andrei aged 33 was hit by artillery. They buried him Monday. EUGENE, MEDIC, 15TH NATIONAL GUARD BRIGADE: We went there immediately. Another team picked up the driver. And that was the hardest thing I ever did pick up the body and deliver it to the morgue. VLAD, MEDIC, 15TH NATIONAL GUARD BRIGADE: His family, his mother, they are in temporarily occupied territories. They couldn't even come to the funeral.
