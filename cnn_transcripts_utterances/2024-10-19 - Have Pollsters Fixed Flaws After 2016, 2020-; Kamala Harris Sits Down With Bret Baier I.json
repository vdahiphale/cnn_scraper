You can take your choice of metrics, the betting markets, the stock market, the cultural touchstones, pundits and the conventional polls, they each tell different stories. Let's just take a look at those prediction markets where individuals place bets on the outcome of events. Those placing bets on the popular platform predicted now trading Trump at 55 cents a share, compared to Harris's 49 cents a share. Bettors on the crypto prediction platform Polly market had Trump and Harris deadlocked in early October. Now have Trump's chance of winning at nearly 60 percent. According to the Wall Street Journal, this rise likely due to a group of just four accounts who have pumped 30 million in crypto into bets that Donald Trump will win. Then there's the stock market. A strong stock market has often been associated with a higher chance of an incumbent victory. If you look at the strength of the Dow Jones, it shows a 72 percent probability of a Harris victory. That number's up from 64 percent two months ago. Another analysis, John Kenneth White is a professor at Catholic University for the Hill. He opined that pop culture is often more accurate than any of the polls. Take Ronald Reagan, 1984 he won a large victory, while the polls predicted he would win. White says that Reaganite values were also prevalent in the cultural zeitgeist. The hit show \"Family Ties,\" for example, starred Michael J. Fox as Alex Keaton, a Republican growing up in a liberal family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL J. FOX, ALEX KEATON IN \"FAMILY TIES\": Attack is a terrible Harry, liberal monster. Big teeth. And the only thing, the only thing they can stop the terrible tax monster is Republican. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "This cycle, Professor White says pop culture favors Kamala Harris, the brat candidate who has the support of Taylor Swift in an era where the kindness and decency of Ted Lasso defined qualities opposite those of Donald Trump.Are you looking for something more conventional? Numbers guru Nate Silver gives the slightest of edges to Donald Trump right now. And ABC's 538 currently gives Trump a 51 in 100 chance of winning. And then, of course, there are the conventional polls, the only tool that's scientifically designed to measure voters' opinions. The latest CNN poll of polls has Harris leading by one point nationally with no clear leader in the majority of the seven battleground states. We don't elect presidents by popular vote. If we did, Hillary Clinton could be ending her second term right now. But the national polls are often a tell. In October of 2016, Hillary Clinton led Trump by eight points nationally. Eventually won the popular vote by just two, and, of course, lost the Electoral College. In October of 2020 Joe Biden was leading Trump by 11 points. Ended up winning the popular vote by just four, while winning the Electoral College. In each election, Trump's vote was underrepresented in the polls. Could that be happening this year? Nate Cohen at the \"New York Times\" recently showed what a polling miss, like we saw in 2016 or 2020 could mean in this election. He also analyzed polling data from the midterms. If the polls are mistaken, as they were in the 2022 midterm election, Harris should be in good shape. But if they err, as they did in 2016 or 2020 Donald Trump will win. So, is there this year a hidden vote for Donald Trump? Joining me now to discuss is Dr. Joshua Clinton, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. In 2020 he led a task force comprised of media and polling experts from Pew, Gallup, CNN and more. They examined pre-election polling for the American Association of Public Opinion Research. Joshua, welcome back to the program. Big picture, what went wrong in 2016 and 2020?",

And so in 2016 we saw a big split for the first time based on education that would never appear before. And so, the polls had too many college educated voters in and not enough kind of those with a high school less.And in 2016 that kind of -- those groups voted very differently. College educated voted overwhelming for Clinton. Those with a high school less voted for Trump. And so the polls kind of missed that. So going in 2020, pollsters kind of identified as a problem. [09:05:10] And so we thought that we were OK and turns out there's a new problem, which is basically that we didn't have enough Republicans in the polls themselves. And so that's why we saw this understatement about support for Trump. And so, going into 2024, right, pollsters are trying to fix what happened and try to figure out, do I have enough of Republicans and the right type of Republicans or Trump voters in my sample? And so we're going to see what happens.",

So, they could be Trump centric, because they happen in presidential election years when Trump was on the ballot. But presidential elections are also different than midterm elections, because different voters vote in presidential elections and midterm elections, right? The less frequently engaged vote in presidential elections and midterm elections, and those are precisely the people that are harsh to get on the phone or come to get to answer polls. And so, we don't really know if it's a Trump specific aspect of it, something about the electorate.And we don't also know, to be honest, where the polls are going to be better, because we've tried to make a correction. So we look at 2022, the midterms. And so yes, the polls did historically well, but that just means that there wasn't a systematic bias in favor of the Democrats, the Republicans. Like on average, the average poll still understand the margin by five percentage points. So look at Michigan, for example, in the governor's race, like their governor, Whitmer, right, the polling averages either had that tag or her up by five percentage points when she actually won by 10 percentage points. And so, the idea that the polls inevitably are going to understate kind of Republicans, maybe that's true in the conventional era when President Trump's on the ballot, but it's not a certainty, especially in an election where, you know, 2020 was very weird with the pandemic. You know, this year it's kind of who knows what the elector is going to look like.",

Like, if there were a credible poll that were an outlier in my show introduction today, I would have said. But, of course, there is this survey, but there's not one that I'm aware of.",

Now, if that's because the data is showing that or because we're trying to make adjustments to kind of -- you know, we know 2020 is very close. We think it's going to be closer this time.And so, it's hard to know, right? And so, but kind of think about the difficulty that pre-election polling faces, right? If I'm trying to call registered voters and I call 100 of them, like, only five of them answer a polls -- answer a poll, right? So right off the bat, I know I've got a small group of individuals, and so now I need to try to make them look like what the electorate looks like. But I don't know that, right? So I need to make an assumption as a pollster about what I think the 2024 electoral is going to look like. And if I'm wrong with that, right, then my poll is going to be off. And so, it's a really, really hard task to try to get 1,000 people. And you know, we just don't have the precision that we sometimes need in the convention lecture. In its high rates of polls, not going to be able to tell you who's up by one percentage point or not. So it's a very difficult task.",

They're prosecuted. Those are two vastly different things.My father was persecuted in 1968 when he was protesting in the Orangeburg massacre and went to prison, that's persecution. These two men are being prosecuted for their crimes. That's first. The second thing is, if you think you can make inroads with African- American males in particular by talking about some similarities with criminality, then you're ignorant and you're intellectually dishonest.

Joining me now by phone is Bob Woodward. Nice to have you here.Given your stature, your book has been widely reviewed. Everybody seems to pick out a different nugget. Bob, I'm putting on the screen some of the headlines that the book has drawn. I would think most notably it's your reporting about what Mark Milley said about Donald Trump, calling him a fascist. Or Putin and the COVID tests. What I've wondered, having read the book and I have, by the way, an answer to this question of my own, what is it that you think \"War\" pertains that others -- that others have missed and are not talking about that you thought they would have? BOB WOODWARD, AUTHOR, \"WAR\" (on the phone): Well, there's a very famous quote from John Adams which he says, power always thinks it has a great soul. And that's what we see operating here with Trump. Trump thinks he has a great soul, that he knows what he's doing, and that he's on top of things. But if you really study it, and I've done three books on him, I spent the year 2020 interviewing him 19 times, you see he does not have -- to be successful in anything you need to have a plan. He does not have a plan. He just comes up with whatever comes into his mind, thinking that, you know, he's powerful, he's got this great soul. And the other problem he has is there's no team backing him up. We know -- you have to have producers. I need to editors. You can't do any of these things alone. And Trump is trying to do it alone. And it's not working for him politically. It is tragic that somebody would think they can be president by themselves and never really having anyone back them up.",

I'm going to give you two things that really jumped off the pages to me.First of all, how close we came to nuclear conflagration with Russia in 2022 when it seemed that Putin was going to go so far as to detonate a dirty bomb for cover so that he could use a tactical nuclear weapon. And the likelihood of that happening was put at 50 percent by those around President Biden. Will you speak to that?",
