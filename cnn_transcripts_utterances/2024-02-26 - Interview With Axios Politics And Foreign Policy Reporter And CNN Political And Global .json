Walter Isaacson talks to award-winning journalist Michele Norris about her newbook, \"Our Hidden Conversations.\" Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The Palestinian Authority prime minister and his entire government have handed in their resignations to President Mahmoud Abbas. It is a stunning shake up that raises even more questions about the future of Gaza and what the Palestinian leadership could look like after Israel's war there. Now, it comes as a death toll in Gaza near 30,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The United Nations has said some 70 percent of those casualties are women and children, and that humanitarian aid deliveries have plummeted by half since January. Meantime, negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages have resumed in Qatar. More than 100 remain in Gaza after they were taken by Hamas during the brutal attack on October 7th. Joining me now on all of this is Axios journalist Barak Ravid. Barak, always good to see you. We've been at this point before talking about negotiations, a potential deal that falls through. Now, according to the U.S., negotiators have reached \"an understanding on the broad contours of a potential deal.\" An Israeli delegation left for Qatar this morning. Does this deal look like it has more potential than the past?",

Both Israel and Hamas and obviously the mediators, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, all have an interest that there is not going to be intense fighting during Ramadan, each for their own reasons. So, I think that maybe this deadline now will give everyone the incentive to try and cut the deal. But I have to say, at least at the moment, right now, what I hear from Israeli officials that the gaps are still wide. I hear the same from, you know, the U.S. and from other mediators. So, there's still a lot of work to do. But on the other hand, there's still enough time to get the deal until Ramadan starts.",

I think the more interesting thing is that Netanyahu told Israeli negotiators before they headed to Qatar that one of the things that he wants Israel to demand is at least some of the Palestinian prisoners that will be released as part of this possible deal, especially those who served longer sentences, who are more in leadership roles, who are responsible for killing Israelis, those will be released, but not to the West Bank or to Gaza, they'll have to find some other place to go, some Arab country in the region maybe.

To be honest, it might sound good on paper. I'm not sure this is executable. There's not a lot of space there for so many people. Another interesting detail, is that last week, last Wednesday, the IDF chief of staff, General Herzi Halevi, and director of the Shin Bet security agency secretly traveled to Cairo. They met their Egyptian counterparts and presented them with the ideas Israel has for an operation in Rafah. And one of the things they presented them is how Israel claims it can do such an operation without tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees just breaking the fences and moving into the Sinai, into Egyptian territory. The Israelis claim their operational plan will prevent it, or at least decrease the threat of that happening.",

We have to remember, since October 7th, there's fighting between Israel and Hezbollah on their border with Lebanon. There's fighting with their attacks from Syria against Israel.

It's partly performative.The resignation of the government is sort of procedural. Essentially, President Abbas has accepted their resignation, but they will remain in place as a kind of caretaker of government indefinitely. It could be a week or two weeks, or it could be many months. We don't know. I think that exact timing will depend. If and when we do see a new government put in place, it will depend in very large part on what happens in Gaza. I think this is an attempt really by President Abbas to demonstrate his relevance on one hand. He's sort of shaking things up. Looks like he's in charge. I think he's also under a lot of pressure, not just domestically, but also from outside actors, particularly Arab states, who have indicated that they're not going to provide financial support to Gaza's reconstruction or to the Palestinian Authority more broadly without major reforms in how the P.A. operates. And so, I think this is a step in which Abbas is trying to get ahead of the curve, so to speak, and show that he's putting in place a future Palestinian government, even though this one is likely to remain indefinite.",

Ithink most people agree it'd be difficult, if not impossible, to hold an election under current conditions, or even, you know, if the fighting were to stop today, Gaza is essentially in ruins and is not in any condition to host elections. And of course, you can't hold elections without the 2 million people in the Gaza Strip. So, I think it's going to be some time before we see elections. It is a key demand of the Palestinian public. They've grown quite frustrated with Mahmoud Abbas' rule. He's extremely unpopular. And they want to see a renewal of the leadership. They want to see some new blood, some fresh thinking. And it's definitely not coming from this leadership. But even before the elections can happen, there's a lot that can take place to put the Palestinian house in order. First and foremost, resolving this almost 17-year rift between Hamas and Fatah. It's clear that any future government, even one that is appointed by Mahmoud Abbas, is going to have to have the consent and acquiescence of Hamas, and for it to be able to operate in the West Bank and especially in Gaza. So, I think that's a step that we haven't seen yet. We don't know if the government that Mahmoud Abbas has in mind is one that is being ironed out with Hamas' consent.

It's just anenormous, almost unimaginable the scale of destruction and death and disease and the miseration (ph) that's happened in Gaza as a result of massive bombing, the destruction of most of Gaza's infrastructure, most of Gaza's hospitals have been destroyed by the Israeli military. The health sector has collapsed. But most importantly, Gaza's under a siege. Israel -- I think by now, it's clear to most people that this is not a famine that is incidental. This is a direct result of Israeli policy. Israel has essentially weaponized mass starvation and disease in order to put pressure on the population as, you know, to release the hostages. I think it's clear that the holdup in the delivery and entry and distribution of humanitarian aid is a result of Israeli policy. We've heard this from U.S. senators and others who have gone out to the region. So, it's imperative, you know, even before we start thinking about a future Palestinian government, that that problem has to be addressed, and really only the United States can put enough pressure on Israel to stop weaponizing food and medicine and to allow humanitarian assistance in, regardless of the political and military calculations. I mean, it should be unconscionable for anyone to use starvation as a weapon. But the United States has taken a much softer approach.",

And when I went out in the world to talkabout that book, I knew I would be talking to audiences about race. I was hosting a show at that time called \"All Things Considered\" and it was a chance for me to leave the studio and to get out into America at an interesting time, a black family had just moved into the White House then. But I thought no one wanted to talk about race. And so, I thought they needed an invitation, an on-ramp. And so, I printed postcards at Kinkos on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington D.C. And the postcards were simple. I actually have one with me. This is what they look like. And they said, raise your thoughts six words, please send. And the idea was that people would take this big toxic subject and try to distill it into the thing that was most important to them, their memory, their lament their question, their anthem. And I had no idea if people would actually send the cards back. And of the 200 cards that I printed initially, about 30 percent of them came back to me. Some of them handed to me at book events. But many of them, people would find a stamp. They would write their six words, they would find a stamp, they would find a mailbox, and then they would send them to me.

Their stories that are so much closer to the ground. And as a journalist, it was very humbling for me because I have been writing about race for years, but I realized that I didn't have access to certain parts of people's lives. When we write about race as journalists, we're usually doing it because something has happened that merits our attention. And so, we're writing about someone crossing a milestone, someone saying something that maybe they shouldn't have said, something bad happening somewhere. In this case, people are setting their own agenda and they're telling us, this is what's important to me. And many of the things that people write about, adoption, blended families, you know, what it felt like to be in America after 9/11 if you were Muslim or North African or part of the Arab diaspora. We're not getting to those stories. And that was the part that was humbling to me.

There have been moments of possibility that have been perhaps missed opportunities. And I hope that we face one of these moments again and soon so that we can figure out how to look at a history that we can't erase. You know, other countries that have been able to move by past this, and I compare America to Germany, not to compare the Holocaust and slavery. You know, I'm not trying to set up comparative evils, but contrasting responses to a historical fissure. And America is very different than Germany. Germany decided, and in some ways they did it because the rest of the world was standing over their shoulder and pointing a finger at them, but they decided to figure out how to move forward by looking at a difficult past through a lens of honor and atonement for people -- for the victims, people who were Jewish, who were Roma, who were queer or what we now call trans, who were marginalized, who, in some cases, were disabled. And they honor them and they teach that history in schools. If you become a police officer, you learn about this history. If you enter the military, you learn about this history. We have been unable to do that. And, you know, you've heard me say this, Walter, in America, it feels like we are the land of the free and the home of amnesia. We have gone through a willful amnesia, a willful forgetting, because that is a very difficult story to tell, understandably, understandably difficult story to tell. But unless we do tell that story, it is hard for us to reach any kind of reconciliation with the past and very hard for us to understand the lingering impacts of slavery, the lingering impacts of bondage, the lingering impacts of the period after slavery through reconstruction and through Jim Crow America. People often want to suppress this history because they don't want someone else to feel bad. They don't want to feel bad themselves. They don't want their children to feel bad. It robs other people of the opportunity, though, to understand their history and to understand the triumph over those things. For instance, as an African-American, you rob people of the triumph of understanding how they overcame that history. If you look at literacy in America, black people who came to America as the enslaved were not allowed to learn how to read and write. After slavery, there was an almost 7,000 percent increase in literacy because there was a barn burning effort across the country. People were hungry to learn, to educate themselves. That is an incredible story to tell. So, you can balance. Yes, you have to be clear-eyed and talk about the horrors of slavery, but you can also talk about the moral triumphs, the human triumphs. And you can also, in looking back at the horrors, understand where we have come as a country. And you -- if you understand where you started and where we have landed and where we can go, if we are willing to look at this history honestly, it is a benchmark that helps you appreciate where you are now and set your steps, order your steps, so you can get to somewhere better and do that in a way that perhaps does not marginalize people in the same way, does not demonize people on the same way, and allows people to work together, even if they do not agree. In a divided America, we have to figure out how we can work together, even with -- if we don't agree.",
