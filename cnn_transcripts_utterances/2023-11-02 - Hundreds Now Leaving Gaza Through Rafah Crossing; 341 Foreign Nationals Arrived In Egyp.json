      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the desperate escaped from a war zone. Hundreds of Americans are waiting at the Rafah crossing, hoping to get out of Gaza as soon as today. This as Israeli forces are fighting face to face battles with Hamas and pushing into Gaza city. All in response to the unimaginably brutal Hamas massacre last month of some 1400 Israeli citizens.Plus, President Biden is calling for a pause to get hostages out and aid in that new public posture comes as political pressure increases on the president from within his own party. And Republicans call out one of their own. GOP senators slam Tommy Tuberville for hours on the Senate floor for continuing to hold up hundreds of military promotions. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We're going to start with that urgent effort underway right now to get Americans out of Gaza. Hundreds of foreign nationals and dozens of injured civilians are expected to leave the Rafah border crossing, go through there at least today. CNN's Melissa Bell is covering all of this from Cairo. Melissa, what are we seeing at this moment?",

In fact, it wasn't until yesterday that this process began a tool having seemed completely blocked as far, Dana.What we understand is that there should be many more to come. In fact, what happened overnight is that a fresh list was published with nearly 600 names on it, including the names of 400 American citizens who are due for evacuation today. So that process appears to be moving along fairly quickly when it comes to American citizens. This is a pretty opaque process. What we understand from the Egyptian side is that the full 7,000 foreign or dual national citizens who are inside the Gaza Strip, will be allowed out. How the daily lists are organized, is a matter for negotiation with Hamas, Israel, Egypt, and it is pretty opaque. We don't really have much insight into that. From what we're hearing from the many different consular services that have turned up at the Rafah crossing to try and get their citizens out is that they don't have a great deal of say in how the lists are organized. The other difficulty, Dana, that people are having is that we had another communications blackout inside Gaza yesterday, very difficult to be for families that are on this side or outside in the wider world to be able to get word to their families inside Gaza, that their names are even on the list. So, it's a pretty chaotic situation inside still, people are making their way out at long loss and bringing with them details of what's been going on inside. And I think that is something already and in and of itself. That is a cause of some celebration for the families who've been waiting so desperately for the news that their loved ones would be able to get out. Dana?",

But it is true that the forces on the ground are engaging with those Hamas militants. They are making use of close air support. We've seen several Apache helicopters coming in to provide that air support.The question now, Dana, is how far, how deep into those urban areas are they going to go. We've still seen the most densely populated areas of the cities including the Jabalia refugee camp yesterday, Israeli forces are still using airpower to target Hamas militants in those underground complexes in those densely populated areas. The question over the coming days and weeks will be whether those Israeli forces will be willing to go deeper into those population centers, where the fighting again will be much, much more intense.",

And now he's calling for this pause.And you understand a big reason why he's doing that. There's a lot of political pressure that he is getting here in the U.S., especially within his own party.

Unfortunately, you know, this is the reality, not a war that we wanted. It was a war that we were drawn into, a war declared by Hamas when they butchered and massacred over 1400 people and abducted 242. So, when President Biden is saying, to get the prisoners home, of course, we of course report that the prisoners, the hostages, the people that are being held from, a nine-month year old, a nine-month- old babies, to the men and women in their 80s, they need to be released, they need to be released now. We are trying, we are operating on the ground to bring that release as soon as possible.

That is what we've been trying to do. Hamas, on the other hand, have been telling people and threatening them and intimidating them, and in certain cases, even establish checkpoints to actually physically prevent people from going south. So, this is, you know, we are looking very, very carefully and even in times, calling off strikes. But when there are people and when there is infrastructure that is being used to conduct strikes against Israel. And even in the last hour, we've had rockets fired again at the heart of Israel, and over 7,500 rockets have been launched at Israel, all of those intended to hit Israeli civilians. All of those in themselves are war crimes. So, our responsibility as the Israel Defense Forces is to defend the people, to restore safety and security. And once we achieve our goal and read the world of Hamas as a governing authority of the Gaza Strip as the tools and abilities. Once we relieve the world of that organization, that merciless government of Gaza than the lives of people in Gaza, the Palestinians in Gaza, and Israeli lives will be much better.",

The prime minister of Hamas in Gaza, the mastermind of the massacre, that is where he made the decision to finance, plan and instruct on the execution of the attack.So, of course, as we conduct our encirclement of Gaza city, and as we conduct operations from the air and from the sea against targets in Gaza city, which we have been doing for the last three and a half weeks.
