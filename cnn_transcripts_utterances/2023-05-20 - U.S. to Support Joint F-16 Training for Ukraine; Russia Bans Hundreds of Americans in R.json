They say these explosions took place at a Russian base in the now occupied city of Mariupol.This base is said to have housed some 150 Russian fighters and used to install air defense systems. The last time we saw an attack of this scale in Mariupol, it was hailed by Ukrainian authorities back in February as an example of Ukraine's reach on the battlefield. Now Ukrainian authorities say they believe the Russian armed forces have sustained significant losses as a result of these three explosions. We are, of course, still learning more details about that and waiting for reaction from Moscow. Mariupol is, of course, a key base for Moscow-backed fighters. We learned earlier this month from Ukrainian authorities that authorities in Mariupol, Kremlin-backed authorities, had already begun mobilizing national cities. This will be a key for Moscow as we continue to see fierce fighting across the country's east and indeed in the country's capital. Overnight, we learned that Kyiv was subject to an attack by the Russian armed forces, landing in residential areas in the city. The city's mayor taking to Telegram earlier this morning to post that a residential block -- a nine-story residential block -- had sustained fire damage to its roof. There are, of course, still assessments being held in the city to assess the damage to infrastructure but also casualties.

The sea of dissent is all in response to two back-to-back mass shootings earlier this month that shocked the country. Children and young people made up most of the 18 victims. Now weeks later, the size of the protests and the anger is growing. Local media says, this is the biggest yet. \"I only want things to be better for my kids,\" one protester says. \"We want our schools to be safe,\" says another. In the immediate aftermath, there were quiet vigils and pledges from the Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic to toughen gun laws. But that's easier said than done. Serbia has one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world. While there are already checks on legal guns, the country is awash with illegal weapons, left over from conflict in the 1990s. Vucic has given a one-month amnesty for illegal guns to be turned in and promised harsher penalties after that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEKSANDAR VUCIC, SERBIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The amount of weapons in our nation must be drastically reduced by three times and of course none of our citizens must possess mine explosives.

And what we also see is, of course, that there is -- if you have sanctions, there are always some who try to do a sanctions circumvention or evasion. And therefore we now issue the 11th package of sanctions that focuses on circumventions. So we are discussing how to target companies, entities, where we see literally that they buy goods in the European Union and, by a third country, bring them to Russia.
