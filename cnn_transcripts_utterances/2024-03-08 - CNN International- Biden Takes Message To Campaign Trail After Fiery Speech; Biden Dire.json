I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.President Biden is hitting the campaign trail today after delivering a forceful State of the Union address. So, how will the speech affect his reelection campaign? Our panel will discuss. Donald Trump spent last night reacting to Biden speech on social media. Today, however, he will meet with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Plus, yet another scare in the air, shortly after taking off from San Francisco, a Boeing plane loses a tire mid-air. We are live with the latest on the investigation and to the cause, straight ahead. Well, President Biden is hitting the road today, taking his message directly to voters, on the heels of a really fiery State of the Union address. It was high drama on Capitol Hill as the President delivered a passionate speech, seemingly pushing back against critics who say that he is not fit to serve four more years. Biden focused on his campaign's key issues of the economy, abortion and immigration, and willingly sparred with Republicans. And while the campaign is calling a \"March month of action\", Mr. Biden will travel to Pennsylvania today before visiting Georgia on Saturday. Both of those, of course, are battleground states. Other top administration officials like Vice President Kamala Harris will also be hitting the trail. Biden's campaign is hoping to build on the momentum from last night's State of the Union address.

One of the parachutes appear to not have properly deployed. Others appear to be tangled up. But, the result was that several pallets of aid came crashing down near the Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, as people were looking to the sky, hoping that that aid would come and help them survive for another day. Instead, for at least five people, it brought about their death. And this, of course, is just compounding the misery that we are seeing on the ground in Gaza, and again, underscoring the need for more aid to be brought in by land.",

That's a nonpartisan campaign analysis site. Also with us is Sabrina Siddiqui. She is a White House Reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Welcome both. Nathan, let me start with you. As you know, the word that has been used to describe last night is often fiery. I mean, I can't tell you how many -- I've lost count of how many times I have seen fiery this morning. And here is just sort of a montage of some of them this morning. How does last night change the race moving forward, if at all? NATHAN GONZALES, EDITOR &amp; PUBLISHER, INSIDE ELECTIONS: Well, on an empirical level, we don't know yet. I mean, we have to wait a few weeks. We have to wait even a month or so before we know. Let this -- let the coverage of the speech seep in. Let people wrestle with whether they think it changes their opinion of what job President Biden is doing. And that's going to be -- that's going to take time to get people to get polls out in the field and digest those. But, I think this is the speech that Democrats needed. They -- President Biden has been taking on water. He has been criticized over and over for his ability, and Republicans lowered the bar so low that he really had an opportunity to sail over it, and I think he did. It gave Democrats the vision that this could happen, meaning, this campaign. They feel more comfortable. And there is a roadmap on issues of where the party can go up until November.",

And what you saw there was what he has done in the past, which is tie it to his experience, and once again, frame his age and his experience as an asset that -- he has had decades of experience in public service. That also in turn, as he said, makes his vision for the country much clearer. This is, of course, coming as he has -- there have been many, many polls. It's not just attacks from his opponents, but polls among American voters and even Democratic voters expressing concerns about his age. There were, of course, many Democratic voters who said they would have preferred someone else at the top of his ticket this time around.So, this speech was really an opportunity for the President, I think, not just to talk about his accomplishments in his first term and lay out what his agenda would be for a second term, but to try and assuage some of those concerns around whether or not he is up to the task, whether or not he has the stamina or the energy. And so, I think that's why you saw him really very combative affirmative in his tone. As you said, fiery is a word that you're hearing from a lot of people. And I think the White House is pretty happy with how it went. And I think you'll probably see him continue and embrace his age even more on the campaign trail moving forward, because the best way the White House really sees the argument here is framing it as an asset and not a liability.",

Well, the Biden campaign is really trying to build off the momentum of President Biden's State of the Union address, and that will include travel by President Biden, Vice President Harris, but also a push to organize and turn out their voters heading into November's elections.Now, the President will start that campaign blitz a little bit later today when he travels to Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state. He is there traveling to a suburb of Philadelphia. Of course, suburbs will be important to the Biden campaign as they're trying to court moderate, independent and female voters, especially around the issue of reproductive rights, something that President Biden spent a lot of time speaking to in the State of the Union address last night, as he tried to draw that contrast with the former presidents. Now, Biden, tomorrow, will head to Georgia. And then, next week, he is planning to hit the states of New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Michigan, two of those being the critical blue wall that he will need to hold on to in November's election if he wants a second term in office. You have Vice President Harris who is traveling out to Nevada and Arizona. But, it's not just campaign travel that the campaign is ramping up in the coming weeks. They are also focusing on their organizing efforts. That includes digital organizing and opening up those brick-and-mortar offices. They're looking to open about 100 new offices in battleground states in the coming weeks. That includes bringing on about 350 staff to start working with volunteers, working with organizers to get out the President's message. And then, there is the advertising campaign, big money planned around that. The campaign is eyeing about $30 million over a six-week period in the coming weeks. That will include television and digital ads, all trying to get the President's message out there in front of American voters. But really, President Biden tried to use last night's speech to draw that contrast with the former President, and that will be a key focus for the Biden campaign as they are heading to November. They believe that soon voters will start to be tuning in, paying more attention to this campaign. The question is, how Biden will appear when he is out on the road? He was energized and fiery last night. A lot of voters want, Democrats want to see him do that on the campaign trail as well. Today could be a first key test of that.",

The President has at times been critical and warned about Netanyahu's and Israel's campaign in Gaza. Last night, in his remarks, he spent a significant portion of speaking about the situation in Gaza, saying that more humanitarian aid needs to get in that the Israelis can't use this simply as a bargaining chip.And so, this -- all has been coming as the President has been quite eager to try to get some type of deal in place by Ramadan, which is on Sunday, to get hostages out and more aid in. At the time, it doesn't appear that that's going to so quickly come together.

I mean, the conversation this morning seems to be a lot less about what Senator Britt said and much more about how she said it. SIDDIQUIfrom Republican operatives, pollsters, lawmakers, is what happened there. So much of the conversation, as you say, is not focused on the substance of what Senator Katie Britt said, but on the style, on the delivery. And it was quite bizarre, or she was quite bizarre in her delivery. It's not actually how she typically speaks publicly. So, it is being seen by Republicans as a missed opportunity, especially because this was -- in an election year, really a key moment to highlight what Republicans see as issues of contrast with President Biden and his administration. And Katie Britt is someone that they were excited about, because she has been seen as a rising star within the Republican Party, the youngest Republican woman elected to the U.S. Senate. But, clearly something in the preparation didn't quite go as planned. And I think, as you know, there is a lot more focus now on the way she said it, and not really what she said. And so, I think for Republicans, it absolutely is seen as a missed opportunity. But, at the same time, how many people, when it comes to the American public, are paying attention to the State of the Union rebuttal? I think that's something that's up for debate. Really, ultimately, we are heading toward a rematch between President Biden and former President Trump, and most of the voters are going to be paying much more attention to what the President and the former President say between now in November. And this State of the Union rebuttal will probably make for a good SNL skit, but be forgotten come November.",

Because we're looking at just some of the reactions to the issues, and these are among people who watched the speech. So, that's something important to remember, not necessarily reflective of who is going to show up in November. But, on key issues, Nathan, the President got a double-digit jump in some of these areas. So, will Biden's policies move the U.S. in a right -- the right direction? He got a 17 percentage point jump there, pre-speech versus post-speech. Will his economic policies move the U.S. in the right direction? And 11 percentage point jump there. And will his immigration policies move the U.S. in the right direction? And 11 percentage point jump again among those who watched the speech?

I'm -- it's OK to wait a little bit longer until we get a sample of polls that have a sample of a broader group of the electorate, rather than just a specific people who watched the poll and watched the speech, because more people are going to consume the coverage of the speech rather than the speech itself. And so, that is going to matter.We have to remember that public opinion around President Biden has not changed significantly in two and a half years. Like, ever since the -- our exit from Afghanistan and his job disapproval went higher than his approval rating, he has been an unpopular incumbent for two and a half years now. So, I'm skeptical that a speech is going to make a fundamental difference. But, even if he can make an incremental difference, that could matter in what I expect to be a close race.",

But, for contexts, for over two years now, the U.S. unemployment rate has been below four percent. That is very low. It's the longest stretch in more than 50 years.Let's discuss all of this now with CNN's Global Economic Analyst Rana Foroohar, who joins us from New York.

We still have a really, really hot jobs market, and in some ways that makes us worry about inflation. That makes the Fed concerned that maybe we're still in this really robust economy and we need to be careful to see inflation not tick up. But, this jobs report is interesting, because even though the numbers are strong, you did see unemployment tick up a little bit. Meanwhile, wage growth has moderated. And with inflation being pretty much down to where the Fed would like to see it target-wise, I think that probably argues for a rate cut in the summer.Now, what that will mean, if that happens, is good things for the stock market. So, I got to say that we are still in what I would consider to be a Goldilocks market. We have a strong labor market. We have decent income growth, but it's not so hot that we're worried about inflation. There are still some black swans that could come. There is a lot going on in the world.

They're shining a light on cases where women who have suffered a pregnancy complication have faced criminal charges.CNN's Isabel Rosales has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Lilian just spent seven years in a Salvador prison. The 28-year-old was sentenced to 30 years behind bars. Lilian was convicted of abandonment and neglect, and later for aggravated homicide and the death of her newborn baby. She says the child suffered health complications, and while under a doctor's care, died just 72 hours after birth, LILIAN, RELEASED FROM PRISON (Interpreted): If they had detected the girl's illness in time, she would not have died. I would not have lost so many years of my life in prison. I would not have missed my other daughter's childhood. ROSALES (voice-over): Lilian said she was undergoing a procedure for a tear in her uterus and was sedated when the baby died. But, prosecutors accuse her of not taking care of the fetus during pregnancy. LILIAN (Interpreted): They wanted to free themselves from blame. So, they accused me of having killed, abandoned and neglected her. The police came to arrest me at the hospital. ROSALES (voice-over): El Salvador has one of the strictest abortion laws in the Americas. And the government makes no apologies, saying those who break the law will be prosecuted. But, with the help of human rights organizations and women's rights groups, some Salvadoran women are rising up against the country's total abortion ban and harsh criminal penalties. Abortion advocates argue the ban has put women in prison who have suffered complications during pregnancy, like in Lilian's case, or in miscarriages. A campaign over the last decade to free women serving long sentences has led to the release of 73 women from prison. Lilian was one of them. LILIAN (Interpreted): I am very happy to have been reunited with my family. I am infinitely grateful to all the people who supported me during this process and who fought for freedom. ROSALES (voice-over): Alba Lorena Rodriguez, so she became pregnant at 21 after being raped. Five months into her pregnancy, she went into premature labor and the newborn died. She says she was arrested at the funeral of her stillborn baby. ALBA LORENA RODRIGUEZ, RELEASED FROM PRISON (Interpreted): I felt like the world came crashing down on me because I knew I wasn't going to see my girls, and that I was being punished for something I hadn't done and that I didn't have a fair trial. ROSALES (voice-over): It has been 25 years since El Salvador made getting abortions illegal under all circumstances. The country's President, Nayib Bukele, was recently elected to a second term, and says there will be no change to the abortion laws. The ban is popular among many Catholics and evangelical Salvadorans in the deeply conservative country. The law has come under scrutiny with cases presented in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. ANGELICA RIVAS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY (Interpreted): We continue insisting to the state that not only does it have to review the procedures at the judicial level, so they are free of gender stereotypes and free of discrimination against women, but it also has to review the legislation, and that is one of our demands. ROSALES (voice-over): According to one Salvadoran abortion rights group, no women facing aggravated homicide charges tied to stillbirths or miscarriages remain in prison. But, they say seven women are still awaiting trial. Isabel Rosales, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But, rarely do they fall from the sky and cause damage on the ground below. This was the scene at San Francisco International Airport yesterday morning, 11So, it caused a fair amount of damage there that you saw just a second ago in the employee lot. The tire hit a Toyota Corolla, a Tesla model three. Something like this might not be immediately apparent to the crew, though, and air traffic control spotted it, and they had to tell other airplanes approaching runway to wait, to abort their landings. The FAA is investigating this right now. And the big question is, why did wheel come off? Not a Boeing issue, probably, because the airplane was about 22-years-old. So, the question is, was it related to maintenance, may be called a maintenance-induced failure? This plane flew from Paris about 24 hours before this. And there is the United maintenance base there at SFO. Or was it simply something that broke? These wheels take a lot of punishment supporting a 300 ton airliner. It's not an easy job. It's why there are 14 of these tires on a 777. Also, while this unplanned landing at LAX was pretty uneventful. United is thinking its crew of the plane, its crew in San Francisco, and at LAX for dealing with this swiftly. United also says \"We will work with customers as well as the owners of the damaged vehicles, an SFO, to ensure their needs are addressed.\" But, imagine getting that call, Rahel, that your car just got crushed by a big tire from the sky.",
