These were the settler leaders. These were the ultra orthodox who have their own reasons for wanting to push forward with these reforms. But keep in mind, Benjamin Netanyahu has his own reasons for wanting to push forward with these reforms. He has denied over and over again that this massive judicial overhaul has anything to do with his own ongoing corruption trial. But when you just look at the bare facts if the Israeli government will have more power over selecting judges if the Israeli government the politicians in power would have more power in being able to potentially overturn high court decisions. That might have an effect on somebody's own corruption trial. Now again, he has denied this over and over again. He has denied the charges against him, but we still have not heard from Benjamin Netanyahu. But we are hearing reports that even some of these far right wing members of his government. That's Bezalel Smotrich and the like are now agreeing that it may be time to at least freeze legislation. This doesn't mean it's going to completely stop. It doesn't mean that reforms of some kind will not move forward. Because people do say reforms may be needed.

Obviously we know there was that controversial rollback of some of the Dodd/Frank regulations certainly on the mid size and smaller banks in 2018 under Donald Trump.And then there was the question of supervision. Were they correctly supervised? Whether regulations in place, you know, appropriately applied? And this is questions around things like why was Silicon Valley Bank allowed to amass such a large proportion of treasury bonds on its balance sheet, then left it very exposed when interest rates went up. And add to that the issue of those uninsured deposits. Silicon Valley Bank had more than 90 percent uninsured deposits. Those over a quarter of a million on its balance sheets. And those two things together really made it very vulnerable. So questions are going to be asked if the regulators, representatives from the FDIC, from the Federal Reserve and from the Treasury, in the Senate, first on Tuesday, and then in the House about how we got to this point and how to prevent it in future.",
