It's Friday, March 15th, 8 a.m. here in London, 10 a.m. in Gaza, where the Palestinian Health Ministry again accused Israel of targeting civilians who were waiting for food aid.At least 20 people are reported killed and more than 150 others wounded. Hospitals are struggling to deal with the volume and types of injuries coming through their doors. Witnesses say the distribution site for aid was hit by what sounded like tank or artillery fire. Israel's military calls reports about the attack false and says it's assessing the situation. The incident happened in Gaza City in the northern part of the territory, where the humanitarian crisis is particularly severe due to Israel's chokehold on food and supplies. The top Democrat in the U.S. Senate is criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and calling for new elections. Chuck Schumer says many Israelis have lost confidence in the vision and direction of the government and new elections are the only way to allow for healthy and open decisions about the country's future. Schumer says Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way, allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of his country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, the Houthis have been striking commercial ships in the Red Sea, and they have also been holding hostage the crew members from the Galaxy leader since November, since they hijacked that ship in November. And they say that they are doing that to put pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza.And we heard from the top Filipino diplomat that is dealing with the negotiations with the Houthis. And frankly, he says that there is not much to discuss other than the fair, the decent treatment of those people who he says are being fed, are able to have some contact, brief weekly contact with their families, and are being held on board the ship. But he says that there is no indication that they will be handed over until this war ends. In fact, he says that the Houthis, there are some indications, may insist on some kind of international recognition before those hostages are handed over. Now, we asked the Houthis this yesterday. It took them a while, but they did get back to us briefly yesterday. And they gave us this statement. I'll read it. Quote: The ship and it's crew are in the hands of the brothers in the Hamas resistance movement and the Al-Qassam Brigades. We have no claims of our own regarding this vessel. To clarify, Hamas is not physically in charge of this vessel or holding these hostages physically. But essentially, the Houthis, again, tying all of this to Gaza, have said, look, whatever happens to them, Hamas will get to decide. Clearly, that complicates an already complicated situation -- Bianca.",

Thank you very much.A maritime tracking website shows that a ship carrying desperately needed food and other supplies is off the coast of Gaza right now. It was due to arrive Thursday night. It's not clear if or when it will be allowed to deliver its cargo. The NGO World Central Kitchen says its ship, the Open Arms, is carrying 200 tons of aid for the people of Gaza. And it hopes to get even more on a second ship bound for the territory. Satellite images show where organizers have built a wharf on the coast of central Gaza. There you can see it's about five miles or eight kilometers from Wadi Gaza checkpoint, the Israeli checkpoint separating northern and southern Gaza. On Thursday, the US and Jordanian militaries conducted their tenth airdrop of aid into northern Gaza, providing nearly 14,000 meals. With the war now in its sixth month, the U.N. warns nearly 600,000 people in Gaza. One quarter of the population are on the brink of famine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say that it's a proxy war and the U.S. is just using Ukraine. So there will be more of that. It will make the nuclear deterrent newly relevant, given the uptick that we see regularly, but especially now from Putin in terms of nuclear rhetoric. And China -- look, I mean, China and Russia are united in their opposition to U.S. global dominance. That's where we see this superpower struggle. It may be the case for China that having Putin in power is helpful, carrying on because they've built this relationship with him, there's regular meetings and all of that. But then also you do see some Chinese discomfort with the war in Ukraine, especially when it comes to that nuclear rhetoric. And they want to present themselves as this peacemaker. So China will continue, I think, to try and benefit as they can, as much as they can from this war and from Putin's tenure, without obviously getting their hands dirty.",

      "sentences": "Five hours in a courtroom in his classified documents case on Thursday, Donald Trump's team made two different arguments trying to get his case dismissed and has already lost one of those arguments.The judge here, Judge Aileen Cannon of the Southern District of Florida, she has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to have his case dismissed because his team were trying to claim that the law was too vague. But Judge Cannon very shortly after the hearing said that's not going to be the case, that's going to be a question and an argument that perhaps he could talk to her and to the jurors about at a later time. But it's not enough of an argument that the national defense laws are so vague that he wouldn't have known what he was doing and could be charged with a crime like this in this classified document mishandling case. Now there's another argument still out there that Judge Cannon has not yet ruled on. That's Donald Trump's argument that the papers that he had kept at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency, things about weapons, military plans, military responses in the case of an attack, foreign powers, all of those things Donald Trump wants to say were his personal papers and he had the ability to keep them because he could have chosen to do so as president. That's something that Judge Cannon was also skeptical about, but she hasn't yet said exactly what she's going to do with that request from his team. It's only a small portion of what his team has been arguing to this judge to have his case dismissed. And so there is a lot more to do both in court and then to await as the judge proceeds toward trial here in this case against Donald Trump in South Florida.
