He's asking the U.S. Supreme Court to decide disputes about his eligibility for office under the U.S. Constitution's insurrectionist ban.Also tonight, Iran is warning of a harsh response to deadly explosions near the tomb of a top Iranian general exactly four years after he was killed in a U.S. airstrike. CNN is in the region with an update on the blast and the rising Middle East tensions. And House Speaker Mike Johnson and dozens of GOP lawmakers visit the southern border, turning up the pressure on President Biden to cut a deal on immigration. This hour, I'll discuss the migrant crisis with New York's Democratic Mayor Eric Adams. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news, Donald Trump now formally asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the Colorado ruling, removing him from the ballot. The high court under mounting pressure to intervene as Trump faces ballot disputes in multiple states. Our Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is working this important story for us.

It's not mentioned in the 14th Amendment, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.The former president also points out that under his belief, he did not actually engage in an insurrection. So, the Colorado decision was incorrect, according to their filing. I'll read you just some more of this, 43 pages here that they filed with the Supreme Court. They say this court should grant certiorari to consider this question of paramount importance, summarily reverse the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling and return the right to vote for their candidate of choice to the voters. They go on to say, Wolf, this is a ruling, again, the Colorado Supreme Court ruling, this is a ruling that, if allowed to stand, will mark the first time in the history of the United States that the judiciary has prevented voters from casting ballots for the leading major party presidential candidate. Now, Wolf, one of the things that really stands out in this filing, I would say perhaps the cheekiest argument that the former president is making, is that the Section 3 of the 14th amendment, they say, doesn't prohibit someone from running for office. It only prohibits someone from holding office. And so they're saying that the Supreme Court should -- just based on that, should reverse what the Supreme Court of Colorado has done. What they say could happen is if Trump wins election, obviously, that the Congress, by a two-thirds vote could essentially cure the problem and allow him to take office if this ruling is overturned.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): Scenes of chaos in the Iranian city of Kerman, an explosion sending crowds into disarray when a second blast rings out. Thousands had gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of Military Commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad four years ago. The twin blasts less than a mile from Soleimani's grave, killing more than a hundred and injuring many more. Iranian officials say this was a terror attack, state media reporting that one of the explosions was caused by a bomb inside a suitcase in a car. Soleimani was Iran's revered top military general, this attack on his supporters seen as a strike against the Iranian regime, which has many enemies both inside and outside the country. In Lebanon, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah commemorated Soleimani's death, but also used his speech on Wednesday to condemn Tuesday's killing of a top Hamas official on his own soil. HASSAN NASRALLAH, SECRETARY-GENERAL, HEZBOLLAH: Yesterday's crime was large and dangerous. This crime will not be left without a response and punishment.

But the brazen strike in Beirut in the heart of Hezbollah territory has raised fears among the United States and its allies that a full scale war could break out between Israel and the Middle East's most powerful paramilitary force, or even more broadly across the region. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): And, Wolf, while we are hearing those warnings from Hezbollah about the potential for this conflict to escalate more broadly, we have heard from the Lebanese foreign minister saying that the Lebanese government does not want to see a war break out, that it is working to convince Hezbollah not to wage a war against Israel, and that it wants to see peace on its southern border. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, saying that it has no reason to be more concerned following Tuesday's strike of a broader escalation than it has been from the outset of the war, saying that, in the U.S. perspective, it is not in the interest of Hezbollah nor in the interest of Israel to see a broader escalation in this conflict.

Number one, any senior member of Hamas who was involved in the planning of October 7th and the brutal murder of 1,200 Israelis has a relatively short lifespan. We saw this, of course, with the way the Israelis dealt with the people who were involved with the terrorist attack on the Munich Olympic team back in the early 70s. The Israelis will not rest until the leaders of that brutal terrorist attack are gone. And so I don't know whether this was an Israeli strike, but we do know what the future of an awful lot of these Hamas leaders are.Number two, it is true that Hezbollah has stayed out of this fight. Hezbollah is sophisticated enough to understand that attack on a Hamas leader is not the same as an attack on a Hezbollah leader. And while I don't think it's in anybody's interest, including Hezbollah's interest, to get involved in hostilities, more hotter, if you will, than what is already happening on the northern border of Israel, there is one player, of course, who would like to see additional chaos, and that is the sponsor of Hezbollah, the sponsor of Hamas, and that's, of course, Iran.",

And as a consequence, were I sitting in that oval office, I probably would have taken more aggressive action against the Houthis. Now, the United States Navy, of course, sank three of their boats attacking shipping. But I think we need to make it very clear that attacking freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is an escalation. And it will not be tolerated. And if the Houthis want to find their ways to -- we would obviously discourage this, but if they want to jump into direct conflict with Israel, that will be their decision, but they do not get to implicate U.S. critical and global critical strategic interests.

MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: A lot of us were skeptical on these big wide-bodied aircraft, whether it really was practical to get a group that large out of an aircraft in that much time. And here, we have a real-life demonstration that it can be done.",

The U.S. Justice Department, listen to this, has just filed suit against the state of Texas over the state's controversial new immigration enforcement law, this as the House speaker, Mike Johnson, visits the southern border.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Migrants crossed the Rio Grande into the United States as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson looks on during the Republicans' tour of the southern border. To highlight a crisis, he says the Biden administration is doing nothing to fix. Migrants have crossed into the United States by the thousands, more than 225,000 alone in December, the highest monthly surge recorded since the year 2000. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): America is at a breaking point with record levels of illegal immigration. And today, we got a firsthand look at the damage and the chaos the border catastrophe is causing in all of our communities.",

MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: Extremely pleased that the Washington -- that D.C. is taking this action. The White House is taking this action. It's so important to send a very clear message to the governor of Texas, who is just really aggressively attempting to destabilize cities. And I think this action is extremely appropriate.

So, our team is culling through them now. But this is all, you know, part of this lawsuit, and part of the reason why the judge said that she would unsealed the names in these documents, it's because a lot of these names have already become public, either through the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former or long time girlfriend, who is convicted of helping him in sex-traffic minors, as well as through interviews with a number of accusers have given to news organizations, and just other information that has come out over the 20 years that Epstein has been alleged to have been involved in this sex trafficking operation. So, we're starting to see some of these names come out, and Virginia Giuffre has been very public about her allegations, accusing prominent politicians of being -- having been forced to have sex with them as well her allegations against Prince Andrew. She had reached a settlement with the prince where he's agreed to make a sizeable donation. So we're going to go through these documents and see if we're learning any new names or new allegations.
