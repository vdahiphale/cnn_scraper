But it may have been very costly for him to do so.His ex-wife, or soon-to-be ex-wife, is very unhappy about the situation presumably, but is using it as leverage. And she understands that he did not want to be embarrassed. He did not want this out in public. We have no idea what is going on behind closed doors but I assume she is extracting a significant price in the divorce in exchange for trying to resolve this in the short run. I think Mr. Wade is paying the price for the relationship that he is in. Reasonably, a hefty price for it. I do not think the price that he's going to pay is over. I think he's going to continue to have to face questions about this for some weeks to come.",

But one aid group says the IDF has taken that offensive into a hospital, a report that the IDF is now denying. Clearly, the ground situation is not cooling off as negotiators near another hostage deal. There is a framework for a truce but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled some resistance. Let's get the latest live from Israel with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, first, what are you hearing about the situation in Khan Younis?",

Imagine the fact that thousands of displaced Palestinians have been sheltering at two hospitals in western Khan Younis, exactly where the Israeli military over the last week has been carrying out a major ground offensive.And today, the Palestine Red Crescent Society says that Israeli forces, Israeli tanks are still on the ground of that hospital complex, The Al-Amal Hospital in western Khan Younis. Where they say that some 8,000 people have been sheltering. They say that snipers are on the rooftops and the roads leading to the hospital, there are reports that many of the roads are blocked. The Israeli military, for its part, says it did not enter the hospital itself but there have been numerous reports of live ammunition as well as smoke grenades being fired on the grounds of that hospital. Meanwhile, efforts are still underway to try and secure another deal that would see a lengthy truce, perhaps weeks of a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas and could see the release of dozens of Israeli hostages. Today, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, telling the families of hostages that he is fully committed to returning all of their loved ones. But just yesterday, he said as well that Israel will not release, quote, \"thousands of terrorists\" in order to secure this deal. He also made very clear that while Hamas is pushing for an end to this war altogether, a permanent ceasefire in order to release those hostages, the Israeli prime minister is saying he will continue until total victory. Making clear that he wants to achieve both objectives of this war as he has laid them out, not only securing the release of all of those hostages but also dismantling Hamas, removing it from power in the Gaza Strip. Clearly, there are still major differences to be resolved between these two sides. A lot of ground to go, despite the fact that we have seen some significant momentum, significant progress in recent days.",

As one put it, quote, \"We had a tough deal and they chickened out,\" referring to Republicans. And that is really the difference. The framing for Democrats has always been, we pursued immigration reform in Congress but Republicans did not want to move forward with it. Now it's a step further. They are pursuing reform and it is tough reform. Notably, this does not even include legalization for undocumented immigrants, which Democrats previously pushed on. So this is an opportunity they are using to say, well, we are willing to take a tougher stance but it's Republicans who don't want that. And President Biden over the weekend in remarks to South Carolina Democrats mentioned border security, linking it to this deal, and saying that he would shut down the border if given the authority. Now the campaign said they will focus on former President Donald Trump, his record and what he pledged to do on immigration. And they say Americans want a balanced approach on this issue. But ultimately, the last few days they have started to give a preview of how Democrats might really start to use this deal in their favor.",
