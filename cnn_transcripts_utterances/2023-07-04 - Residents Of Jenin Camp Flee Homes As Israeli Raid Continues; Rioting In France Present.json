According to the IDF a brigade size troop deployment, around 500 soldiers took part in the raid targeting what was described as a terrorist command and control center in the refugee camp. During the raid, Israeli soldiers say they came under heavy fire from Palestinian militants, while some residents threw rocks and also cars and tires on fire. Palestinian officials say at least nine people were killed almost 100 hurt. Civilians say they're fleeing violence not seen since the Second Intifada. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is over the course of the day. What we've heard throughout the day is that the IDF is striking infrastructure. And when we talk about infrastructure, what are they actually talking about. They've uncovered over thousands of explosive devices, heavy explosives that are meant to detonate beneath military vehicles, hand grenades, weapons, and so on, command and control centers which are used in order to prevent IDF activities. The reality is one where over the last two years, the Palestinian security forces are working less than less, and not even entering the palette -- the refugee camp of Jenin, and that has required the IDF to step up its activities in the camp and this is the reality where we are today, where basically the terrorist activities is using -- the IDF is calling it a safe haven, I prefer to use to say the term as a launch pad or a staging ground to conduct these attack attacks and activities.",

And -- but the access that Palestinians from the West Bank, and specifically from Jenin to Israel is relatively easy compared to those other areas. So that's why, in their view, many terrorist attacks have been successful in killing and murdering Israelis on the front lines. We have to keep in mind that, you know, the core problem around this conflict is the conflict that there is no political horizon. There is no discourse between the sides and this is creating reality on the ground where, you know, there is no hope, there is no dream. What do people do?

We need to have leaders that can actually have a vision of coexistence.Unfortunately, they're not around and this cycle of violence, I would say it's unfortunate.

We do need to be very wary, weighing on the last sink of what was just reported of political, I would say hyper bowl, which is playing for local ears. On I would say on the Israeli side. And also on the Palestinian side, we need to be focused that the understanding of what's going on in the ground is this is a limited in scale and scope, although it is in an increased scale, compared to the last few years. But the scope, it will be limited, it will be over within a few days. And then every site will have to look at what it's achieved. And, you know, the terrorists will have to ask themselves and the people in the cabinet class themselves, is it good to have these terrorists? And so I will say OK, what are the types of tools I need to do in order to prevent this from happening again, and I would say security coordination is one of those with the Palestinian Authority, but also operational capability of the IDF is also important.",

So he's created a center -- a central position that he now occupies, with a far-left in a far-right, those are the two major parties left on the electoral landscape today, who are absolutely determined to end up in the runoff stages in the 2027 elections and who have been obstructionists in parliament, of course, in their goal to undermine his presidency. But at the end of the day he is the president, he's at the helm, and the fact that electorally he sees the future of his party not just moving to the right but poaching on right-wing voters through these kinds of debates on identity and cultural debates on immigration. And that's not enough to take care of that other pillar which is the pillar of equality, which is what so much has been about in the unrest since the pension reform, the yellow vests, and ultimately the question of ethnic minorities in France today, John.",

We support Israel's security and right to defend its people against the Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups. It is imperative to take all possible precautions to prevent the loss of civilian lives. Now beyond monitoring the reports of casualties as they emerge from this Israeli operation inside the West Bank, U.S. officials are also very wary of a potential broader escalation. Over the last couple of years there have been a number of clashes between Israel and Palestinian militants. And the U.S. has played a crucial behind the scenes role in mediating some of those conflicts. Also bringing together some of the highest level Israeli-Palestinian meetings that we have seen between the two sides in years. But nonetheless, powder-keg dynamics remain in the region and so the U.S. is very mindful of the possibility for a broader escalation here. The U.S. is also in the process of trying to re-integrate Israel more broadly into the region. Building on the success of the Abraham Accords during the Trump administration. And one of the Biden administration's key goals is to try and achieve normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia has made very clear that the situation for Palestinians need to improve in order for that to happen. Secretary of State Tony Blinken also speaking to that last month, saying that it would be tougher if not impossible for that normalization to happen, unless those powder keg dynamics actually change, unless the situation for Palestinians improves.
