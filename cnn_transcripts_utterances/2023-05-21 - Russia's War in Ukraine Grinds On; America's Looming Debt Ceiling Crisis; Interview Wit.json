Each side is still trying to fight it out and each side thinks that if the other gives up, if the West pulls back support, then maybe the tide will turn.So what's crucial now is to continue to pledge support for Ukraine so that the Russians realize that we're not going to back out and with that, the Iranians -- not the Iranians. The Ukrainians need the tools to win but they already know now that they can beat the Russians on the ground. And so the only question now is when will the gap between the objective Russian situation and Russia's real perception of it change? And I think that will happen this year.

That's the strategic objective.But by so emphasizing democracy versus autocracy, it makes it more difficult for countries like Vietnam, whose assistance we want in this dispute, to take our side. And by pressing the military elements of it, they are overemphasizing the military elements of it because they can't deliver on the economic elements of it. I thought the G7 was a step in the right direction, though. And it appears to be where the secretary of state is putting a lot of his diplomatic emphasis.

All you have to do is look around the Muslim world and just look at the -- I mean, the devastation that is going on there. So, I'm a firm believer that the country needs a strong defense and needs to be able to defend itself as it did in the war on terror because -- I mean, we got ourselves into a mess. And 80,000 Pakistanis died. And the army gave great sacrifices. The problem right now is -- first, let me just correct you. I never had a problem with the army. I worked knowing that they were entrenched, the army has been -- it is a fact of 75 years the army has -- three times they have ruled directly through martial law. The last 60 years half has been ruled by the army and the half by the two families were chosen, Sharifs. So I was working with them. I was working with the General Bajwa. What happened when he decided to switch horses and abandon me and topple my government? I still am not sure. I'm not still sure of his voters. One of them could have -- he had struck a deal with the current prime minister for his extension. But I never knew what happened. All I know is that the last six months he just worked to remove my government and he's -- he's openly afterwards in an interview claimed that he decided that I was too dangerous for the country and so my government was ousted. Since then, all I have said is that the solution to Pakistan's problems are free and fair elections. Because that is the only thing that will bring political stability in this country. And without political stability, our economy has just tanked. We now are in a worse situation than Sri Lanka was. I mean, we -- Pakistan has never had the economy in such a tailspin as it is right now. The only way you can bring the economic stability is through political stability which will come through elections. That is all I've been saying. Now the problem I'm facing is that somehow the current lot, what I would call the PDM parties, they have aligned themselves with the establishment. And they have convinced the establishment that if there are elections, they are going to lose, which is a fact. Now, in order to keep me out the whole democratic system has been dismantled. So when you -- you don't -- the government does not listen to the Supreme Court and doesn't follow the constitution, when the way they have used the pretext of arson, they blamed us for the arson when I was grabbed from the -- from the high court, by the army. And the way I was grabbed, there was a reaction. But, they used that reaction, unfortunately, to dismantle the party. So I mean, they have -- over 10,000 workers are jailed.

The country has one of the world's highest rates of inflation. It is now currently at 43 percent, having peaked at over 85 percent last year. Foreign investors have fled Turkey under Erdogan's rule. Erdogan has played up a culture war between his base, conservative often rural religious Muslim voters and the country's secular elite. Does his strong showing suggest that culture matters more to Turkish voters than the economy? If so, it is not a political phenomenon specifically to Turkey. We see it all over the world.
