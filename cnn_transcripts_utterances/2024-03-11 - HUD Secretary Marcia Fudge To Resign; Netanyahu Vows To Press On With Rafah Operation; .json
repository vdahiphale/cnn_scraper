So what does a red line actually mean and how is that impacting the Israeli strategy?BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: So, first, I think that if we listen closely to what Biden said, on the one hand, he said Rafah rough operation is red line, meaning he's not going to allow it. On the other hand, he said that he's not going to stop completely weapon supplies to Israel, and he mentioned specifically the Iron Dome system, this missile defense system. He did not mention, however, things like munitions for fighter planes. He did not mention artillery shells or shells for armored tanks.

But, you know, at the current moment, Israel is the main country who gets U.S. weapons and is fighting in a conflict area. And Israel needs to provide by, I think, by mid-March like something until the end of this week, it needs to provide the U.S. with a written letter of assurances about the use of U.S. weapons in Gaza and about a commitment to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, any humanitarian aid that is supported by the U.S. government. And the Israelis, I think, are going to sign it by the end of the week.

They tried to make it out that that money wasn't a bribe. They said it was a loan. Not true, according to prosecutors.
