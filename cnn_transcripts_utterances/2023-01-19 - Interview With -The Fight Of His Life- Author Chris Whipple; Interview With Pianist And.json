An intimate conversation with Mikhail Voskresensky, and composer,Alan Fletcher, who helped bring him to the United States. Plus, political commentator Charlie Sykes talks to Michel Martin about a divided Congress and whether moderate Republicans can hold firm against the party's extremist ways. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The 118th Congress is getting into full swing, and we are starting to see what the impact of a divided government looks like. GOP hard-liners, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, were given committee assignments. This, after they were tossed off committee's last term for incendiary language and ideas. The alleged fabulist, George Santos, also got a committee assignment, despite growing calls for his resignation, even from his own party. All this, while the country moves full-steam ahead into a fight over the debt limit, risking a U.S. default that could have disastrous consequences for the U.S. and the global economies. We'll have more on the future of divided government later in the program. But first, let us take a step back with a revealing inside look at President Biden and his first two years in office. Chris Whipple joins me from New York with his book, \"The Fight of His Life\", based on securing special access to the Biden administration. We discussed the fascinating details he's amassed on the president who keeps confounding the pundits. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This was the moment that Joe Biden was born to face, apparently. I mean, he spent his whole career preparing for this kind of a challenge. The intelligence was extraordinary. You know, I think that the intelligence community's ability to predict exactly what Putin had in mind rivaled the - - their performance during the Cuban missile crisis. It was one of the CIA's finest hours. The, you know, NATO was -- the NATO leaders were extremely skeptical. They didn't believe it. Biden and Tony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, and the rest of his team were persistent and kept telling him, this is happening. I write about a previously untold story about Kamala Harris meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the eve of the evasion when she said to him, look, the Russians are coming, not only for Ukraine, but for you and your family, personally. Zelenskyy was skeptical. When he left, she turned to an aid and said, that maybe the last time we see him alive. It's a -- the walk up to the invasion is a dramatic story.",

And it was a moment of authenticity that, of course, everybody had their hair on fire when he said it and tried to argue that it was a mistake. But I would argue with that. You know, the endgame here, Christiane, I think is frightening to contemplate. I -- in addition to talking for two years to almost all of Joe Biden's inner circle, I spent some time with Bill Burns, the CIA director. And we talked at length about this. Bill Burns believes, as does Joe Biden, that this may be existential for Vladimir Putin. And it's hard to imagine him giving up on this grandiose notion that all of Ukraine is part of Russia. And at one point, Bill Burns just mused out loud to me as we were in his office above Langley, above the campus at the CIA. And he said, you know, now that he is in Scotts and the eastern provinces, I wonder if it's possible, he said, that Putin will try to cut a deal. And I said, you really think it's possible that he can live with Volodymyr Zelenskyy? And he said, no. Not really. He said, this is existential for him and he's -- would probably only be a delay before he goes back for the rest of Ukraine. The thing that keeps Joe Biden up at night is the prospect of nuclear confrontation with Russia. It's never far from his mind because this is existential for Vladimir Putin and the opinion of Bill Burns, who knows Vladimir Putin better than anyone other than his inner circle. So, I think this is something that really troubles Joe Biden. He thinks about it all the time. They don't like to talk about it out loud, but you can be sure that war games are being conducted continually. And they are gaming now what they would do in the event that Vladimir Putin were to go to that last resort.",

I talked to President Zelenskyyabout all of this, and he doesn't believe it. He just does not believe it. And you could argue that the Ukrainians know Putin, you know, better than anybody. But again, I realize that this is in, you know, top of mind all over the place. So, let's go back to something that wasn't as noble as the U.S. and NATO's defense of democracy, the rule of law, human rights in Ukraine. And that was literally the abandonment of Afghanistan. I mean, his first foreign policy act, President Biden just about was to double down on what Trump had agreed with the Taliban, and handover, you know Afghanistan to the Taliban. A lot has been written about it but I'd like to quote from your book, Bruce Riedel, who is a counterterrorism expert, the former CIA analyst, conducted a study on Afghanistan options for Obama administration. Of course, Biden was in that administration. And here's what he told you, \"Biden's right. We can't beat the Taliban. But we'd produced a stalemate and it cost us very little, about 3,000 troops on the ground, a small expenditure in terms of economic and military assistance. And we protected the vast bulk of the Afghan population from the kind of medieval theocracy that the Taliban was threatening.\"",

The biggest mistake, and the thing that I most regret, of course, isthe fact that we did ignore the extremist elements in the party in part because I think that there was the complacency that these were, you know, these were like your drunken bigoted uncle at Thanksgiving. You could roll your eyes, but that somehow the sane center would prevail. We regarded this as, sort of, a recessive gene. Well, it turned out this recessive gene is dominant. But the point you just made is really significant. Because as recently as 2019, the Republicans did understand there were still red lines and there were needs to -- there was a need to police themselves. So, Steve King was flirting with white supremacy in 2019, well into the Trump-era. And Republicans hesitated only briefly before saying, no, this is not who we are. We are going to expel him from the committee. And he was really, eventually, consigned to political oblivion. Now, fast forward to today where you have people who have consorted with white supremacists, like Paul Gosar, who have engaged in conspiracy theories and, you know, antisemitic fantasies about Jewish space lasers, like Marjorie Taylor Greene. And they are not only not being exiled, they are being promoted and put into these key positions. So, clearly something has changed. And part of this has been the acceleration of the things that I wrote back in 2016. The growth of an alternative reality universe, a right-wing mini-ecosystem. The entertainment wing of the Republican Party, which has clearly become dominant. And it's changed all of the incentive structure. So, it used to be that there was -- you know, there was a leadership in the party that could say, look, this is inappropriate behavior and you need to stop that. Well, there is no leadership structure. There is no establishment that has that kind of control. Right now, the perpetual outrage machines of many of these third-party groups are much more dominant in terms of the money they can raise, the attention they can give, and the kind of celebrity. So, Marjorie Taylor Greene, rather than being cast out can, like Steve King, can go on Fox News. She can go on Newsmax or OAN, and she can turn to small donor -- small donors and raise millions of dollars. And this is the source of her power right now. So, this is one of the reasons why someone like a Kevin McCarthy has to negotiate and give away so much of his power. That's why he needs to appease the crazies in his caucus because the locust of power and money and celebrity has continued to shift drastically and dramatically in the era of Trump.",

They will not go to the mat for their principles the way that the freedom caucus was willing to go to the mat for their caucus. So -- I mean, that's the real question. Well, yes, there are moderates but when will they take a stand. Now, to take a stand in this particular conference risks political oblivion. You ask, you know, why won't they -- you know, why won't they take governing seriously? Well, does that mean working with Democrats? Does that mean making compromises? If they do, they run the risk of following Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney into retirement, that's the way that they conceptualize that. Because the pressure to go along, to get along is so intense. So, I think this is going to be one of the most important things to watch. Because there are quite a few members of this Republican conference that represent districts that were won by Joe Biden. Who ran as centrist, who ran as moderates. But will it matter in the end?

The entire media ecosystem on the right will be geared out to put pressure on Republicans to not compromise. Kevin McCarthy may have made concessions that make compromise impossible. We don't know all the things that he gave away. But we know that he made promises to the freedom caucus. My greatest fear is that any Republican that wants to be grown-up, wants to do the responsible thing will be labeled a traitor, a cock (ph), a rhino (ph). And that if they were to, you know, sign on to a motion of discharge or any sort of a deal with the Biden White House, that they would be immediately targeted by fellow Republicans. It would guarantee that they would have a primary. That voting to compromise with the Biden White House would have the same political implications of voting to impeach Donald Trump. We know how Republicans reacted to all of that. So, then the question is, well, how can we get through all of this? And we don't know. This is also a measure of how radicalized the Republican Party has gotten. And even though they didn't do well in the midterms, the reality is, they control the House.
