Because after all, they nominally annexed that city and the region just a few weeks ago. That is what they claim. But of course, Ukraine won`t accept that. So, you have that dramatic moment. And then also, I think you know, you see they have to mention what`s going on diplomatically. You have the G20 meeting, which, you know, President Putin would normally be attending that. It`s a very big deal. He didn`t go because Russia right now is under severe criticism around the world for its actions in Ukraine. So, he wasn`t there. His Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov was there taking his place, and was under a lot of fire and criticism as well. So, that`s another dramatic moment.

Why did these projectiles end up in a NATO nation, killing people inside NATO territory? This is in some senses a doomsday scenario, because if it were a deliberate attack carried out by, say, Russia, it would trigger or could trigger the Article V, all for one and one for all, agreement between NATO members; in other words, war with Russia. That is the doomsday and most unlikely scenario. But this has come, whilst there have been many, many dozens of rockets, missiles, cruise missiles, fired at targets, mostly critical national infrastructure right across Ukraine in the last few hours. Just this afternoon, really in what has been the heaviest bombardment since the beginning of October, with now 7 million Ukrainians cut off from electrical supply because of these attacks. Now it is probable -- and this is simply based on my analysis of having watched these things unfold here -- that this is a combination of a Russian missile perhaps been shot down by Ukrainian anti aircraft missile.

And it`s been a lot of criticism of the Russian military and the conduct of their operations as a result of it. It`s also militarily problematic because they are now on the other side of the Dnipro River and they do now have that as a natural barrier.

COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, I think the seems to be an accident. In other words, that if it was a Russian missile, like we think it was, that it hit the town of Przewodow, the village of Przewodow, that is right on the Polish border, Polish-Ukrainian border. And it seems to me, based on the initial reports that we`re seeing, that this was either debris that came from a missile or it was a missile that had errant targeting coordinates in it. If that is the case, that the Russians didn`t put the right coordinates in it, then of course, that is an act that has some issues associated with it and could potentially present some difficulties from a NATO standpoint. You know, clearly given the fact that two Poles were killed is a tragedy.

We need, as NATO, to get together, have NATO consultations; Article IV calls for that in the case of any concerns that any allies have about security -- and do several things. We should ask for an explanation from Russia; ideally, the Russians would be telling us that this was an accident and they didn`t intend to strike NATO territory. If they`re silent or if they don`t say that, I think we also need to warn them that any further attacks could generate a proportionate response from NATO against their forces. That`s something they would not want. But I think we have to not fail to respond. The worst thing would be silence from NATO support, which, I think, would then encourage Russia to think that it can get away with this.",

Do all of that kind of telemetry analysis and information analysis to see what we think actually probably did happen. And then also, a lot of political maneuvering for countries to express solidarity with Poland, to make clear that no one will accept any attack on any NATO ally.

We saw that east of Kharkiv, we`ve seen that in Donbas, we`ve seen that now around Kherson. And this will continue. I think the Ukrainians will continue to claw back territory. So all  Russia is able to do is terrorize Ukrainian cities by raining bombs on them, forcing people into shelters; as you indicated, turning off the electricity. Maybe that interrupts the water supply. That`s the kind of terror that Russia wants to inflict on the population. Ukraine will not give up. They will continue to fight and not only Russia will be defeated. And I think Putin is facing some serious problems inside Russia.
