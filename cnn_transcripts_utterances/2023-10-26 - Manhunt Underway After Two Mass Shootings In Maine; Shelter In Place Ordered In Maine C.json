That's significantly more training than most of these officers that are going to be trying to hunt him down has, no? I mean, what does that mean for them?",

Just simply the way he holds the weapon up to his shoulder, the placement of his hands on the -- on the foregrip of the weapon -- so that's like underneath the barrel of the weapon. Then, of course, on the pistol grip on the back. He has the weapon slightly tilted down and is looking out over the top of the -- of the front sites -- the optical devices that aid in making the -- making the weapon -- firing of the weapon more accurate. I mean, those are all the hallmarks of someone who has been trained in the tactical use of this military weapon. So, trained to enter buildings. Trained to look for threats. Trained to prioritize targets and individuals that he decides to eliminate. This is a very, very serious -- a person with serious skills. All those same skills that he used last night to wreak havoc on this town -- he still has those abilities and he can now train them on the law enforcement officers that he undoubtedly knows are looking for him. So even when they come to a point where they believe they have him kind of pinned down to a certain area, the stakes on that confrontation that will inevitably result are enormously high. And you can bet that every law enforcement officer that's engaged in this search knows that if they come across this guy it will be life and death for him or them any second.",

Stay inside. Keep your doors locked. Keep your cell phones around. Keep everything charged. Make sure you have enough food to eat and things like that. But if at all possible, stay in the house. Don't even go outside. And if you see anything it's important to stay aware of your surroundings and aware of what's going on -- noises and things like that, suspicious vehicles in your -- in or around your residence and your neighborhood -- call those things in to law enforcement right away. But I think it's also important for folks to remember that this may not be resolved in the next few hours or even today, or even in the next few days. It's not strange at all for a manhunt situation like this to stretch on for a week or more. Certainly, we've had examples of a few in the last few years that have gone on several weeks. Hopefully, that doesn't happen here. But we have to kind of steel ourselves for the worst possible event.",

Maine does not have a red flag law or an extreme risk law. Those laws are on the books in several states and they enable law enforcement or even family members or people around someone who perceive that someone seems to be kind of on the edge and presenting a danger to themselves and others, you can intervene and have their weapons taken away for a limited period of time to give that person the opportunity to get some mental health treatment and kind of restabilize themselves. Maine does not have that. Also, people are wondering is it -- how is it possible to obtain a firearm if you're someone who is actively receiving medical treatment. That is also not an impediment to purchasing a firearm in Maine or anyplace, really, else in this country. You can be excluded from purchasing a firearm if you've been adjudicated a mental defective -- that's how the statute reads -- but that requires a court to basically --",

So it's very relevant facts to us to understand, like, what might have driven this person to take this horrible, horrible act. But in all likelihood, he possessed that firearm lawfully. We don't know when he purchased it. That's going to be something we'll find out as we go on. But the overwhelming likelihood is there's not really much of an issue there.",

We are going to get to the latest now on this morning's breaking news -- a mass shooting last night in Lewiston, Maine that multiple law enforcement sources say killed at least 16 people. Dozens of other victims were injured in two shootings -- one at a restaurant and another at a bowling alley.A multistate manhunt is underway for what police are calling a person of interest, 40-year-old Robert Card. In these surveillance photos, a gunman is holding a high-powered assault-style rifle. Officials tell CNN Card is a firearms instructor in the U.S. Army Reserves. They say he's armed and dangerous. Anyone who spots him should not approach them. They should call 911. A shelter-in-place order covers the Lewiston and Lisbon, Maine areas this morning. Last night, witnesses to the attack were taken to a reunification center to find their families. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ken, thank you very much for being back with us. You heard Rob there with those details. He was driving up from Boston overnight seeing cop cars -- law enforcement coming from all over the region. Can you help us understand what they are all doing and what they are looking for right now? KEN GRAY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN (via Skype):  Absolutely. So in a situation like this what happens is you set up what's called a unified command. Unified command means there's representatives in there from law enforcement agencies from the Lewiston police, from the sheriff's office, from the state police, from the FBI, from the ATF. All of these different law enforcement agencies and also first responders are in there providing -- investigators -- providing personnel to conduct the manhunt. And so, there's a lot of coordination going on here to try to find Mr. Card and to try to arrest Mr. Card. Here's the thing, though. Card is what is considered to be a pseudo commando. That's the terminology for mass shooters. They often use military-style weapons. They were military-style clothing like the cargo pants he was wearing. And pseudo commandos often end up in a suicide by police-type situation where they want to encounter law enforcement. They want to end their life with a shootout with police. So this is a very dangerous situation not only for the people of Lewiston there but also for law enforcement in their search for him. He's still very dangerous. He's still armed and should be considered very dangerous.",

He's a firearms instructor in the use of firearms and the tactical use of firearms. That kind of training and knowledge is not something that's typically given to local law enforcement that may now find themselves in encounters with him, no?",

They are going to be able to be able to deal with the tactical situation. And that makes it doubly dangerous for law enforcement because not only are they trying to track him down but then they have to also deal with a person that may have equal or better training and better firepower than the officers that will be encountering Mr. Card when they find him.",

So -- and also information about victims' families -- about where they can go for assistance.So there's a lot of different moving parts in this and again, this is a very fluid situation. But I expect for an update to be limited with the amount of information they put out. They've already put out a lot of information for an early-on part of an investigation like this, but that's to keep the public safe and to provide them information that will help them keep away from Mr. Card in the event that he should be in their area.",
