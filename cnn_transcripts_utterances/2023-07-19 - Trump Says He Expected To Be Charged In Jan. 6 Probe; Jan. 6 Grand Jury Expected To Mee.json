If you've spoken to any of Trump's lawyers over the past year, they would have told you that they absolutely did not expect that he would be charged in the January 6 investigation. Now, initially, they would also tell you they didn't expect he would be charged in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. But that thinking, of course, changed once they learned there was a recording of their client.So the charges, though, that are listed in the target letter, according to reports, contemplate a case that is much broader than they would have even anticipated. So now they're trying to figure out, does the special counsel have some additional witnesses or some other evidence that they're not aware of? And, Jake, I've got to tell you, the Trump team, they're pretty looped into what's going on with this investigation. Remember, the political action committee aligned with Trump underwrites the defense counsel for a lot of key witnesses. And that's a big part of how they keep tabs on what's going on, which makes it all the more surprising that they were so caught off guard.",

Now, there is, of course, though, some confusion because the Mar-a-Lago grand jury was here in D.C. but then eventually they transferred it to a grand jury down in Florida. But the key difference there is, of course, Florida is where a lot of the alleged conduct occurred, though also some of the alleged conduct also occurred in New Jersey, it's up to prosecutors. But I was in court yesterday, Jake, with defense attorneys for the former president and special counsel prosecutors and the defense attorneys made it clear that they intend to make that move from D.C. to Florida in the Mar-a-Lago case, an issue going forward.",

RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I hope he doesn't get charged. I don't think it'll be good for the country. VIVEK RAMASWAMY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I do not want to see my opponents eliminated because of the actions of a corrupt federal administrative police state. MIKE PENCE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're all involved in a primary. I trust the American people to judge that. That day -- TIM SCOTT, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He used to try to find a way to weaponize his powers.

But there are some nuanced differences that we've seen at this point from the indictment in March and earlier in June.In your interview with the Florida governor yesterday, he talked repeatedly about looking toward the future. He said he must look ahead toward the future. And he said he does not believe it's good to have a presidential campaign in January focused on the past, what happened on January 6 of 2021. So there are some nuanced differences, but by and large, the Republican rivals, with the exception of Chris Christie and Mike Pence and sometimes Nikki Haley, they are staying away from any criticism of the former president. And, Jake, the reason is simple, because he still controls the base of the party's support here. And it's a very perilous thing to say to a primary electorate to criticize Donald Trump.

So even if Donald Trump wins in the Iowa primary or caucus, it does make it hard for folks to get momentum. But New Hampshire is known to kind of push back and say, but we want and with this poll, six out of 10 New Hampshire in saying that they don't want to actually support Donald Trump, I do think it gives opportunity for folks if they can stay in the race that long.",
