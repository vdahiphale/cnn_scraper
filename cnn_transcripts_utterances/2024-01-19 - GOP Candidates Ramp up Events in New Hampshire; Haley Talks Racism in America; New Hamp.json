He has a few events. He really hasn't been competing aggressively in this state, though. He went right to South Carolina after Iowa. He spent some time in Florida. He hasn't even hit 10 percent in most polls. So, it is effectively a one-on-one competition here in New Hampshire between former President Trump and Nikki Haley. That's exactly what her campaign wanted it to be. And when you look at their strategy, one of the thing that they're trying to do is reach out to independent voters here in New Hampshire. They make up almost 40 percent of the electorate. So, it could be key to her success here. Of course, not all of those folks are going to vote for her, but it's a big bucket of voters in New Hampshire. And they are a group that she is targeted. The other thing that Nikki Haley is doing is really stepping up her attacks against Trump a little bit more aggressively here in New Hampshire than she has been doing throughout the course of her campaign. She said to his allegation that she could never win the Republican nomination. Responded to that last night by saying, then why is he going after her with all of these million dollars in ads in New Hampshire? And she's also trying to tie him in more directly with President Biden, saying, why would voters want two folks running for president who are in their 80s. Listen to what she told CNN's Jake Tapper during that town hall last night.

That's what she's relying upon. And, of course, Donald Trump is attacking her for that, you know, relying on non-Republicans to try to tilt the primary. So, I think it's advantage Trump. But, obviously, Haley wanted this essentially a head-to-head race, and she's got it. And, you know, we'll see what she can do with it. I'm dubious. I think it's a long shot. But if -- there won't be any more fertile ground for her than this particular electorate right here. SIDNER: Yes, this is where she has really made a name for herself, at least in New Hampshire. I do want to talk about this. Racism is playing a real and present role in this battle, mostly because of Nikki Haley's two takes on race in this country.

I was a brown girl that grew up in a small, rural town. We had plenty of racism that we had to deal with. But my parents never said we lived in a racist country.

You can acknowledge the long road and the long journey we've been on, but also embrace, you know, the absolute greatness of the United States today and say, we are miles better than we were.

And so I don't - I don't know why this has become such a difficult thing.Also, she's a Republican. And one of the reasons I'm a Republican is because I come from Kentucky, the land of Abraham Lincoln. And I am enormously proud of my party's history in trying to rescue the United States from its original sin. And I think if I were running for president as a Republican, I would lean on his values and legacy and his name every single day. So, that's what I - that's what I'd like to hear more out of is acknowledgment, leaning into the tradition of what it means at least to me to be a Republican, but also leaning into the greatness of the United States and her people. I agree with her, I don't think the United States is a racist country today, but certainly you can acknowledge we've been through extraordinarily difficult periods that were extremely violent and hurtful to large swaths of people throughout periods in this country's history.",
