But those residents in Las Vegas and around a lot of the West really feel other than the Desert Southwest in Arizona. This came on quite suddenly. I'll give you an example. There in Las Vegas. June 30 was the first time they reached 100 degrees. That was just about what, two weeks ago. That was the latest on record that they had ever reached 100.It hasn't looked back since. It's been 105, 110 plus, and I guess you know, in Las Vegas, your luck can change just that fast and it certainly has and hundred plus possible records today. Las Vegas, Phoenix is another one that could get there today. Also Austin in Texas. And these are record high temperatures. But also record high, low temperatures. And that's really where things can get dangerous when it doesn't cool off at night. And we're seeing that in a lot of these locations. Phoenix, we've talked about 117, that record is 15 days, and counting today will be the 16th, and tomorrow the 17th for sure. You know sometimes the meteorologists can be wrong about those things but not this time. The heat is not going anywhere, anytime soon. We are looking -- at because it's going this is 110 and above, it's going to fly passed that and -- and certainly reach that 18 days will be the longest on record.

In fact, most of these strikes are going to be when new markets open up, and there's new money available. Likewise, in the 1980s, there were strikes as we were entering the era of pay TV, and most importantly, home video. So in some ways, maybe this is similar in the early 2020s. Here, they're striking over this new things streaming. And the -- in this case, the -- the actors and writers want their share of streaming. But there's some big differences, though, right now that make this quite different from the previous strikes. In those previous strikes, they were striking over something very hardand specific that they could quantify. In other words, you could count the box office of a film and how -- know how well, it does. You can look at the Nielsen ratings to see how good a TV show does. And you can count unit sales to see how good your DVD or BluRay is selling. But with streaming, it's different because streaming is not sold program by program. What the streamers are doing is selling monthly subscriptions, not box office tickets. And well, the streamers know exactly how many people are streaming different things and what each individual is streaming. This is proprietary information to them that they don't want to get out. In fact, in some ways, it's their secret sauce, it's the secret of their success, their data, as to who's watching what it allows them to shape, what's coming up in the future for these audiences. And so the management is very reluctant to open it's, you know, computers to allow folks to see what's going on really with the streaming services. So that's one big difference today.

These were motion picture Hollywood lifers. People who were born in the business, worked their whole lives in the business, dying in the business. They were connected to it.Management is a different thing today in the 2020s, These streamers are not folks that began necessarily in Hollywood. And in many ways for companies like Amazon, maybe in Apple, what goes on in Hollywood is just a tiny percentage of their business. And I don't think there's any kind of kind of dedication amongst management today to preserving that entity called Hollywood.",

I want to get your thoughts on this, because we heard what the union said that was the proposal from the producers. They came out with a statement after that, that said that, \"The current MPTP proposal only permits a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed. Any other use requires the background actors consent and bargaining for the use subject to a minimum payment.\" So that's where they are there.But as it relates to the threat that this presents to actors, this seems like it could be fundamental as they talk about, you know, not just the residuals of getting paid when something airs again, for some of those top line talent.

On the front lines themselves, though, it is a very different story. Even senior Ukrainian officials will tell you it is a slog, it is very slow. There have been some bright spots around Bakhmut. For instance, the Ukrainian say that they are making some inroads there but no major breakthroughs. And because of that analysts say that frankly, it is pretty difficult to figure out who has -- who has the momentum who's really winning this war. Attrition is maybe a good word to describe what's happening here, meaning that both sides are reporting, hitting enemy troops, hitting enemy equipment, but neither side really able to make a major breakthrough. Obviously, if it is purely a numbers game, Russia has the advantage, but Ukraine may have an advantage when it comes to training equipment, and you have to imagine they're more motivated as well.",

This is so interesting. So can you explain to us first how the star began forming and what the image tells us about stars? DR. JANE RIGBY, NASA ASTROPHYSICIST: Sure, so this is the closest place in our own galaxy to us where stars are forming. Right. So this is the -- this is a nursery. This is a set of about 50 baby stars and newly born stars. That one in the bottom right is already formed. It's lit up, and it's actually lighting up its own stellar nursery.

We live in a galaxy, we live on a planet, we go around the star. What Webb is giving us this new is a perspective that is sharper, that is clear, that sees further back in time, that sees the parts of the universe that have just been invisible to us. Because if you look with your eyes, or even with Hubble, at this part of the sky, all you see is black, you can't see any of this. It's just too hidden by dust.
