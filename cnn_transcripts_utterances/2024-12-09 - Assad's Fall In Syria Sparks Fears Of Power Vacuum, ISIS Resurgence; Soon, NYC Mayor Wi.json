What's the latest that you're hearing after this person was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, believed to potentially be connected to this case. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, just, literally, a few minutes ago, Altoona police announced that they had taken an individual into custody because of a 911 call coming from a McDonald's from an employee. She told police that there was an individual there who fit the description of the person who was pictured in those fliers from New York City as someone suspected in that murder. Police responded. They engaged with the individual who was in McDonald's. Upon questioning him and going through his things. They allegedly found a gun with a silencer, some documents that are being examined that relate to the health care industry, dissatisfaction about capitalism, profiteering, and references to violence. And he is being held. NYPD detectives are in route if they are not there already. And we are waiting for the mayor, the police commissioner, the chief of detectives and others to give us a briefing on how all this came to pass and whether or not he will be charged in this New York case. Which will be something that the district attorney of Manhattan will have to work through, based on the evidence that they get from the police in Pennsylvania and how that and evidence from this individual may match to the evidence recovered from this crime scene last Wednesday in this incredible, brazen murder of one of the nation's top executives.",

He has been identified as Luigi Nicholas Mangione. He is a male, 26 years old. He was born and raised in Maryland. We know he has he has ties to San Francisco, California. And his last known address was Honolulu, Hawaii. He has no prior arrest history in New York. Members of the NYPD Detective Bureau are currently traveling to Pennsylvania with members of the Manhattan district attorney's office to interview this subject. This case was brought to a successful conclusion based on the coordinated effort between numerous NYPD units, including the Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureau, our federal partners at the FBI, the Manhattan district attorney's office and, of course, members of the Altoona Police Department in Pennsylvania. On Thursday, one day after this crime was committed, the NYPD released a photo of the shooter in this case. This picture was obtained by the NYPD during one of their extensive video canvasses. We took that photograph and we asked for the public's help in identifying the subject and the public responded. Hundreds of tips began to pour into our hotline. Each tip was investigated thoroughly and we began to release additional photographs as they came into our possession. The NYPD provided these photos to numerous media outlets. Local, national and international outlets released the photo via television, print, social media and online content. Luckily, a citizen in Pennsylvania recognized our subject and called local law enforcement. Members of the Altoona Police Department responded to the call. And based on their investigation, they notified the NYPD. This investigation is still active and ongoing. Thank you very much.",
