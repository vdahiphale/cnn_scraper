And that that dramatic video of the kidnapping was taken at about 11:45. And that in between that time, the Americans were lost. They were trying to find the doctor's office where one of the Americans was supposed to get a medical procedure. Now, in that dramatic video, you see how they are dragged and put into the bed of a pickup truck. Now, police at that point really didn't issue a statement. That video actually circulated in Mexican news outlets throughout Friday and there was really no statement issued by police at that point in time in Mexico. Now, on Saturday, one of the friends of Latavia Washington McGee reported this to the police. On Sunday, a family member watched that dramatic video and started asking questions. On Sunday, actually, the FBI issued its first statement. And overnight, on Monday, that's when it became international news. Abby, it was on Tuesday, following a tip, according to Mexican authorities, that they actually followed this tip that they received that led them to a Wooden house in the outskirts of Matamoros where they actually found the Americans. And like you mentioned, tragically two of them dead, the other two survived.",

DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENTthat these four were friends who grew up together in a small town. They have been lifelong friends. Two of them survived and two of them did not. And that is breaking all of these families. I spoke with the mother of Latavia Washington McGee this morning. And she said that she is absolutely elated that her daughter is coming home, she believes as early as today. But she is devastated that her nephew, Shaeed Woodard, who she raised as a son for the teen years of his life after she tells me his mother died, and then Zindell Brown, who she said was also like a kid to her - they all grew up together - did not make it. Now, she spoke with her daughter yesterday. She said that Latavia McGee was crying and upset on the phone while she was in the hospital and recounted exactly what happened and what she experienced to her mother. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But in private messages, he said, quote: \"We are very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait. I hate him passionately.\" \"We are all pretending we have a lot to show for us, because admitting what a disaster it's been, is too tough to digest. But, come on, there isn't really an upside to Trump.\" In previous released messages, Carlson wrote, quote: \"He is a demonic force, a destroyer. But he's not going to destroy us. I've been thinking about this every day for four years.\" Now, this is the same Tucker Carlson who still pals around with Trump, who, right now, is selectively airing footage from the capitol insurrection in an attempt to exonerate the former president. So let's bring in CNN's senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy. So, Oliver, Tucker Carlson is not alone in any of this. Even Rupert Murdoch himself admitted that the network went too far in pushing Trump's lies. It's so interesting to me to see and hear the disdain for Trump in these messages, while on air, the commentary, the entire network is so sycophantic.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby. This trove of messages has really just exposed these people as total frauds. Right?They say one thing on air when the cameras are on to their audience and, behind the scenes, the person they have been cheerleading for years and years they trash them. They call them in very harsh terms. I mean, in these Text messages, as you just read, Tucker Carlson sounds more like an MSNBC host than a FOX News host. This is something, if someone else were saying this, if someone else had the courage to go on camera and say these truths about the president, Tucker Carlson and other FOX News hosts would attack them. But in private, they're saying these things. Separately, Rupert Murdoch, the FOX chairman, acknowledges behind the scenes or at least in his deposition here that some of his hosts went too far. I want to read you part of an email that he had sent to Suzanne Scott. He says about election lies, \"Maybe Sean and Laura went too far. Oh, very well for Sean to tell you he was in despair about Trump. But what did he tell his viewers?\" And that really gets to the heart of this thing. Because, again, in front of the cameras these hosts were saying one thing. But behind the scenes, everyone knew the truth. They just didn't share it with their viewers.",
