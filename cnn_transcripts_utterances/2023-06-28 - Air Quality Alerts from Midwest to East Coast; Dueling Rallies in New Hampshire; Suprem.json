Chicago is currently the third most polluted city in the world. Here's a live look at the windy city, along with Detroit and Milwaukee. Air quality alerts have been issued for seven states, including Illinois, Michigan and Maryland, as well as partial parts of states, including Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Let's go our meteorologist Jennifer Grey. It was so surreal to experience here in New York City a few weeks ago, and people are feeling it across the country again.",

You can see all the red and purple dots. These indicate unhealthy to very unhealthy. At one point yesterday Chicago did have the worst air quality in the world.So, this is all going to sink down to the south. We have poor air quality alerts in all of the states, as you just mentioned. You can see those yellows and oranges. So, the smoke is really going to be bad for one more day and then start to dissipate. So, that's the good news. But look how far south it's sinking, all the way down into portions of the mid-south, the southeast, could have some hazy skies but definitely improving by the time we get to tomorrow. We also have excessive heat warnings, heat advisories in effect with a dangerous heat across portions of the south where the feels like temperature today could be anywhere between 110 and 115 for a lot of areas across the deep south. We are going to stay in the triple digits for portions of Texas, Louisiana, on into the southeast, as that heat expands, Poppy.",

But first, we want to warn you that you might find this next video disturbing. As you watch, you can see an officer pointing his gun through the window before a gunshot is heard. Then the car takes off and crashes. The officer, accused of shooting the teen, has been detained on suspicion of culpable homicide. Two passengers were in the car at the time of the shooting. One fled while the other was arrested and later released.Now, the shooting has triggered violent protests, cars and trash cans set on fire, bus stops destroyed. Demonstrators also set off fireworks near the police station. Riot police used tear gas to break up protesters and about 31 people have been arrested. Well, Trump and DeSantis, they have held dueling events in New Hampshire. It didn't take long for the jabs.

In North Carolina the question was, was this redistricting map fair or was it a partisan gerrymander that impinged on voters' rights? We're going to have many cases in 2024, just as we had in 2020, about fairness at the ballot box. And it comes down to who actually will oversee that. And as you said, this case tested whether state legislatures would have complete, independent control, over those rules or whether state court judges interpreting the protections of their own state constitutions could decide - could review those. And what the Supreme Court ruled is that state courts have a duty here. Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to the history and tradition ofjudicial review, not just at the federal level, dating all the way back to Marbury versus Madison, but at the state court level, saying federal courts must not abandon their duty to exercise judicial review. When state legislatures act pursuant to their election clause authority, they engage in lawmaking subject to typical constraints on the exercise of state power -- such power. So, Poppy, this was a really important decision that actually plays right to what our democracy has always practiced. It was that this very extreme theory had been put forward in 2020 and it was a chance that could it actually -- it could actually affect what happened in 2024.

Legislatures, of course, every state has them. And that state legislatures, you're elected by the public. As a result of that, those state legislatures, certainly you want them to make important decisions. But you want them making decisions within the confines of the law.And what this opinion essentially said was that the state legislature should not have unfettered discretion to do what it wants with respect to the electoral process, and it has to be checked, right, by the state court system. Why should we be in a scenario where we have the state legislature making a decision that cannot otherwise -- it would be immunized, right? It would be immunized from all attack. And so essentially what's going to happen now is that if they overstep, Phil and Poppy, you're going to have the state courts that can now come in and they could otherwise assess that misstep and they can right the wrong.

And what Professional Hassan and others have suggested is, maybe this might give, frankly, federal courts and the Supreme Court itself free reign. What the opinion said is that state court themselves cannot go beyondthe ordinary bounds of their judicial roles, but the people who will be deciding that will be federal court judges and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.
