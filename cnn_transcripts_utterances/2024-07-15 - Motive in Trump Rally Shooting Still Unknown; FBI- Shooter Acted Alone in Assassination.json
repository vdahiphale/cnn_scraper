Appreciate your company.Now, just one day after surviving an assassination attempt, former U.S. President Donald Trump is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the Republican National Convention is set to kick off in the hours ahead. In a new interview, Trump says he's rewritten his speech for the convention to focus on unity following the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania, saying he believes this is a chance to bring the country together. And despite the shocking violence over the weekend, the Secret Service says there are no plans to tighten existing security at the convention. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AUDREY GIBSON-CICCHINO, U.S. SECRET SERVICE RNC COORDINATOR: So, we are confident in the security plans that are in place for this event, and we are ready to go. It's been an 18-month process. It's the -- we've worked together over that 18 months to develop operational security plans for any and all aspects of security related to this event. We're not anticipating any changes to our operational security plans for this event. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He said he felt history would judge that moment, and he had to let everyone know that he was OK. Now CNN has obtained new video of the gunman positioned on the roof near the Trump rally on Saturday. The shooter can be seen before the shots are fired and panic breaks out. A warning: the images and sounds might disturb some viewers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROSSTALK)",

An agent or law enforcement officer is trained to see threats where others may not. And they are also trained to act swiftly and decisively in a manner that will neutralize the threat before it's too late. But here's the thing. If somebody immediately outside of a designated security venue, as I think was the case here, is seen with a gun or if they're simply acting unusual or out of character, Secret Service agents and authorized law enforcement officials are justified -- in fact, they're obligated -- to stop the person, disarm them if they are armed, and hold them for questioning. If the person refuses to lower or hand over the weapon, and the agent believes there is imminent danger to himself or others, he or she may use only that force which is reasonably necessary to neutralize the situation. However, only the law enforcement official at the scene can determine when they have exhausted all reasonable options. And in this recent case, this weekend, based on available facts, the officer who first spotted the shooter with the weapon, in my opinion, was justified to take immediate action to engage and neutralize the threat.",

What -- what are the risks that this won't cool the rhetoric, that it could be not the end, but the start of more tension? HEDDELL: Well, first of all, I think it's good that the president and former President Trump appear to be moving toward a little calmer campaign where the -- where statements aren't made that might motivate someone to do something bad like what happened this weekend. We don't know why the person did that. But there's a lot of speculation that they're simply reacting to what they're hearing in the media and so on. But look, this kind of thing is always a threat, potential threat for the Secret Service. They know the names of certain people throughout the United States who are dangerous. Some people that are in foreign countries. And so, when a president travels to a city where those people might be, then the Secret Service neutralizes that threat by -- by watching that person, by being with them, by you know, doing anything that will keep them from going to the site. If that person has weapons, then the Secret Service becomes extra concerned, because it's obvious, of course, that they don't want weapons, by anybody, brought into the venue. And people -- in this case, the person was outside of the venue. But look, the person, from what I have heard, was acting out of character, was acting strange.

And they have ways of identifying people who do that. And -- and there have been cases where people have been identified who would have been dangerous to the Secret Service and have been. But -- but -- but here's the thing you're missing on this on this one point about what happened this weekend. When the Secret Service designates an area or a venue to be protected by the Secret Service, such as this venue was, that also includes areas outside of the venue where the Secret Service may have line of sight to a building, as it was the case here. So, anything that happens inside or outside of that venue is -- is the responsibility of law enforcement to address, and they can address it as a part of the security venue. Not -- certainly, there may be people in a state that are authorized to carry weapons out in the open.

And probably, what's going to be lost are the references to Adolf Hitler. And there have been a lot of them. And of course, Trump himself said, \"I want to be a dictator on day one.\" I don't know what was supposed to happen on day two, but he said these things himself, and he is clearly authoritarian. But we're going to lose the Hitler part of it. I think that is probably a permanent loss for the Democrats. And they have to be more careful in their rhetoric.

This is the time to take a step back and be unified. And we're seeing how Donald Trump is really echoing that message.

Mills explain how the chaotic scene unfolded as he was capturing photographs of Trump by the podium, when he heard the gunshots. Our Kaitlan Collins spoke to Mills earlier. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOUG MILLS, PHOTOGRAPHER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": I guess I was, you know, trying to put him between the flag and the podium and photographing there. And then when he kind of gestured to his right, and I heard the pops -- you know, I don't have a gun, so I don't know what an AR-15 sounds like. Never heard one. At first, I thought it was like a motorcycle or some sort of machinery. And then, when I saw him grab his ear and he kind of winced and then immediately went down, I thought, oh, my God, he's been shot. Because I mean, I get chills saying it now, and it will do so much adrenaline going on then. And once he went down, my first reaction was to run around to the side and try and get a picture of him down on the ground. And by that time I got there, he was completely covered by the Secret Service agents that are on his detail and, you know, all the staff is yelling. The Secret Service is yelling at me, yelling at all the other photographers. There were four of us in the buffer zone, as you know. And it was pretty chaotic, and they just kept yelling, \"Get down. Active shooter. Get down, get down, get down.\" And I probably didn't do the safest thing, because I reacted and went straight to the stage and started shooting, just you know, taking pictures, just like a lot of the other photographers.

Yet at the same time, this is a topic that is, you know, firing up on social media. It's also a big part of coverage in state media, which you can argue is essentially a messenger service for the Chinese government. So, these remarks by President Biden talking about foreign actors fanning the flames, this all intersects, especially when it comes to China. Let me show you some examples that we are seeing so far in Chinese state media. First, I want to show you an editorial from \"China Daily.\" It's an English publication by Chinese state media. The headline reading \"Trump Incident Reflects U.S. Polarized Divisions.\" A commentary from Chinese state media to promote this theme of political discord in the United States. Another example from another publication, China's \"Global Times,\" also in English: \"Shooting at Trump Rally Shows Rising Political Violence as U.S. Divides Even Further.\" [00:55: Again, these are all tools for China to discredit the American political system to the world and, of course, to the Chinese population. And then we've been talking about the response that we have been seeing in Chinese social media, the chatter that has been lighting up. And we should point out that, in general, Chinese social media is heavily censored by the government, but in these recent hours, we are seeing in some remarks, particularly those that are showing the U.S. In a negative light, that are not necessarily filtered. In particular, we saw on Weibo, which is China's version of X or Twitter. One quote saying, \"What democracy and freedom? I now think elections in other countries are not so different from talent shows. The world is but a circus.\" A comment that, again, is discrediting the American political system. But we've also seen some more benign comments, someone calling the U.S. political system a house of cards. We've also seen remarks about gun violence in the United States and how this incident may actually bolster Donald Trump's chances in the election. Some people felt that he came across looking strong.
