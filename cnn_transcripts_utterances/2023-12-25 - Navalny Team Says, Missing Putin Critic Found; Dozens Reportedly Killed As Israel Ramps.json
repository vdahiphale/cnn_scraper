Opposition leader and chief Putin critic Alexey Navalny has been found after simply disappearing for two weeks.Now, the head of his anti-corruption foundation now says this morning that Navalny is now in a penal colony in the far reaches of Northwestern Siberia, thousands of miles from the penal colony in jail where he was last known to be located. He was moved from a detention center near Moscow, where he was serving a 19-year sentence. CNN's Nada Bashir is following these developments for us. Nada, what is Navalny's team saying about this move, how he is, whatever they've been able to gather?",

As you mentioned, he has been moved, according to his lawyer and, of course, colleagues, to that new penal colony, described as the Polar Wolf colony in Northwestern Siberia.There has been mounting concern around the conditions faced by Navalny, his team unable to make contact with him for over two weeks now, raising concern for many. We have had updates today from his lawyers, as well as the director of his anti-corruption foundation, who issued this statement just a short while ago, saying, Navalny is in colony IK-3 in Kharp called Polar Wolf, one of the northern most remote colonies. The conditions there are harsh with a special regime in the permafrost zone. It is very difficult to get there and there are no letter delivery systems. And, of course, as we understand it from his lawyer, he has faced difficult health conditions over the last few months. There is concern that this could deteriorate in this new colony, where he has been moving. Of course, there are always concerns when those who are detained are moved between these colonies. As you mentioned, Alexey Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison back in August for charges relating to extremism. And he had already been serving 11.5 years in prison for other charges, including fraud. These are charges that Alexey Navalny and his legal team, as well as his supporters, have consistently denied. They believe these charges are politically motivated. Navalny is, of course, a key and fundamental critic of President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin overall, and has posed one of the largest challenges to Putin during his rule, and continues to pose a significant challenge. So, as you can imagine, there is significant concern over what Navalny may face in this new colony.",

We're going to be looking to see if we can gather more throughout the morning.Let's turn now to Gaza, where Israel is promising to intensify its ground operations. This follows one of the enclave's deadliest nights in the 11-week-old battle between Israel and Hamas. The Hamas- controlled health ministry says at least 70 people were killed after what they say was an Israeli attack. This occurred at a refugee camp in Central Gaza. The IDF says they are reviewing the claim. In the meantime, in the West Bank, there are subdued celebrations on this Christmas morning. Local leaders have canceled Christmas festivities in Bethlehem to show solidarity with the people of Gaza. And in place of the traditional Christmas tree in Bethlehem's major square, this year, an art installation depicting Mary and Jesus surrounded by a scene of a bombing. Let's go to CNN's Will Ripley. He's in Tel Aviv following all of this. And, Will, 15 IDF soldiers were killed this weekend in operations in Gaza. There's a lot of developments here. What are you learning about the intensifying operation in Gaza right now?",

And in Moscow, that doesn't mean the same things it means in other places. It means that Putin takes the opportunity before re-coronating himself as president to crack down on political dissent and to put out some sort of message that makes him look domestically like he's a responsible leader wants to end the war, but it's a ruse.In other words, this is a common Putin tactic to put out that he wants to ceasefire. It has the effect of modifying his domestic opposition but it also has the effect of dividing us, of playing upon the divisions inside western societies in exacerbating the feeling among some of the west that maybe Ukraine is the problem, that maybe Putin is the peacemaker. It's not true. And the way that we know it's not true is that Putin is actually increasing his aggression, attacking Ukrainian infrastructure, advancing his war in Ukraine's east. And this is such a common Putin tactic that I would actually be surprised if he didn't try to sort of offer a ceasefire on terrible terms that he knew the Ukrainians except at the right time.

And yesterday on Christmas Eve, he sent a flurry of social media posts railing against this latest legal battle and also reiterating his team's claims that he is immune from these charges because they stem from his actions while he was still in the White House.Now, in one social media post in particular, Trump denied any wrongdoing, and he also argued that it was his duty as president to look into and investigate potential claims of fraud. Now, I'm going to read you some of that he wrote. Quote, I was doing my duty as president to expose and further investigate a rigged and stolen election. It was my obligation to do so. The post continues, of course, I am entitled to immunity. Additionally, I did nothing wrong. Stop the witch hunt now. So, Sara, this is a very typical post from Donald Trump. He's saying he did nothing wrong. He's continuing to rail against these charges, claim that he is immune from them because he was president at the time, and also paint himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and political persecution. But I think big picture here, what I find really interesting about this appeal is it's very strategic. Donald Trump and his team, regardless of the outcome in this case and whether it could have a very significant impact on the viability of this case, but also if it's delayed or postponed further into the height of election season or potentially if Trump gets his way until after the 2024 election. And at that point, Donald Trump could say, drop the charges, I'm president now.",

But you also have to weave that into a broader message of here's where we've been as a country, here's where we are now, and here's where we're going, both in terms of the opponent, in terms of foreign policy, in terms of domestic successes and domestic losses, and they're not doing that.

But that is where Biden feels like the message is the strongest. That's where he feels like he's got a lot to celebrate from his first four years in office but that's what isn't necessarily paying off for him in the polls. So, that's a place where they're really trying to find a message that resonates again with all segments of his coalition, especially as a lot of those economic indicators look really good for the Biden administration. We're talking about gas prices going down, grocery prices stabilizing, the Fed even considering in 2024 cutting interest rates because inflation is cooling down. All of that should bode well for President Biden, but he's not seeing it yet in the polls. I think that's something that they're really going to try to drive home.",
