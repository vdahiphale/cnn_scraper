We will bring you that speech live when it happens, first up to our breaking news this hour. And homes destroyed, roads underwater and fears that the number of casualties could rapidly rise. We begin with one of the largest storms to hit the Gulf of Mexico in the past century. Tropical storm Helene is headed north, battering Georgia after making landfall in Florida earlier as a Category 4 hurricane. Winds associated with Helene were estimated at 140 miles an hour, and with those winds devastating storm surge. You are looking at images of entire homes floating away in one Florida community. And here a Florida home on fire as emergency workers search for stranded residents. Now we know that at least five people have been killed, including a four-year-old in North Carolina, more than 3 million buildings are without power in the State of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Southern Virginia. And weather watches and warnings are in place for 60 million people across 12 states. Well, this video from Pinellas County, Florida, shows one house dealing with dual emergencies. Crews out in boats during rescues in a neighborhood underwater, waded through flood waters and came up on this a house flooded by hurricane Helene, engulfed in flames. Rescuers had to dodge large objects floating in floodwaters, including dumpsters, in order to reach storm victims. CNN's Carlos Suarez was in Pinellas County ahead of Helene making landfall. He is now in St Petersburg, Florida. Just explain to us what has been going on in this past, what 18, 24 hours.",

Overnight, the cut and toss operations began at 03:00 a.m. with the Florida Department of Transportation, and they have been able to clear a lot of a lot of miles of roadway, over 2000 miles just since the wee hours of the morning. I-10 is open and passable, but please drive with caution. I-75 north to Georgia is clear and passable, and FDOT Cut and Toss crews are pushing southward on I-75 currently in Tampa Bay, the Sunshine Skyway, Gandy, Courtney Campbell and Howard Franklin bridges are still closed at the moment, at first light bridge inspections began. There are reports of some mapping applications not marking those bridges as closed, but as of right now, please choose alternative routes. Those bridges are going to be inspected and open in due time. And I know Jared and his team are working really hard to do that. The Sunshine Skyway is open to first responders and emergency personnel. Please listen to local law enforcement's directive on that in Southwest Florida, Sanibel causeway had a washout that's currently being repaired by FDOT, and we expect that to be OK relatively soon. 470 crews are active in the field, and as I mentioned, have cleared over 2000 miles of roadway. And this was starting at 03:00 a.m., so they were ready to go, and it's made a difference. 129 bridge inspectors have been dispatched at first light, and they are currently inspecting the bridges in the impacted areas. Airports falling airports have suspended service, but are anticipated to resume operations at some point today. Tallahassee, Tampa International, St Pete Clearwater International, Lakeland Linder International, Gainesville regional, some flight cancelations or delays are being reported. Just check with your airlines directly on specific flight updates. Florida Fish and Wildlife has boat teams in Dixie and Taylor counties actively conducting search and rescue. These are basically the ground zero of the storm. An additional team of 72 staff are enroute to Taylor, Dixie and Levy with shallow water boats. Florida Fish and Wildlife has a boat team of 15 going through Franklin and Wakulla counties to assess storm damage from Hernando to Lee. FWC has 145 local officers that are responding, an additional 15-man air boat team that are coming over to the West Coast of Florida from Titusville.

We are keeping a keen eye on what is going on inNew York this hour at the United Nations, where Israel's Prime minister is expected to speak later this hour at the General Assembly. Ahead of that Benjamin Netanyahu's office is saying it quote, shares the aims, end quote, of a U.S. led plan for calling for a ceasefire across the Israeli-Lebanese border. Now the U.S., France and other allies have unveiled a blueprint for a 21-day truce. It was formed on the sidelines of the U.N.'s New York gathering this week. For his part, Lebanon's Foreign Minister is calling for an immediate ceasefire. He is warning that the crisis threatens all of this region. Well, Lebanese health officials back home report more than 600 people killed in Israel's latest offensive. The Health Minister Firass Abiad sat down with my colleague, Jomana Karadsheh, saying it is imperative for the international community to get Israel to agree to a ceasefire. Here is more of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. FIRASS ABIAD, LEBANESE HEALTH MINISTER: I think we are in full-fledged war. There is no doubt about that. And you know, irrespective of what you know, call it, you know, we have civilians, innocent people, women, children, being indiscriminately attacked, targeted. We have, you know, residential buildings being blown to smithereens. We have, you know, hospitals, ambulances, primary Health Care Centers being targeted. This is war. There's no doubt about that.",

Of course, he's speaking of the North of Israel there and return those who left the safety of their homes, speaking about 60 or 70,000 odd Israelis who have been displaced from that those northern communities, that does not suggest that this is going to stop any time soon, getting those people back to their homes will mean ensuring that, as far as the Israelis are concerned, Hezbollah is not a threat to those communities. So, this certainly from the Israeli side, does not sound as if it is going to stop any time soon. Just how significant could this be consequential? Could this be if it continues?",

Already, we've seen this massive displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and there's just a we've seen looks like an Israeli strike on the horizon behind me. Maybe I'll just, we're going to zoom in on it anyway. Yes, I mean, it could be much, much worse. OK, now we hear the sound, so that is definitely several kilometers away. But I mean, the worst-case scenario is absolutely catastrophic for all of Lebanon, but particularly the south, which suffered so much in 2006 and then just since Monday, has just taken an utter beating in terms of the death toll, in terms of the amount of destruction that has happened, Becky.",

Look, Ben, thank you for the time being. I want to bring in Alex Marquardt, who is in New York, and you are there, anticipating in about 20 minutes or so from now, a speech from Benjamin Netanyahu.

It's always a pleasure, sir, thank you very much indeed. Look, I want to get back before we get to that speech by Netanyahu. I want to get back to what is this massive storm event still unfolding in the United States on the East Coast. Helene was the strongest hurricane on record to hit Florida's Big Bend region in Levy County, Florida. The Emergency Management Office was forced to suspend responding to calls across the entire county, and it's turned roads into water in Atlanta, in Georgia. Well in the Western part of North Carolina, there are emergency declarations for flash flooding, including in the city of Asheville, the weather service urging people in Haywood County, for example, to move to higher ground for their own safety if they can, as streams are rising and landslides are possible. Joining us from Asheville is CNN's Isabel Rosales, I mean, this is really serious stuff. I know that you've been speaking to authorities. You've also been speaking to people in the area.

Let's get the very latest from ourMeteorologist Allison Chinchar, who is at the World Weather Center. Let's just get your map up and chart where this storm is at the moment, because it seems to be sort of barreling up that East Coast, but its impact is absolutely huge and continues to be so.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Becky, we were worried even before this made landfall, this was a storm that was very large in size,which meant it was going to impact a lot of people, and even after it's moved inland, that sheer size of this is still impacting numerous states. You can see we're finally starting to see an end to some of that rain in and around the Atlanta area, but western North Carolina, where Isabel is located, they're still going to be dealing with heavy rain for at least another hour, possibly even a few hours after that, more rain spreading into Tennessee and Kentucky, and that's even just the heavier bands. Now, we also still have several tornado warnings in effect across portions of North and South Carolina, that could continue through the afternoon as well. But the wide, the most widespread concern certainly is going to be the flooding. All of these areas you see here in green, that's a flood watch, meaning the conditions are possible for flooding as we go through the day today. The red areas are where flooding is occurring. It is ongoing actively. These white shaded boxes, that is a flash flood emergency. That is the highest possible alert level you can get for flooding. We have some of those in and around the Atlanta area. Two of them that it does include the Atlanta airport, so any flights that may be in there, you definitely need to check for some delays and cancellations. And then this is a look at Western North Carolina. I mean, almost the entire portion of Western North Carolina is under some level of a flash flood emergency, and that does include the City of Asheville. The concern here is that it's still getting additional rainfall on top of what they've already seen. A lot of this area has picked up a foot of rain, and now we're still going to be adding at least another inch or two on top of that. Winds in some areas are starting to die back down. But in other areas, they're ticking right back up. You've got about 50 mile per hour gust in Columbia. Same thing in Charlotte, North Carolina, still looking at about 40 mile per hour gust in Atlanta. Same thing for Charleston and Myrtle Beach. The rain will end first, the winds take a little bit longer, so it's going to be several more hours, even after the rain stops, before those winds finally calm back down, and the concern there is the potential for any trees and power lines to come down. Perry, Florida, that is near where landfall took place, looking at a wind measurement of 99 miles per hour. But now let's take a look at this, Douglas, Georgia, that is more than 90 miles away from the coast. This is not a beach city. They are inland, well inland, and they also had a 90 mile per hour wind. And that's been the big concern, and that's what's also been leading to such a significant amount of power outages. You're looking at roughly 4 million people on that are without power right now in Florida, Georgia and both North and South Carolina. And these numbers are actually expected to go up, even though some of the rain is ending, especially in Florida and portions of Georgia, it's going to take time. Some of those folks in Florida may be without power for days before they can get it back on. The rainfall amounts are starting to come in. We've had numerous reports of over a foot of rainfall. Some of these areas are done. Others are still expecting another one to two inches on top of it. That's why you have the concern for flooding. This entire area has the potential for flooding. The greatest threat is obviously going to be in the red shaded areas, and that pink, which does include the City of Asheville, that pink is what we call a high risk. They are very rare. They only occur about 4 percent of the time, but they account for 40 percent of the fatalities and 80 percent of the of the damages, Becky, so again, very significant event unfolding right now across several states here.",
