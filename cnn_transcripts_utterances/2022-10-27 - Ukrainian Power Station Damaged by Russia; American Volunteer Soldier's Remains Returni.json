Russia amping up its efforts to deprive Ukrainian civilians of the very basics needed to survive. Officials are saying that Russia used Iranian made drones overnight to attack the power grid. People in and around Kyiv are being warned of severe outages to keep the grid from overloading and causing a complete blackout. CNN got exclusive access to this Ukrainian power station incapacitated by Russia. Officials with the United Nations tell CNN these attacks on Ukraine's energy sites have led to, quote, \"deep suffering that could get worse as winter sets in.\" They are especially worried about people who live near the front lines. Many of them are, elderly, disabled or chronically ill. CNN's Nic Robertson visited the disabled power station, which CNN is not identifying for safety purposes.

Indeed, just as we arrived, here the sirens were going off. We immediately went into the bunker, where a lot the other workers from here, dozens of people in an underground bunker. But it is kind of normal here. I was speaking to one of the workers. He said we're getting used to. This we spent hours every day stuck down here. They've got internet and they can message with their families. One guy was playing chess on his phone. So they are not cowed by the missiles that are coming. But it is preventing them doing the much needed repairs. We could really see the extent of the damage, buildings blown apart, drones and cruise missiles here hit here. They have been able to do some repairs and put up some of the pylons that have been knocked down, repair some of the building work. But there is critical infrastructure here that is really hard to replace, partly because it is not manufactured anymore. These plants are very old. So it is hard to get. And they are looking around the rest of the country, to try to find replacement spare parts, looking to international partners to find those spare parts. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think that advisor toPresident Zelenskyy that was saying the toughest battles still lie, ahead that certainly seems to reflect the reality on the ground. near Kherson as well. What we are getting from the Ukrainian soldiers who are on the front lines, they say the Russians are not withdrawing from that area but are in fact digging in even more than they have before and also reinforcing some of the positions that they have. They also, are -- this is one of things Ukrainian said -- are getting some of those new recruits as well. But they're also a lot of very able Russian soldiers down there. So Ukrainians do believe it will be a tough fight. In the Kherson region. For the south of the country. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Ukrainian forces trying to hit the Russians on all fronts. This motor unit firing in the north of the country, while in the south Kyiv his continuing a counter offensive trying to capture the Russian occupied city of Kherson. We met up with an artillery unit on the battlefield. (on camera):  The soldiers tell us there's firing going on here pretty much every day several times a day. The front line is not very far from where we are at all. It's a couple of kilometers in that direction. And right now, there's not very much movement on that front line but still, the situation is very dangerous. (voice-over):  Ukraine's defense minister says Kyiv's counter offensive here is complicated by wet weather in the area. But the commander says he believes in the end they will oust the Russians. \"BANDERAS,\" ARTILLERY COMMANDER:  I know one thing for sure, we will never step back from here. We have no other choice, only forward. Ukraine has to get back all its territory and borders. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  While Russia continues to mobilize 100s of 1000s for the war here, the Ukrainian say they found the Wagner private military company, founded by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin is sending Russian prisoners with diseases to the front line. The chief of Ukraine's military intelligence told CNN's Nic Robertson. GENERAL KYRYLO BUDANOV, CHIEF, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translator):  They put on them certain wristbands in blue, white or red color. Every color signifies tuberculosis, hepatitis or HIV. It's happening on a mass scale, most of them who are taken prisoners or their dead bodies, which were found in the battlefield had those wristbands. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  CNN can't independently verify those claims. As Russian forces continue to lose ground in Ukraine, the Kremlin conducting massive annual nuclear drills involving submarine launched ballistic missiles and others launched from Russia's fleet of strategic bombers. While the Russians notified the U.S. about the drills well in advance, Russian President Vladimir Putin with a clear warning to Washington. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  What they are trying to achieve we see on the example of Ukraine, which has become an instrument of American foreign policy. The country has practically lost sovereignty and is directly controlled from the United States. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But the Ukrainians on the front line say they are fighting for their own freedom, not for anybody else. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This as thousands of people gathered at Mahsa Amini's grave on Wednesday. To mark 40 days since her death in police custody. Meanwhile, ISIS is claiming responsibility for a deadly attack on a holy shrine in southern Iran. At least 15 people were killed and more than 40 injured when an attacker opened fire on worshippers. Iran's military is now saying protesters are complicit in that shrine attack. They are saying that without evidence. It has to be said. It's threatening a further crackdown. CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking the story for us. From London.

Of, course as you noted there, at least 15 people killed, according to state media in that attempt. Which they are blaming on foreign nationals. According to state, media that incident at the shrine yesterday in the southern city of Shiraz has been claimed by the Islamic State. The authorities there are accusing three individuals, allegedly foreign nationals, of opening fire on worshippers at the shrine on Wednesday evening, which is typically a very busy hour. At the shrine, for worshippers. But there is concern that this could essentially set the pretext for the regime to double down, intensifying their crackdown on protesters, as we have seen over the last six weeks. We have heard in the past from the Iranian authorities for the regime, accusing these protests of being an attempt by foreign meddlers and actors of trying to court instability and unrest in Iran. They've already charged more than 300 protesters, allegedly, for jeopardizing state security. And they've long, held, according to the regime, that this has been encouraged by the United States, by Israel and by other foreign actors. This could certainly play into that narrative. We've heard already from the Iranian armed forces issuing a statement. They have said that they believe that this was created as part of the protests we've seen over the last few weeks, to create insecurity and chaos. And that this terrorist, act as they've termed, it is part of this protest movement. We've already, heard also, from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, pledging to see a decisive response to this incident. So there are certainly concerns that we could see an intensification of that crackdown. We've already heard the concerns and the alarm bells being raised by human rights groups over that crackdown. We've seen the use of excessive and lethal force, including live fire ammunition and that has continued today. Becky.",
