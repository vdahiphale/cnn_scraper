A CNN exclusive sit-down with the US President Joe Biden saying no other president has his track record in turning around the economy. We have that for you. Plus, the US has paused the shipment of bombs to Israel amid concerns over its Rafah incursion. We will take you to Jerusalem. And AstraZeneca withdraws its game changing COVID-19 vaccine, citing low demand. Live from London, it is Wednesday, May the 8th. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, and of course, I, too mean business. A very good evening, everyone. Tonight, US President Joe Biden sits down for an exclusive interview with CNN as he tries to sell his economic achievements in the key battleground state of Wisconsin. Mr. Biden is in Wisconsin on a campaign stop. He announced a $3.3 billion investment from Microsoft to build an AI facility there. Former President Trump broke ground on an electronics factory on the same site in 2018 and that investment from Foxconn failed to truly materialize. This is an important context there for you. Well, President Biden used the fact, that very fat to draw a sharp contrast between himself and Trump during a speech. President Biden told CNN's Erin Burnett that US economy has already turned around. He says, most people are confident about their own finances even if they feel the country as a whole is troubling.

Real income, when you account for inflation, is actually down since you took office. Economic growth last week, far short of expectations.

He had promised that that whole creation would lead to some thousands of jobs being created, and unfortunately for this community, those big promises didn't actually materialize, and it ended up being a huge disappointment for this community.

So it just goes to show and is a reminder that the president and his campaign certainly recognize what an important group that is particularly in a state like Wisconsin, where all expectations are that it is going to be a very, very close race between Donald Trump and President Biden come November. Now, remember this is a state that Donald Trump won in 2016. President Biden won in 2020, but only by the slimmest of margins.

That Rafah Border Crossing is a lifeline for millions of Palestinians. It is also the only entry point in and out for humanitarian aid workers, for people who are getting medically evacuated from Gaza and then you have the hospitals in Rafah themselves. One, there were only three of partially functioning hospitals in Rafah when this military operation began. One of those hospitals, the Al-Najjar Hospital in Eastern Rafah has been forced to shut down, evacuating after the Israeli military dropped evacuation leaflets on Eastern Rafah, including where that hospital is located. And so the question now is, will this operation expand? And when could it potentially expand? The Israeli Prime Minister and his War Cabinet have continually said that a military operation in Rafah, a ground offensive in Rafah to take out Hamas entirely was in the offing, and while they have said they've given space to negotiations, they now arrived at a point where they've been willing to send troops and tanks into Eastern Rafah.

But it's really important that now they will also potentially be getting their money back. The company did say that it expects around 98 percent of its creditors to be paid back in full with interest. And so I think, you know, will customers be trusting FTX going forward?

It was a very crucial vaccine in the early stages of the pandemic, as we saw that gentleman Trevor. It was of course developed in partnership with Oxford University and he mentioned that. And it was very crucial for low-income some countries because AstraZeneca sold it at cost largely, only later making a small profit from some richer countries. But by then, sales had already started falling sharply. So I do think this is a competition issue and also worth bearing in mind that AstraZeneca came into this COVID-19 crisis with very little experience in vaccine development. It's known for its popular cancer drugs, in particular lung cancer treatment. So it was a bit of an outside player. It faced quite a bumpy ride. It came under fire from policymakers in the U.S. and Europe over mistakes in clinical trials, over data that it didn't fully disclose, over production delays, which meant that promised doses weren't delivered in Europe. But the company says that it is very proud of the role that its vaccine played in the pandemic.",

Now, on his first visit to Europe in five years, the Chinese president has been pushing back against claims over Beijing's support for Moscow in the Ukraine war.

Speaking on Ukraine in particular, Mr. Xi said China is neither the creator nor the crisis there nor a participant. Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have frayed since the start of the war with concerns over trade as well as China's wider ambitions. And tensions between China and the West have created an opportunity for countries like Vietnam. That is according to the country's largest asset manager. Vietnam's economy has grown dramatically over the last two decades. And that's despite challenges like corruption. Last month a real estate tycoon was sentenced to death over her role in a financial fraud case worth more than $12 billion.
