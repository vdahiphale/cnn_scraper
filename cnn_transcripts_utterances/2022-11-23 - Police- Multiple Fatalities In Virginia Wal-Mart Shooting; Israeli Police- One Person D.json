      "sentences": "Yes, Rosemary. Two things that I'm looking at right now are the method of the shooting. As you just mentioned, the reporting the CNN has that this appears to be either a current or former employee of this Wal-Mart store. Of course, Wal-Mart is a global conglomerate, some 10,000 stores both in the U.S. and 24 countries around the United States. This is the type of store where you go to buy groceries, where you go to buy general merchandise. And we're learning from this law enforcement sources that appears that this was a current or former employee who opened fire inside of a break room. That's one key piece of information. I'm also looking at a second piece of information, which is the time of the shooting, looking at this particular store.It appears as though the store closed at 11:00 p.m. at night, which is key because the shooting, at least according to law enforcement occurred around the 10:00 p.m. hour. And so, you know, covering sadly, so many of these mass shootings, if you are a shooter who is intent on causing indiscriminate casualties, this would not be the time of day that you would open fire. We know for example, back in 2019, there was a mass shooting at a Wal-Mart store in the U.S. state of Texas that caused some 23 casualties, 23 deaths and multiple injuries. That occurred around the 10:00 a.m. hour. Again, looking at this shooting that we're reporting on now in the U.S. state of Virginia, this occurred just before closing time where you wouldn't typically have many casualties. And so that tells me as a former, you know, law enforcement investigator, this appears to be very personal. This reporting that we have, this was a former employee or perhaps a current employee who went into a break room. And so, as you think about a store that's laid out, you know, anywhere in the world, you have the section of the store where customers are, they're buying items, they're checking out there, then departing. But there's also a separate area where employees are where they have their break room where as they're on shift, they will obviously have their downtime. And it appears as though the shooting took place in this particular area. And so again, we're waiting for additional information from law enforcement but this appears to be according to our reporting, someone who knew the layout of the store, who knew where this break room was based on their current or former role. And so, that's all information that investigators will be looking at. Of course, finally, it's important to note that we don't know if customers were also included among the casualties as the shooter made his or her way to that break room. That's something we're still waiting to hear from police officials.",

      "sentences": "Well, police believe that these were coordinated bombings that went off in the 7And then it exploded where at least 11 people were injured. One of those who was injured has suddenly died of their wounds and about 30 minutes later, another explosion at another bus stop happened in an area in the north part of the city. And in that situation, three people were injured. Now police say that they are continuing to search for suspects. And there are great fears that there might be further explosions because bombings like these have not happened in Jerusalem or in Israel proper for many years now. These types of explosions are bringing back many memories for many people to the Second Intifada when suicide bombings and sort of these apart -- package explosions were happening, especially on buses and by bus stations and restaurants and things like that. But Israel hasn't witnessed these types of explosions in many years. Now, this has already been the most violent year for both Israelis and Palestinians since 2015 as a result of a series of attacks on Israelis and as a result of mostly Israeli military raids in the West Bank. And there were already great, great fears that the ground was so dry, the kindling was so dry for some sort of explosion that would turn into a potential Third Intifada. And these explosions today are I think the closest that we've potentially come to that because it is so reminiscent of the First and the Second Intifada as these explosions have not happened. Typically, if there have been attacks targeting Israelis in the last year they've been stabbing attacks, they've been ramming, they've been shootings. We have not seen explosions like these have recently. And we do know from some reporting that there have been these newly formed militant groups in the West Bank. Some of them have reportedly been working on explosives. Now no militant group has claimed responsibility yet for this attack. But obviously this is still a very quickly developing situation. The Israeli Prime Minister, soon to be outgoing Prime Minister Yair Lapid is holding a security situation assessment on this in the next couple hours. But right now the situation in Jerusalem is incredibly tense as people are very fearful that there are going to be further explosions potentially elsewhere in the city or elsewhere in Israel.",

In fact, the World Health Organization's Europe regional director was in country this week, earlier this week, to try to assess this damage after weeks of sustained attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure. The World Health Organization saying some 10 million people in the country, that's a quarter of the population, are without any electricity, that half of the country's power grids are either damage or completely destroyed in these attacks.And, of course, these are life-threatening conditions, Rosemary. Temperatures are expected to drop to negative four Fahrenheit. That's negative 20 degrees Celsius. In the depth of this winter, you have to remember, that also hospitals, clinics, schools at times are struggling to get electricity, to get running water.
