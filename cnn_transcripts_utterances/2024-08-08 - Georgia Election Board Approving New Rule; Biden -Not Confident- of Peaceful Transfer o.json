      "sentences": "We are less than 90 days from the presidential election and a controversial new rule in a key battleground state is raising concern among voting rights advocates. Georgia State Election Board approved a new rule giving local officials the ability to conduct inquiries, as they're calling them, and to demand more information, as they're describing it, before certifying election results. Critics say it could slow down election certifications in a state that has already been at the center of a year's long election interference investigation involving President Biden's 2020 win there.They're joining me now to talk about this, Democracy Docket founder and Elias Law Group partner, Marc Elias. Marc, great to see you again. As soon as this popped up, I knew exactly who to turn to. What is going on in Georgia? And what does this tell us about what's happening around the country?",

      "sentences": "Look, what we have to remember from this story is that Donald Trump at his last campaign rally actually gave a shout out to three of the five members of the otherwise obscure Georgia State Election Board. And lo and behold, shortly after that shout out in which he called them pit bulls and said that one of the things they were going to do is ensure victory, they enacted this new rule that really goes against the grain of how we certify elections in this country.In this country, voters vote, the election officials tally the votes and then certify the results. And here, there is -- the rule gives some discretion or tries to give some discretion to election officials to maybe say they want to investigate further. And look, this is part of a bigger effort that Donald Trump and Republicans have been trying to launch around the country to allow space for election deniers to be in office and not certify election results. We saw it an effort in this -- in the 2020 election in Michigan. And in 2022, my team and I had to sue Cochise County, Arizona, some counties in Pennsylvania that were doing exactly this. So, everyone needs to be paid close attention to this as it moves forward.",

Donald Trump has spent the better part of the last decade sowing distrust in elections. He sowed distrust in elections in -- before 2016, before 2020, certainly after 2020 when he's -- when I was proud that my legal team and I defeated him in court time and time again. And then, obviously, that led to January 6th. And then, the aftermath of that in which he has spread election denialism day in and day out. So, I don't think that there's any effort here to build confidence in elections.I think there is an effort here by the Republican National Committee, by Donald Trump and his supporters, to try to give themselves leeway to find another way to contest an election when he loses.",

Maybe not exactly like January 6th, but yet, you could have breakdowns in states where election officials are refusing to certify election results, and it just becomes a giant hornets' nest. Add to that the possibility that, yes, you could have perhaps spasms of violence breaking out, maybe not in the nation's capital, but in state capitals. What are your thoughts on this? ELIASYou know, we were lulled into being told by people on the right to take Donald Trump seriously, but not literally. And then, what we wound up with was an assault on democracy after the 2020 election that ultimately culminated in a violent insurrection in the nation's capital. So, when Donald Trump says, don't worry about voting, you won't have to vote again, and when Donald Trump says that he's calling out election officials because, you know, he thinks that they are pitbulls, we need to take him literally. And the consequences of that can be quite dire. Now, I will tell you that those of us in the pro- democracy world, we are not going to take this lying down. And I expect you will see efforts to challenge any effort to subvert the election and that those efforts will succeed.",

Meredith Vadis served as Walz's deputy chief of staff when he was in Congress. She had both Walz and his wife as senior advisers in high school.

Those are the things he's done to make sure it's a really great climate to raise kids. And as a parent of two elementary school kids, I feel great, right? There are job opportunities. My kids are thrilled in school. Their schools are well funded. They eat, their friends eat, there's no disparities. It's a great place to be. So, I don't think it's about being progressive.

You know, checking out his territory. And then he got up there and began breakfast. So, he's been chomping down on some bamboo, having a good time just checking the people out. But what we have learned is that they've really spent time to make this happen, to bring these giant pandas back here to San Diego, to having these conversations with their Chinese counterparts we know that some of the handlers from China have moved to be here -- not moved, but came to be here for an extended period along with the handlers here at the San Diego Zoo to make this happen. And it's really a fanda (ph). I didn't mean to do that, but it is a panda affair because of the fact that some of their ancestry was actually here. And so, they have relatives who were based here in San Diego as well at this zoo.So, all in all, people are very excited. Today is the big debut that we're going to see this and see how much bamboo they can eat. One other thing that I've learned, Jim, is that there are solitary animals. So, the boy and the girl pandas are separate because they like to live their lives alone until it comes to mating time. So, she is in a different enclosure right now, Xin Bao is. And so, he is just here, very happy with his bamboo. And they've tried really to make it seem very hospitable to what he would normally be living in if he were in his native China. But what this is about is conservation, saving these panda bears, and extending their life for a long period here, Jim.",
