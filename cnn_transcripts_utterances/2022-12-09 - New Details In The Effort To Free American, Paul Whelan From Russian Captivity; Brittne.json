      "sentences": "Good evening.Brittney Griner is home and safe tonight and there are new details in her time in Russian captivity, as well as new video of some of her ordeal. We begin though with one American who remains in Russia, Paul Whelan, and the remarkable details we now have, the scale and the effort to secure his freedom, details that might just as easily come straight out of a Cold War spy novel or the Cold War itself. We're also learning about the price that Russia was asking for sending Whelan back, namely freedom for an assassin, former FSB Colonel Vadim Krasikov. That's the man there. He is serving a life sentence in Germany for what German authorities say was the State-mandated murder of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent, execution style, in a Berlin Park, who was tracked and murdered at close range. The assassin, Krasikov is part of the price Russia wanted for the freedom of Paul Whelan. CNN's Phil Mattingly joins us now with some additional new reporting. It's a pretty extraordinary story this. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there is no question about it. It's also the first real window we've gotten into what President Biden was talking about yesterday when he mentioned that the Russians were treating Paul Whelan \"differently\" than they were when it came to Brittney Griner. And what they meant by that is there was a very clear sense among US officials beyond just the general frustration that they had based on how these negotiations were going on that what the Russians wanted for Paul Whelan was what they viewed as an essentially lateral trade here, asking for an ex-FSB colonel, somebody that was accused of murder and currently being held in custody in Vadim Krasikov. That was the primary issue when you talk to US officials. Now, what's interesting here, Anderson, is they actually made efforts to try and figure out if there was some type of three-way swap that included the Germans, where the Germans would get something that could make this a feasible option. They never actually got to the point where they raised that to the highest levels for German officials, underscoring the difficulty here and that's where you get at the frustration. This was an issue that started being raised by the Russians in the summer, and they continue to go back to it over and over and over again, Anderson. I'm told by one official that the Americans even made an offer as recently as the last two weeks one more time to try and see if they could add Paul Whelan into the deal that brought Brittney Griner home. They were not given any concrete alternatives. What they were asked for, again, was the same official that they believe they could not get out of another country -- Anderson.",

Alexander Vinnik, who was extradited to the United States in August. He was convicted of extortion, of hacking, as well, Roman Seleznev was the other Russian that we are aware of right now, a cybercriminal currently serving a 14-year sentence in the US. There was no sense whatsoever from the US official I spoke to that the Russians were even willing to consider them as options. There is no clear answer as to why that is the case right now and why they have been so fixated on one individual held in a different country, who was essentially a Russian assassin. What US officials will say, however, is they don't believe the idea that there are no more cards to play, there are no more options on the table is necessarily true. The official that I spoke to said explicitly, we're going to test that proposition, and in the coming weeks, not just months, Anderson. So they very clearly are planning to go back to the table. They're planning to put other options on the table. But those options will be and perhaps most importantly, if those options will be considered by the Russians still very much an open question and one the Whelan family would very much like an answer to soon.",

We can confirm Brittney Griner arrived at Joint Base San Antonio. Brittney Griner now in her home state after nearly 10 months in a Russian prison, most recently serving her nine-year sentence in a Russian Penal Colony. And there is new information about her life there. Griner says she cut her long hair nearly two weeks ago and trimmed it to make her life easier during the Russian winter, and her attorney there says she was unable to do the sewing work she was assigned at the Penal Colony due to her large hands and because the tables were too small to accommodate her. President Joe Biden's National Security Council spokesperson saying she appears to be in good health. ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: She was very incredibly gracious and kind and humble on the flight. Very, very appreciative of the effort to get her home. FLORES (voice over): Griner is now undergoing a medical evaluation before being reunited with her wife, Cherelle and the rest of her family. A senior Biden administration official saying that negotiations to bring Briner home were separate from any talks about Ukraine. The deal came together about one week ago, after the US offered to swap convicted Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout for both Griner and Paul Whelan. Whelan was detained in Russia in 2018, convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison, a charge he denies. The Russians rejected that proposal.",

And in particular, she was very bothered about why prosecutors were stuck on getting someone from Trump's legal team to attest that all classified documents had been returned because she pointed out that Trump's team really appears to be working to make sure they're returned, because as recently as last month, they hired that team to search locations in New York, New Jersey, and Florida. They ended up finding two classified documents, and then they returned them to investigators. So that was one sticking point for the Judge here. And in the end, the Judge didn't rule for contempt, and instead urged DOJ and Trump's team to keep working through this together before any order is issued. So Anderson at this point, it seems that DOJ and Trump's team, they'll have to coordinate and cooperate a bit more even though it is clear, DOJ really believed before today's hearing that they were at an impasse.

So, I understand why. I think that from their perspective, they think that this punts things for another day. But again, the ball really is in DOJ's court at the moment because DOJ could, as Shan said, go into his properties again. Now, we have been told many weeks ago, there was no reasonable probable cause to search Bedminster or Trump Tower.

There is nothing wrong with contemporaneously continuing to negotiate. I mean, in some ways, they're building a record of their good faith of the various inconsistencies being said. It is so unusual that Trump's team cannot produce someone to be the Custodian of Records. I mean, it is quite symbolic, it really indicates that nobody has custody of the records.
