In fact, the entire city is full of signs like this one, you can see that the crowd is obviously very loud as it's sort of moving in that direction to a place called Azadi Square, where the procession will then end. It's about five kilometers from here. But the key thing here is, Paula, this is a very public show of mourning, and certainly one that the government definitely has encouraged very much here in Iran. They've called for people to come out here. And as you've mentioned, this is one string of events, laying those who killed -- were killed in that helicopter crash to rest. Obviously, today, we're in Tehran, and then tomorrow, we will be in Mashhad seeing something very similar as well. And as you can see right now, many, many people have turned out here to pay their final respects, as well as the supreme leader, as you mentioned, leading that final prayer, which is actually inside Tehran University, to then begin the procession -- funeral procession that's going to pass by our location very soon as once again, you can hear those chants erupting here in the crowd, many of them, of course, in support and showing their condolences for those who were killed in that helicopter crash, Paula.",
