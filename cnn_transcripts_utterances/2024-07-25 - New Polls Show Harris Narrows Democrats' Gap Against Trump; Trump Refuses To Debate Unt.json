Vance is no friend of hers after calling women who don't have children cat ladies. Also, a swing state governor believes America is ready to say I do to an all female ticket. And no takebacks, Nikki Haley says she meant everything she said about Donald Trump, but will vote for him anyway. Live at the table, Joe Pinion, Elie Mystal, Jeff Duncan, and Jane Coaston. Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race. Good evening everyone, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. As always, let's get right to what America is talking about, a whole new race tonight. Kamala Harris is closing in on getting a massive endorsement from former President Barack Obama. She's been waiting all week for it. And Donald Trump apparently is no longer the clear leader in the presidential race, at least according to a new string of polls. But also, tonight, Donald Trump is now suggesting that he won't commit to a debate until the Democrats formally commit to a nominee. Harris replying on Twitter, what happened to any time, any place, calling his bluff. Our panel is here in New York. Jane, shocking, Donald Trump apparently backing out of this, but why --",

And so, that is the hot take. It's probably a cold take. Republicans are not necessarily accustomed to running against a Black woman, because it's never really happened on this scale. In the end, focus on the border, focus on the economy, focus on the world torn asunder on Joe Biden's watch, and Kamala Harris can't say, I was there, but they didn't let me do the job.",
