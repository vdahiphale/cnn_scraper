      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington.At this hour, we're following major breaking news out of Gaza, hundreds of civilians caught in the chaos of the Israel-Hamas war. And a warning to our viewers:  The videos you're about to see are graphic and very disturbing. The Palestinian Red Crescent, as well as several eyewitnesses, now say hungry civilians were simply waiting in line for food in Western Gaza City when Israeli tanks and drones opened fire on the crowd. Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 100 people were killed and nearly 800 injured. CNN is unable to independently confirm these numbers. A local journalist on the scene says most of the deaths came from the chaos that erupted when aid trucks tried to escape the gunfire. The IDF says the incident is under review. The U.N. aid chief saying moments ago -- and I'm quoting now -- \"Life is draining out of Gaza at terrifying speed.\" Last hour, President Biden told reporters that he knows this violence will complicate any negotiations for a temporary cease-fire, but he's still hopeful. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live in Tel Aviv for us right now. I know you're working this with a lot of sources, Jeremy. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, based on eyewitness accounts, here's what we understand happened.A convoy of aid trucks crossed into a neighborhood in Western Gaza City -- this is in the northern part of Gaza -- within moments, Wolf, thousands of people began swarming around those aid trucks, trying to desperately get aid that those trucks were carrying. We're then told that, within minutes of those trucks crossing into Northern Gaza, the Israeli military opened fire. This is according to our journalist Khader al Zaanoun, a local journalist who's been working with us, and other eyewitnesses on the ground. That Israeli military gunfire killed and wounded perhaps a couple of dozen people, but the majority of deaths that ensued in this incident happened as the drivers of those trucks, amid the gunfire, amid the chaos drove away, running over several people. We're told, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 104 people were killed in this incident, 760 were injured. But, Wolf, the Israeli military is offering a different narrative. They say that the gunfire happened after there was already a stampede of people, after the drivers of these trucks had already run over people. And they're describing it, Wolf, as separate incidents. They say that a group of Palestinians in that area approached that Israeli military checkpoint where those trucks had come in, that the Israeli military says that those individuals approached that checkpoint in a threatening manner and that the Israeli military then opened fire. But we should note, Wolf, that that contradicts eyewitness accounts on the ground, including local journalist Khader al Zaanoun, who I spoke with earlier today. But the bottom line, Wolf, is that 104 people are dead, hundreds more are injured, and all this is happening because of the desperate humanitarian situation that currently exists in Northern Gaza. About a half-a-million people there are currently on the brink of famine. Very little aid has been able to actually get into Northern Gaza because of the dangerous security situation, because aid groups have not been able to get aid into Northern Gaza. And so what little aid is able to get in, Wolf, people are desperate for. Right now, those people who are hungry have been surviving on animal feed, on grass, on soupy mixtures made with dirty water that they are able to obtain. And so what you have here, when you put together that desperate situation, a lack of security for these aid convoys, and then apparently the Israeli military opening fire, all of that is a very desperate and a very deadly combination -- Wolf.",

It's international assistance that was being supplied in the northern areas of the Gaza Strip, precisely for the -- for the requirements and the needs of the people. Unfortunately, this is a situation that we are facing, and we are understanding that there is a dire situation. The humanitarian aid needs to arrive in its place.

And I also heard that this morning I saw that there -- the U.S. and Canada are also considering that. I'm sure that we can facilitate more access. There is no limit on the amount of humanitarian aid and supplies that can get into Gaza. We are facilitating that and coordinating that. We have been almost for five months.

I wouldn't trust the al Qaeda Ministry of Health. I don't trust the Hamas Ministry of Health. In this war, we have killed up to now over 12,000 terrorists, Hamas terrorists, Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in combat or in precision strikes. Indeed, it is a deep tragedy that civilians are caught up in this war. It's a war Israel never asked for. It was a war Israel was surprised from on the 7th of October, when Hamas decided to launch a war against Israel, attacking, killing, murdering, massacring and abducting 240 Israelis and foreign nationals into Gaza. There are still 134 Israelis being held by Hamas. This war can end today. Hamas can let them go and unconditionally surrender, and there will be no more need for war. But there is one very, very clear thing that everybody agrees upon. Hamas have to go. The paradigm has to change for the safety and security for all decent people in this region.",

I would say Hamas have weaponized the civilian arena, to an extent where they have no regard for civilian lives, Israelis or Palestinian. And so when we are going after Hamas' leadership, and when they are hiding in the civilian arena, there are civilian consequences. But we need to do everything we can to evacuate people from harm's way. We have called on evacuation areas. We have directed people out of harm's way. We have -- indeed, and throughout the course of this war, CNN has covered extensively the vast tunnel network. I remember, Wolf, in 2014, when you had access to the tunnels. This is an industry of terror and hate. It has to go. It has to end. The people, Israelis and Palestinians, are paying too dear a price because of this failed leadership of Hamas.",

And, as I said, Israel is the only people, by their own admission, by their own volition, to be in charge of security inside Gaza. And just one anecdote, Wolf, the head of one of the -- the head of UNRWA told me that even animal fodder is running out in Gaza. And I'm like, animal fodder? And he said, yes, because people are eating animal fodder, and even animal fodder is running out. So that's how desperate the situation is.
