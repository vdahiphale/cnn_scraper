In some states, just a handful, listen to me, a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner. So, we need to vote in numbers that erase any doubt. We need to overwhelm any effort to suppress us. Our fate is in our hands. In 77 days, we have the power to turn our country away from the fear, division and smallness of the past. We have the power to marry our hope with our action. We have the power to pay for the love, sweat and sacrifice of our mothers and fathers and all those who came before us. (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) M. OBAMA: We did it before y'all and we sure can do it again. Let us work like our lives depend on it. And let us keep moving our country forward and go higher -- yes, always higher than we've ever gone before, as we elect the next president and vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Thank you all. God bless. (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) M. OBAMA: Now, before I go, I have one more job tonight. (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) M. OBAMA: Yeah, one more job. You all, thank you for all the love. But, it is now my honor to introduce somebody who knows a whole lot about hope -- (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) M. OBAMA: -- someone who has spent his life strengthening our democracy. And let me tell you, as someone who lives with him, he wakes up every day -- every day, and thinks about what's best for this country. Please welcome America's 44th President and the love of my life, Barack Obama. (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)",

They were -- they were in this position in 2016, making this case for Hillary Clinton, and they experienced what it was like to make that case and then be there on election night when Donald Trump won.I heard that in their speeches tonight. The admonition to not take it for granted, that this is really hard, that it's going to take a lot of work to talk to people that you disagree with, to insist on American values. I think they feel burned by their own experiences trying to convince this country to seek their better angels.

And the one that Kamala Harris does is full of people of color who are either homeless, migrants or murderous thugs, etcetera, etcetera.And Haberman's response was that she thought there was actually strategy to it, Donald Trump had been trying to bait Kamala Harris and Kamala Harris campaign into an argument about race, that there actually was rhyme in reason, a method to the madness, if you will. It was interesting tonight, the particular zingers that both first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama made Donald Trump because they seemed targeted and aimed at things that Donald trump might be insecure about, and I am specifically referring to his hand gestures when discussing crowd sizes.

And they did it beautifully. They did it powerfully. Obama used nostalgia in a beautiful way. He didn't say make America great again. We are going to go back. He reminded everybody of the best things about our families, about our neighborhoods. That was beautiful. And then Michelle, she wasn't doing the minister role. She was really doing the coaching role in that she called it right out. She said, you guys, you know, she talked about the affirmative action of generational wealth. She talked about the luxury of whining and cheating that other people don't have. But she didn't stop there. She also called the left up. And she said the winding on the left needs to stop. She said the goal deluxe, they're not perfect. This was a masterful act of leadership. It was a sacred task. They took it on well. It was like an oasis.

And I thought that was a really fascinating way to put because in comparing it to the RNC, which we were at, there was something about it that was quite oyster (ph). I mean, not to compare the enthusiasm because it was after assassination attempt, but it felt small and it was so hyper-focused that it had a way of shutting out the world.

The music, the Obamas, the whole thing worked for them tonight.I think the contrast that I see, and I don't know which is going to win, but we're seeing the contrast of the politics of combat versus the politics of compassion. That's what the Obamas were trying to set up tonight in my judgment. I should warn my fellow Republicans that we heard two of the greatest communicators in the country tonight. Now we had hulk a mania. The Democrats have Obama mania. They ripped the roof off of this place tonight. These democrats are fired up. They're not playing, okay? Yes, they say things that are exaggerations, they do say things about Trump and the Republicans that are outright lies, but the convention is working for Harris, at least as of today. The gap that I still see in all these speeches, as good as they were, is that she's in the White House right now. Democrats have controlled the White House for 12 of the last 16 years. And for all of the talk about division and the problems in the country and people are hurting, Democrats have mostly controlled this country. Trump had it for four. The Obamas and Biden had it for the rest of the time. And somehow, it's still all Trump's fault, and somehow she hasn't been at the center of it. So to me, that's still the glaring hole in this campaign that hasn't yet been solved at the convention. How do you explain all of the problems that will be solved by the person who is currently in there for the last three and a half years who is supposed to already be working on solving it? But bottom line tonight, this convention is working for them. Michelle Obama is -- I mean she's an incredible speaker and you cannot deny the power of what happened in the hall tonight.",
