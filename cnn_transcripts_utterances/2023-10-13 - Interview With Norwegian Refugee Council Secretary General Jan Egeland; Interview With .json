Here's what's coming up.Israel Defense Forces troops have carried out local raids in Gaza in the search for hostages and Hamas infrastructure. That after an evacuation order for more than a million people in Gaza as Israel continues its retaliatory bombardment. We have a report on the devastation there in Gaza, and I'll talk to the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, whose staff are on the ground in Gaza right now. Then, after a week of pain in Israel, how does a nation even begin to process this trauma? Clinical psychologist Ayelet Gundar-Goshen joins me. Also, ahead, the dangers of dysfunction in American politics, as the U.S. House remains speakerless. Christiane's conversation about that with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Plus, Michel Martin speaks to former U.S. Envoy to the Middle East, Dennis Ross, about how to achieve a lasting peace in the region. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Israeli troops have been carrying out local raids inside Gaza involving infantry and armored forces. This news comes after the Israeli military warned people in Northern Gaza to move south immediately. The United Nations saying just 24 hours' notice was given to evacuate. Let's now bring in Becky Anderson, who is following these developments from Jerusalem. Becky, specifically, what more are we learning about these -- what appear to be smaller raids, targeting terrorists, and finding out more information about where these hostages may be?",

She was supposed to be here in the U.S. on a book tour for her new novel, \"The Wolf Hunt,\" but it was canceled because of the war. Ayelet, thank you so much for joining us. Like all other Israelis that we've talked to, history will now define the days before October 7th and after. The country changed. The region changed. You're a professional who deals with trauma and helps your patients cope with theirs. My first question to you, though, as an Israeli, as a human being, how are you doing right now? AYELET GUNDAR-GOSHEN, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR, \"THE WOLF HUNT\":  You know, we stopped asking each other, how are you doing in the mornings when we meet at work because there are no words.

If Celine is alive, her body is still producing milk for her baby, somewhere out there in the Gaza Strip, if she is still alive, is a mother whose body keeps making milk for a baby in Israel. Talk to us about -- GUNDAR-GOSHEN:  I think when you think about Celine, I mean, this is the most terrible thing that you can imagine, right? Having a baby here in Israel and having her mother in Gaza and the body doesn't know that the mother is away from the baby. The body continues to produce the milk. And then, we have the father of the baby asking how can he feed his daughter. And I think this is also the moment when you see the beauty of Israeli civil society. Because the government, the Israeli government, is weak, but the people are so powerful. So, you see women coming to the house, bringing their own milk to feed Celine's baby. And you see people opening their houses and hosting inside their houses, people that they don't meet, survivors of the massacre, are coming now to our houses in Tel Aviv. You see how everyone is trying to help somehow. You have a family here and -- that lost the parents. You have two newborn babies, twins. So, you get text messages of, I have the baby twins, but I don't have clothes for them because I don't have newborn clothes. So, other mothers from the neighborhood come and bring clothes over their own babies. I think everyone is trying to help. But as mental health professionals, we keep asking ourselves, how many patients are we going to meet? Because it's not just the survivors, you know, the entire civil society, the entire Israeli society is traumatic at the moment.",

You know, people got text messages saying, help us, they're burning us, or help us, they're shooting at us, or help us, they're taking the kids. So, the entire country was exposed. But later you had another wave of explosion because the kids, Israeli kids, saw the videos and they got it through WhatsApp, they got it through Instagram, they got it through TikTok. Hamas was cruel enough to publish and to put it on social media so that people can see their loved ones being tortured on live streaming. And I think, if I can tell you one thing that you never do with kids, you don't expose them to this if you have a choice.

Putin invaded Georgia. He invaded Ukraine the first time, in 2014. He was not stopped. And why is it that all of our allies in Europe who border Russia, who have first-hand experience with Putin are begging that we support Ukraine? Because they know that if Putin gets his way in Ukraine, he will not stop there. And the Ukrainian people have demonstrated they are willing going to defend themselves. They just need the help. It was similar if you go way back to, you know, what FDR faced when, you know, America Firsters, the same claim that we're hearing from the MAGA extremists, were saying, we don't need to help the British. You know, the Germans are bombing them. There's the Blitz. They're invading Poland. But that's not our fight. Well, yes, it was our fight. And the fact that FDR maneuvered through the America Firsters and figured out how to keep providing aid to Great Britain is exactly what we need to do now. So, almost regardless of who ends up being the speaker and what rhetoric they use about Ukraine, I would urge President Biden to use every tool at his disposal to keep funding Ukraine. I hope that there's a vote in the House. I know that it will turn out the right way. But even if they drag their feet and play to the worst impulses and find common cause with those American Firsters who frankly supported Hitler, you know, shame on them, we still need to figure out how to fund Ukraine.

These are people who actually deeply believe the in making peace with the Palestinians, even being prepared to make real concessions with the Palestinians.

You know, people tend to forget every time we were making progress in the 1990s, every time we were making progress, we would get suicide bombings from Hamas. When I hear people say today, well, Hamas wouldn't have done this if there was a peace process. On the contrary, when there was, they were the ones who did everything they could, literally, to kill it. And even now, clearly, one of the motivations was the prospect of Saudi Arabia. The king is -- the custodian of the two holy moss (ph), most important Sunni Arab leader, most important Sunni Muslim leader in the world was prepared -- it appeared was in the process of being prepared to make peace with the nation state of the Jewish people.

And in this, you say, the only way to achieve a lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians is a complete dismantling of Hamas.

Now, having said that, the essence of what I was saying is that it is clear that Hamas cannot continue to be a threat towards Israel, number one. It's also clear there is no possibility of creating reconstruction in Gaza so long as Hamas is in a position where at a time of his choosing it can blow everything up again. So, I do take the view that Hamas has completely delegitimize itself by what it has done. It is not a partner in any way, shape or form, and I do think there has to be an outcome. I would like to see this kind of formula that I was saying. I'd like to see demilitarization of Gaza in return for massive reconstruction of Gaza. And I don't see Hamas being in a position where it will ever go along with anything like that. So, I think at a minimum, Hamas has to be put in a position where its fundamental power has been dramatically eroded. You know, the idea that you can eradicate something like Hamas is something I think is beyond anybody's capability, but you could dramatically weaken it to the point that it doesn't have the kind of capability to disrupt everything else.

You know, one of the person that I was able to speak to was describing how -- you know, she's already lost members of her family. She said, we're the ones who are vulnerable. Yes, the Israelis have basically directed us to seven areas in Gaza, but I have 90-year-old parents who are not movable. You know, we're exposed. All the Hamas leaders are deep underground. So, look, this is a way a terrible dire situation, you know. And yet, we face a reality where whatever we say, the Israelis are no longer going to live with this threat. And this is left to right, completely. It's a complete consensus. So, you know, this is a terrible reality. But in a sense, Israel is now facing its ISIS. When we thought ISIS when -- you know, in Mosul and in Raqqa, you know, there are a lot of innocent people who were killed. You're dealing with a threat that actually wants to invite the killing of innocence. And it forces you into these terrible excruciating dilemmas, where if you don't take these steps, you have to continue to live with this group, which will continue to carry out outrages. And at some point, you have to try to find a way to deal with it. When I was a trust and what I was laying out in terms of the objectives, I said, the International Community should emphasize the unconditional release of all the hostages, and it should emphasize the demilitarization and offer reconstruction. I mean, I'm hoping that under some circumstances you might be able to bring this to an end so that the supreme price that we could be seeing pay, in fact, doesn't materialize. You are quite right. Look, the price Palestinians will pay is terrible. The price the IDF will pay is also awful. So, it's a -- you know, it's an awful situation, but we also know who's responsible for it.

It's the way I think that we should be talking about it. We have to frame this issue for what it is. You have to take on this group that has (INAUDIBLE) these unspeakable atrocities on the one hand, and will continue to do it if given an opportunity.

There needs to be an alternative administration in Gaza, maybe under some kind of international trusteeship. There needs to be a plan for reconstruction as part of that. There need to be elections held six to nine months later. There needs to be -- in other words, it needs to be a strategic plan for what is going to happen in Gaza afterwards, and that plan needs to ensure it can't be rearmed, but it also needs to create kind of the equivalent of a marshal plan for Gaza. One of the good things about Gaza from that standpoint is it is small. We're talking about an area that is, you know, not much bigger than the greater New York area. So, the potential -- and it's -- and you're going to have so much destruction there that rebuilding the infrastructure and, in a sense, almost starting from a low ebb, you can make a big difference pretty quickly. And give Palestinians there a chance to breathe. So, that would be one thing. The second thing is, I don't write off the possibility that we will still see maybe several months down the road a Saudi Israeli breakthrough, in which case, part of that will also involve what is done for Palestinians in the West Bank as well, not only in terms of changing how they live, but also tangible steps that would ensure that two states remains an option for the future. You know, then you can change the trajectory. Then you can move in a way that becomes dramatically more hopeful. I mean, what we can't do is become so lost in what's happening right now that we lose sight of anything that might happen over time. And look, I completely -- you use the word grievous, and that there's a poverty of language to capture what it means to see these losses.
