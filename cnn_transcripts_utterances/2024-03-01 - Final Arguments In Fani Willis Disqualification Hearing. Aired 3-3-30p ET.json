State, which is 287 Georgia 542. And all of the cases that fall under this, what I would call category, is about a - attorney who formally prosecuted a defendant in, I guess, the same type of case or the same case or similar charges. And that would be why the courts were a - excuse me, the courts found that disqualification would be necessary because of the relationship that existed between the former client and the now person who's being prosecuted, Your Honor.The next series of slides just goes through what has been addressed as it relates to the standard that is required when dealing with the issue of disqualification. And the state would contend and submit to the Court that the defense must show an actual conflict in order to have the District Attorney disqualified and that actual conflict has to be in the form of - showing that Ms. Willis in this instance received a financial benefit or gain in relation to the outcome of the case. Like many of the cases that involve personal interest, Your Honor, it's all based on a contingency fee where how much they're paid or a bonus, for example, is dependent upon the outcome of the case. That's how one is to show that there's a personal interest in the case. We have none of that here. And I would submit to the Court, we have absolutely no evidence that Ms. Willis received any financial gain or benefit. The testimony was that Ms. Willis paid all of the money back in cash related to the trips and if didn't pay back in cash, it was in exchange.",

So what I'm thinking of, I'm just going to try and come up with some hypos here, what if ADAs are given a bonus for every motion to suppress, they win, a thousand dollars per Fourth Amendment claim they win. Well, now they've got an incentive if one of their officers is lying not to tell you about it because they want to win that motion to suppress. Maybe that doesn't affect the outcome because you can win a motion to suppress or lose in the - that doesn't decide whether it's going to be a guilty or not guilty verdict.

[15It's a 1996 case where the court says, \"Nevertheless, the conflict must be palpable and have a substantial basis in fact. A theoretical or speculative conflict will not impugn a conviction which is supported by competent evidence.\" Now, I understand as it relates to the post-conviction factor or the status of the case being in post-conviction based on Your Honor's earlier inquiry. But I would submit to the Court that as it relates to the issue of disqualification, that the standard is the same, whether it's post-conviction or pre-trial. In Blumenfeld v. Borenstein, which is 247 Georgia 406, the 1981 case. In that case it says, \"The appellees have not shown us a case where a per se rule was applied to disqualify an attorney on the basis of an appearance of impropriety alone. The Georgia cases cited by appellee do not stand for the proposition that a trial judge is authorized in Georgia to disqualify an attorney solely on the basis of an appearance of impropriety.\" Which further goes to the state's submission to the court that the standard is that an actual conflict must be shown and that conflict that arises shows that there's a personal stake of the District Attorney as it relates to their personal financial gain that's being alleged. So in the case that's been referenced by all parties here today, Whitworth v. State, 275 Georgia, Appeal 790, a 2005 case. In that case, it says, \"Whitworth's complaints are largely based on speculation and conjecture. Applying the any evidence standard to the record, it is clear that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Whitworth's motion to disqualify Morgan based upon his personal interest in his conviction.\"",
