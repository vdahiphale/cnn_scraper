I'm Whitney Wild, in for Christine Romans.We begin with the latest on the Walmart shooting in Chesapeake, Virginia, that took the lives of six employees. Survivors and investigators are consumed with just one question, why did a former Walmart colleague open fire on their break room earlier this week? There have been three mass shootings since September 13th leaving 14 chairs empty on Thanksgiving. In addition to the six Walmart employees who lost their lives, three football players were killed at the University of Virginia and five people were shot to death at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is in Chesapeake, Virginia, and brings us the story of those left behind after this latest round of killings.

They're getting pled down in the judicial process to the point they're no longer applicable and no longer affect the red flag laws and they don't pull into action, preventing these people from getting guns.So, we really need to look at what charges people are being faced with and how to keep those intact, especially when they involve threats or weapons previously to make sure that that stays intact and can be entered into a system that could prevent these people from getting guns, because let's face it, guns are overwhelmingly getting into the hands of people who should not have them.",

She says the former president had raped her in the mid 1990s in a dressing room of a New York City department store. She also says he defamed her when he denied the allegations of rape, saying that he didn't know who she was, and she made up the assault to boost sales of her new book.This is the second lawsuit brought by Carroll, but the first time to hold the president accountable for the alleged assault. Carroll is bringing this lawsuit under the new New York state law, called the Adult Survivors Act. That allows any adult to bring a lawsuit against anyone that they say sexually assaulted them, no matter how long ago the alleged attack occurred. Trump attorney Alina Habba responded to the lawsuit, saying: While I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this act which creates a terrible precedent and the runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims. Lawyers say to expect a flood of lawsuits under this new law. If you look to a 2019 law that was passed that allowed child victims to bring claims, there were 11,000 lawsuits brought in that two-year window. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We don't know if that's incoming or outgoing here in Zaporizhzhia.We've seen the nuclear power stations across the country disconnected from the national grid. They have been reconnected. That's problematic because that means cooling systems have to rely on local diesel generators themselves vulnerable to break down, fuel outages or attack. That is something the international atomic energy authority has been extremely anxious about. And, of course, you have Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station just down the river from where I am which is in Russian hands being used by the Russians as a fire base and regularly there are exchanges of artillery fire close to and sometimes hitting facilities in that nuclear power station. From the ordinary Ukrainian perspective, they are trying to get by. Cities like Kherson, which are in total blackout because the Russians destroyed the generating capacity in that city have also now been suffering from bombardment by the Russians from the other side of the river Dnipro just after they've withdrawn from that city, now carrying out attacks against civilian targets in the last 24 hours killing at least 7 people in that region and along the river.",

In the same state, into the Southeast, we have a flood watch. This includes the Houston metro region. We're looking out for the potential of additional rain. This is an already very saturated environment. This bulk of rain currently moving over the southeast, including Atlanta, was just here. Now we have a secondary storm system that's developing to its west. That's bringing the snowfall to New Mexico. It's also going to pull up a lot of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and create heavy rain. Some of these thundershowers that develop within the next 24 to 48 hours could produce 2 to 3 inch per hour rain totals for that general area. You can see both storm systems working together. It's going to move along the east coast. Unfortunately, what that means is potential for some travel delays in the skies for some of those major east coast cities.
