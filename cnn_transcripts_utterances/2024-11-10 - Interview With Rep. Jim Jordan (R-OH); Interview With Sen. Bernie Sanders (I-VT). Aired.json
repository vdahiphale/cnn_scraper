We should all be proud of that, but it has to be put in the broad context of the reality of the American economy today. And that is, when you have three people on top owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, when you have millions and millions of people working for starvation wages, you got to speak to that reality. So you could say, look, we're proud of what we have accomplished, but we have so, so, so much more to do to create the kind of government and nations that work for all of us and not just the few. That's my critique. It's not that the Biden administration did not do a lot of good things, but it has to be put into an overall context where, in the last 50 years, 50 years, if you could believe it, real week -- inflation accounted for weekly wages are lower today than they were 50 years, a massive transfer of wealth from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent. That's not Joe Biden's fault. It's not Trump's fault. That's what's gone on for 50 years. Recognize it. Deal with it. Tell the working class that you understand what is going on in their lives. You got to fight for them.",

Dana, in -- on Tuesday, in the election, in the state of Missouri, a conservative state, they became one of the many states that voted, I think, 58 percent to raise the minimum wage. Now, how is it that in Congress, in the Senate, we haven't even brought a damn minimum wage bill onto the floor? We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. The Affordable Care Act is a stopgap measure. It is not addressing the real health care crisis in America. Why aren't we saying, yes, health care is a human right, we're going to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies, we're going to pass the PRO Act to make it easier for workers to join unions, we're going to expand Social Security by lifting it up, we're going to demand that the billionaires start paying their fair share of taxes?

Do you think health care is a human right? Do you think we should build the affordable housing that we need? Do you think we should take care of our seniors by expanding Social Security? So I think the emphasis has got to be, of course, and wiping out all forms of bigotry, and the Democrats should be proud of standing up for women's rights and abortion rights and gay rights and civil rights. But the emphasis has got to be is to make it clear that we are prepared to stand with the vast majority of the people, many of whom are falling further and further behind, while the people on top do phenomenally well.
