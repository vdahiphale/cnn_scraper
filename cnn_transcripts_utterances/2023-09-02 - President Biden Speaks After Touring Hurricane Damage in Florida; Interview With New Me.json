He's a former federal prosecutor and co-host of the podcast \"It's Complicated,\" and Shan Wu, a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Gentlemen, thanks for sharing your Saturday with us. Shan, let me go with you first. In Georgia, these criminal defendants, they can waive their right to an arraignment hearing, and entering a not guilty plea through court paperwork. We saw Trump doing that. Anyone who has not taken that step by this coming Wednesday apparently will be arraigned in person in Fulton County.

I don't think the trial itself, the verdict, is going to cause much difference just like the polling for, you know, who's going to be the nominee.But during the trial itself, you might see a lot more turmoil and controversy.
