Their prior contacts with this group have involved searches and the seizures of lots of weapons. And the plot involved the idea of a coup to take over a building, take over the government. So very serious. But to get to the core of your request, this -- you know, we have Neo- Nazi groups here. We have sovereign citizens who deny that the government is legitimate. We have conspiracy theorists who believe the world is run by a deep state corporation. This group combines all three into one group. They don't believe that the German republic is legitimate government. They subscribe to all the conspiracy theories about the deep state and all that comes with that. And if you look at their anti-vaccination, anti-COVID things, when they demonstrated at the Reichstag, the German parliament, they stormed the steps, very reminiscent of January 6th, tried to take over the building.

And the other zeros in on recent disruptions of LGBTQ events throughout the country. Law enforcement is putting this into context. And as we know, the time that this happened, the time the power went out here in Moore County coincided with the start of a drag show that was supposed to happen here in Moore County. So investigators are looking into that, although it's important to note they haven't exactly nailed down the motive yet. And part of that is because they haven't been able to figure out who did this. The FBI now leaning on the public to try to help them generate very solid leads. They've come out with a new wanted poster, hoping that these photos might help jigger some memory, might help to generate some really solid leads that law enforcement can run down. Because quite often, it takes someone calling in saying they know the person, saying they have information that can really help break open this case. Meanwhile, here in Moore County, they're on the fifth day of no power and it's extremely difficult. One woman telling us she has to drive up to an hour sometimes to get groceries. Another woman saying that she's losing out on hundreds of dollars because she can't work, there's no power at work and so she can't go and so she's not being paid. Here's what two women who were at a local shelter told us this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And especially as, you know, after Princess Diana died in the way she did, it clearly did traumatize both boys, especially Harry. There's a huge class-action against one of the tabloid newspapers, a really big one, with not just Prince Harry, but Elton John and a whole load of other stars. And the court is waiting to hear back from that newspaper group. They have held off with their reply, one suspects, until after this has gone to wear. So there's a lot of collective holding breaths because this may feed into that court case as well. So, yes, it's an interesting one. Britain isn't quite as Hollywood. We -- you know, they don't understand all the glitz and the glamour. And even those promotions have got people, you know, perplexed. We're just not used to that. So it's going to be an interesting one. I just -- there's a guy, a fantastic guy called Charles, who's written a portrait of the queen. And he really does have the royals' ear. He's friends with Prince Charles. He knew the queen really well. And he said apparently one thing Prince Andrew said to the queen after Harry and Meghan sat down with Oprah is, oh, dear, that's not good, is it? Whereupon, the queen turned to Prince Andrew and said, but didn't Fergie do something rather the same with Oprah? So not the first and it won't be the last.",

And I think Harry and Meghan are about to find out what happens when you hand over very personal stuff to -- for millions. I mean, Netflix is going to make a buck. They've got to show, you know, everybody who invests in them that this documentary is worth something. Already the British press has started picking up on some certain scenes, one where the -- in those promos where it looks like the press are coming after them.
