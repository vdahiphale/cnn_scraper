It's 9 am there in Washington. It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Also happening over the next two hours, a strong condemnation of Russia, China and Iran in NATO's latest declaration with China, firing back at a high stakes news conference for Mr. Biden, who is facing calls from some Democrats of course to step aside from the presidential race, plus, it just could be coming home for England fans see Three Lions head to the Euro final. And the stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now at 9:30 Eastern Time just had the latest inflation numbers in the futures market, certainly indicating a very mixed open more on that bottom of the hour. Well, Joe Biden will hold a highly anticipated news conference at the NATO Summit in Washington later today as he faces more calls from Democrats to exit the presidential race. For the first time at Democratic Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, is calling on Mr. Biden to end his campaign. Another Senate Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado says he thinks Donald Trump will win in November, maybe he says by a landslide. And the president has also lost the support of Hollywood Megastar George Clooney just weeks after Clooney hosted a high profile Biden fundraiser. Lauren Fox is connecting us from Washington. Lauren, let's start with new polling from ABC News, Washington Post and Ipsos, which shows Biden and Trump nearly head to head. The new polls also show that 62 percent of Democrats say he should step aside. What's the sense on the Hill and in the White House about how concerned Democrats should be about these numbers?",

I think the concern about what Biden's view at the top of the ticket does down ballot is something that a lot of Democrats are still very concerned about. You can expect that today. When Biden campaign officials come and meet with Democratic senators just off Capitol Hill, that they are going to be buoyed by these kinds of polls showing the fact that there hasn't been a lot of movement in the race between Biden and Trump in this matchup. But I think a lot of Democrats who are running in states like Montana, Arizona, talking about states like Ohio, those Democrats still have concerns about what this means for them down ballot. It's one thing in the words of Peter Welch yesterday to me to be running and trying to make up some ground between them and the president. It's another thing to try to make up a major chasm in a state like Ohio or Montana. So something I think that we still have to watch as these polls come out in dribs and drabs.",

The Israeli military has now ordered Palestinians to evacuate all of Gaza City urging more than a quarter of a million people to head south. The IDF says it has opened a quote safe passage route for civilians, but we of course have seen civilians killed on numerous occasions while taking such routes previously. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joining us now, what do we understand to be the situation on the ground? Evacuation orders from Gaza City where as we just reported, we understand there are some 250,000 people many of whom may have returned to their homes or may never have left and have been putting up with this sort of constant assault from Israel.

But here's the thing, if a family is trying to leave their home in Gaza City, they have to first step out into an open combat zone. As you mentioned, they have to take what Israel has called safe routes, but in the past have proven to be deadly, even dangerous for families trying to get further south. And even if they do reach the south, Becky, there is no sanctuary there. Just on Tuesday, there was a displacement shelter, U.N. run displacement shelter held inside a school in Khan Younis. That's all the way in the south that just two days ago, was struck by Israeli firepower. Israel says it was targeting and did kill a Hamas operative, but there were civilians caught in the middle. So for any families receiving this evacuation order, they have very little trust that they can make itself safely. And they simply know that there is no safety to be had, even if they do take those evacuation orders seriously. Painting again the wider picture here on the ground nine months into this conflict, you're looking at nearly 38,000 people who have been killed, that are according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Famine and hunger is now spreading through the Enclave. That's according to the United Nations. The healthcare system is on its -- Medecins Sans Frontieres the Doctors without Borders said they've shut their last center in the north of Gaza today. And as all of these suffering increases on the ground, Hamas is responding by saying those talks happening in Doha. Well, that takes us all back to Square One. And that's really where the question is right now, Becky, as these talks are ongoing we know the Doha portion has wrapped up. There continue to be mediators shuffling around the region. They are desperately trying to find respite, the six week ceasefire deal but these continued assaults on the ground could threaten that peace, Becky.",

And based on you know, if he's convicted of some of the most serious charges, some of them carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Now, this is still up to the judge to decide if the senator is convicted, how much of that he would actually serve. They rarely get the maximum allowed under the statute. But these are serious charges. And that's why we saw Senator Bob Menendez's lawyer give a five hour in -- and closing argument over the past two days trying to convince the jury to acquit the senator of these charges, saying that the prosecution has not made its case. Now prosecutors have accused the senator of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, cash that they found in the senator's home, including in envelopes with the senator's DNA on it. Also -- interfering in criminal investigations, as well as helping the government of Egypt by softening his stance on human rights abuses and pushing through some military aid that the government was seeking, including through private meetings that aides testified at this trial saying that they thought were weird. Now, of course Menendez's lawyer is arguing that these were routine meetings that all the senator was doing is trying to help his constituents when speaking with prosecutors about other investigations. And we are expected to hear this morning from another one of the co-defendants in this case, one of the businessmen, his lawyers will continue his closing arguments, and then as you said the prosecution will have their rebuttal. We expect that to go for about two hours that once that is completed, then it's the judge's turn to instruct the jury on the law what they have to find the prosecution proved in order to find the senator guilty of these charges of course you know, then the deliberations will begin, they will take as long as it needs to be. This trial is now in its ninth week of the case and so it's really not clear how long it will take the jury to deliberate but they've certainly heard a lot from the lawyers over the past several days, Becky.",

The RussianPresident is a staunch proponent of the bloc of major developing economies seen as a counterweight to Western led institutions like G7, for example, that have condemned Moscow for its war on Ukraine. Well, the meeting comes as Ukrainian authorities confirmed the first death of a child following Russia's attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv on Monday. Local officials say at least six people have been killed in Russian attacks across Ukraine in the past 24 hours. Let's get to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who is set in Kyiv. This BRICS meeting, I don't think anybody would believe is any is a coincidence in timing coming. At the same time as NATO meeting, of course, in Washington. There are those suggesting that we are seeing an even more emboldened Putin. Now that he has this sort of, you know, coalition, as it were. And certainly members of BRICS or countries that have been very neutral on this war, as so many countries away from the West have been. What's your sense of what he's taking into that meeting? And what he hopes to achieve?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right. I think that Vladimir Putin iscertainly trying to self-style himself to a certain extent, as a kind of counter gang balance to NATO, and to what he calls Western domination. So I think that that certainly is the case. And I think you're also right, Becky, that he's trying to rally those BRICS members around himself in order for BRICS to possibly become a counterbalance to NATO, and possibly also to the G7. As well, of course, it used to be the G8 until Russia was kicked out of it after the invasion of Crimea. It's going to be quite interesting to see what exactly the BRICS are going to come up with. But you're also absolutely correct to point out that, of course, countries like India, for instance, have been extremely neutral in all this, because we know that the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. He was under some fire from nations in the West for embracing Vladimir Putin, on the very day that, that attack that you were talking about on that children's hospital took place. Of course, 43 people were killed across Ukraine. And now we know three people, including a child were killed at that children's hospital. So there was some fire, because of that, however, India has also remained very neutral, and some are saying is essentially providing a lifeline economically to the Russians by continuously and increasingly purchasing Russian oil. You have countries like South Africa, also and of course, China, which was heavily criticized by NATO in that communique as saying that they were essentially an enabler of Russia's war effort. And Vladimir Putin himself continuously is trying to portray himself as someone who is that counterbalance weight to the west to what he calls Western oppression, Western hegemony. And that's certainly something that an emboldened Vladimir Putin is going to take into that meeting. One of the things that I think is sort of the basis for all this is that the Russians are saying, first of all, international sanctions against them aren't working, of course, also because of some of the other BRICS members that are providing help to the Russians and continuously doing business with the Russians. But also the Russian saying that despite the sanctions, they believe that right now, their war effort against Ukraine is fairly successful, even though that's not necessarily reflected on the battlefield were some of the momentum that we saw from the Russians about a month ago, when the Ukrainians still weren't getting many weapons from Western nations. A lot of that has now been stymied. If we look at the northeast of the country, the area around Kharkiv, for instance, the Russians there right now, really on the back foot, and the Ukrainians advancing, if anything, in most other places, the frontline has essentially stalled. Nevertheless, the Russians are saying they're still in the war effort. They believe that their military superior, they believe that their air force is functioning better than before. So right now, it seems as though Vladimir Putin believes that he can take some of that momentum that at least he's portraying to the international community, take it into that BRICS meeting. And it certainly does seem to be the case that, that meeting is absolutely no coincidence the timing of it coming right on the heels of that NATO meeting, Becky.",

These numbers, they really do amount to a green light for the Federal Reserve to start dialing back that inflation fighting medicine. Today's report showed that prices did fall between May and June. We haven't seen that since the spring of 2020 when COVID crashed the economy. On an annual basis, we saw prices up by 3 percent. That beat expectations tied for the lowest in three years. And when you dig in, you can really see why we saw annual price drops for gasoline for new cars, used cars, air fare for transportation. And one of the biggest problems shelter, that is going up at a slower pace. And so when you put all that together, then you couple it with what we're seeing in the jobs market, you understand why people are starting to talk about the Fed cutting interest rates because remember, the Fed has had interest rates very high for the past few years. And that is starting to slow the jobs market down. We're starting to see the unemployment rate creep higher, some yellow lights are flashing in the jobs market.
