      "sentences": "CCN obtained a copy of the report detailing, what it calls quote, cascading failures from law enforcement. The hunting conclusion, the gunman who killed 19 children and two adults could have and should have been stopped much sooner. Instead, the shooter was left alone for 77 minutes where he was able to carry out mass murder.The report says this in part, officers on the scene should have recognized the incident was -- as an active shooter scenario and moved and pushed forward immediately and continuously toward the threat until the room was entered and the threat was eliminated. That did not occur. CNN has been leading the way on the story exposing details, the authorities tried very hard to keep quiet. That is all, thanks to CNN Shimon Prokupecz and his team, who spent well over a year reporting on so many of the failures that are laid out now in this very government report. Shimon, you are there back in Uvalde, at this news conference waiting for Merrick Garland to begin. This is all shocking to once again read. But again, it is all information that you pried out of officials right there on the ground in Uvalde.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. It's different when you get to see in such a -- as you say, government report way, right, and the way it's laid out and just how disturbing everything was here on that day. And just from top to bottom, the mistakes from the response to the communication to the way they treated the victims who were inside the room when they finally pulled them out to what they did after.You know, there's things in this report about the crime scene and how the officials when they got inside, they disturbed the crime scene, they tainted the crime scene, things like that. And the trauma just by the actions of city officials, law enforcement officials, the trauma that they continue to cause on the families by not being transparent, by trying to sort of hide information and no accountability. And that's what this report lays out. Just everything that went wrong, went wrong on that day and continues to go wrong. And for these families, it's the trauma of all of that. And so finally, they have answers. A lot of this is not new, they tell me. There are things they want to see more of certainly accountability. And they're waiting on the district attorney to make a decision whether any of these officers are going to face criminal charges. The families are here. We have some of the family members here of the victims. They're here and also local officials are here as well. And I think this -- if you can hear behind me the DOJ is now given us some -- given us the two-minute warning here, Dana. So, we should see the attorney general here soon. And also the investigators who worked with the Department of Justice on this. They're all here as well, Dona.",

I can't imagine.Well, we know what it's like just as a normal civilian, a parent, a member of the human race to read some of this for you, as somebody who has spent a lifetime in and around law enforcement to see the cascading failures as this report put, it must be just completely mind blowing, John?",
