You'll remember that the Russian military intelligence hacked and dumped a ton of information about the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. And there's just been a number of those over the years, and the Iranians are just pointing it at the Trump campaign. It's a pretty well-known tactic.The other thing the FBI announced this week was that the Chinese government has been taking over armies of zombie computers all over the world -- hundreds of thousands of them, actually -- for a different reason -- not for interference but for espionage and for attacking corporate and other organizations. So it's not new to have foreign governments using AI and other technologies to hack and dump and cyber infiltrate. But the scale of it is unprecedented and the new technology makes it that much easier for these enemy governments to perpetrate and that much harder for the FBI to defend against.",

Once is targets and one is tactics.So on targets it's pretty clear based on everything that we know that the Russians favor Donald Trump. The Russian government is work -- using its intelligence in cyber tools to help the Trump campaign against the Harris campaign. On the other hand, it's also very clear that the Iranians favor President -- Vice President Harris and are using their cyber tools against the Trump campaign. And the Chinese are kind of split. They don't seem to really have a strong preference. So that's in terms of targets. In terms of tactics what we're seeing is that the Iranians have a very sort of low-level, short-term goal, which is just to mess with us and perhaps mess with the Trump campaign. And the Chinese have a much more long-term goal, which is to embed themselves in every router, and DVR machine, and webcam that they can find not just in America but all over the world. They're playing a much longer game and that's because their goals are corporate espionage, intelligence gathering, and then a possible attack later if and when they attack Taiwan, for example, that they can prevent us from retaliating. So I think that basically rounds up the differences between these -- all of these bad actors.",
