How the White House is dealing with a fresh wave of pressure, tonight? We'll talk about it all with a top Biden ally, in the Senate. Meanwhile, Michael Cohen is taking his fight, against his one-time boss, all the way to the Supreme Court. More on his warning about what happens, if he doesn't succeed, when Cohen joins me, in moments. And a bankruptcy hearing for another former Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, devolved into absolute chaos today, as he clashed with the judge, and is also on the verge of losing all of his assets. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We do start with breaking news tonight, as the first sitting Democratic senator has now just broken with President Biden, with Peter Welch of Vermont calling for him to leave the race, and I'm quoting him now, \"For the good of the country.\" Senator Welch wrote in a searing Op-Ed tonight, saying, quote, \"We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night... I'm calling on President Biden to withdraw.\" Now, I should note, so far he is the only Senate Democrat to go this far. It's further even than what you heard from Colorado senator, Michael Bennet, when he was here, last night. But two more Democrats, in the House, echoed his calls today, now making it a total of 10 lawmakers, on Capitol Hill, who say that they believe it's best for President Biden to leave the 2024 race. All of this has created a fresh wave of pressure, on the White House, today, as President Biden has been very clear and firm in his insistence that he is not leaving the race. As many of his allies seem to be wondering today in a new line that we're hearing, repeatedly if you're paying close attention, if that's really his final answer. Listen to what his longtime ally, Nancy Pelosi, how she put it in a very carefully-worded statement, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. WILLIE GEIST, \"MORNING JOE\" CO-ANCHOR, MSNBC: He has said he has made the decision. He has said firmly this week he is going to run. Do you want him to run?",

They know better than anyone how carefully she often chooses her words. That comment came just hours before George Clooney, a longtime Democratic donor, who just co-hosted a $28 million fundraiser for Biden, added to those calls for him to leave the race, saying that he believes the President, who was on the debate stage a few Thursdays ago in Atlanta, is the same one that he saw at that fundraiser. And I'm joined now by the Delaware Democrat, who holds the same Senate seat that President Biden once occupied, who also co-chairs the President's reelection campaign, and is one of his closest allies, on Capitol Hill.

We have a president who has aged. We have a president, who is not the same as he was in 2020. We have a president, who isn't as articulate. Let's not deny reality. But we still have a president, who has good values, good judgment, and if we work very hard, can win.

It was critical of him. I want to get straight to THE SOURCE, tonight, with Michael Cohen, who's joining me tonight, alongside his attorney, Jon-Michael Dougherty. It's great to have you both here. Michael Cohen, of course is the host of the \"Mea Culpa\" podcast, and the \"Political Beatdown\" podcast, and also the Author of the book, \"Revenge.\" So Michael, just you and I know this. But to get people up to speed, you sued Trump, you sued the former Attorney General, Bill Barr and other federal officials in 2021. Your lawsuit was for damages. And it was dismissed and upheld by an appeals court. But obviously, you're hopeful that this is going to clear a hurdle for the Supreme Court, to get in front of them. As you know, Michael, it's difficult for Americans to sue federal law enforcement officials. So I just I'm curious, tell me why you think and why you're hopeful this one will succeed.",

And I believe that it's incumbent upon the Supreme Court of the United States to hear this case, and to remand it back down. You see, the interesting thing, Judge Liman called this case, profoundly violent, in terms of the fact that he had to deny the case and to grant the summary judgment motion. In fact, even the Second Circuit Court of Appeals turned around, and they could not understand what is the precedence to prevent a government official, in this case, specifically, a president, or a willing and complicit Attorney General, from ever doing it again? And the answer is they didn't have one. And the only way that we could ever know, because the rule here, as put down by Justice Thomas, by Justice Clarence Thomas, is, unless it is of the most unusual circumstance. And so I posit to you and again, to your listeners, what could be more unusual, than the President of the United States, weaponizing the Justice Department, to go against a political opponent, or a critic, and incarcerating them, because they refuse to waive a First Amendment constitutional right?",

Some of them have even been criminally charged for helping Trump, to try to overturn the 2020 election. Yet in their roles as National Committee members, delegates, or alternates, they'll have the distinct honor of making him the party's next nominee, officially. Joining me, here tonight, for the first time on THE SOURCE, Republican governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, who I should note just won a primary opponent -- just won a primary against an opponent, who supported false claims about the 2020 election fraud. That happened just a few days ago. As so, Governor, it's great to have you here. And I just wonder, given the lens of that, the election that you just had, how you feel when you see that people, who are fake electors, including people under criminal indictment, are going to be representing states at your party's convention?
