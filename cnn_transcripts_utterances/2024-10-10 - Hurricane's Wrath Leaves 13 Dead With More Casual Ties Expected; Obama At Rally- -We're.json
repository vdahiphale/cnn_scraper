      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextThe breaking news, former President Obama about to speak. This is his first campaign event of this election. It is going to be live here in the next few moments as polls show the race tightening in the crucial battleground states today. Also breaking, the death toll rising from Hurricane Milton but amid the destruction a miraculous story, a mother, her four young children rescued by a TV crew. They had to cling on to an oven, climbing onto a kitchen counter to escape the rising floodwaters. That mother is my guest tonight. And once considered fringe even by her fellow Republicans, now this conspiracy theorist is gaining power and influence in a must-win swing state. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we are following several breaking stories this hour. First, Barack Obama is about to take the stage. This is going to be his first public campaign appearance of the year. The former president moments away from rallying Kamala Harris supporters in Pittsburgh. We're going to bring that to you live, again, this first comments here we have heard this year. Vice President Harris calling up the biggest names in the Democratic Party, hoping that he will energize what was a winning coalition for him at a time when the polls show the race increasingly tight. We're going to bring you Obama's remarks when he begins speaking in just a few moments. You see the governor of Pennsylvania and he's going to be speaking shortly. But first, let's get to the breaking news out of Florida where the death toll rising after the devastating blow from Hurricane Milton, according to officials, at least 13 people are known to be dead. Crews right now are still scrambling to find people, to rescue people who are still stranded in floodwaters. And just a short time ago, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says, they've already rescued nearly 350 people who were trapped in the devastating storm surge, inundated entire neighborhoods. And we'll show you some brand new images here. This is a before and after of the image in Punta Gorda. So you can see what, how things have changed so dramatically in 24 hours. What you're seeing is the area before Hurricane Milton's. So you can look at that. Now, let's look at the after, homes and roads as far as the eye can see under water, just one night. And that is the change. Milton unleashing a historic number of tornadoes across the state at the end of the day, nearly 40 were reported. The deadly outbreak tearing homes apart, leaving major roadways littered with debris, broken road signs, abandoned cars and trucks, obviously impossible in those areas. And we are learning that as of now, about 3 million people are in the dark. Bill Weir begins our coverage OUTFRONT live in St. Petersburg. You know, Bill, last night in this hour, you know, you are getting lashed by waves coming up where you were in St. Petersburg. Milton was making landfall. Now, it is the aftermath. What have you seen?",

But then there's also so much loss in unexpected ways. I mean, hurricanes are really the intersection of nature and human nature. And we use the past to try to figure out what's going to happen next.You know, when Helene was so far offshore, the people on the coast thought, well, there'll be no storm surge and it was devastating. So then this time, Milton, people are afraid of the surge, but instead it was rain. It was wind. It was tornadoes, 100, 150 miles away from the storm, hitting people completely by surprise. So right now, people are trying to process this one-two punch and real really what comes next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEIR (voice-over):  As earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms the tape and livelihoods but as families reel in private grief, it's the material lost that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County, from the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field, peeled like an orange by Milton's winds. The Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium, with taxpayers kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars. What happens now is anyone's guess, especially after the loss of empire neighborhood's retirees and working class American dreamers.

Much of the damage occurred from a record number of tornadoes, some of the tornadic activity caught on camera in places like St. Lucie.St. Lucie hit with nine tornadoes, three of them striking in just 25 minutes. Florida had the most tornado warnings ever in a single day, at least 126 issued by the National Weather Service, and at least 15 confirmed touchdowns. This is what it looked like, for example, driving through places like Fort Pierce today. You can see that there are destroyed buildings everywhere, debris still on the ground. Weather experts say these tornadoes were different. They say they were super charged, meaning that they were more powerful and lasted longer once they were on the ground. We've also heard so much about storms surge, places like Fort Myers and Naples, for example, experience more than five feet of storm surge, water flooding, the first floors of businesses and homes. By day, for example, this is what it looked like places like Punta Gorda, there were boats all over the place on land where they should not be, places like in a park, on sidewalks, once again, showing the power of storm surge during its worse. And now, an overview of some of the flooding and its aftermath. Keep in mind, some spots in Florida saw a months-worth of rain in a single day, more than 18 inches in St. Petersburg, more than 14 inches in Clearwater Beach. Rescues like this one taking place today, for example. This teenager got stuck in the water, needed some help getting out. He thought he could make his way through but ran into trouble, needed rescuing by the Hillsborough County sheriff's department. He's going to be okay. There's also aerial footage from that very same sheriff's department showing more people being rescued. They were also trapped in their homes, needed help getting out this morning due to those high floodwaters. And while this was definitely not the worst-case scenario there in Florida is still so much destruction and loss of life -- Erin.",

It is the biggest prize of all the battleground states.I am told that tonight, the former president is going to yes, lift up Vice President Harris, but also draw a sharp contrast with what her presidency would look like vis-a-vis a second Trump administration. This was one of the reasons that many Democrats believe this race is stuck, if you will, there are still some voters who have questions about Vice President Harris's ability to serve at exactly what she would do. And they also are not necessarily attuned to what a second Trump term would be. So I'm told that former President Obama is going to begin what is going to be a really a three-week series of events across the country drawing that very sharp contrast, going out to working class voters, of course, also a particular message to African American men, particularly younger men, who the Harris campaign has been concerned about that. Erin, this is a coast to coast, all hands on deck effort, former President Bill Clinton will be going to Georgia and North Carolina. He was not a big presence on the campaign trail, of course, four years ago, he will be now. And here in Arizona, the vice president will be arriving here in a short time. Early voting is already underway here. Arizona has a 11 electoral although so that is why for all the talk of the blue wall, of course, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, yes, that's key. But also the Sun Belt states here in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia also critical with this race exceedingly tight in the last three weeks of the campaign here, the Harris campaign is trying to keep all options open. But Barack Obama largely seen as one of the best campaigners of his time, of course, Democrats love to see him. He will be out. I'm told starting tonight.
