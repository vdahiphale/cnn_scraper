It was historic and unprecedented the first time, this time might be a little different because of how the Democrats are gaming it. And this is hugely significant because Ukraine aid, which has been stalled for months over this in party, in fighting the GOP, which has been desperately needed. Ukraine says it needs it now, Democrats say Mike Johnson lay out a plan to get us Ukraine aid in perhaps will save you as job, but it is not that easy for Johnson to do that. CARL HULSE, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES:  Yeah. I think that we were talking to the same people thereafter, the vote and what Marjorie Taylor Greene and others, Thomas Massie, were saying was that they want to look around to see who could be a replacement speaker. But the Democrats are looking at this and going, we're not going to go along with this. I think that Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic leaders, set it to us, the New York times recently, kind of intimated it again after the vote that there would be a discussion about how to rescue Mike Johnson if it came to that, however, there's a price and that price is probably, lets get this Ukraine aid going.",

And she's getting really vocal about it, which I think is part of her process here. She did win as a write-in candidate once before when she lost the Republican primary. She's tough, you know. She's going to be able to weather whatever attacks come her way. I think in the Republican conference in the Senate right now is the biggest split I think I've ever seen. I've talked to members about this. Their lunches are very acrimonious. There's a big, big difference. And I think her, Susan Collins, some other members who say they will never support Trump, you know, they're kind of beating up against the tide of their own membership. And I think that election primary in Ohio last week was very telling to people like Lisa Murkowski. There was a big establishment primary Republican candidate who was easily defeated, much more easily I think than we expected by the more MAGA-aligned candidate. And you know, you look at her and her father was such a big Republican politician. It's like what's become of our party and they're worried about it. RAJU: Yes. She's had such a fascinating track with the Republican Party, the Tea Party wing, she'd sustain that, she ran as a write-in candidate.

You have some Republicans in Congress who will very harshly criticized things he says or take issue with them. But at the end of the day and were starting to see this come to a head now.

This is why you must vote for the establishment candidate. It felt flat. I mean, he lost by nearly 20 points.
