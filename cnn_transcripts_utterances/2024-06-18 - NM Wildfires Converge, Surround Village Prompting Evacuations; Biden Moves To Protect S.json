That's coming up.Also this hour, a warning about an online scam costing Americans billions of dollars. Victims and their families are sitting down with CNN as they fight to make sure no one else has to suffer from the phenomenon known as pig butchering. Plus, President Biden unveils a sweeping new executive action on immigration aimed at protecting undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens. Border state Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, is here to react. Leading this hour, the brutal scorching heatwave punching the United States right now is more than half the country faces dangerously high temperatures. Those high temperatures are fueling fires across the western United States made worse by driving gusty winds. Federal officials say there are 29 large fires burning in the United States including a pair of fast growing fires tearing across southern New Mexico right now. Multiple fires also exploded across parts of California overnight. Officials predict the fires could get even worse as temperatures continue to rise this week. In just moments we are going to be joined by New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham who just declared a state of emergency in parts of New Mexico due to the fires. But first, let's go to California where 10 large wildfires are burning. CNN's Natasha Chen is near one of them. It's called the post fire. It's in Northwestern Los Angeles County. Natasha, how are firefighters working to get the post fire under control?",

And the video that we just shot, hopefully, we're showing you now, exclusive video, actually, of these fire crews taking everything that they can with them, including basic life support medical aid, so that they can take care of themselves should anything happen in the middle of nowhere, essentially. This is them trying to get to the southern perimeter of this fire, which has been difficult to work with because there is steep and rugged terrain there. And on the north side of this post fire is better taken care of. Overall, about a quarter percent contained 15,000 acres burned. We're at the command post where they're still just mapping this out.There are supposed to be high winds warnings until 6:00 p.m. local time.

And anywhere where there have been evacuation warnings or orders, people have frequently told us there was barely any time to prepare for this.The winds shift, and next thing you know it's at your doorstep. There are definitely very dry conditions, high wind gusts, as we mentioned, a heat that is building. Next weekend, we're expected to get more of that heat. Also have to mention, the last two winters really, we saw a lot of precipitation for California. And so that means a lot of vegetation grew, and that also produces a lot of fuel for fires to burn throughout the area.

I think it's pretty well known across the country that FEMA wasn't created to deal with the rebuilding aspects, that gets harder.Right now, we've focused on making sure that we save lives and take care of New Mexicans. New Mexicans are incredibly generous. Ranchers and farmers from all across the state, the state fair in Albuquerque, properties are all stood up for livestock and ranching families to spend as much time as they need to with their horses and cows and pets. We attend shelters up, food, sleeping arrangements, showers. People are giving donations of clothing and supplies. So for now, making sure that all of those operations are steady, and we can move them as we need, I'm confident that we can do that. More firefighters is always valuable. But you pointed out at the early part of your report the west competes for these fire resources because New Mexico is not the only place where we have a serious fire raging in this heat.

Nor can we do that on the ground investigation with the intensity it will take until we get our arms around the fire a little bit better.Tonight, FEMA will have a satellite imagery for us so that we can look at structures in the broader area, because, as you know, New Mexico is a very rural state. So we have people that don't live in the small villages where the fires are encroaching or where the fires have passed through. So we'll have more information for New Mexicans and more New Mexicans or Americans who I know worry about us and have us in their thoughts and prayers.

And it didn't leave yesterday in Toledo.Look at the high temperature in Toledo breaking record at 99. Jake, I lived in Detroit for five years. We never got close to that number. But another 150 records will likely be broken before Saturday. And we have excessive heat warnings into Maine where they may see their highest temperatures up there ever. The feels like temperature in Syracuse right now, it was 101. For Newark, it feels like 97. Pittsburgh 95.

All that wind is here and here. So not around the center that's why it's not yet a tropical storm, but it will likely be one and it is forecast to be one but a 45 mile per hour storm. Not a wind event. Not really a surge event, maybe a couple of three feet. But it's a rain event like hours and hours and hours of rainfall there. Northern parts of Mexico and also into Texas, Flood Watches are in effect. But some spots, especially in northern Mexico, just south of the Rio Grande, could pick up 10 inches of rain.

And in fact, this is an issue that has divided many Senate Republicans, many Senate Republicans against it and many others in the time since Friday, Supreme Court ruling said that they would be open in expressing some interest in potentially coming around to that legislation. But that in the end of the day here today, Jake, did not happen. And certainly we heard from one senator who worked very hard on gun control measures, Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut.

Congressman Crenshaw, I'm sure you don't like how Biden enacted this through executive action. But do you have issues with the policy itself? REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): I do. I'll get to those in a second. First, I want to say how odd it is to agree with CNNs analysis on something. This is electoral politics, it's pretty clear that they did a poll. I think CNN reported they did do a poll. It pulls well, and they're far left more progressive base that they need to appease right now. And I think what's frustrating about all this is that there's not really a guiding principle for this administration when it comes to immigration. What do they believe? I mean, they rolled back all Trump's policies, why? Because they're Trump's policies. All right. And then we had a massive disaster at the border for the last three years. And they finally said, geez, even Democrat governors and mayors are complaining, maybe we should do something about that, we're going to lose independence. And so they did a couple of things. But we have yet to see if there's a really meaningful things that made some deal with Mexico to get Mexico to do more. They just announced this asylum change, but we have yet to see the results of it. And that made the progressives mad so now they're doing this. So it's very reactive. And it's all political, which makes it cynical. Now, do I like rulemaking instead of lawmaking? No, I also don't like that. But let's get to the policy itself, your actual question. There's a couple of problems with it. One, like any change to immigration, doing a favor for one group, because you know, you feel compassion for them, the thing is, is you're still allowing them to get favors over the people who did it right. My stepmom is one of those. My stepmom is married to U.S. citizen, my dad. And they did it the right way. Right? She didn't come here illegally. There's -- you just did it the right way, you waited in line. And there's a lot of people like that. When I talked to immigrants who have done it the right way, this stuff really makes them upset. It makes them mad. Because it is hard to get citizenship, it's hard to get a green card, it's hard to wait in line. We're America, we're going to have a line out the door forever. And it's going to be infinitely long forever. So you have to have a process and it has to be fair. And look, the current process is it's not impossible to get a green card, but you'd have to leave the country to apply properly. That's the current process. Now he's saying, you don't have to do that. You know what, all the other people who did it the right way, you know what, you did the wrong way, it's OK, no consequences. So I do have a problem with that on a just an ethical level. You could also suggest that because this now exists, there's no opportunity for bride sales effectively. So if a woman's been here for 10 years, and now they know that they get a green card this way, what a trafficking groups do, what are those groups do that prey on illegal immigrants? They look for opportunities like this. That's a possibility as well, it's another down of what they're thinking about.",

Which by the way, you should want, you shouldn't want dumb bombs being used in Gaza, you should want precision weapons. F-15s, I mean, they're not going to be F15s over Gaza tomorrow, just because you saw them the Israelis, these weapons are primarily for deterrence against Iran. There shouldn't be any disagreement about that. And look, these senators know that, the congressmen who are holding this knew that, the administration knows that. The problem is they have a progressive left wing base and an election year. It doesn't like Israel and likes to chant from river to the sea. And so again, they're playing electoral politics instead of just following consistent guiding principles. And that's a problem because it gets you in these contradictory statements and these contradictory positions. It's better just to follow a guiding principles and leave it at that. Israel is defending itself, and we're going to help Israel our ally.
