      "sentences": "Well, the leaders of these two most heavily sanctioned countries in the world met face-to-face at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian far east, where Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, um, toured a brand new Russian space, rocket launch facility. President Putin indicating that Russia would look to help North Korea with its space technology. Later at a formal dinner, Kim voice support for what he said was Russia`s fight against imperialism, a reference to Russia`s standoff with the west over Ukraine. But in terms of tangible results, frankly, there`s not been much, no agreement signed as far as we know, no joint news conference, the whole visit carefully choreographed and shrouded in secrecy. But of course, that doesn`t rule out the possibility that a deal may have been done behind the scenes. Russia desperately needs weapons in ammunition to sustain its war in Ukraine and North Korea is believed to have vast stock piles. North Korea in turn has an ambitious missile and satellite launch program, which may well benefit from Russia knowhow. But of course, that kind of transfer may have profound consequences, both on the volatile Korean Peninsula and on the front lines in Ukraine. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Maybe the cost of food at the school cafeteria has goneup, or the amount of money used to spend on a movie ticket in popcorn is now only enough to get you the ticket. Now that`s inflation. The term used to measure how much prices go up in the United States economy over a certain period of time. U.S. inflation accelerated in August for the second straight month, pushed up by rising gas prices. Across the country on a month-to-month basis, prices rose 0.6% in August, compared with a 0.2% gain in July. All this will impact the U.S. federal reserve, which will decide next week if there will be another interest rate hike. A hike means you must pay more on interest charges from your credit card company for mortgages and even car loans will become more expensive. We`ll hear more now on what to expect.

Located in Southern Turkey, the Taurus mountains are home to some of the world`s deepest caves. Up next, let`s talk about this intense international rescue mission causing quite the brouhaha in one of Turkey`s super deep caves on Tuesday. A researcher was doing his thing, exploring the cave when he suddenly got really sick and he couldn`t climb out on his own. Here`s CNN International Correspondent, Jomana Karadsheh with more.

Dickey appeared to be smiling, giving thumbs up. We heard from Turkish officials saying that he seemed to be fine and that they were going to get him on a chopper out of there and move him to Mersin Hospital in Southern Turkey where he will be headed for the medical treatment he needs. Now, this has been a very, very complex operation. It has lasted days. Mark Dickey, an experienced caver was part of an international and a local expedition. And when he fell ill at about more than 3000 feet, more than thousand meters from the surface. But over the past few days he had been stabilized. He was improving. He was walking. He was talking. We even saw a video recorded by -- released by Dickey where he spoke about his condition, but also explaining that he was still not OK on the inside and that he needed medical treatment. And this was such a complex operation again, because this is, uh, one of the deepest caves in the world. We`re also talking according to experts about a cave with very narrow and winding passages. So putting him on a stretcher and getting him out of there, would`ve been very, very difficult. So they have to look at the different options consulting with doctors to make sure they can get him out of there. And finally, this operation, this extraction began on Saturday and it involved nearly 200 rescuers from different countries. It was a real multinational effort to try and get him out of there. And they moved in phases over the past few days. They would move. They would stop, rest a bit, and then move again until they made it out of that cave. This certainly is going to be good news for the family, friends, colleagues of Mark Dickey and all those who have been involved in this rescue operation that has brought an end to this ordeal.
