These are youutility workers AT&amp;T workers bringing in heavy machinery. There is a pole in the back there, a power pole that they are working to restore. Some movement and progress is happening. We've also confirmed with MEMA, Mississippi Emergency Management Agency that there are still search and rescue operations going on right now, but they have accounted for all of the people that were missing statewide. Originally, it was four from Friday's storm and tornado. And right now, they are looking for anyone who might still be in distress and might need some help, but everyone is accounted for, something Fred that will be really big here in this recovery journey because this is going to take some time will be that major disaster declaration by the President that he approved this morning, that opens up federal resources and money for things like debris removal, for help with grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and also low cost loans for those that have uninsured properties. This tornado has undoubtedly cost tremendous loss here, a tremendous toll between human lives lost, but also property and homes lost. I spoke with Erwin Macon as I was standing next to a debris pile that was his home, a mobile home park. The only thing he could recover from that was a piece of luggage, a carry on. In it, a pair of tennis shoes, a couple of shirts and jeans. That is all that he has tangible to his name to this day. He told me he was in tremendous fear on Friday.

An official in the Prime Minister's office saying that the Prime Minister called the Defense Minister to his office for discussion and saying he had lost confidence against him, because he had acted against the government, and against the coalition, against the Prime Minister while the Prime Minister was abroad.

One is that at any moment when Putin feels that he is not making much battlefield progress, we have seen him invoke his nuclear arsenal in some way or another.In February and March of last year, he did it early in the war to threaten that if the West intervened, he might be tempted to use these. In the fall, we had a significant nuclear crisis, that you may recall, President Biden himself talked about at length, comparing the moment to the Cuban Missile Crisis, because of Putin threats. This is the third time around, and this time, what he is basically saying is that he is going to place these weapons in a country that can threaten both Poland and Ukraine. And I think it's an opportunity to try to rattle both of them. I think, though, he is finding that the nuclear card isn't making as much progress for him as it did at the beginning.",

Obviously, he's got Belarus. Obviously, he has Iran, which is providing him with drones. North Korea, which is providing some artillery shells and other ammunition, and of course, this strange relationship and the most important one with China.

I thought it was interesting today that the administration said they see no evidence that Russia is considering using a weapon. But I don't think we've heard the last of this.
