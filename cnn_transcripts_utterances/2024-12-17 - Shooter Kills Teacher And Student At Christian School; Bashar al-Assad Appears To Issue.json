CNN is unable to verify if Assad still controls the Syrian presidency Telegram account, and if the statement is authentic. Our Fred Pleitgen reports from Moscow.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Syrians celebrate the demise of the Assad regime, the deposed dictator, seemingly delusional, apparently speaking out for the first time since fleeing to Russia. His statement on the social media page of the former Syrian presidency, appearing to be from Assad himself, datelined, Moscow. I have never sought positions for personal gain, but have always considered myself as a custodian of a national project, the statement says. This after Syrians ransacking Assad's palace discovered the luxury the dictator and his family were living in, including a garage with dozens of luxury cars, including Ferraris and a Lamborghini. Assad's wife Asma, also known for her lavish outfits, once called, quote, a rose in the desert by \"Vogue\" magazine. But Assad, also admitting, as rebels were closing in on his palace, it was Russian leader Vladimir Putin who bailed him out. Assad fleeing to Russia's air base in Syria as he claims to oversee combat operations but then, quote, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from the battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen, his statement reads. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the bases command arrange for an immediate evacuation to Russia, on the evening of Sunday, December 8th. That was not only the end of Assad's rule in Syria, but possibly also the beginning of the end of Russia's military footprint in Syria, as Russian forces have been seen apparently flying some of their equipment out of their Air Force Base. And Israel is now busy bombing Syrian military installations like this naval base in Latakia. Russian Middle East experts warning about the huge loss to Russia in the wake of Assad's fall. When I saw these ships with our weapons burning, I simply felt like crying. This expert says, these are our weapons, our gear, after all, and our help to the Syrians to protect their statehood but those now in charge in Syria are working on a new statehood without Assad, the former dictator, seemingly grappling with his loss of power. When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, the statement says, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless.

The two had been bickering for some time over a financial mechanism and Germany's economy. But, what resulted in this was Scholz leading a minority government. That meant he had very few other options left to him, apart from calling this confidence vote.

That animosity was very clear to see on the floor of the Bundestag today, with all parties leveling accusations at one another. Scholz took another opportunity to remind the German people that the reason this government collapsed in his mind was because the liberal partners in his coalition were not prepared to agree with his policies and timetables.

Whilst the outcome of the election is difficult to predict right now, all signs are pointing towards f Friedrich Merz and the CDU becoming Germany's largest party and therefore, keys to the chancellery. And as one person said to me today, it will almost certainly spell the end of Olaf Scholz's political career.Sebastian Shukla, CNN, Berlin.",

The question is fair deal, a deal that will not only introduce a ceasefire that is highly likely to be broken within the first 24 hours after being introduced, but a deal that will actually end the war and prevent new war from happening. This is the real task for state men.But what we see around is a word game, like politicians and leaders, they play with words and constructive messages, indicate their readiness to engage, but the moment they go down to the very substance of the conversation, this will be a very tough moment for all stakeholders. When leaders are saying we want peace, that's easy. When you get to defining the terms of this peace and the specific solutions that have to be implemented, it gets really difficult. Like take the NATO issue, we hear different opposite views on that. Take the land issue. No leader of Ukraine can legally concede territory of Ukraine enshrined in its constitution. So we cannot speak about any transfer. And most importantly, you can ask hundreds of questions of what Ukraine should do. But, the key to peace is in Moscow. And as long as Putin is not part of negotiations in good faith, everything else, the importance of anything, everything else diminishes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
