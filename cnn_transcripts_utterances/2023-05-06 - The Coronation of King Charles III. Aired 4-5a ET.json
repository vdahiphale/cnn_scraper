Guests waiting for the next hour, when King Charles III makes his way to Westminster Abbey.The doors to the royal church have already been open for an hour and a bit. Guests have been arriving for the first crowning of a British monarch in seven decades. About 2,200 deaths have been arriving at Westminster Abbey. A little later, we expect King Charles III to move from St. James Palace to Buckingham Palace by car. From there, he will begin his journey to Westminster Abbey with his wife, Queen Camilla, in the first of two processions. Today, the royal couple will ride to the service in the diamond jubilee state coach, drawn by six Windsor Grey horses you will see in the procession there. Let's get more on what you can expect today and the momentous occasion of this. Trisha Goddard joins me now from London. Trisha, the mood here is just electrifying. It's a family occasion.

They may appear distressed. I just want to tell people that we're not talking about bad people. We are talking about people who have got a lot of problems. Just to put people's minds at rest. There are groups like FTAC, Fixed Threat Assessment, where the police work with mental health workers. There's also Coast, an organization that works with police to support people with mental health issues. So anybody in the crowd who is listening, if you see someone who is really distressed, upset, this is a chance for us all to come together and accept people, whatever their troubles are, whatever their weaknesses are. Please reach out, help them. There are organizations that can help people because this will set off a lot of things for people.",

But I think it is going to be completely fascinating. I have in my mind's eye not only the coronation of the queen, which I wrote about, but also the coronation in 1937 of the last king and queen. And it looked vastly different. There were hundreds and hundreds of robes. There were lots of tiaras. I don't think, as I've been watching people coming in, I don't think I've seen one tiara. I don't know if there's a ban but I think it's just more of a reflection of the 21st century, the involvement of women in various elements of the ceremony. People from around the world, from Jill Biden and all the other countries, we will be seeing something quite unique in the world. And also there is, of course, the involvement of the Commonwealth, which is singular to the United Kingdom. (MUSIC PLAYING) NOBILO (voice-over): As 70 years have passed since the last coronation, we have seen changes between the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 and today. You've touched on some of them. But what else should be looking out for as a window into society today and the adjustments that are being made to reflect that?",

I think what we are seeing is a much different representation of what Britain is right now. This is a 21st century coronation. So as we look at the congregation, we see people who would not have been there in 1953 or 1937. We see representatives of the king's charities. We see people recognized for their service. And I think it's going to be fascinating to have a 14-year-old boy greeting the king and the king telling him that he is there to serve and that is going to be a real theme of this coronation, the notion of glad service.",
