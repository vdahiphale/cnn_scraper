Authorities telling CNN there are new developments in the investigation. CNN's Veronica Miracle is in Idaho. She is on the phone with the latest. Veronica, what can you tell us?VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Amara, we just heard moments ago and confirmed -- CNN can confirm according to two federal law enforcement sources that a suspect has been taken into custody in connection to this investigation into the murders of four University of Idaho students. The sources are telling CNN the arrest was made by the FBI in northeastern Pennsylvania, all the way on the other side of the country. This is per our Josh Campbell and Mark Morales. This comes just moments after we were told that there's going to be a press conference today at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time as you have said. Obviously, major developments going to be announced here today officially from the Moscow police department. And this comes nearly seven weeks since the murders of Xana Kernodle -- Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves happened on an off- campus home near the University of Idaho. The colonel says that they were murdered and stabbed in their sleep, obviously a gruesome crime. And it has shaken this entire small rural college town here. And, of course, the families have been reeling and have been asking for answers this entire time. But the Moscow police department has been steadfast in releasing very few details the entire time saying that they have had strong leads and that they were keeping information close to the investigation to protect the integrity of the investigation. Well, now, we are expecting that they will be announcing today at this press conference that an arrest has been made in the murders of these four students, Amara.",

This is now the third week in a row the hospital admissions for, you know, people hospital -- people admitted to the hospital with the flu has gone steadily down.Now, a couple of caveats here. First of all, this doesn't include holiday activity because this looks at the week of December 18, so it doesn't include people moving around after Christmas or after New Year's. We'll have to see what happens with that. Also, flu activity is still super, super high in the United States. Nearly every country -- every state at high or very high levels, Amara.",

A friend called, asking for help, asking to be rescued, and so Jay Withey took it upon himself to get in his car and drive towards helping that friend. He got stuck. He ended up picking up a guy who didn't know was wearing a light jacket and not prepared for the storm, and had him join him in his vehicle.By later that night, his vehicle couldn't move anymore. An elderly woman knocked on his door and said she wanted a gas, so she joined the group in that vehicle. At one point Jay Withey went, he said to 10 houses begging for people to let him in. He offered $500 just to sleep on the floor saying he was in fear of his life. All of them turn them away saying no, I'm sorry, so they went back to the car, spent the night, took turns taking naps by morning -- by Saturday morning, one of them had to use the restroom, so the mechanic used his phone's GPS and found this school behind me, EDGE Academy. And he said this school is going to have heat, it's going to have restrooms, probably food too. So, he went and he used some old brake pads to break a window on the side of the school, managed to gain entry, went in there with this old elderly woman and the young man he found. And then later, he noticed in the streets surrounding the school that there were several cars, at least seven vehicles, elderly people stranded in their cars, so he went and got them, brought them into school -- into the school, he broke into the cafeteria, got them cereal so that everyone could eat. Eventually, he managed to break into a closet and get a snowblower working, even without the key because he's a mechanic. And he later, at one point, went and cleared the snow around all of the vehicles. But bottom line, he was able to help save these people. And he felt bad, of course, for breaking in, and so he left a note. And here's what the note said. To whomever it may concern, I'm terribly sorry about breaking the school window and for breaking in the kitchen. Got stuck at 8:00 p.m. Friday and slept in my truck with two strangers just trying not to die. There were seven elderly people also stuck and out of fuel. I had to do what to save everyone and get them shelter and food at a bathroom. He signed the letter Merry Christmas Jay. And just one more note. One of those houses -- one of the people they stopped by begging to be let in, they came and found him later. And they said that they were so sorry, they couldn't sleep all night having denied him entry. And Jay Withey says he's a religious man. He said, you know, if you would let me in, I wouldn't have been able to save all these people. At least 10 people that he saved that night. All of them exchange numbers. They are planning to stay in touch, but finally a good story out of this terrible storm, Amara.",

Not so much a flood watch for big rivers and lakes and the lake itself, this is really for the localized area that are the low-lying areas where the water may be seeping into people's basements, may be seeping into the crawlspaces and the like. There's going to be some rain showers and there are some rain showers right now, but it's not significant. This would have to get a lot more severe for there to be widespread flooding. So, that is some good news.56 degrees on Tuesday. They will take it there, absolutely. There's still going to be snow melt. There are still going to be some rain showers. The showers are on the radar right now, but they are widely scattered, not widespread. Down to the south, I can't say the same thing. There are some severe flooding going on now in New Orleans. Also, severe thunderstorm warnings for places just to the west of Mobile. Kind of the same system that made the snow for Denver, the south side, the warm side, making the severe weather possible today. Back out to the West. We are seeing the next storm system coming into the West. A big weather-maker flood watches out here, as you said, millions and millions of people in these flood watches. I'm looking at some of the computer models from this morning. And there are models that are putting out 12 inches of rainfall in the next 60 hours. 12 inches of rainfall. You push that up into the Sierra, you're going to get snow and a lot of it. Some spots could pick up six to 10 feet in the highest of the Sierra. That's good news for the spring when we're going to use that water to one, drink water plants, and put back into the reservoirs. Now, if you're going out for New Year's Eve, you may not want that rainfall. The rain is going to be early into probably San Francisco and then late into LA. As we work our way though, into the afternoon evening, New York City is looking a little bit drier. Some air is dry up -- coming up into parts of New York State and also even into Boston that may shut that rain off just in time for the big ball drop. Expecting the same thing in LA still raining around nine o'clock in the evening but by midnight, if you're outside or going to go see some fireworks, I think it starts to dry up, Amara.",

If you're going to do that do not bring an umbrella, do not bring a backpack, do not bring any coolers or blankets, or chairs. People are, you know really just asked to bring the bare minimum.
