My co-anchor Brianna Keilar is live for us in Washington.And this afternoon, we're witnessing two very different political campaigns. While Democrats are calling for the incumbent president to quit his race for reelection, Republicans are celebrating their presidential nominee less than a week after he survived an attempted assassination. And a few hours on this stage behind me, Donald Trump will take a victory lap when he formally accepts his party's nomination for president. His speech tonight could be different from any we've heard from him before. We're told it's been rewritten after Saturday's shooting and is now expected to focus on a message of unity. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live for us here at the RNC in Milwaukee. And Kristen, what are you hearing about Trump's speech? And how are lawmakers expecting it to be a different version of Donald Trump tonight? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I think that right now lawmakers that I'm talking to are waiting to see what exactly that speech looks like. There's always a lot of talk about Donald Trump changing, pivoting, is he a different person or not. And not everybody has had a chance to sit down and talk with him since that assassination attempt on Saturday. But if you talk to his senior advisors, they do say that he is a changed man. And he has told allies that part of his speech, he wants to lean heavily into what happened on Saturday. And the idea that there was some sort of divine intervention that saved him from being killed on that stage. And we actually heard a little bit of that in a video from an earlier event. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This has been our best campaign and then I got shot. What was that? How does that happen? That was an amazing, horrible thing. Amazing thing. And in many ways, it changes your attitude, your viewpoint on life. And I think honestly, I think you appreciate God even more. I really do because something happened. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are really leaning into the Trumpian kind of celebration, performance aspect of this. Donald Trump we know likes a good show, they really save the kind of big names -- oh, Tucker Carlson also coming out, big ally of Donald Trump, also big fan of J. D. Vance's.

It's a battleground state, one that Democrats are eyeing very closely as part of the blue wall. What do you need to hear from former President Trump tonight that gives you confidence that he's going to win this stage? SCOTT WALKER, PRESIDENT, YOUNG AMERICA'S FOUNDATION: Well, two things. I think one even before all this happened in the last few weeks, we wanted a fighter who is fighting for us. So, affordability, when I fill my gas tank up the Kwik Trip, it's a buck and a quarter more than it was four years ago. When my kids, my son and daughter-in-law are building a new home. It's cost him almost a $1,000 per month more in their mortgage payments. Affordability is a big deal. So, we need to hear that Donald Trump is going to fight for families like those, we're seeing the gap between wages and cost out there. And that's a good fighter, that's a fighter that won '16, not a fighter for the sake of fighting but a fighter for them. The other part I think we just saw a snippet of in that little tease from the shot -- the video that was taken, and both Scott and I reacted to that. He's going to be reflective, who couldn't be? You almost died, you were not just inches, you were just fraction of an inch from dying, that's going to affect anybody to be reflected. I want to hear about the thoughts about his family, his kids, particularly his grandkids, and I wasn't going to let them down nor America down. Man, I'm ready to go with that.

And I'll tell you another thing. These Democrats who are trying to throw Joe Biden off the ticket right now, they say he's not capable of being president in January, have some guts, call for the president to resign today.

And that's why we got to make the case as a Republican here that we get you. J.D. Vance helps, because not just on economic policy, but on just getting the forgotten men and women. He lived that life. His mother as he mentioned talked about, drug addict, raised by his grandmother, lived in abject poverty. There's a lot of people here and across the country that feel forgotten.

And we should expect sort of more of the same as he tries to continue staying engaged, and really doing the daily work of the presidency as well, in addition to the political work that is so important right now. But as you said, Boris, the timing truly could not be worse for this campaign. The president has said over and over again, since that terrible debate performance that what he needs to do now is get out into the country and show voters, show his skeptics and critics that he can run for a second term and do another four years at the White House. But now he is going to be isolating in his home in Rehoboth when, at a moment when he is completely politically isolated too. You know, we have lawmakers continuing to come out and publicly call on him to leave the race. We have donors saying the money is completely drying up. Of course, there's our reporting about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a private conversation telling President Biden within the last week or so that she believes the polling shows that he cannot win. So increasingly, Boris, the picture that we are getting is one that is just completely political untenable for the Biden campaign right now.",

I want to point out during the vice president's remarks, she actually started by thanking service members saying her and the president are so proud of the U.S. military, even touting a health care expansion for veterans. This comes one day after perhaps the most powerful moment thus far of the Republican National Convention when Gold Star families came forward, naming loved ones who died during the Abbey Gate suicide bombing during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, a moment in which they said that President Biden mishandled. The vice president then went on to say that this is an existential election and took aim at the vice presidential nominee on the Republican side, J.D. Vance. She said that the vice presidential nominee has a compelling story about saying that he did not tell the full story to the American people last night because he didn't talk about Project 2025. She went on to say that if you stand for unity, you have to more do more than use the word. She say that -- she said that you can stand for unity if you stand for taking freedoms from women, for example, with reproductive rights or overturning a free and fair election. Harris also adding that she believes that the vice presidential nominee and that President Trump are attempting to distract from their record and their agenda. A senior democratic advisor tells CNN that privately President Biden has actually begun asking if the vice president could beat Donald Trump in a head to head race in November.

And what do we see there? What we see is that in both of those states, we see that Kamala Harris is running stronger than Joe Biden is. In Pennsylvania, Joe Biden's down by three points at Donald Trump. Harris is down by just one. In Virginia, a state Democrats have won in every single election going back to 2008. Yes, Biden is ahead. But just by three, Harris is ahead by five. And this is a consistent pattern that we have seen throughout the electoral map, when you average the polls, and you don't just look at any one individual poll, you do see Harris doing about a point or two better. And you may say to yourself, hey, that's not that much. But you know, elections in this country are decided by the smallest of margins. And more than that Harris is able to do that, despite the fact that her name recognition is not as high as Joe Biden, I believe she has more room to grow.

And if you look back in the 2020 cycle through this point, it was 100 percent of the days, every single day in 2020 Joe Biden led Donald Trump. In this particular year, if you take a look at the polling average, it's a big fat zero, it is zero folks, he has led nationally and none of the days when you take a look at the average of polls, this race has been consistent, and it's been consistently bad for Joe Biden.
