Look, when the debate -- right before the debate was held, Biden was behind.But he was only behind a couple of points, though that would have defeated him because of the Electoral College. Now, he's behind four or five, six points, depending on a survey. That is absolutely devastating. It would actually mean that Biden would lose every single one of the seven swing states.
