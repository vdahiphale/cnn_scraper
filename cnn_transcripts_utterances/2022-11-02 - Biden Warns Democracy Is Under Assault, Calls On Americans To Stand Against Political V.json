We must vote knowing what is at stake and not just the policy of the moment, but institutions that have held us together as we sought a more perfect union are also at stake.The extreme MAGA element of the Republican Party, which is a minority of that party as I said earlier, but is its driving force, is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020, to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until the election is over, they are starting well before it. They're starting now. They've emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It is estimated that there are more than 300 election deniers on the ballot all across America this year. We can't ignore the impact this is having on our country. So, we're asking you to think long and hard about the moment we're in. In a typical year, we are often not faced with questions of whether the vote we cast will preserve democracy or put us at risk. But this year, we are. This year, I hope you'll make the future of our democracy an important part of your decision to vote and how you vote. I hope you'll ask a simple question of each candidate you might vote for: Will that person accept the legitimate will of the American people, of people voting in his district or her district? Will that person accept the outcome of the election win or lose? The answer to that question is vital. And in my opinion, it should be decisive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks for staying up with us. Joining us now is Vermont Independent Senator and former Democratic presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders. Senator Sanders, appreciate you joining us. You heard President Biden say democracy is on the ballot. Americans can't take democracy for granted any longer. Is he right? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):   Yes, he is. Look when you have a former President who went around saying that the only way he could lose an election is if there was fraud, think about what an outrageous statement that is. You know, I've run in many elections, sometimes I've won, sometimes I've lost. People can lose elections, and clearly what Trump and the extreme right-wing are trying to do now is undermine faith in American democracy. So the President is absolutely right. This is a major, major issue. People fought -- I don't have to explain this to anybody. People fought and died against Hitler, against the authoritarian governments in order to make sure that in this country, it is the people who determine the future of our nation, but you have people right now who are trying to undermine American democracy is really outrageous. COOPER;   We were just showing that poll of 51 percent of voters put the economy/inflation as the number one issue? Do you think the President's speech is going to change any minds ahead of this election?",

It's about whether or not women can control their own bodies. It's about whether we deal with the existential threat of climate change, which threatens the wellbeing of our kids, and future generations.But of course, Anderson, it is about the economy as well. Right now, what we are seeing is some 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. They are struggling to get by, while the billionaire class has never ever, ever had it so good, more wealth and income inequality today than any time in American history. And when we talk about inflation, you know, what everybody should know is that the profits of the oil industry are record breaking, huge profits for ExxonMobil, and the other companies. The food industry, people can't afford to buy the groceries they need. Food industry profits are soaring. Airline industry profits are soaring. So what has happened is that in the midst of the war in Ukraine, the breakdown in supply chains, which are important parts of why inflation is high, all over the world, Republicans forget to tell the American people, inflation is not just an American issue, 8.2 percent here, that's bad. It's worse in Europe, over 11 percent. So yes, the economy is very, very important and we cannot do as the Republicans wanted give massive tax breaks to the rich, cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That is not a solution to the economic problems of the country.",

Again, in Europe, in Germany, England, throughout Europe, inflation is high. It is a global problem.But let me say this, Republicans say that it is Democratic spending and what they really mean by that is it was the American Rescue Plan, and I want everybody watching to go back to March 2021, when the American Rescue Plan was passed. At that moment, 3,000 Americans were dying from COVID every single day, in the midst of the worst pandemic we have had in a hundred years. At that moment, unemployment was soaring, small businesses were going bankrupt. Hospitals were unable to continue because of so many people coming in for COVID. Yes, we passed the American Rescue Plan, that's 1,400 bucks for every man, woman, and child, which saved many families. We put money into hospitals, so that they continue to go, we extended on employment. We did a $300.00 tax credit for parents.

People here, the Democrats in Arizona know what they need are the numbers. They need the turnout. So they think that Obama hitting all of the battleground states is a good sign when it comes to control of Congress. The question will be is, will it really carry through enough to sort of blunt any Republican energy. What Democrats will tell you, at least here in Arizona is that they might not be exactly voting for Democrats on the ballot. I didn't really talk to anybody here who said that they were incredibly inspired by Katie Hobbs who is running for Governor, but they are terrified of the Republicans. This is a Trump-backed ticket. The people on the ticket are election deniers, and we've seen you know these vigilantes show up at ballot boxes with guns.

Short time ago we received this new video, Speaker Pelosi leaving her home in San Francisco and security presence now surrounding her.Earlier today members of the Pelosi family gathered with police to hear the 911 call and watch body camera footage of the attack on Paul Pelosi. And this comes the same day that the Capitol Police confirmed reporting by CNN and the Washington Post that they had cameras on the Pelosi residence which caught the breaking and the police response. But the cameras were not actively monitored at the time of the attack. In other words, no one was actually watching them in real time. Source tell CNN it wasn't until about 10 minutes after the incident when an officer notice the lights and sirens in the video. Today congressional Democrats now demanding answers from the Capitol police about security for members of Congress. Court documents filed Tuesday say that the suspect David DaPape allegedly told officers and medics at the scene that he was on a, quote suicide mission. I'm joined now by CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. First of all, the surveillance system the Capitol Police, no one actually watching it. Does that surprise you? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Not in the slightest bit. It's actually kind of a dumb question if people are thinking like, there's 1,800 cameras feeding into a command center in Washington, D.C., there aren't 1,800 officers each watching one of those monitors. What they're doing is they're listening to the police radio, they're watching for incidents, they're zeroing in on cameras where something's happening, they are much more attentive to the camera that's on the residence where Nancy Pelosi is actually staying in Washington that night, than a place that's 3,000 miles away where their protectee is not present. So, it's unreasonable to think that they would have been staring at that.",

And just to give you an idea of sort of how chaotic this was, it was December 31st.
