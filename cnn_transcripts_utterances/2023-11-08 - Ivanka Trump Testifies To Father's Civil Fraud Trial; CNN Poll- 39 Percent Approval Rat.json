The state's final witness, Ivanka Trump, who was initially a defendant until an appeals court dismissed the case against her. Today, on the stand, she largely distanced herself from detailed knowledge of her father's financial statements and the valuations that went into them, saying, \"That was not something I was involved in.\" On multiple other occasions, she said \"I do not recall\" when asked about financing for several properties, including the former Trump Hotel in Washington. As \"The Washington Post\" reported at the time, she oversaw bidding for the property, as well as securing agreement with the federal General Services Administration for use of the landmark property. Government official back then telling \"The Post\" that Miss Trump said about her own family: \"She fully anticipates her daughter growing up in the business, and being out there years down the road negotiating the renewal.\" The family sold the hotel last year.

She answered the questions, although not always to the satisfaction of the Attorney General's Office, but their main focus today were the loans that she was involved in, and that was on the golf course known as Doral in Florida, as well as the old Post Office Building that she helped negotiate with the General Services Administration, the federal government to get that lease.So they asked a lot of questions about that, showing documents indicating that she was involved in these loans, that she knew that her father's financial statements were being provided for these loans, and her testimony was that she was involved at a high level and that she'd introduced the relationship to Deutsche Bank and this private wealth unit to the Trump Organization. But she said, when it came to the nitty-gritty details, she didn't recall them, and that she relied on some others. So again, like her brothers, Don, Jr. and Eric Trump, who testified last week, distancing herself from these financial statements. She was asked specifically about them in particular if she had any involvement in them, and she said she had no involvement in them. She didn't know what went into the values on the statement. She didn't approve them. She didn't review them. So consistently, like her brothers saying that they did not have any involvement in them. But I mean, you mentioned that old Post Office building. They had received the financial statements as part of the bidding process for that, and she was asked about a letter, an e-mail that the GSA had sent saying that they had flagging that Donald Trump's financial statements did not comply with accounting rules in all respects. So she was asked about a meeting she attended with her father in Washington, DC when they were pitching this project and asked specifically, did these financial statement irregularities come up during the meeting and she testified, she had no recollection of that, saying that during the meeting, she was focused more on her vision for the project. Now her testimony lasted all day long, and then the New York Attorney General's Office rested their case -- Anderson.",

Now, if they're going to be able to call people from the bank to say no, it didn't. That changes it.

She simply said \"I don't recall\" so many times, I think we should be worried she may forget her children's birthdays. But I think the most revealing thing she said, Anderson, was that Donald Trump in order to pump up his net worth got pledges from his three oldest children to count their wealth, or a portion of their wealth on his personal guarantee statement to the bank. I'm sorry, all across America, the bank of mom and dad often helps grown children, but the other way around is quite unusual and it goes to Donald artificially inflating his net worth.",

So this was a way for the US to both retaliate against the Iranian-backed groups for those attacks, and try to destroy their infrastructure and the weapons that they are using for those. Now according to Defense officials who just spoke to us a short time ago, the US used precision munitions to carry out these airstrikes and they saw secondary blasts coming from those warehouses, indicating that there were weapons being stored there. So look, Secretary of Defense Austin, he released a statement about this and he is describing this as a very limited self-defense strike, a precision strike aimed at defending the US against these kinds of attacks. There has been a lot of criticism, as you know, over the  response to these attacks, saying that they have been tepid, but the US says they're not looking to expand this conflict anymore. They simply want to conduct these limited strikes to try to destroy that Iranian infrastructure -- Anderson.",
