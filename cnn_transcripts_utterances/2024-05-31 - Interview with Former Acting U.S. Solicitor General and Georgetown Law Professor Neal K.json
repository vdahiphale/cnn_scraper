You said these are felonies, but we should note they are low level felonies in the State of New York. He may very well not even be sentenced to prison time. This is a case that the DOJ decided not to bring up, that Alvin Bragg's predecessors decided not to bring up.

And sometimes, really serious crimes turn out to be low-level felonies, and it just depends on the facts. Here the facts, and this is what I think Mr. Steinglass, in his closing, did so well at illuminating. Yes, it's a low-level felony, but it's a low-level felony with the most huge of consequences, possibly swinging the presidential election. And the idea that New York like doesn't prosecute these crimes, it's totally poppycock to use the technical legal term. You know, this D.A. has prosecuted dozens of those cases on much weaker, you know, facts and so on, just in the last year. So, I don't buy that. And this is really Trump's M.O., his modus operandi, which is to throw so many different crimes, so many different outrageous statements at everyone, the American voters and everyone else, you kind of lose track and you get a nerd. The jury didn't lose track. The jury didn't get a nerd. And it's really significant that you have someone convicted now of 34 felonies.",

And they -- so, it wasn't something in their lexicon. And so, that's why you have sometimes gaps in the law. There are all sorts of gaps in the constitution that, you know, one could say should be filled. This is one of them. And so, yes, Trump is going to get to run and he very well, on July 11th, may be sentenced to a prison term. I think that's probably likely at this point, given the gravity of the offenses, Trump's lack of remorse, his behavior in and out of court and the like. I mean, maybe it'll be home confinement, but there will be some term of confinement that I suspect is going to be imposed on him. Now, he's going to appeal and he will file for something called bail pending appeal, which he'll almost certainly get, which means the confinement term, whether it be in prison at Rikers Island or wherever, or at home will not be imposed until his appeal is over, and that is more than a year away. So, I don't think it's going to directly affect his ability to campaign in the election or anything like that. But certainly, the American public now knows that one of the two candidates running for office right now is an adjudicated felon.

And one of them I dedicated to -- with a few baubles here and there, what an outstanding job the defense had done. So, they should know that they did everything in their power. Unfortunately, they were undermined from time to time by Mr. Trump. But the prosecutors, I think, felt a sense -- I hope they felt a sense of pride.

He said it was heard by 12 Americans, like all cases are. And then, he went on to say it's irresponsible to say the system is rigged as Donald Trump has repeatedly, simply because you don't like the decision. Those were the president's comments on Trump's conviction. But the focus of these talks, these comments here was on the details of a plan that he called a viable plan to end the war in Gaza. He says that Israel has now offered what he described as a comprehensive new ceasefire proposal to Hamas, which includes an enduring ceasefire as well as the release of all hostages. He went on to then detail three phases of this, six weeks of full and complete ceasefire, release of the female and children hostages. A second phase where all remaining male hostages and others are released with a cessation of hostilities permanently. And then a third phase, which he said would be focus on Gaza's reconstruction.

Andhis message was that this is the only way for this war to end. If this continues, Israeli security will be undermined. And I think that's interesting, because behind the scenes, Biden has been very, very vocal about some of these members of that government. He sees them as sort of an impediment to any two-state solution, of course, but also an impediment to an end to this war, which for Biden himself is becoming more and more politically perilous. The longer this goes on, the harder it is for him to coalesce his own party in the United States. And I think what he's doing here is really trying to show that he has a plan to end this war and that he thinks it can be done, but it isn't wholly dependent on him, of course.",

And, Nada, you have, of course, covered the war in Gaza with particular attention to the civilian casualties, the human suffering on the Gaza side. And as I mentioned, President Biden acknowledged that, saying that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell. I wonder as you follow this and you heard those words there, did you hear the president applying pressure in effect on Israel to pull back, particularly as this operation is now underway in Central Rafah, which only recently he made very clear he did not want Israeli forces to go into Rafah?",

I wonder, first, to the details of this proposal as described by President Biden, again, three phases here, six weeks of a full and complete ceasefire, release of female and children hostages, a second phase where all the remaining male hostages are released with a cessation of hostilities permanently, then a third phase of Gaza reconstruction. Do you see a plan here that might be accepted by both sides, or at least the outlines of such a plan?",

And there are certainly those on both parties who have moved to accept it. Not only in the general Israeli public has their support for this, but even within Netanyahu's own mini war cabinet, there are very senior members who would like to take it. And in Hamas, there have been signals that some in Hamas, at least Hamas on the outside of Gaza, have been inclined to accept this deal or similar deals in the past. The main question is whether the two leaders Sinwar in Gaza, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Netanyahu himself, whether they will accept this. And I think that's part of what we saw Biden trying to do now, put pressure not on Israel writ large, but specifically on Netanyahu, siding in a sense with the other members of his mini war cabinet and trying to appeal to others who have been advocating for an end of violence to also put pressure on Hamas, on Sinwar specifically, to accept this kind of deal.",

DoesHamas calculate that seeing Israel isolated is to its advantage and that he's managed to survive in that maze of tunnels, perhaps, and that many of the fighters, while many have been killed, that it still remains a fighting force, that's Hamas' look at this. And that from Netanyahu's point of view, that he still has military objectives in his view to accomplish. You heard one of the senior advisers say just yesterday that the fighting will carry on through the rest of the year. I just wonder, is -- are those two leaders' perceptions of their own interests, do they pull them away from such a deal as opposed to pull them towards it?",

From the Hamas perspective we've seen, there is no concernfor the devastation and the true horror that Gaza has seen in the past eight months, and that has been a major problem with the victims of it being obvious. Sinwar may be moved, it's hard to say. But obviously, Qatar and Egypt are the two parties, the outside parties that the United States is working with do believe they can nudge them in that direction, in particular if they see an end to the war and with Hamas able to come out and declare victory in this horrific image of what they've left in Gaza after the war they started there. But on the Israeli side too, yes, Netanyahu has an interest in a longer war, that's true, but there's also a very strong interest in the other direction. The Israeli public is extremely concerned with the fate of the hostages. It is paramount in Israeli minds across the board, and it is also one that other Israeli leaders are very concerned with. In the next week, in 10 days, we're going to see probably the resignation of some osf the senior ministers from his coalition, from Netanyahu's coalition, and a very tense political moment. That could lead Netanyahu to more obstinance, but it also leads in the direction of trying to bring a big win, and that would be the return of the living hostages and the remains of those who are not alive.",
