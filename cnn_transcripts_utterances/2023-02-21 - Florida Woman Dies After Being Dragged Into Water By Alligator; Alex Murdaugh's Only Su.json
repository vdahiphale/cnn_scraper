And he testified that nobody in his family, which would include his father, would ever load a weapon with a buckshot and a bird shot. He also talked about how Alex Murdaugh often misplaced his phone. We know that Alex Murdaugh didn't have any activity at all on his phone from 8:09 to 9:02 p.m. and the murders took place in that window. So that was also a key piece of testimony. And then he also talked about his father's bathing habits because Alex Murdaugh, according to testimony, had changed clothes before and after the murders. On the day of the murders, he was wearing two different outfits. One scene earlier in a Snapchat video, long pants and a blue shirt. And then later, after the murders, in shorts and a white t- shirt.

But when you look at the physician workforce right now, active doctors at this moment, we're still seeing 5.7 percent are black or African American. And that's compared with, as Victor said, 12 percent of the U.S. population. When you look at Native Americans, less than 1 percent of doctors are Native American. And that's compared with up to 2 percent of patients. When you look at Hispanic or Latino physicians, 6.9 percent are doctors, compared with up to 18 percent of the U.S. population.

Remember, all of those seat selection fee, those can really add up. Think about it. If you're flying with a family, two, three, four kids, that really, really piles on on top of the existing ticket price. So this is a huge thing for the Biden administration because they say, you know, the airlines really ticky tack on all of these fees, especially when it comes to baggage seat selection. They say that you just can't treat family members like baggage.
