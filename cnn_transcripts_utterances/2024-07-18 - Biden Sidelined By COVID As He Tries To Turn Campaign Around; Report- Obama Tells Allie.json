And we are also learning that the former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told Biden that polls show he cannot defeat Donald Trump, and that he could take congressional Democrats down with him to be loses.

He was still trying to convince people to come out and vote for him. Remember Senator Ted Cruz telling people in 2016 to vote their conscience. In 2020, it was COVID.He did it at the White House. And it was a time he was still trying to hold on to his tenure in the White House trying to get another term when poll numbers were suggesting that might not happen. Here, this is a Republican Party that has completely coalesced around Donald Trump. Now when it comes to what he is going to say tonight, we are told that he completely scrapped whatever plans he had for his speech after that assassination attempt on Saturday in Pennsylvania. Now, he has told people around him he wants to focus on unity. Now, as you mentioned, he has also said and this is according to his senior advisors that he wants to write and dictate portions of the speech himself. He has had meetings with outside allies in which he has said he wants to lean into what happened on Saturday. He wants to lean into the fact that he feels like not only is he lucky to be alive, but there was some sort of divine intervention. He wants to call for unity. But of course, the big question is what exactly that means to former President Donald Trump. We know that Donald Trump is known for his divisive rhetoric, and his advisors insist he is a changed man, that that is not what's going to occur here tonight. We obviously will wait and see. Erin.",

But we're also learning that a lot of citizens are contacting the White House as they routinely do for a variety of things. But in particular, some Democrats and some supporters of the president are reaching out to the White House to express their concern as ordinary citizens. And we got one copy of a letter here obtained by CNN from an Iowa couple who supported the President, and they sent a letter to the White House. This is John and Terri Hale from Ankeny, Iowa, two retirees themselves.Let's take a look at what they said specifically. They said \"It's with the utmost respect that we offer this conclusion, you cannot win the race. Not because you're not the better man, but because the public, rightly or wrongly, now sees your age and perceived limitations as the main issue in the campaign.\" They go on to praise his accomplishments, but urged him to sort of reconsider for the good of the country. So just a snapshot of what this President and his advisers are hearing. Now, we talked to the White House to see if these messages are being conveyed to the President. They said the president has a sense of all of his correspondence he receives but know that he also receives many supportive letters, as well. But the point here is it's not just insiders who are calling for it. Of course, he has supporters. But in terms of what his decision is, we reported yesterday that he is being more receptive to these entries. What we don't know here tonight, is if it's changed his mind at all. He certainly has heard now, we are three weeks ago from that debate, almost hard to believe, he's heard all the information. Again, this decision is his.",

So yes, we're in a different moment, because the leaders have allowed it to be known publicly, that this is what they feel, Wolf. But that doesn't mean that we're in a different place for Joe Biden's decision making because we don't know that. Walls can be closing in and he may just have to exist in this very tight cubicle of walls.That is his choice too. It is not a fait accompli, we've no indication that he has decided that he's going to step down from this race, though he's keenly aware of all of the pressure and all of the swirl around him. There's no doubt about that. So that factors into his thinking. But I just -- we are in a very different moment. I think it's going to be a day by day kind of thing. This is very intense pressure on him. But this is his decision to make. And I think he's going to want to understand completely what step two looks like. What is if he does step down, what does that process look like? Who is that nominee that really has a better chance than he does at defeating Donald Trump?

My brother on the other hand, I texted him today, what are you thinking about Joe Biden? He says he's 1,000 percent, with Joe Biden.

But pleading with him in this moment, because he deems the stakes of this election so high, and that Joe Biden's chances of victory here are so slim. Well, I do just want to say, if Joe Biden stays in this race, is a completely different candidacy than the one he has had the last six months, because now we're at a place where the leaders of his party, where members of Congress are already expressing doubts that he can win.
