It is Thursday, September 14th.And we start with an aging politician who is by his own admission getting out before he gets too old. And, no, it is, of course, not Joe Biden who's 80, or Donald Trump who is 77. It is 76-year-old Senator Mitt Romney, a man that many see as one of the last true Republican statesmen left in Washington, and he will not run again. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT):  The times we're living in really demand the next generation to step up and express their point of view and make decisions that will shape American politics over the coming century. And just having a bunch of guys, baby boomers, around in the post-war era, we're not the ones to make decisions for tomorrow. Oh, I think it would be a great thing if President Biden and former President Trump would stand aside and let their party pick someone for the next generation. President Trump -- excuse me, President Biden when he was running said that he was a transitional figure to the next generation. Well, time to transition. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Sixty-six percent is seriously -- 68 percent, excuse me, are seriously concerned about his ability to understand the next generation's concerns. And we have new reporting this morning from inside the Biden camp about how they are dealing with the malaise surrounding their candidate. CNN's Isaac Dovere joins me now. Isaac, good morning. Thank you so much for getting up early. I know many of us have late nights for work or other reasons, so we really appreciate you being here to break down this reporting that you have. What have you learned here? I know you've been talking to a lot of Biden insiders as well as what learning voters are saying.",

It's something that lot of Democrats and within the Biden campaign they are really ready to lean into over the course of the next year and a half. But it is not going to be something that we see starting right away. The actual, full throated campaign from the Biden folks won't be coming until next spring still.",

In the story, I get into what they are doing to try to get ready.A big part of this, they see that the presidential campaign ahead is going to be as they say unlike anything any campaign has ever been. It has been eight years and changing our politics and technology the way that people respond to information since we had a presidential campaign in the non-COVID days, a lot is different. And they are spending this time getting ready, doing a lot of experimenting, testing, a lot of seeing what they can do to see how they actually move people's opinions, and try to get Republicans who may have drifted back toward Trump since 2020 or to get Democrats excited about Biden, whether there is anything do about that and how they go about this.

The president told supporters, quote, the best I can tell, they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government. Speaker McCarthy is trying to placate hard line Republicans who also want to slash spending with a government shutdown looming at the end of the month. CNN's Annie Grayer joins me now. Annie, I'm so grateful to have you up early. Especially, I know it's been a long week on the Hill whenever they come back into session after a long recess.

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, Kasie. There are a lot of different ideas being floated around. And that is because Republicans know at this point, they do not have the votes to move forward with an impeachment of Joe Biden. So, all conversations are around how to get the conference to that point.As you mentioned, the committee chairs who are leading the impeachment inquiry effort are going to be briefing the full Republican conference this morning, in just a few hours to try to get members up to speed about the evidence that they have uncovered so far and answer any questions that members might have. Those chairmen briefed Senate Republicans yesterday because a number of them have also raised concerns about the impeachment effort. And on top of that, Kasie, there's also a lot of questions going on about strategy. Now that the inquiry has started, what should the next steps be? There's a big conversation around time line, how long should this inquiry last, should they wrap it up in a week and quickly move on trying to get the articles moving or should they take their time and use it to try to get these reluctant members on board? There's also a big conversation going on around subpoenas. Part of the argument Republicans made to launch an inquiry was they said this is going to give them enhanced subpoena power. Now that they have it, what are they going to do with it? Some say, send the subpoena to Hunter Biden today. Others know that Hunter Biden, the president's son, is under criminal investigation and any House subpoena will likely be tied up in court and not necessarily useful to their investigation. So, Kasie, these are just some of the conversations that are going on in the conference right now.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kasie, I think the term \"role reversal\" would be quite fitting because remember the last time that Pyongyang fought a war, during the 1950s Korean War, it was the Russians, the Soviets that were providing them with weaponry. And now, of course, the tables have been turned. This once largely symbolic relationship has become substantive becausePutin's top priority now is grinding out in this war in Ukraine and North Korea has exactly what he needs desperately, that is tens of millions of artillery shells and rockets designed for Soviet era weapons. North Koreans, of course, they could use Russian technology to advance their own weapons program, not to mention seeking a new source for food and fuel. Because remember, for decades, it's China that has been propping up that regime in Pyongyang providing them with economic lifeline. So I think that Kim definitely could use some more options from his perspective to lessen the dependence in Russia, has now become this natural choice. But we haven't heard much detail about this potential deal .We may never will because both sides have incentives to keep it secret, especially for Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, that has signed up to all these sweeping sanctions against Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons program. But one thing I think both Pyongyang and Moscow see eye to eye, is whatever they do, whatever they say, they are trying not to cross China because they will increasingly need Beijing's support on the international stage as both of their own regimes become more and more isolated from the West -- Kasie.",

We are running them because they are fascinating, editorially justified as well.So then, we have to look into why they want us to show these pictures. And it is -- if you look at the flags behind the state dinner, this is Kim Jong-un and Putin on the world stage, as global states people. That's how they are promoting themselves right now, and it's also a sign of defiance that they won't be cowed by this pariah status that the West has imposed on them. They're going to carry on regardless. Really interesting as well that we heard that Kim has invited Putin to Pyongyang. Putin has agreed to that. So we're going to see the whole thing all over again. And also, you got to remember, it was Donald Trump that started all of this when we saw that meeting between Kim and Trump at the border. And it was really Donald Trump that put Kim on the world stage and so whether he will use that in the upcoming presidential campaign.",

Of course, arms are really important in Ukraine, but he also wants these pictures to be promoted around the world of their meeting. And if him meeting in Pyongyang say something to the world, we're going to try and figure out what that is, and it may just be defiance against the West.
