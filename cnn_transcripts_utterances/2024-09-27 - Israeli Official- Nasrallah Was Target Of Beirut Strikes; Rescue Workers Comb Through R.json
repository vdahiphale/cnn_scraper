      "sentences": "Hello and welcome, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, I want to go straight to breaking news in Lebanon, in Beirut. AnIsraeli official confirms that Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah was the target of massive airstrikes in Beirut just a short time ago. Lebanon state news agency says six buildings were completely destroyed in the densely- populated southern suburbs. Israel says it targeted Hezbollah central headquarters, which it says was built under residential buildings. The blast was so powerful, they shook the entire city as huge plumes of thick black smoke as you can see there, rose in the skies. It is now after nightfall and rescuers are on the scene looking, as you can see there for any survivors. Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least two people were killed and 76 others injured. But it expects those numbers to rise. And we still don't know whether Nasrallah is among the dead or was even in the area at the time. The strikes happened -- and the context is important here. The strikes happened just after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at the United Nations, vowing to continue fighting Hezbollah. Gives a rather fiery speech, he's now cut short his trip and is expected to return home. Now, I want to go straight to our region, to our reporters, we've got the very latest for you. Let me -- we have Jomana Karadsheh in Beirut, Jeremy Diamond in Haifa in Israel, and Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. Jomana, let me get to you first. Just give me -- give us a sense of the magnitude of this blast, because you and the team on the ground, give us a sense of what they heard and what authorities are telling you, because as we just stated, this is a densely-populated area.",

And then we saw that thick plumes of smoke coming from the southern suburbs of Beirut, Dahiyeh, as you know, one of the most densely-populated parts of the country. And since then, of course, we have heard the reporting from Jeremy, they are being told by an Israeli official that the target of that strike was the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. And right now, we have not yet heard anything from Hezbollah officially, no statements yet. We do not know if Nasrallah was indeed there, what his status is right now, all we do know from Lebanese authorities after those massive strikes that leveled six buildings, at least according to the state news agency, is that at least two people have been killed, 76 others injured. But if you look at those images from the scene, that huge crater there, and you know, it's after -- it's nighttime now and you have rescue workers still on the scene. The number is likely to rise. These -- this strike as Lebanese colleagues here have pointed out, this is the biggest Israeli strike they have seen in the Lebanese capital since the 2006 Israel- Hezbollah war. And it has certainly put this entire country on a knife's edge right now as they wait to hear if Hassan Nasrallah was there, if Hassan Nasrallah has been killed, if he was injured. I mean, even the fact that he was targeted in this strike alone, Isa, is a very dangerous escalation. I mean, it doesn't even begin to describe the situation that the entire country right now awaits to hear, but you know, most certainly, this is going to change things dramatically in this escalation. And what you know, both Israel and Hezbollah --",

Six buildings leveled, you can see there, the workers using bare hands, trying to find any survivors. Incredibly, really concerning picture. And Jeremy, let me bring into this conversation -- of course, we know we've heard from the IDF that Nasrallah was the target of the strikes. IDF has been going after Hezbollah's commanders now for days. What is the IDF saying about one -- about whether they were successful here.

And I understand that, that battle damage assessment is still very much ongoing, so unclear what the fate of Hassan Nasrallah actually is. Now, in terms of the ammunitions used, nothing official from the Israeli military, but what is clear is that the IDF said that they targeted what they described as the central headquarters of Hezbollah underground, beneath a residential neighborhood. And when you look at, when you consider that, you put that together with the enormous booms that were heard across Beirut, the large plume of smoke, and now these images that we are showing our viewers of the enormous destruction on the ground, at least six buildings flattened. This all points to the use of very heavy ammunitions by the Israeli military. And we know that in the past in Gaza, for example, when they have sought to take out these kinds of targets that are underground, beneath existing structures above ground, they tend to use those enormous 2,000-pound bombs. We don't know whether those were actually used in this strike. But certainly, there are indications that they could have been used and the damage does appear to be consistent with that kind of size of ammunition. And we know from those strikes in Gaza again that when these bombs are used, there are enormous casualties and there are also enormous civilian casualties because when the targets are underground, the buildings   above ground in which there are most likely many civilians, those are likely to be flattened as appears to be the case here.

I'm going to read you part of what they've just put out. This is from the Iranian Embassy, \"the Israeli regime once again commits a bloody massacre, targeting heavily-populated residential neighborhoods, spewing false justification to try and cover up its brutal crimes. There is no doubt that this reprehensible crime and reckless behavior represents a serious escalation that changes the rules of the game, and that its perpetrator will be punished and disciplined appropriately.\" And that is the fear right now, isn't it?

Maybe they have a bit more lighting on there now, but this looks like the tiny miracle, and I'm sure everyone in Beirut and around Lebanon will be hoping right now, these small children that their parents, if they were with them have survived as well. You know, what we've seen over the past week is Israel specify that it's been targeting particular Hezbollah commanders in this sort of same suburb, southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has a presence. The IDF has said we're going after this person, this target here in this building, and there have been civilian casualties in this building. But also a day or two days later, Hezbollah admits that, that commander was in that building, and that commander -- or they don't admit that he was in the building, but they admit that he died. They never admit to where these particular senior commanders may have -- may have fallen. They're very obscure about that. But nevertheless, civilians are dying as the IDF tries to strike senior commanders in Beirut. And this, I think by the fact that the IDF came out on this occasion and announced that they were targeting in this area underneath and made a point of saying that Hezbollah was hiding among the civilian population, which they continue to say was an indication that the civilian death toll could be huge. But there's also an indication it would appear by their own calculus is, whatever those calculus are, that this particular target was worthwhile, the high collateral. But what we have seen by Israel's tactics particularly in Gaza and in other places, that a high collateral is something that they are often willing to take, this though, is an escalation that you mentioned, the Iranians. This is sure to draw an increase in escalation from Hezbollah side, even if it's limited -- or the Iranian side, this does absolutely raise the specter of huge escalation, and of course, it's scorches any idea, anyone's belief that they could possibly be discussing --",

TRITA PARSI, CO-FOUNDER &amp; EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, QUINCY INSTITUTE FOR RESPONSIBLE STATECRAFT:  I think the key thing to keep in mind here is that just 48 hours ago, President Biden and France's Macron put forward a 21-day cessation of hostilities plan that they hope the Israelis would sign on to, at least, they studied it. Netanyahu very promptly rejected it, and while in the U.S., while at the U.N. building appears to have given the order for this. Once again, we are seeing that if the United States under Biden actually wants to put an end to this, wants to avoid an escalation, particularly avoid a regional war that could drag the U.S. into it, which appears to be Netanyahu's plan, then asking nicely and issuing these different statements of absolutely no consequences. As long as Biden continues to provide the weapons and the political and diplomatic protection, we will see Netanyahu continue to escalate until he gets the war that he has been seeking. So, it is really on the United States at this point, there is no other country that actually can put restraint on Israel and prevent it from escalating on-and-on again and bring about a complete war of the entire region.",

That's not to say that they are not profoundly hostile to Israel, but they're not the ones that are looking for a regional war in this situation. The statement that the Iranians gave that you read up indicated that this changes the rules of engagement. What I worry about is that if we see what Hezbollah has done so far and what the Iranians have done in terms of the retaliation they did in April, they specifically targeted military installations. In the Iranian case, they appear to have even given a heads-up to make sure that there were no soldiers there at the time. If this is an indication of a change of rules of engagements, given that both Iran and Hezbollah have shown their capability of breaking through the Israeli air defenses. We may now unfortunately see that the response from Hezbollah will be much more indiscriminate, in fact, on par with the indiscriminate nature of what Israel has been doing in Lebanon and in Gaza, and so, that will lead to --",

Mindful of the fact that Hezbollah was not behind, they did not know of October 7th. So, there seems to have been a pattern, and many in Israel are pointing this out of Netanyahu trying to goad Israel -- sorry, Hezbollah or Iran into doing something with civilian casualties that would justify this large award that he has been seeking.

What the previous guest I wasspeaking to was talking about the strategy from -- this is his analysis by the way -- the strategy from the Israeli's side is that perhaps they are goading Hezbollah to retaliate and to retaliate heavier, heavier handedly in order to get boots on the ground into Lebanon. Is that your sense? How do you -- speak to that aspect of it. How does -- how does Hezbollah retaliate here? It has been weakened. We've seen that. You touched on that. But how does it -- how does it go about retaliating?",

At the same time it doesn't want to go full out, full on -- you know, sort of bringing out its most capable weapons, precision-guided missiles and whatever else it may still have. And I think that that fundamentally hasn't changed. But Hezbollah is caught between the risk that were to bring out its heaviest guns once they're out and they're used. Then if that's not enough then they've run out of options and they're going to look weak. But on the other hand, if they don't defend themselves far more vigorously and Iran doesn't defend them, then Hezbollah also suffers the perception among many people that this highly potent professional and capable non-state actor is not in fact that capable anymore and is not that professional. And so again, it's being put in a position where it has pretty much no winning strategy here.",

That's about three and a bit hours ago. The Israeli military says it targeted Hezbollah's central headquarters and more specifically Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. An Israeli military official says the IDF is still working to verify whether Nasrallah was killed. The strikes flattened several buildings. We've been told six buildings in fact. And sent large plumes of smoke as you can see there into the skies above the southern suburbs of the capital. A U.S. official says the United States did not play a role in the operation and that Israel only notified the U.S. after the operation was already underway and Israel had planes in the air. Meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now returning to Israel a day early from New York where he spoke at the U.N. General Assembly and had this message for Iran.

Aaron, good to see you. Just give us a sense of what you're seeing. You know, as you join us here, we're looking at rescue workers combing through this rubble. Many are using bare hands. We saw two little girls, children being rescued in the last 20 or so minutes. But this is a huge blast, six buildings flattened. How do you interpret uh the intentions and the consequences here, Aaron, more importantly as well? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: Well, the intentions I think are clear perhaps than the implications of this. I think over the last several months, the IDF has been pressing Prime Minister Netanyahu on their assessment that the northern front is really the key strategic problem for Israel, not Hamas. The Prime Minister said today in his speech, he all but said that Hamas has been totally defeated. I think the Israelis are really not -- no longer fighting a two-front war. I think they reasoned that the largescale ground operations in Gaza have come to an end. They're now refocused on Lebanon. And two additional calculations I think informed their view. Number one, I think they persuaded themselves that no amount of diplomacy is going to get Nasrallah's attention. The Americans are not going to be able despite the best of intentions, no matter how talented the American negotiator is, that there is insufficient urgency on the part of Hezbollah without a ceasefire in Gaza. So, they have made a calculation I think to focus now almost entirely on Lebanon. And the final piece of it is in the -- in the wake of October 7 -- and this has been supported across the board in Israel. Benny Gantz, Yair Golan who now heads the new Democratic party which is essentially what remains of the Israeli left and center left has also talked about a grand operation. So, Netanyahu's numbers are rising. He clearly believes that preempting and striking his Hezbollah, striking their comms, striking their intelligence network, striking their leaders. Now, is this a tipping point? Yes, it's a tipping point. Whether Nasrallah is killed or not -- and Yezid Sayigh, a colleague of mine in Cairo told you, I think his analysis is absolutely right --",

I want to bring in our Kylie Atwood who is in D.C. to try and get some reaction.And Kylie, I wonder what the reaction has been from the United States. I saw in the last 20 minutes or so that Israel notified the U.S. only moments ahead of Beirut strike. What more are you hearing? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. So, what we've learned from U.S. officials is that there wasn't a very advanced heads up that they got from Israel that they're going to go ahead with this precision strike against the Hezbollah headquarters targeting of course as we have now learned Nasrallah, but that there was some communication from Israel to the United States as this effort, as this strike was underway as we understand it. So, to give you some context here, when we have previously asked U.S. officials about strikes that Israel has carried out against Hezbollah or against Hamas, they have routinely said listen, that is their decision, it's not ours. They -- we aren't controlling what the Israeli military does but this is a different one. This is one that could dramatically change the conflict right now, could dramatically escalate things. So, the fact that the United States wasn't given an advanced heads up on something that could really turn this potentially into a greater conflict is incredibly noteworthy. We're still trying to report out some more details in terms of who knew what when, you know, who notified uh the U.S., and who it was on the U.S. side that found out. All of those details will work on, you know, in the coming hours here. But we'll also be watching to see what U.S. officials say publicly about this. The Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in New York right now. It's his last day there for the U.N. General Assembly. He met with Israel Prime Minister's top official Ron Dermer just last night. And this afternoon he will have a press conference. So, we'll watch and see exactly what he says about the strike that was carried out. That will be the highest-level Biden Administration official that we hear from yet. That's at 3:30 local time here.",

And Nic, just for context for our viewers, we know six buildings have been leveled, two dead, 76 wounded. We have seen rescuers combing through the rubble.

Look, I mean, the very latest if you will does start at the top with the warning from the IDF saying that there were civilians in thebuilding that Hezbollah was underneath them, their command and control was underneath. You only have to look at the plumes of smoke to see how high they go and the color that they are to get an idea of just how deep the target was below those buildings. And so therefore that makes any rescue that much harder because the these bombs that will have been used to reach a very deep bunker that appears to have been the intention here will have had delayed fuses on them. They will have -- they will have gone very deep. That brings in a lot of -- a lot of sand, a lot of debris. So although people in the surrounding buildings and perhaps this is why at the moment the death toll that we understand is relatively low, two people and the casualty rate 70 -- more than 70 people injured, because they're more likely in the surrounding buildings. And it's going to be very hard for the rescue workers to really -- to get deep in and find out what's going on. And of course, during this time, you know, the speculation mounts was Hassan Nasrallah in the building. If he was there, who was with him and the likelihood. And I think look, the longer it goes and the -- and that death toll is still low, I don't think it means the ultimate death toll is going to be low. I just think it means it's so hard to get deep enough in the debris from these comp -- what appear to be complex bombs in this targeting.",
