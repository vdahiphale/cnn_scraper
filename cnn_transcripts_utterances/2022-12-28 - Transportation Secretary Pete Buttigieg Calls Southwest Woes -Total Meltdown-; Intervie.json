And this experience is really testing the loyalty of some longtime Southwest passengers.Earlier, I spoke to a woman who described herself as a loyal customer. She said she's flown with them the last 20 years. But the experience she went through the last few days is really drawing that loyalty into question. What she said when she got stranded in D.C., then eventually stranded here again and a layover in Atlanta, she's scheduled to make it to Tampa today, she'll finally breathe a sigh of relief. Then there was a father and daughter I spoke to, who ran into an entirely different problem. She was 11 years old, scheduled to take off today as an unaccompanied minor. Listen to what she had to tell me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Scott, you heard the vice president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association told CNN that the infrastructure for scheduling software is vastly outdated, that we're seeing a complete meltdown. It sounds like it needs to be completely rebuilt. What would that even look like? SCOTT KEYES, FOUNDER AND CHIEF FLIGHT EXPERT, SCOTT'S CHEAP FLIGHTS: Yes, look, I think the time to have done that would have been months and years ago, not right now during the middle of what's shaping up to be the worst meltdown in Southwest's history. Trying to rebuild that is going to take quite a bit of time. This is something that hopefully will prevent future meltdowns. But I think you're going to expect to see, for passengers impacted today, this is going to be something that's not going to be any comfort for folks. It will take many, many months before they can rebuild the type of software needed for the 21st century, even though the systems that they've been using up to now are clearly not up for the job.",

In other words, was it caused by weather or the by the airline?One statistic:  flight cancellations, as we speak to, American Airlines, zero percent of flights are canceled; Southwest, 62 percent canceled. So if it is deemed these cancellations were controllable, then they're on the hook to make passengers -- to do right by passengers, in terms of providing hotels, providing meals, providing ground transportation. All these sorts of reimbursements that they're required to make for passengers who are otherwise having to pay for those things out of pocket.

This family right here is from Venezuela. I just finished talking to them. They left Venezuela in September in search of a better life, given the economic circumstances there, the violence there, wanting a better life for the three kids they've been traveling with. Family after family waiting to figure out what will be next here. One thing I want to make a point of, they have as many questions as I have seen from El Paso, the city itself, saying they're preparing for what could be another surge. But they still don't know exactly what all of this will mean for them. They have two vacant schools that they are preparing to be shelters. But these migrants don't trust a lot of officials here, so they're not willing to get on the bus to go to the shelters. They don't want to end up being deported. They have a lot of questions as to what Title 42 will mean for them now and in the long run. So the city and the migrants themselves are trying to figure out what will happen next.
