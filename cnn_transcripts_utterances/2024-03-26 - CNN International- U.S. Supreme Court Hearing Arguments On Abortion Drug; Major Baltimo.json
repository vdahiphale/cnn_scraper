But this court's case specifically said that the fact that the heart -- the nature of the harm was, quote, non- economic, did not prevent the court from finding an injury.In Havens, the court looked to two things, whether there was an impairment of the organization's mission. And second, whether there was an expenditure of resources. Both things are satisfied here. If you look at how our organizations have been harmed, they've been forced to divert resources from speaking and advocating for their pro- life mission generally, to explaining the dangers of the harm from abortion drugs. One of the primary reasons that that's required is because in 2016, FDA took away the requirement that abortion providers report adverse events.",

I acknowledge that the lower courts have cabined Havens to say where you have sort of prelude to litigation types of activities.In those sorts of cases, those resource justifications don't count. In this case, if you look at respondents' declarations, they note that they have performed studies, they've analyzed studies. Several of those are in the record and they're not short. They came -- come through Medicaid data, they come through FERS data, so you get at the true nature of adverse events. And all those sorts of things are neither a prelude to litigation, nor would they have occurred but for FDA's unlawful conduct in this case. SONIA SOTOMAYOR, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: Counsel, in the line you quoted about economic harm that had to do with the fact that they didn't intend through their testers to rent an apartment. And so there was no economic loss to them or gain to them from renting the apartment. But what was, I think, the SG is pointing to, is that they provided services on their own. It wasn't just the member services that they were relying upon. They were providing services to people to help them rent departments. And so that's a very important distinction from here. Separate from the individual defendants' claims of standing based on wasted resources, their resources. The organizations are not losing anything.",

They were speaking broadly.Again, you have to dig to the underlying briefs to find that economic interest that this court did not rely on. With respect to our own injury, it's absolutely redressable.

We have before us a handful of individuals who have asserted a conscience objection. Normally, we would allow equitable relief to address them. Recently, I think what Justice Jackson's alluding to, we've had one might call it a rash of universal injunctions or vacatures.

And as the government acknowledged an oral argument in Corner Post, when the parties before the court are non-regulated parties, the only avenue in which they can possibly get relief, and of course that's sort of the sine qua non of equitable relief, is that the parties before the court get it. And that's for, as in this case, a state issue or another case is a vacature. And that's because without that sort of relief, the very parties before the court won't get it.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we've been hearing these arguments for about an hour now. And what they've been focusing on are the issue of standing, whether the doctors who brought this lawsuit, trying to restrict the abortion pill, whether they even had the power to initially bring the lawsuit.And then secondly, you know, if they did have the power to bring this lawsuit, whether the FDA acted with reason decision making, when they rolled back some of the restrictions on the pill in 2016 and 2021. And what -- you know, we heard the arguments from the FDA. It was argued by the Solicitor General of the United States and then also from the manufacturer of this abortion pill. And right now, we're hearing arguments from the lawyer representing the doctors. And, you know, the two sides are diametrically opposed. You know, the doctors that brought this case said that they were being impacted because if something did go wrong with mifepristone, the abortion pill, that those doctors who might be in the ER, at the time something might go wrong, they might have to treat one of these patients. And because of that, they said that they were being affected. The FDA is saying, that is very much too tenuous to establish that you have the right to bring this lawsuit. So that's one of the arguments here. We're also hearing about some of the easing of getting this abortion pill. You know, it was in 2016 and 2021 that the FDA eased some of the barriers to this pill. Women can now get this pill up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Previously, they could only get it up to seven weeks. And crucially, women can also get this pill right now. And it began in 2021. They can get it via the mail. And, interestingly, there was also somewhat of a question that popped up from Justice Thomas about that issue of getting it in the mail. It was an issue that wasn't really argued below. It'll be interesting to see at the Supreme Court even addresses it in their opinion. But it's something called the Comstock Act. And the Comstock Act prohibits the delivery of contraception and items considered obscene through the U.S. mail. So that's one of the arguments sort of percolating here that this mifepristone should not be delivered via mail because it violates the Comstock Act. Interestingly, the DOJ, earlier this year, looked into that argument and they issued their opinion, some guidance saying, no, it doesn't violate the Comstock Act because mifepristone can be used for more things than just abortion. In fact, many women also use it if they've miscarried. This helps women deal with the miscarriage. So, you know, this is a big case because it really brings the Supreme Court back into the forefront of the abortion debate, something the Supreme Court probably thought two years ago that they had settled when they overturned Roe v. Wade and really handed the power over abortion law back to the states. But, of course, now we've got these doctors, Rahel, challenging the abortion pill. This is something that is used in more than half of all abortions across the country. And crucially, it's used by women in those states that outlaw abortion because they can simply get it via mail. So, you know, there is an ideological component to these arguments, and now the Supreme Court will have to wait in. So, we're about an hour plus into these arguments. It probably will go at least a half hour more. And then, Rahel, we probably won't see any decision in this case until the end of June when the Supreme Court concludes its term. And until then, everything is status quo with this abortion pill. It is fully available. It is available to women up to 10 weeks, and it's available by mail. But we'll see if the Supreme Court decides anything that could change how this pill is administered. Rahel.",

And the governor confirming that, saying that the crew notified authorities of a power issue. So it remains to be seen exactly how that played into what happened here today. But that certainly a focus for investigators right now. The governor was also saying that, you know, of course right now, the big focus is on this search and rescue operation. Two people have already been rescued, one is in the hospital, the other is OK, not in the hospital. But there are six people still missing. All six were part of a construction crew that was on that bridge fixing potholes. So they weren't there doing any kind of structural repairs or anything, just fixing potholes. That is who the Coast Guard is now searching for right now. And you just have to imagine that they would now be in this water for several hours now, very cold water. So the search and rescue efforts really reaching a critical point right now. And then one other thing, Rahel, you know, you just have to note this is such a massive port. One of the busiest ports in the world. And this bridge just completely gone. A major, major thoroughfare around the city of Baltimore.

They had a highly skilled and licensed harbor pilot. In other words, someone who knows the channels, knows the currents, is licensed, has a background check to guide the ship to literally steer the ship through the channel and under the bridge. And so that helped. And the fact that they got the mayday call and there was an effort to stop traffic over the bridge. You know, however, they're going to know what went wrong with the ship. Why was it listing so far out of the channel, even before it hit the bridge? And if it lost power, then, of course, it lost the ability even to do sort of other steering. For example, you know, everyone knows you steer the ship with the, you know, the rudder just like a small ship, a big ship does the same thing. But you also have on a big ship bow thrusters that can move the ship from side to side, can help you maneuver in very small spaces and can help you actually slow down and get away from any obstruction that you're headed to. If you had no power and you lost the power, you're literally just floating along with the currents and the currents could have taken right into the bridge.

I mean, still, if you hit something at the eight knots or, you know, 12, 15 miles an hour, that still it's a huge impact because of the size of the ship, where if it was something small, it wouldn't have made such a difference. So the speed isn't so much the issue as that force of those hundreds of thousands of tons hitting the bridge. And also it's unclear if they hit just the support structure, which would lead one to ask, why wasn't their protective rip-rap, rock, cement, et cetera, around the base of the bridge? Or if they were so far out of the channel that the ship and cargo itself hit the bridge, not the support structure. And so those are questions they will have to answer as well.",

SCHIAVO: Well, I think it will factor into it because the National Transportation Safety Board, as well as the Highway Administration and many other agencies, government agencies are going to want to know, in the 50 years of progress and bridge building since 1977, what have we learned? Well, we've learned an awful lot because a lot of bridge collapses in the U.S. do happen when a ship hits the bridge. And in some cases, the bridge comes down, but in most cases, just a segment of the bridge comes down. And in some cases, a segment has come down. They've repaired it. But here, the whole, almost all the bridge came down. And so they're going to be looking at the bridge supports and stays, what affix the bridge to the support structure. They're going to be looking at the connectors and the connections of the bridge. And here in my home state, they had a bridge that was hit by a ship and a couple of the sections of the bridge came down. They're repaired it and last for many more decades until it was replaced in the 2000s. So they're going to be asking, why did the whole thing come down?

And the new bridge took, oh, gosh, it was probably five years to get the new bridge. And it was important, it was a great improvement, but that was an expected collapse.

And one of the things about bridge engineering is that we are learning all the time and improving our practices all the time.I would say that bridges that are being designed and being constructed at the minute do have increased ship impact protection. And it's a serious piece of work that is taken very cautiously through the design process, considering how a navigation channel and ships of this size will impact on a new structure that crosses the bridge -- crosses the channel, I should say. And that ship impact protection will take a number of forms. It might be dolphins or restrictions on ship movements that are in the water, sacrificial pieces of concrete essentially, or it might be hydraulic energy absorbing buffers on the pier bases that resist the loads. However, the size of this ship means that those have to work extremely hard to resist the forces that are generated. It may be low speed, but the weight of the ship and the momentum that it carries means that it's an extraordinarily large force that's been applied to this bridge pier in this tragic, tragic accident.",

This progressive and quite rapid collapse is exactly how you might expect this structure to behave. And really the way that we deal with that nowadays and in more recent designs, as I said, by increasing the level of impact resistance and protection around those piers, making sure those fragile elements of hopefully robust system are better protected.",
