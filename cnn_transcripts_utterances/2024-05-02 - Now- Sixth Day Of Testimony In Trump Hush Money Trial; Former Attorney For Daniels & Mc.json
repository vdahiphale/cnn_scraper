      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.The criminal hush money cover-up trial of former President Donald Trump is well underway right now in Manhattan. On the stand, right now, is a man named Douglas Daus. He works for the Manhattan district attorney's office, but as opposed to previous days that were focused on bank records, today, we are knee deep in shady deals and sleazy details. Mentioned today were other celebrity scandals involving Hulk Hogan and Charlie Sheen. More on that in a sec. But the reason we heard all of this today was because of this man Keith Davidson, who took the stand. He is the attorney who represented both Stormy Daniels, the adult film star and director, and Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playboy playmate of the year, when negotiating hush money payments arrange to keep them twice quiet about alleged sexual encounters they had with Donald Trump, ones that Mr. Trump denies. And jurors saw the actual confidential settlement agreement between Daniels and Trump with Mr. Trump's signature. The documents used pseudonyms, the ones that were more available. Stormy Daniels was Peggy Peterson. Donald Trump was David Dennison. And in this document, David Dennison was paying Peggy Peterson to keep her mouth shut. Former President Dennison -- I mean, former President Trump paid close attention to cross-examination of Keith Davidson, the attorney, as the defense attorneys tried to poke holes in Mr. Davidson's credibility, resulting in at least one particularly testy exchange. Let's get you up to speed on what's happening in the trial right now with the help of our panel. Trump right now in the courtroom. Trump is on a phone call when the recording starts. It's a recording that Michael Cohen made. And when he hangs up, Cohen can be heard saying, great call by the way, big time. This as prosecutors playing the recording from a 2016 telephone call and you hear Trump's voice. This is the first time in the trial that they have heard, the jurors have heard Mr. Trump's voice. As we pop back and forth between what's going on in the trial now and what happened a few minutes ago, let me go back to something Shan Wu, Keith Davidson said on election night 2016, this is the attorney who negotiated this, the Hush money agreement allegedly, Keith Davidson said he texted the \"National Enquirer\" editor, Dylan Howard. This is on November 8 the night that Donald Trump won the presidency, 2016. And he says, what have we done? Mr. Davidson explained there was an understanding that our efforts may have been some way strike that. Our activities may have in some way assisted the present so dental campaign of Donald Trump, why is that relevant to this prosecution?",

Not sure what exactly he will go after Mr. Daus for, he processes digital evidence in the unit of the Manhattan district attorneys office called the high-technology analysis unit. He seems to be basically just providing stuff that has to do with phone calls and records on the calendar of Michael Cohen and the like.Jim Trusty, former Trump attorney, Davidson in his testimony earlier recall the phone conversation with then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen. This took place in December 2016. Trump had already one. And in this conversation, Davidson says Cohen said something to the effect of, Jesus Christ, can you f-ing believe I'm not going to Washington after everything Ive done for that f-ing guy. I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's ass so many times, you don't even know that f-ing guy is not even paying me the $130,000 back. That's the $130,000 paid to Stormy Daniels. If get to you one second. I just want to bring people up to speed. Bove is asking Douglas Daus about his work on Iraq, doing forensics and intel collection and the differences between that work and the work he does for the Manhattan district attorneys office. We'll see where that goes. But in any case, this venting by Michael Cohen, two essentially opposing counsel really, I mean, like somebody who has been negotiating with Stormy Daniels, attorney what do you make of it?

Don't worry about even David Pecker, different people that have little foundational bits of information. They're not the fight. Even the stuff that's going on right now feels foundational. Setting up sometimes, it's setting up some -- some contacts so you can do a chart to say, look at all these people are all talking around the time of the election. The substance ain't great. I would agree that a lawyer or tape recording his client and then having these bitter outburst is not a great look and maybe we can bring Avenatti to comment on it. But it does not look good in terms of Cohen and we're already just seeing the tip of the iceberg and how much they're going to be able to cross-examine them on.

One Trump attorney whisper to Trump, he acknowledged, but did not open his eyes. Trump today on Truth Social posted: Contrary to the fake news media, I don't fall asleep during the crooked D.A.'s witch hunt, especially not today. I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes listen intensely and take it all in. It's actually not so different from what Maggie Haberman said, who was one of the most authoritative Trump journalists that there is, that he does sometimes close his eyes in her view to focus and calm down and not lose his temper.

It's not just because he has agita, he wants to get up and walk around and because he's angry, but also part of his that he knows everyone is watching him all the time. This is a man who cares very much about appearances. He plans every kind of media appearance he has. Now he knows there are reporters in the courtroom watching him all the time.

They know it's denial. There's no truth to it. And he said, quote and extremely strict reading of this denial would technically be true with an extremely fine reading. I think you'd have to hone in on the definition of romantic, sexual, and affair. I don't think that anyone had alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic. I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that there was a relationship between Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump. I believe a relationship is an ongoing interaction.

There would be tipping their hand to the defense. They would only have an hour to do direct and then the defense would have all night to prepare. And as we know as of now, the prosecutor strategy is not to tip their hands, not to share who the next witness is, to keep that advantage from the defense. Now, they argue they're not sharing names because they're worried that the defendant, former President Trump, will tweet about these witnesses, try to intimidate them, but it makes sense that they're using this last little block of time to have this particular witness come in, bring in something the evidence that they need to be validated, likely cell phones from Mr. Cohen and then educate the jury on where the information on that phone is, that it's relevant, what it is, verify it, sort of in and out on the stand here.

For example, the defense name-dropped Charlie Sheen, bringing up an alleged $2 million payment to Davidson's client. They mentioned the time Davidson was investigated by law enforcement as part of 2012 extortion probe tied to Hulk Hogan. He was not implicated in that probe. This had to do with a Hulk Hogan sex tape. Then they asked Davidson about a settlement deal he tried to negotiate with somebody seeking $100 million from boxer Manny Pacquiao after a big fight. Then they press Keith Davidson on whether he helped someone get paid in connection with the 2010 TMZ story about the rehab treatment of Lindsay Lohan.

Bove asking Daus whether he has first-hand knowledge of why the recording of Mr. Trump cut off and Douglas Daus says, he's does not. This is, I suppose, just trying to establish what the prosecution was trying to establish that these recordings are real. Emil Bove, I'm not sure what he's doing, but in any case, Karen, let me just ask you these kind of like other sleazy cases and the idea of where is the line between, hey, I have this story that somebody has and you can buy it and it won't see light of air or not versus extortion, it does seem to be suggesting that this prosecution witness Keith Davidson, is kind of sleep easy.

And in fact, I don't know if we have the courtroom sketch, but there's a courtroom sketch of Donald Trump seeing an image that Michael Cohen had retweeted or tweeted of Donald Trump in a prison suit, an orange jumpsuit, and that it was brought up by the defense saying, here's Michael Cohen throwing punches at Donald Trump all the time.

You know, the gag order. Whatever you think of a gag order, President Trump violated it, got fined the maximum amount for contempt you can be fined. But there's a different issue with Cohen which is he made comments yesterday about witness testimony. He started talking about, oh, David Pecker did a nice job saying this, that and the other. In every trial, every serious trial you have in this country, you have a rule of sequestration of witnesses, where they are purposely out of the courtroom, not able to see the other witnesses with some exceptions, not allowed to see the other witnesses' testimony. Cohen is taking in testimony and commenting on it. I would not be surprised if you see a motion to exclude him on the whole for violating a very important rule for the administration of justice, which is keeping witnesses from parroting the testimony or molding their testimony to what other witnesses have said. So, I'd be real curious to see if they take that tack and file something in the next couple of days because I think they have a record that would support it.",

I mean, even when the testimony is relatively dry, it's being tied into to what the allegations are in this case, setting up the shelf, the shell company wiring the instructions, or is the banker testified that Michael Cohen was always in a hurry, that everything was in urgency.
