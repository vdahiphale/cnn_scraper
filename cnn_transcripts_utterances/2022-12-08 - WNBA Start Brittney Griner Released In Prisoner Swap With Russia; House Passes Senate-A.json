You are seeing the very first images of Brittney Griner and after she was released from Russian custody. There you see her smiling such a relief to see her coming back to the United States. The WNBA star spent nearly 10 months behind bars in Russia and now there you see it, that smile and sheer relief to come home. There you see her boarding that flight and there's Viktor Bout, upon his return back to Russia as well. It's all part of a result of a prisoner swap. The U.S. released arms dealer Viktor Bout as you see him boarding the plane. President Biden this morning sit alongside Griner's wife to announce the good news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, the Secretary of State saying that it was unforgettable to be in the Oval Office today with President Biden when Cherelle Griner was able to speak with Brittney Griner for the first time since she was freed from Russia. And he also went on to say that this has been an effort that's been underway by U.S. State Department officials, by officials in the U.S. government for months.And Bianna, we have reported on that. We know that the Biden administration put an offer on the table months ago back in the summer for both Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan who was another American wrongfully detained in the country. That is not the deal that came to fruition today and that's not because U.S. officials didn't want it, it's because of Russia's position here. Russia was a challenging interlocutor. They treated Paul Whelan differently than they did Brittney Griner and here's what the Secretary of State said about the United States moving ahead with this deal, even though for now it meant leaving Paul Whelan in Russia.

U.S. officials saying they will keep working on that effort.And we should note that Brittney Griner is on her way back to the United States today. Folks really welcoming that news across the United States, because there was such a public push for her to get released from the basketball community, from the LGBTQ community, also from African-American community here in the United States. And according to a UAE official, it was a meeting with the President of the UAE and President Putin that was part of securing this deal because Brittney Griner was actually exchanged today in Abu Dhabi for Viktor Bout.

What you haven't heard is a clear pathway or idea of what it will take to secure Paul Whelan is released. Again, it's kind of - the difficulty and complexity of this moment. There is no question U.S. officials are elated by the fact they were able to secure the release of Brittney Griner.There's no question that the advocates and constituency that have been pushing for this over the course of the last nine plus months are as well. But the recognition that there's still an American Left Behind - the recognition there are many Americans left behind is something that really drives the teams that Kylie covers so closely. And the difficulty of these moments as to how this is going to play out going forward still no clear sense yet. The Whelan family has weighed in saying that they're very happy Brittney Griner has come home, but they are obviously distraught by the reality that Paul Whelan was not with her. How this plays out going forward is going to be a question that the administration is going to continue to have to address both publicly but also in their negotiations with the Russian counterparts.",

Evelyn, good to see you. We're going to go to Terri Jackson in a minute if we can. But let me get your perspective here on what it means for, one, Vladimir Putin after all of these months to finally agree to this exchange for Viktor Bout, but also to make sure that it was only Brittney Griner coming home and not Paul Whelan. EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RUSSIA, UKRAINE &amp; EURASIA:Yes, Bianna, I think I have a little bit of a different take on this, which is to say that I think Vladimir Putin was never going to give us Paul Whelan. All along, he probably knew that he was only going to give us Brittney Griner in exchange for Viktor Bout. He definitely wanted Viktor Bout, so there was going to be an exchange and it's happening now, because Vladimir Putin wants this to happen now, he needs a win. He needs a victory in Russia because he is having trouble convincing the Russian people that it's a good idea to be at war with Ukraine. So I think that all of this back and forth negotiation was just typical of the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin, just a lot of game - playing games, frankly.",

With a vote of 258 to 169, the House passed the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting same-sex marriages. Thirty-nine Republicans voted with Democrats to pass the measure which the Senate approved last week. President Biden said he will sign the bill promptly once he receives it.Now, this federal law does not legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, but it does mandate that every state recognize another state's legal union. CNN Congressional Correspondent Jessica Dean joins us now from Capitol Hill. A significant day there, Jessica, to say the least. So explain how this bill specifically works and the impact that it will have?",

They were working on it before the midterms actually and just could not quite get there in terms of getting those 10 necessary votes from Republicans to get this over the finish line, so they came back together. They did get that done.And what this bill does, as you mentioned, it doesn't necessarily put in a nationwide law requiring the recognition of same-sex marriage. What it does is require each individual state to respect and see legally in the eyes of the law, any other states laws on same-sex marriage, so it recognizes same-sex marriages from any other state. So no matter where you go, you are married in the eyes of the law no matter what that state has on the books. So it's a bit nuanced, but it certainly does give those protections to same-sex marriages. And this really became a concern after Roe v. Wade was overturned over the summer. There began to be concerned that what if the Supreme Court overturned the ruling on same-sex marriage and that is what moved both the House and the Senate, Bianna, to do this and get it done in this session.",

How did conservatives get on board given that just 10 years ago, it was President Obama's own administration that sort of took issue when now President Biden spoke out in favor of same-sex marriage.",

So that was kind of the linchpin for some of these members that made them feel comfortable in supporting this.

The emotions for our organization just like for our fans, and so many across the world are those of joyous celebration, deep gratitude grief for the time lost, and sincere hope for all families still awaiting the return of a loved one.\" Once again, they're noting, that somebody else didn't come home with her and that is Paul Whelan and there are others that are being wrongfully detained.
