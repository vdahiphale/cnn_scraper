I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Tonight, an exclusive report on what's happening to Iranian protesters behind bars. Demonstrations have been ongoing since September, as people continue to take to the streets across the country. And as many as 14,000 people have been arrested since those protests began. Now, there are troubling accusations that are emerging about the treatment they are facing while detained. Men and women alleging sexual assault by Iran's security forces. Nima Elbagir has the story, and as you would expect, the report contains disturbing details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Over these mountains is Iran. A regime that has succeeded in cutting many of its people off from the outside world. But disturbing stories detailing the authority's brutal retribution, systematic sexual violence against anti-regime protesters have begun leaking out. We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iraq to try and find out more. This is Hannah (PH), not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran. She fears for her life. After taking off and burning her head scarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian intelligence officers. HANNAH (PH), ARRESTED AND DETAINED BY IRANIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS (through translator):  They choose the woman who are pretty and suited their appetite. Then the officer would take one of them from the cell to a smaller, private room. They would sexually assault them there. ELBAGIR (voiceover):  Hannah (ph) isn't only an eyewitness.

And Khamenei many said that, if women have the right to vote, there are going to be prostitutes. So, because of that since 1979, when Khamenei came to power, they have been suppressing women. They have been denying women of their rights. And the whole government, I can say, has been sexualized. And the movement against the government has been sexualized as well. Sex has become an instrument of suppression. I know that you did a series about sex. Sex has become an instrument of suppression in the hands of the government. And then you see such atrocities happening in Iranian prisons when interrogators, torturers, sexual perverts would've been suppressed sexually, they have a free reign in order to -- and they can treat the prisoners however they want.

The Islamic republic has not been ready for an internal, for a domestic protest like this at this level. So, they are clueless about what's going on. But they are resorting to what they know which is detainment, torture, execution, shammed trials. And this is just the beginning. Right now, at this 15 people have been sentenced to death, we will see more of that. We will soon see sham trials. There are social media persecution of different opposition members, different journalists by trolls -- by Islamic republic trolls. At least 60 professional journalists are imprisoned right now. More than 200 citizen journalists are in prison right -- imprisoned right now. So, the government is all over itself. They don't know what to do.

So, you have a beautiful little boy now to enrich your life and your husband's life. I mean, what is next? I mean, how do you see your career at this point? Do you plan to go back to the stage?",

I mean, you look at Serena Williams and, you know, returning to tennis and the difficulties of that and, you know, to focus on your body. But ballerinas have been doing this for generations and generations, having babies, going back onstage, but we don't see all the work and what it takes to -- the dedication and commitment. And so, my plan is to be back on stage by the fall, winter of 2023. I think I will always dance in some capacity and I will forever be a part of the ballet community, you know, whether it is through speaking, writing books, just advocating for black dancers in ballet through my foundation, the Misty Copeland Foundation, I will forever remain a part of ballet in some way.",
