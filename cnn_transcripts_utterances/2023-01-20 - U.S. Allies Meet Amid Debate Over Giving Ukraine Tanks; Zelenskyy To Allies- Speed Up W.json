Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at meeting today with European defense ministers at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. We are also, though, just getting in some breaking news, CNN White House reporter, Natasha Bertrand. Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann, both joining us. Natasha, what are you hearing potentially about what more we're learning, even this secret meeting that the CIA director held last week with President Zelenskyy?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So about this meeting between Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, and CIA director, Bill Burns, we are learning that Burns went there really to brief the Ukrainian president on what the U.S. believes are the potential battle plans by Russia to launch an offensive in the spring.Now, of course, Bill Burns has been a very key emissary between the U.S. and Ukraine, as well as even with Russia over the course of the war. And this really just signifies the urgency that the U.S. feels at -- in this moment kind of getting Ukraine the information, the intelligence it needs ahead of this potential Russian offensive, seeing this as a very key window to give Ukraine potential information that it can use for a leg up there. So Burns traveled there. This is a roughly the third time in the last three months that he has traveled to Ukraine, you know. But we are also learning new information today about a key Russian organization inside Ukraine that the U.S. has been watching very rarely. And that is the Wagner Group, this Russian mercenary organization that Putin is increasingly relying on to carry out operations inside Russia. The U.S. says that they now have new information, new photos that they're willing to release to the public, showing Russian rail cars traveling from Russia to North Korea and back, picking up weaponry, they say, to be used in Ukraine by Wagner Group. So a really a key kind of big escalation here by the North Koreans to be providing this military equipment to this Russian mercenary organization. And, of course, it says a lot about how the Russian defense establishment and Vladimir Putin, the president there, are increasingly relying on this Russian mercenary organization to carry out these military operations in Ukraine as the Russian military there is really faltering. So again, this information just coming in that the U.S. does plan to issue even more sanctions on Wagner Group next week, and of course, releasing new evidence to the public about what they say are deliveries by North Korea to Wagner Group, a very powerful missiles and other military equipment that they can use there.",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple of things, Erica. First of all, I want to make a comment on the tie we're on that's below us right now that Wagner is a transnational criminal organization. You know, what Oren has just described is sort of a scenario out of The Sopranos.I mean, the Russian government is corrupt. They are relying on these paramilitary organizations to recruit criminals from prison, putting them on the battlefield and having them attack in mass so that literally tens of thousands of them are killed, used as meat grinders. So what you're talking about is a military that hasn't been able to execute their war plans, have not been good tactically, operationally, or strategically on the battlefield so they rely on Prigozhin and his Wagner group, and it's causing a great deal of consternation within the Pentagon itself. Personalities are at each other's throats in Moscow. Having to do with CIA Director Burns going to Ukraine, giving additional information, you know, harken back to before the February invasion by Russia into Ukraine, Burns had been to Moscow several times, told them, basically, we knew what we were -- what we were seeing them do, getting ready to prepare and -- to attack into Ukraine. And yet, Mr. Putin brushed it aside. We had been reading their mail. The United States intelligence agencies know what Russia is doing at every step of the way. And it's great that they're informing President Zelenskyy of what's occurring.",

In addition to the coincidental serendipitous meeting of the Ramstein contact group, where continued pressure has been put on NATO allies and partners to provide more equipment to Ukraine. So the -- a combination of all of those three things.And as Oren say a minute ago, the Wagner Group has been very effective, but they've only been very effective in a small portion of the battlefield, in and around Bakhmut. They can't cover the entire 500 kilometer frontage that is the distance between the Russian lines and the Ukrainian lines. So while they have been successful in that very area, they can't cover down all of Russia's failures. So it's fascinating to watch what Prigozhin is doing with this group, but he's not going to be able to sustain these kinds of actions, because he doesn't have the manpower and he doesn't have the equipment. That's why they went to Korea.",

We heard Secretary Austin earlier today.But on the one hand, it would seem to highlight what from the very beginning has been a discussion among NATO countries, which is which weapons to send, and what the potential impact of those weapons could be, not just on the battlefield, but the broader impact.

And they know that the potential for a retaliation or even a preemptive strike for that could be catastrophic for the Russian Federation. So while they continue to push those threats, I think they're becoming less and less viable as Russia continues to lose on the battlefield.",

And I'm talking about Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and maybe even to Crimea.But the list you just showed on the -- on the screen shows U.S. forces, the contributions of 90 Stryker vehicles. That's an ominous force, an additional 59 Bradley Vehicles, a great tank killing weapon. I've actually fought off of both of those vehicles in combat, they're very good. But you also need the tanks, and that's what Secretary Austin is pushing. But I would say a warning though too, Erica. As I go down the list of the last couple of months that what had been given -- what has been given to Ukraine by various partners. We're talking about Bradley, Strykers, Denmark is given the Caesar artillery system, M777s, the artillery pieces HIMARS, MRAPs, Gepards, Patriots, Leopards, AMX-10s, 106s, NASAM, Hawk missile systems. What I'm describing is a litany of different types of brand-new weapons systems. The Ukrainian army can fight off of most of those. They need training on some of those. But truthfully, Erica, as I've kind of become a broken record on this, I'm very concerned about the logistics support. When you introduce those various types of weapons from different country, it is really going to put a hard pressure on the Ukrainian logistics and sustainment system to maintain that type of equipment. And that's what Secretary Austin is doing as Ramstein ensuring, not only is Ukraine getting the kind of equipment they need, but it's as simple as possible to put it to use on the battlefield.",

And to tell them, you know, if you're struggling, we will help you. We will do this. I did 26 years of post-abortion counseling with men and women.

Yes, I don't think the number of people with initial access at the outset of negotiations, 82, as the investigators said in their final report, is going to change necessarily, but how the documents are handled most certainly will.What the investigators found was that they couldn't determine how many copies were made by the people who first had access, the various law clerks and other assistants. They didn't -- they couldn't determine how many copies were actually e-mailed, potentially outside the building, whether they were downloaded to other devices. It turned out that several of the law clerks told investigators that they had actually confided to their spouses about the vote count and opinion. So there were all sorts of ways that security was lax, not just in terms of, you know, who had access, but then how those people handled their access. So it appeared that those were the kinds of things that would be may be changed going forward. You remember that when Chief Justice John Roberts announced this investigation back on May 3rd, the day after Politico published the draft opinion, you know, there was a lot of suspense and anticipation about what they would find. And here we are about nine months later with no answers about who a culprit might have been. But frankly, more questions about the security and institutional protocols. It seemed like frankly, Erica, that this was a leak that in some ways was waiting to happen, given how uncertain and unsecured various computers, printers, and other I.T. protocols were at the Supreme Court.",
