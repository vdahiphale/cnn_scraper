It is a category three storm. This, what you are looking at now is less than 20 miles from Keaton Beach. You can see the water levels start to rise. They have been rising throughout the course of the morning.To give you some context here, particularly in this Big Bend region, this hurricane, hurricane Idalia, is now the most powerful storm to make landfall in that region in the past 125 years. Sara Sidner is standing by, has been standing by all morning live in Crystal River, Florida. We have full team coverage all over Florida's gulf coast. John Berman and Brian Todd are in Tallahassee, Florida. Derek Van Dam has been in Tampa throughout the course of this morning. And Bill Weir is in Steinhatchee where the expected, or where landfall happened just 20 miles away. That storm has been picking up there. The effects have been rapidly intensifying there as well. We're going to get to everybody throughout the course of this hour, but I want to start, Sara, with you, and have been following you, looking at your live shots throughout the course of this morning, talking to you, and just the intensity, the up and down, the bands as they have gone through, it has been something to see. And we experienced landfall about 15 minutes ago.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we have vacillated from beautiful to terrible, beautiful to terrible, back and forth. That's just the way hurricanes work. But this is a very dangerous storm, no matter how beautiful it is where you are on the west coast of Florida. It has made landfall in the most dangerous position for people in that area, the Big Bend area. They need to shelter in place according to authorities. They need not to try to evacuate if they haven't already at this point in time. You will have to wait until eyewall passes, and then that second major band of destructive wind and rain comes through past that eyewall.I want to get to Derek Van Dam who is in Tampa. He has been watching this storm. He has been watching it from the satellite images and from the ground where parts of Tampa are inundated with that storm surge, with that floodwater. Derek? DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  All right, Sara, so we are going to step away from this -- the seriousness of the storm for just one second. You've got to bear with me, because this is something you don't see every day. Guys, what are you doing? Literally, we are -- this is a very new way to beat rush hour traffic on Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa. These guys are kayaking down this major thoroughfare of Tampa over my shoulder here. I mean, look at that. I don't want to minimize the serious nature of this storm, but this is what people are dealing with in Tampa as we speak. People coming out to be more spectators than anything. But the storm surge threat has been realized, five-and-a-half feet at one of the tidal gauges just down the road from us, and that is why we see this storm surge event that is unfolding across much of the Big Bend all the way to Tampa Bay where I am located. And that is an angry ocean there. You can see the waves just spilling over this coastal floodwater area. And in all of my years of reporting, I don't think I have ever seen people take advantage of floodwaters in that particular way. So, look, I am not going to minimize the risks, the ongoing risks that are real, and they're dangerous. But the storm surge that they are anticipating and experiencing from where I'm standing now all the way to the Big Bend, remember, this is the strongest hurricane to impact the Big Bend in over 125 years. We are at record level storm surge in Tampa Bay. This is incredible to see unfold behind us. And just look all the way down Bayshore Boulevard. It is completely flooded with water, and that water is lapping up to the front yards of these homes here as well.",

If you see me keep looking off in that direction, that's because the wind is coming from there and we are getting gusts that feel like 40, 45 miles per hour. Just want to keep an eye for debris and things that may be going through the air.Tallahassee is about 60 miles from Keaton Beach where this storm just made landfall. So here where I am is inland. This is where it's now going to get worse. The situation here will deteriorate for several hours as this storm moves in, which mean more rain. They're expecting maybe six to 10 total inches here and more wind. Tallahassee has never experienced hurricane-force winds since they have been keeping records. All the storms that have passed through here have come through as tropical storms, 74 miles per hour or less. They could get hurricane-force winds here over the next few hours as this storm moves over us and into Georgia. And 200,000 people live in Florida's capital city. This is where Governor Ron DeSantis has been speaking to the state, warning them to stay safe. Meanwhile, the people here where he is speaking from, they need to stay inside also because getting around is really just going to continue to get much, much worse. You can see some of the trees here. There are trees, much bigger trees than this all over Tallahassee, big, gorgeous trees, that are just going to be soaked into their roots. And as the wind picks up, they will be so vulnerable and there will be such a great risk of tree damage, power outages. Right now, there is still power in this downtown area where we are. But that could turn, again, very quickly. They are expecting things to get worse here potential, as I said, Sara, a situation they may have never seen before here in Florida's capital city making it challenging, I think, perhaps to coordinate, coordinate the storm response throughout this day. More rain coming in now, Sara, and there is the wind. Cue the wind.",

But it is significant that you say that this is the first time ever that Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, has ever experienced hurricane-strength winds and rain. That is significant. That is why they have been telling people to get to safety if they are near low-lying water. People need to understand, Tallahassee is inland. It is not right on the coast. And yet, here is this massive storm. Thank you so much, John. I appreciate you. We will check back with you in just a bit.I want to go now to our Bill Weir, who is in Steinhatchee, Florida, which is also getting pounded by this storm and these bands of wind and rain. What are you experiencing at this hour?",

But the thing about these hurricanes is it can go from happy to heartbreak in just a few minutes. That is the reality of them. I do want to give you a sense of what has happened here at CrystalRiver. This is where people normally dock their boats, way over there. They bring them in to go see the manatees. We have been standing here on actually very dry ground, literally minutes ago, and now we are seeing the water come up. It's come up, oh, a couple of feet here. This is completely normally dry ground. You would never want to put a boat on this. If you look to where the sort of awning is there with that pontoon boat, I mean, where you see the lights, that's the end of the pier, which is normally dry. So you can definitely see the storm surge is happening here. The fear is it will get up to nine feet, potentially. Right now, it's only at a couple of feet, and the flooding is not extensive yet here in Crystal River. That could change. We hope it doesn't. We hope this is it. But this storm is still going, it's still dangerous. And so we will be checking in with bunch of different people. But I'm going to go back to Phil Mattingly, who, hopefully, is safe and dry in the studio. Phil?",

We're going to get to our team in Tallahassee in just a minute, but I want to start with as Hurricane Idalia has made landfall in Florida, we want total to the National Hurricane Center's director, Michael Brennan.

Get to an interior room in your home, you're not going to want to be outside. We have a lot of debris blowing around, trees coming down.There could be structural damage. So, these areas near the eye wall as it moves inland are going to see some significant wind impacts. We're also still seeing water levels rising along the coast along the Big Bend region. Significant life-threatening storm surge is going to continue here for several more hours. We're seeing elevated water levels all the way down into the Tampa Bay region still with significant inundation there. So, we're just starting to see the impacts ramp up now as Idalia moves inland across north Florida, southeastern Georgia later today and into tonight. And we're going to see significant impacts all the way up into the Carolinas during the day tomorrow.",

It's moving at almost 20 mph now, so that's going to bring the center pretty far inland before it has a lot of time to weaken. That's why we're still expecting it to be a hurricane even when it reaches the coast of Georgia and South Carolina.Be at or near hurricane strength as we get into tonight. So that's why we have that hurricane warning and storm surge warning in effect for portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coast and those inland areas in Georgia and South Carolina under hurricane warnings as well. So, again, substantial impacts that are going to spread inland with the center of Idalia and not to mention the flooding, heavy rainfall, especially to the left of the track. Areas farther inland like Augusta; Columbia, South Carolina; Fayetteville, North Carolina; W could see the substantial rainfall, flooding risk play out over the next 24 to 36 hours.",
