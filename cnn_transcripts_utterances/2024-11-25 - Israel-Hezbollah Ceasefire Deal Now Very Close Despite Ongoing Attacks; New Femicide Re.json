Now, Republicans are bracing for long confirmation battles ahead, especially for the president- elect's more controversial choices, like the nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, who faces allegations of sexual assault. It could force Republicans to choose between loyalty to Trump and growing concerns about getting nominees confirmed in a narrowly controlled Senate. Some are vigorously defending Hegseth, but one Republican senator, while still defending Trump's vision, says it's fair to ask about the assault case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ERIC SCHMITT, (R-MO): Senators certainly are going to ask questions about it. They should. And he has a right to answer. Ultimately, this is a decision that President Trump made to bring in another disruptor. And I think if you look at this election, it was disruptor versus establishment. He ran on this.

We heard in the interview that the military officials are being given the time to come up with a plan which can achieve that. So there's very little detail, as you might imagine, as to what that retaliation could look like or even what a time frame could be. But it is in retaliation to what we saw at the end of October from Israel, where they took out a number of defense and military targets. So we understand it was missile manufacturing sites and aerial defense systems. And since then, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also said that there was a component in Iran's nuclear program which was targeted as well. That launch and those strikes were in retaliation for what we saw at the beginning of October when Tehran launched around about 200 ballistic missiles on Israel, saying it was targeting military facilities. So this is a tit-for-tat response, a very significant response, certainly the likes of which we have not seen between these two state players before. But we will have to wait and see what the Tehran response looks like. Now, another issue we are following very closely is that potential ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah. We are hearing that it could be very close, according to a regional source. We're also hearing from an Israeli official that significant progress has been made. But we are being cautioned from many sides that we are not quite there yet. We did hear, though, from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Michael Herzog, speaking to Israeli Army Radio, that the ceasefire could happen, quote, \"within days.\" So it really does feel as though it could be imminent, although he did say Israel also reserves the right to respond if need be. Rosemary. CHURCH; All right. Thanks to Paula Hancocks bringing us the latest on that. I appreciate it. The White House is condemning the killing of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates and calling it a horrific crime against those who stand for peace, tolerance and coexistence. That statement coming as authorities in the UAE arrested three people in connection with the death of Rabbis v. Kogan, who had been filmed by a friend days before his murder. Kogan had been missing since Thursday and on Sunday, the UAE Interior Ministry confirmed his body had been discovered and the arrests made. Israel says he was killed in an anti-Semitic act of terror. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The State of Israel will use every means to bring the murderers and their dispatchers to justice. None of them will escape accountability. I greatly appreciate the cooperation with the UAE in investigating this murder. Together, we will strengthen our ties in the face of attempts by the axis of evil to harm our peace relations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He'll be holding some bilateral meetings. He'll be taking part in a broader G7 meeting. And then he'll also be holding a meeting with NATO on Tuesday that was sort of hastily arranged off the back of that Russian medium range missile strike on Dnipro on Thursday. [03:15:07] So, look, Russia has signaled that this is essentially a new phase in the war with that missile strike. And that, I think, will form the broader context of that meeting. They are willing to bring in a whole new class of weapons with this that essentially dwarf the range of the long range missiles that the West has provided to Ukraine and that they recently lifted the restrictions on using inside of Russia. We're getting early reports this morning signaling that perhaps those missiles may have been used again on Kursk, unconfirmed as of this moment. But a freelance advisor to the governor of Kursk suggesting that Western-provided missiles were used on that region. Seven missiles used on Kursk this morning, according to the governor there. So it looks like Ukraine may be continuing with those efforts in spite of that Russian effort to sort of restore the international view of its deterrent last week. Look, perhaps still more importantly, the context here is that Russia is still advancing on the front lines, particularly in the east and southeast of Ukraine. The U.K. defense ministry described this as the most unstable the front lines have been since 2022. So I think all that will come into play. President Zelenskyy said last week that Ukraine is discussing new air defense systems with its allies to protect them against new risks. And I think one other headline that we may look for out of this meeting, Rosemary, is any progress towards providing Ukraine with that $50 billion loan backed by those frozen Russian sovereign assets? The commitment from the G7 has been to provide that by the end of the year. And of course, that would give Ukraine much greater financial security going into next year and, of course, into the next U.S. administration.",

It is likely that they will appear virtually. And it is a hearing that will start at 10:30 a.m. at a Van Nuys courtroom here in the Los Angeles area. The judge also setting very strict rules around what happens in this hearing. There will be no cameras and no cell phone. In fact, the cell phones will be sealed in bags. Journalists will be allowed to attend, but only 16 members of the public will be allowed in that courtroom and they will get their seats via a lottery. There is huge attention and interest in this case, especially after a 2023 docuseries on Peacock, where a member of the boy band Menudo also alleged that he was a victim of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, the father of the two brothers. So that, along with a letter that Eric Menendez wrote before the killings, describing the sexual abuse is what the defense team says should be used and is why they are asking a court to reconsider the sentence and the conviction. And so the district attorney here in Los Angeles agreed with the defense. The problem for the defense is that that district attorney was essentially voted out of office. Nathan Hochman, the incoming district attorney here in Los Angeles, sees this case a little bit different. Here's what he told us. NATHAN HOCHMAN, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-ELECT: Now, as to whether or not I'm going to support that particular motion or not, you've got to do the hard work to make that decision. You've got to review thoroughly the facts in the law.

A disturbing report is underscoring why marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women today is more important than ever. According to the U.N., last year a woman was killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member. People are taking to the streets to show support for the cause and anger at the shocking statistics. The report shows that globally 85,000 women and girls were killed intentionally in 2023. Much of the violence against women and girls happens in the home. 60 percent of all female homicides are committed by intimate partners or family members, with 140 women and girls on average losing their lives to domestic violence every day. Now U.N. Women is calling for accountability and action from decision makers. Kalliopi Mingeirou, the chief of the U.N.'s Ending Violence Against Women section, underlined the need for greater progress in basic safety for women, and she pointed out the most violence against women still goes unreported. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KALLIOPI MINGEIROU, CHIEF, ENDING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, U.N. WOMEN: We know that less than 40 percent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. And just to mention that less of these women, less than 10 percent who seek help appeal to the police. There's so much stigma for survivors of violence to really report the violence that they experience. And you know it's really difficult for women just to report on the partners that they are with. Sometimes they're so much afraid of their own lives, they're afraid that they're going to lose the custody of their children. So it becomes very, very difficult to report such violence. So we really see only the tip of the iceberg. We have seen some progress though in the last few decades. Member states have been working and governments have been working very hard to implement laws, policies, and to put services in place to address violence against women and girls. And now we have as of 2023, we have 104 countries that they have comprehensive laws addressing domestic violence. And we have seen some increases of budgets in order to implement these laws.

Out to the west we are going to have a series of systems moving their way through. This is expected to bring some heavy rainfall along the coast and some very heavy snow especially in the Sierras could see two to three feet over the next few days. By late into the day Monday again you'll start to see that first system begin to spread into the areas of the mid-Atlantic as well as the northeast overnight into early Tuesday. Also looking at some showers along the southeast coast too. The other system we're watching that's the one that moved into the west coast now starting to overspread into the Rockies and eventually into the central portion of the country once we get towards Wednesday. This is going to have mostly rain here as the temperatures won't quite be cold enough for snow. You're really going to have to go pretty far north to get the snow into the mix. But by overnight Wednesday and into Thursday those temperatures starting to creep down in some areas allowing a few more spots to get some snow or even a rain snow mix. Heavy rain at times possible across the Tennessee Valley even cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Knoxville could have rain in the forecast. Then by midday Thursday you're looking at more of that moisture over spreading into the northeast and into the mid-Atlantic. So any last minute travel or local travel on Thanksgiving Day itself the biggest concerns are going to be the northeast stretching all the way down into the gulf coast where you're going to have the bulk of that really heavy moisture. So then the question becomes okay, what about the famous Macy's Day Parade? Here's the thing we've got that rain coming in the heaviest will hold off till the afternoon and evening hours of Thursday. So the first few hours of the parade should in theory be okay but those rain chances go up very quickly for the back half of the parade.

For those planning to catch a flight this week Brian Kelly founder of travel website The Points Guy offers this advice on how to beat the travel chaos.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN KELLY, FOUNDER, THEPOINTSGUY.COM: In general I recommend try to leave on the first flight of the day generally weather hits later in the day so the earlier you can get out a lot of airlines will actually let you move your flights earlier. So if you're flying through New York this Thursday you may want to do that or even call and ask the airline to leave the night before. Also understand the DOT in October now instituted new rules if your flight is delayed three or more hours domestically or six or more internationally just know that you're owed a full refund. So if you're in the airport your flight keeps getting delayed you want to get home for the holidays you can actually book yourself on another carrier and know that if the delay qualifies you will eventually get a full refund for your other flight which gives a little bit of peace of mind. If you're starting to say you know what I don't want to travel this weekend if the weather is going to throw things out of whack, you can always call the airline most airlines are pretty lenient these days with letting you make changes, and if there are weather waivers so if the storm hits airlines will say hey we are encouraging people to rebook later so I say get ahead of the action instead of going to the airport and hoping for the best. I also recommend if you are going to end up traveling and there is weather coming even if it's not in your home city, weather elsewhere can impact your flight so always sign up for app updates with the airline you're flying and then I use an app called Flighty. Flighty often will let me know if my flight's delayed before the airline does. So getting that intel seeing where your plane is coming from can give you that inside scoop to say, hey, look and try to call the airline and switch to a different flight that day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.K. Met Office said some rural communities could be cut off with up to 40 centimeters of snow expected in higher elevations. Forecasters say wind and rain could continue to be a threat before storm Bert finally clears the region on Tuesday. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These robberies are not believed to be random. This video was shot at the home of Milwaukee Bucks player Bobby Portis. He's now offering a reward for anyone who can help return his stolen items. Investigators say the burglaries could be the work of sophisticated organized transnational criminals. They're thought to be using public records, social media and news reports as well as surveillance drones and jamming devices.

The FBI is said to have briefed both the NBA and the NFL leagues to tell them of what they're seeing which is targeted, concerted, well-organized likely South American gangs that are in here either on visas or unlawfully that are using public information.Where is the team playing? Who is with the quarterback or the players of the family's going? And then a lot of surveillance to determine whether the house is empty, whether there's a dog, whether there's fences or anything that would be hard to get over and they are going into the houses at those times to take a lot of expensive goods and materials and clothing and purses and everything else.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so a couple things are happening. So one, a lot of this is defense actually, Rosemary, what we're learning is a lot of these players have home alarm systems. They're not using them. They probably need to get more surveillance.The FBI is said to have told them, you know, get a trusted house sitter if someone can be in the home because it does not look like these are intended to be physical encounters. They just want to get the materials and to take things from these players and their families and so a lot of it is just reinforcing defense. Some of that may be also social media in terms of not saying who's coming, maybe not putting kids or pictures on social media. On the offense side the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in particular potentially international law enforcement agencies seem to have a sense of at least what this group is. They don't think they're from China or they're from the United States, that they do have some ties to South America. So we have to believe that there is a concerted effort to disrupt this group. They are sophisticated, this group. They are known to use things like drones to get an assessment of what the house is like and then go in so that they can go in quickly, get what they want and leave. So this is very serious. I've been in sports security for a while or been involved with it. I've never seen a bulletin by sports leagues like this before. For the most part they try to keep them quiet and I think they wanted to get the word out that all players have to be careful.",
