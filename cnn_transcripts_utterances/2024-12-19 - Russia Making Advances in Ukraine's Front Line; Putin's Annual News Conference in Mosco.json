      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. We want to begin with two major legal storiesthis evening. Just minutes ago, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO arrived in   New York as you're seeing there, after being flown from Pennsylvania. And these pictures you're looking at there, you can see him there in that orange suit, shows the extraordinary security around Luigi Mangione. He's in the orange jumpsuit, being escorted heavily, escorted by armed police. Even the city's mayor, the New York State case against him will proceed in parallel, we understand with a federal case. And multiple sources tell CNN, those new federal charges will include murder, stalking and a weapons charge. UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed earlier this month while walking to a conference, if you remember from his Manhattan hotel. We of course, stay across this story, we'll come back to it in just a few moments and take you live to New York for the very latest. We turn though, now to Avignon in France -- well, where Gisele Pelicot, as you can see here, the 72-year-old woman whose former husband, Dominique Pelicot and dozens of others were sentenced today for her horrifying mass rape spanning a decade. Across the world, she has become a figure of strength as well as resilience for going public with her case, a decision she says she has never regretted. And the perpetrators of her abuse include these 50 men, just take it in, these are their names, includes Dominique Pelicot, but 50 others sentenced between them all to some more than 400 combined years. Speaking outside the courtroom, Gisele Pelicot said she hopes to give survivors of sexual violence the courage to speak up. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GISELE PELICOT, SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE (through translator):  I am thinking, finally, of the unrecognized victims of stories which often unfold in the shadows. I want you to know we share the same fight. I would like to express my most profound gratitude to everyone who supported me throughout this lengthy trial. Your testimonies moved me, and I drew strength from them to return every day during these long days of hearings. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She said, \"we have a really problematic justice system when it comes to trying cases of this nature.\" Women in France simply don't trust the French justice system. And she pointed the fact that only 10 percent of victims of rape even report the crime to the justice system, and of those reports, only 1 in 4 percent end up with a conviction.

And what we saw in this court is that they're already using the concept of consent all the time. The problem is that a law is not going to change the fact that judges have misogynistic views, that juries have misogynistic views, that there's not enough money for police officers to inquire the right way for judges to have time to do the files. Like we heard the judge who prosecuted the case, she said she had 90 cases to do in one year, including the Pelicot case. Imagine what it means. It should be something you work on full time for 2 or 3 years, right? I was talking to a police officer who is working on those kind of cases, she said at night, I need to decide, am I working on this incest or am I working on this mass rape?

I would say it's probably Crimea plus something within Luhansk, a bridge over to Crimea from Russia. And then it's a question of what percentage.

She and that prosecutor, Nathan Wade, they went on trips. He paid for some things. But when a trial judge looked closely at it and had her even testify on the stand, he learned from her that she did not believe that these gifts were anything that would have benefited her in the case. So, the judge looked at this issue at the trial level and that judge, Scott McAfee, said, you know, she can continue on. Nathan Wade needs to step down from this case against Donald Trump. It'll continue on into appeals. And then, now, the Georgia Court of Appeals is looking at what that trial level judge did and said he made the wrong call. Actually, because there was such a significant appearance of impropriety by the district attorney, she needs to be pulled off of this case. The bigger impact here is that it's essentially the death rattle for this case against Donald Trump in the State of Georgia related to the 2020 election. That's because Willis is the person who was leading it and will have to be replaced. And it's totally unclear how long it will take for that replacement process to happen. And even if the next person assigned to be in charge of this case would want to continue it against Donald Trump. Now, Willis is appealing this ruling today. There's another level of appeals courts above the Georgia Court of Appeals in that state. But it really is a moment that Donald Trump is solidifying his opposition, his wins across the board on criminal cases. He's gotten rid of the two federal cases by winning the presidency and now, the Georgia Court of Appeals is solidifying that this case Fani Willis brought in Fulton County, Georgia against Trump and others, it's not going to continue on right now.",

House Republican lawmakers are racing to cobble together a temporary spending plan as the clock ticks down to a U.S. government shutdown that's happening this weekend. And it comes after billionaire Elon Musk and Donald Trump tanked a bipartisan bill that would have provided temporary funding. The president-elect is also introducing an explosive new demand, telling lawmakers they must raise the debt ceiling as well. House Democrats, meanwhile, are resisting Trump's demands, with one calling the idea to increase the borrowing limit ridiculous. I want to go to our Sunlen Serfaty, who has the very latest.

So, lawmakers have been huddling in a series of closed-door meetings all day really trying to hash out different plans. And as of now, they have not come out with one plan that can satisfy both demands. And from Republicans, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, he is hopeful to put forward a proposal that they're kind of coalescing in the leadership ranks around a clean CR, a clean spending bill, a clean debt limit raise, it would have things like a disaster relief and aid for farms, but not all of the provisions that Democrats originally agreed to. So, as you noted, that's risky to put forward because he is going to lose Democrats' support and he needs that in order to get this over the finish line. So, they are in this tight rope of a moment on Capitol Hill, was so much up in the air and so little time to actually achieve that and the 11th hour request by President-Elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk and others certainly torpedoed the negotiations that took months previously to get to this point.
