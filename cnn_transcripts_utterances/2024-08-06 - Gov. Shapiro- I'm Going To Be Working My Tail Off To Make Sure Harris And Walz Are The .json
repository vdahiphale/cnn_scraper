      "sentences": "North Philly in just moments, Vice President Kamala Harris is going to take the stage for the very first time with the man she just selected to be her running mate. The pick is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach who served 24 years and the Army National Guard before being elected to the House of Representatives six times. Choosing Governor Walz highlights just how much the Harris campaign is focusing on the blue wall states of the Midwest, which sent Biden to the White House. Sources also say Harris felt Walz would be a trustworthy partner in both campaigning and governing.So why did the Harris campaign pick Pennsylvania and specifically Philadelphia for its very first joint event? Because not only do Harris and Walz need to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, they need to drive up the vote both here in Philly and in the surrounding suburbs. And overlooking the popular governor of Pennsylvania as a running mate is something of a calculated risk for the campaign. Let's get right to CNN's MJ Lee, who's here in Philly. And MJ, the crowd is pumped. What are voters telling you?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's no question, Jake, that there is real enthusiasm in this arena. I'm sure you've sensed it too. It took a little walk around to talk to the folks that are in this room. And there are a couple of things that really stood out to me, Jake, for one, the voters in this arena very much really do believe that Kamala Harris represents something new and something different. This has to do with her age.It has to do with the fact that she is a woman. It also has to do with her race. One woman I was talking to actually started tearing up because they said they were thinking about the possibility of there being a future biracial president, because she herself has biracial grandchildren. The other thing I notice, and I don't think this is surprising at all, a lot of people don't have a great sense of who Tim Walz is but they are starting to get read in they are starting to see those videos circulating on social media. They're using words like, he seems nice, he seems funny, as they're starting to just get to know the vice presidential running mate. And also, every single person, interestingly, that I spoke to Jake, said that they were supportive of President Biden's decision to get out of the 2024 race, as much as they all did support his presidency. Now, when Harris and Tim Walz take the stage together, we certainly expect that the Vice President is going to take the opportunity to explain to this crowd why she decided to choose him. We will see what kind of chemistry they have together, and we will see the ways in which Tim Walz will try to complement Kamala Harris on the ticket by leaning into his biography. We expect that he is going to talk about his Nebraska roots, his Minnesota values. And what is clear from all of our reporting right now, Jake, is that there are many reasons for which Tim Walz really impressed Kamala Harris and the vetting team. We are told, for example, by sources familiar that at one point in the vetting team's interview when the Minnesota Governor was asked the question of how he sees the role of the vice president, he said it is whatever she would like it to be, that essentially, he would be happy to do whatever she thinks is necessary. And then another point, when he was asked whether he has aspirations himself to run for president, that he said no. A different approach seems to have been taken by Josh Shapiro, the other contender. Of course, we are told that he actually brought in a lot of questions himself about what the role of the vice presidency would be under a Kamala Harris presidency. But Jake, just looking around the room, you can't help but think about the fact that for so many years, Joe Biden and the advisers around him had said it had to be him running in 2024 that he had to be at the top of the ticket, of course, in 16 days, 16 very fast days. We have seen Kamala Harris sort of prove the president wrong and show that there can be somebody else at the top of the Democratic ticket, Jake.",
