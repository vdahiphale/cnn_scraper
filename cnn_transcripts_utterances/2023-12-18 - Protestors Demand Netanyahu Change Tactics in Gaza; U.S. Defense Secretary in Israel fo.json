It stretches two and a half miles long, 160 feet underground. The IDF says it's wide enough to drive a vehicle through, equipped with electricity, ventilation and communications systems. CNN could not independently verify those claims. We start off this morning with CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who is live at the Pentagon; and CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who's live for us in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, I want to start with you. It is tough to over-emphasize just how extreme the pressure has gotten on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, both domestically but also internationally.

There has been a recognition among Israeli officials who I've been talking to for weeks now that, at the end of the day, if there is a clock that is ticking on this war. That clock is being run in Washington. And so these meetings today between Secretary Austin and Israel's war cabinet, which follow discussions between Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor to President Biden, and the prime minister of Israel in the last few days. All of these are part of a bigger picture and conversation about exactly what happens next. For the United States, they very much want to see a change in terms of what we're seeing in Gaza. Fewer civilians killed, a less intensive bombing campaign, a less intense ground offensive, and instead, shifting to intelligence-driven raids to go after senior Hamas commanders. But the question is when exactly will that happen? There's no question that the United States wants that to happen far sooner than Israel does. And so the question is, will Israel bow to the pressure of the United States, and if so, how quickly?",

You know, typically, Phil, when we see images of Hamas tunnels that the Israeli military have discovered, they're the kind of narrow tunnels that you'd have to walk single-file down in order to get through. But this one is far different.You can drive a large vehicle through it, according to the Israeli military. It reaches up to 50 meters underground. It's fully equipped with electronics systems, ventilation, communications systems. Now, this tunnel doesn't actually cross into Israel from Gaza, but where it does emerge is about 400 meters away from the Erez crossing, which is one of the key crossing points between Israel and Gaza. It's also where Hamas terrorists attacked on October 7th in order to get into Israel. It was one of the points that they used. There's no evidence that this tunnel was used on October 7th at this point, in terms of what the Israel military has provided. I also think it's interesting that the Israeli military also said that they actually discovered and secured this tunnel weeks ago, but they only chose to show it to the media and reveal these videos in the last few days. I think that's also a sign of what the Israeli military wants the media to focus on. They want to push the conversation back in the direction of Hamas's infrastructure underground, what they've been able to accomplish. And also the resources that they have used in Gaza rather than spending them on the people in Gaza is the key point the Israeli military wants to make.",

Now, we are getting word just this morning from a U.S. military official that yet another wave of attacks has occurred in the Southern Red Sea. The USS Carney responded to yet another distress call from a commercial ship operating in the Southern Red Sea. Multiple projectiles were targeting that vessel, according to the military official. But this all comes as the U.S. and the world are trying to figure out a solution to this major problem, something that is really causing an impediment to international shipping. The third largest shipping company in the world actually has paused operations in the Red Sea because of all of these missiles, drones, and projectiles being launched from the Houthi rebels there. In a statement, the largest, third largest shipping companies, CMA CGM said, quote, \"We're deeply concerned about the attacks on commercial vessels unfolding in the Red Sea region. The situation is further deteriorating, and concern of safety is increasing.\" This is something that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will be discussing with his counterparts in the region this week, trying to bolster a multinational naval task force that could better protect the ships that are operating in the region, guys.",

They look at that and say, there's an opportunity there. SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, \"SEMAFOR\": I actually kind of agree with what was just said. Not really because, again, so much of Republican voters are so concerned about the border. And this is exactly what they want.
