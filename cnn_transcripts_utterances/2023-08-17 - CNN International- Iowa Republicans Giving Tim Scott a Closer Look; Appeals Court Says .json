A new study shows that cancer diagnosis rate among Americans below age 50 went up between 2010 and 2019. That was largely driven by a spike among women and people in their 30s. Increase was the highest among Native Americans as well as Asians and Hispanics. Data from other countries also shows an increase of cancer among young adults.Scientists attributed that to better screenings and other factors that they have yet to investigate. The study was published in the journal of JAMA Network Open. At least three people have died in the northeastern United States after contracting infection from a flesh-eating bacteria. Officials say two people in Connecticut were infected after swimming in the Long Island Sound. And New York's governor says the bacteria was detected in a person who died on Long Island. And all the victims fell ill from a bacteria that lives naturally in warm salty water. People can catch it by swimming with open wounds or by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. It's been a brutally hot summer in the United States and it's not over yet. This week much of the U.S. will be blanketed in a miserable heat wave once again.

And you could see it's even extending into portions of Central California. And so, we are going to be dealing with triple digit heat for some areas. Spokane, 100 degrees for today, normal high of 84. Hitting 100 in Sacramento. That's almost ten degrees above normal.But you do see that temperatures start to cool a little bit. They will be back to 85 degrees on Saturday in Spokane. Seattle, back to normal, even below normal, on Friday. So temperatures will start to back down a little bit. Excessive heat warnings though are back across Texas, where we can see incredibly hot temperatures. Some of the warmest so far. We're looking at temperatures at 108 in Dallas, 103 in Houston, 104 in Midland. Those are the highs on Thursday. 108 in Dallas, it's the feels like temperature this afternoon. Houston 108, feeling like the triple digits just all across the deep South and the Gulf Coast, so another very hot and humid day. So temperatures will hit 109 in Dallas on Friday. Hitting 109 in Del Rio. Temperatures are close to 104 for Monroe. New Orleans hitting 100 degrees. It's the same old story across the South. Temperatures are going to stay above average and then even building to above average temperatures across the Northern Plains, Midwest and really the entire East, aside for some areas in northern New England. Below normal temperatures for the West. So temperature outlook for next week, it looks like hardly anyone will be able to escape the heat. We'll see a small pocket across portions of the Southwest as well as the Northeast but we're looking at a very hot week or above normal week, I should say, for the vast majority of the U.S. Here's the forecast radar. You saw those storms just sweeping by. We do have a chance of showers and storms. Over the next two days we're looking at anywhere from an inch or two of rain across the portions of the Midwest.

They come from parts of Himachal Pradesh, especially Shimla where landslides have led to the lost of properties and lives. We do know that over a dozen people still remain missing. Unfortunately that death toll could be going up. Now what's triggered these landslides is the heavy rainfall in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

And they've seen coup after coup happening in this region. And for them, Niger, which is a very strategic large country. About twice the size of Texas. It's a very key ally in the fight against terrorism. For them, it's one coup too many. And they want to be seen to act and to really take a firm stance.And there was a threat very, very early on, an ultimatum about restoring democracy in seven days and a military action was planned. But some said that they showed their hand too early and then the plan actually didn't happen. Which may have emboldened the junta in Niger. But now ECOWAS is very keen to avoid a costly war in this region. It's unstable. Some of the poorest countries in the world are in this region. It's plagued with insurgency, which Niger was a key ally in that fight. So it's not an easy decision, Bianca, to take military action. To put their boots on the ground in a country like this, in a region that could lead to protracted civil war. In Nigeria, for example, which is headed -- which the President Tinubu is the head of ECOWAS right now. The northern part of Nigeria is very close to Niger. Long, historic, and ethnic ties. And they're saying that any war on Niger, it's a war our brothers. We don't want it. So ECOWAS really has to pursue dialogue until the very last moment. And that's what they're doing. But they are clear that it may happen. This meeting of the defense chiefs, later on today, is to put a deployment plan into place. And it's very likely that we will see military action in Niger in the coming days and perhaps weeks -- Bianca.",
