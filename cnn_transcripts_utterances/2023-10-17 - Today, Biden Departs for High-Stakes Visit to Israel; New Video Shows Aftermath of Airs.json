This is the Israeli city targeted in some of the most recent rocket attacks. And some of the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza have been here, Khan Yunis, a southern city, Rafah, not far from the Rafah crossing here. You can see this is the region where Israel has told people in Gaza to move to, yet this is where some of the airstrikes are taking place.Our military analysts are speculating that perhaps Israel is targeting Hamas terrorists who are now trying intersperse themselves with the civilians in this area. That, of course, very likely in many ways. Let's get right now to our friend, Sara Sidner, who is in Tel Aviv right now, the major city in Israel with the very latest on what you are seeing.",

Her daughter, 21-year-old Mia Schem, was kidnapped from the music festival earlier in the month where at least 260 bodies were found in the aftermath of the initial Hamas surprise attack.And I attended a press conference that her mother, Keren, held today. I want you to listen to this mother who, for the very first time, saw that her daughter was alive. No one knew anything since Saturday. And, yesterday, this video was sent out by Hamas of her daughter talking to the camera. She had a bandage on her arm, and she had clearly been injured in a very bad way, but she was alive. And here is what her mother told the world today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Again, there have been rockets here almost every single day. This one was a little different, though, because at least two that we could count were not intercepted and actually did make impact. Take a listen to what it sounded like a little bit earlier on.You can hear the sound of some Iron Dome intercepts, but also the sound of a couple of those rockets making landfall, one, just over there. No reports of any casualties, though, and Hamas coming out and saying that this was revenge, basically, for the continued strikes on Gaza. And I want to point out that in Gaza there is no Iron Dome. There has been relentless bombardment for yet another day there, including many strikes, as you heard John Berman talking about, in that southern part of the Gaza Strip. This is where Israeli forces had told people from northern Gaza to move to. We're hearing of at least six strikes right next to that Rafah border crossing. Palestinian Health Ministry saying at least 60 people killed in those strikes, the death toll now in Gaza nearly at 3,000. And we actually spoke to a 22 year old dentistry student. We have been in constant contact with her since interviewing her on Friday. She is from the northern part of Gaza. She and her family were getting ready to move to the south. They were having difficulties finding a place that had electricity or even beds or room. But they said that after today's strikes, they are simply too nervous to move to the south because it just does not appear to be safe, Sara.",

The Dwight D. Eisenhower is headed there.And we learned this morning that a Marine Expeditionary Unit will be aboard the Baton headed through the Red Sea, some 2,000 Marines, part of that. I want to bring in retired Major General James Spider Marks, our CNN military analyst. And Spider, look, look, we talk about deterrence here, but you also note that there is a level of potential compatibility between these U.S. forces and the Israel Defense Forces. What do you mean? MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  John, the United States and Israel has a very long exercise program and a very long program, a historical program of cooperation, routine efforts on intelligence, exchange, maneuver forces, Marines working with other elements within the IDF, U.S. forces working routinely with the IDF. In other words, there's a level of trust at multiple levels where the United States and Israel have worked together in the past. So, when the carrier battle group, the strike group, shows up in the Eastern Med, the Eisenhower will replace the Ford, but both of those will probably remain on station for a while. There is interconnection between those capabilities and what the IDF brings to bear on the ground and in the air. So,  those levels of support exist and will exist immediately once they're on station.",

We've been getting word that there have been Israeli airstrikes.We can come into the map here so people can see what I'm talking about. There have been Israeli airstrikes in the southern part of Gaza, which is where Israel told people to move to. We know there have been strikes around Rafah, Khan Yunis, which is in the major city. There have been strikes in the north also. The question that a lot of people are asking is why. If Israel told people to evacuate to here, why then would they be striking in that region? MARKS:  There are legitimate targets in Gaza. Israel has the right to go after those legitimate Hamas targets, irrespective of where they are located, except going through the collateral damage estimates that are necessary before you strike. So, although you want to get as many civilians away from the northern portion of Gaza as you can, there still are legitimate targets. And it is not unlikely that Hamas is trying to integrate itself into the civilian migration to the south so that they can live and fight another day. If everything in the south is completely off limits, then you have got Hamas leadership potentially that will be intermingled, will be completely integrated into that, and they will go untouched.",

But Jim Jordan is still pressing ahead, plans to have this vote on the House floor and essentially see how many members will vote against him.He can only afford in this first vote to lose three Republican votes. We expect that these five no votes, maybe ten at the moment, perhaps even more, because a number of members simply are not saying where they will come down. And driving all of this tension is everything that happened over the last two weeks, the historic ouster, unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, and the elevation of Jim Jordan, pushed by those very same members who sought and successfully got Kevin McCarthy out of the job. Some members simply do not want to reward those hardliners by elevating Jim Jordan and are making very clear they plan to vote against him on the floor, even if there's pushback from some of Jordan's key allies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SCOTT PERRY (R-PA):  Feelings are hurt, but Jim didn't have anything to do with that. So, they need to assign their ire, if you will, to those who they think deserve it, but certainly not Jim Jordan. REP.

I want to start there, but then I want to ask you about everything that's unfolding in Israel.Your vote was unknown until late last night on speaker, on the speaker's race. You came out of the meeting with Republicans last night saying that you will support Jim Jordan. What got you to a place where you're comfortable with that? REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX):  Well, I had a very good conversation with him. I was concerned about national security issues, particularly if we pass an Israeli supplemental national security bill, would Ukraine be included in that? And I was assured that he could link the two. He would look at the details of that, but that was very important to me. But I think most importantly, Kate, is we can't afford not to have a speaker in the chair. We have to govern. I mean, as we look at what's unfolding in Israel, my committee does the authorization of use of military force. If we don't have a speaker in the chair, we can't pass any of this stuff. Jordan has a unique capability to govern his caucus, the Freedom Caucus, and primarily the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy. Now, I don't like rewarding bad behavior.

They know how to do this. But we have to have the assurance from Hamas that they're not going to steal the food and humanitarian relief going in and use it for military purposes. That's a negotiation taking place right now. And I think for the sake of the 1 million children whose lives could be at risk, we have to make this thing work. And, finally, because the narrative is such that if you see children in Southern Gaza being impacted, that's going to light up Hamas' narrative and could impact Hezbollah, which is in Lebanon.

So, this is something we are looking at.As you know, Secretary Austin now has 2,000 Marines in Expeditionary Force off the coast of Gaza and Israel, I'd say Northern Israel, near Hezbollah, as a deterrent to ensure that Hezbollah does not invade Israel. And I agree with that. I'm glad the secretaries put the warships there, aircraft carriers, destroyers. But the Expeditionary Force of Marines is very telling because that would be a kinetic force that if they land on the ground, their boots on the ground go into war. And we don't want that to happen.
