      "sentences": "That's right. It's the big question of what this delay means and how this case will ultimately move from here. Now, as you said, the judge was expected to issue this long awaited decision on presidential immunity and whether Donald Trump's conviction would stand or if it would get thrown out.But there were talks over the weekend between lawyers for Trump and the district attorney's office. Trump's lawyer said that they were going to ask the judge to pause these proceedings because of questions that they have now that Trump is the president-elect. This is all a result of the election outcome. The DA's office wrote to the judge and said that they want a week to figure out what they think the best steps forward are. I mean, that could range from anything of them saying that they want the judge to move forward with his ruling on immunity and maybe the subsequent sentencing. It could even be as far as them saying that they agree the case should be dismissed. But we really don't know what posture they're going to take in this as it unfolds. But Trump's lawyers have made clear that they still want to move ahead. They think that this case should be thrown out because of the Supreme Court's ruling, but also because Donald Trump is now the president-elect and saying that a state judge should not have any interference in his capacity to govern the nation. He does not, of course, become the president until January. And there is still time in the calendar for decisions to be made, but it is shrinking as well. So whether Donald Trump gets a decision on this immunity remains to be seen. Whether he is sentenced is certainly something that people that I've been speaking to lawyers think is less likely. But ultimately, one week from today, we'll find out what the D.A. recommends. And from there, the judge will make his own decision -- Brianna.",

And while Trump becoming president is having a big impact on criminal cases, the special counsel, which has those two criminal cases against Donald Trump, has signaled that they're looking to wind down those investigations because of the DOJ policy of not investigating a sitting president. That doesn't apply to civil cases.And in those cases, both the New York civil fraud case and the E. Jean Carroll defamation and sexual abuse cases, Trump is on the hook for over half a billion dollars. Now, those cases are on appeal. So we're waiting to see what the appeals court will do. But the fact that he is the president-elect will not impact the outcome of those cases. It will purely come down to the legal arguments -- Brianna.",

It's been touted by Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, and it is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to attempt to bring religion into the classroom. But now, this federal judge has temporarily pumped the brakes on this law by putting out and granting a preliminary injunction.Not only did he say that it was unconstitutional on its face, but that the plaintiffs that brought this lawsuit against the defendants, against Louisiana, that they are likely to win this case based on the fact that it violates the First Amendment. Now, supporters of this Ten Commandments law argue that this document is not just religious-based, that it has historical value, and because of that, it does belong inside of the classrooms. But opponents argue that it is unconstitutional because it is promoting one specific religion, and this is against the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

What that means exactly, we're not sure, but that is what it is being called on social media. What we know is this happened in Louisville, in the Clifton neighborhood of that city, and we're told that that explosion could be heard within a one-mile radius of that area. And like you said, Brianna, we're also learning it's very possible that there are people trapped inside. Now, it's hard to tell from these aerials, but we know that, of course, there are fire crews on the ground as well as law enforcement trying to get a sort of idea of exactly what happened here. But yes, look at that image right there. From that perspective, you can see where that explosion has hit this commercial building, again, in the Clifton section in Louisville, Kentucky.
