He described Kamala Harris as -- quote -- \"lazy as hell,\" saying she is a Marxist. She's not a Marxist. Obviously she's not lazy as hell. She was a district attorney in San Francisco, attorney general in California, senator from California and vice president. Can't really be lazy as hell if you're doing all of those things. And, Daniel Dale, I want to bring you in because you're a fact- checker. One of the things that we heard from the former president a few moments ago, he was talking about how she was in favor of sex changes for prisoners. One thing that we should note is that, during the Trump administration, the Bureau of Prisons, a division of the Justice Department, provided an array of gender-affirming treatments, including hormone therapy for a small group of inmates who requested it during Donald Trump's four years in office, that according to \"The New York Times.\" But, Daniel, there were a number of falsehoods, typical Trump stretching of the truth, bending of the truth, attacking the truth, but your thoughts? What did you pick up on\" DANIEL DALE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, I mean, that one about prisons and transgender people stood out to me.",

He spoke for a couple of minutes there about how Harris is a huge liar. \"The New York Times\" did a side-by-side analysis of one speech from each of them, I think it was last week. They found something like 23 false claims from Trump, 15 or 16 misleading, 15 or 16 exaggerations. They found from Harris, it was like one false, one misleading, one exaggeration. I might quibble with the specific numbers, but we're dealing with that kind of huge disparity, so I think important to point out.",

This was actually the entire point. He got there in the end. It took him a while, but he got there in the end. This is really a message directed towards this group of people.

To some extent, when he talks about how, if Kamala Harris gets into the White House as president, it's going to be like Venezuela on steroids, I mean, that -- as we were talking about with Lulu a few moments ago, that is obviously targeting people who are exiles, people who are migrants, who are refugees from countries like Venezuela, like Cuba, where that kind of messaging might work. But, at the same time, I have to think it has to cut both ways, because if you're Donald Trump and you're calling people the enemy from within and so on, that is using the language of a strongman.

So I don't know that that's the best use of an example to convey to people the risk that a rival can bring, especially when you have -- the Cuban vote is a very important bloc. The Venezuelan American vote is -- they're more recent arrivals, so it's not as strong as other groups.

Sanjay, I don't know what it is these days when I'm sniffling or coughing. It could be all sorts of things, but allergies are still with us. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes . I mean, there is a significant fall allergy season. And a lot of people do suffer. I mean, I have encountered so many people just in the building today, Jim, who are really dealing with this. Ragweed is usually the big culprit. I think the headline, though, is what we're learning is that this first frost being delayed really changes things. It gives these plants that produce the allergens a longer time to grow. It prolongs the allergy season and actually makes it start earlier as well. Take a look at this map, Jim. This is really interesting. Basically, it's making the case that allergy season as we know it is changing around the country. There are many places around the country where allergy season is extensively sort of widened, Reno, for example, 99- day longer allergy season. Some of these places around the country, it's just always going to be allergy season, in Atlanta, 23 days longer, in New York, 21 days longer. Allergy season as we know it is starting to change. By the end of the century, over the next 75 years or so, Jim, there will be about 200 percent increase in pollen overall in the environment. It's just something that we got to think about as the as the temperatures warm.
