The Kremlin calls the situation in the Belgorod region \"alarming\" after a, quote, \"massive strike\" that wounded four people. Shelling injured another person in another district and we are hearing of two drone attacks elsewhere just inside Russia. In the meantime, Kyiv is on edge amid fears Russia will retaliate for that strike on Moscow. We have Fred Pleitgen in the Ukrainian capital right now. Fred, great to have you on. Look, Ukraine is denying involvement but we have seen strikes across the border increase. Now the question is, what is Moscow's next move?",

      "sentences": "That's a very good question. Certainly one of the things that people here are bracing forand have been bracing for, certainly overnight last night, was possible massive Russian retaliation for the alleged drone attack by the -- well,, the Russians say was conducted by the Ukrainians on Moscow. But the Ukrainians denying that. Now overnight, that didn't happen. It was actually very quiet here overnight. There were no strikes. There is a lot of speculation here. On the ground in Kyiv as to why that may be the case. Could it be the Russians sort of retooling their forces? One of the things that the Ukrainians for instance have said is that, for a very long time there have not been any sea launched cruise missile attacks on the part of the Russians so the Ukrainians fear that something like that might be coming. But again, all of that right now is still speculation. As one adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry, who said maybe the Russians did get a message by the fact that there was that drone attack on Moscow. But it is still unclear. But I think the point that you are making and one of the things that you said is absolutely key. Right now, the Russians certainly under pressure at a lot of the border regions with Ukraine on Russian soil. And that Belgorod attack is certainly something that is rattling the people on the ground there. The damage apparently seems to be extensive, according to the governor of the Belgorod region. Some high rise buildings have been damaged. Some private homes damaged as well. Some of the residents that we have heard from in Russia media say that they are extremely concerned. And certainly the governor of the Belgorod region has been calling on the Moscow authorities to do more, to fortify that border and to keep people there safe. And there were those attacks on the refinery in the south in the Krasnodar region. So all of this very far apart. But one thing that was also key and that the Ukrainians are focusing on is certainly further to the north in the Bryansk region. The Russians there are saying that they fended off a attack using a lot of drones earlier today. And there seems to have been an artillery strike or something of the sort on a road near the border on the Ukrainian side, on a road leading toward Russian territory. And the Ukrainians are essentially saying that they believe that, right now, the Russians are so nervous that they are bombing that road to try and make sure that there are no further Ukrainian incursions. And so that certainly seems to go to show how on edge the Russian forces appear to be and possibly the Russian government is as well.",

What we have seenplaying out, since some of these attacks have occurred across the border, is just how vulnerable Russia is. But the other element and the big concern is whether Ukraine is involved and whether they are using Western weaponry for these attacks. We're still getting a lot of data; in the last 24 hours Ukraine says it was not involved. That is an import distinction to make. But these are the questions that are being asked.",

Pyongyang saying there were engine problems on its second stage. South Korea's military picked up what it believes is debris from the rocket, 200 kilometers off its west coast. North Korea admitting failure is rare, especially this quickly. But it says it will try again as soon as possible.

It's at this moment that China is refusing that. And over the last several months, the U.S. has seen a lot of these kinds of risky and escalatory maneuvers by the Chinese. Just in December, yet another Chinese fighter jet tried to intercept an American surveillance plane in much the same way, coming within about 20 feet of that manned aircraft. So obviously, the risk here of escalation of a potential collision between the aircraft is very high. And that is causing the U.S. to release these videos publicly to try to pressure the Chinese into coming back to the table and talking to the U.S. so that a potential escalation does not happen and does not spiral out of control.",

They have to clear one procedural hurdle this afternoon. But sources on both sides of the aisle do believe that this will ultimately come up for a vote and that they will have the votes necessary to pass it. This would cap off weeks of intense negotiations between the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office. We saw very many moments where there were starts and stops in these talks but, ultimately, the two men came together to come to a bipartisan agreement. Now as this heading into this vote later this evening, there still has been some consternation from both Republicans and Democrats. Republicans, some Republicans, particularly the more conservative wing of the party, has really been quite vocal in their opposition to this bill, saying that it has not cut spending enough. Well, you are also hearing from Democrats on the progressive side, who are frustrated when it comes to those work requirements for food stamps and also permitting reform for energy products. At this very moment, top White House officials are up on Capitol Hill, really trying to shore up the support within their Democratic base for this bill. But one key Democrat, a progressive Democrat, congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, just told our colleagues a short while ago that she is voting against the bill. She anticipates that much of her progressive caucus will as well. Now Republicans and Democratic leadership sources have said that they do believe they will have the votes to get this passed. But this will be a bipartisan effort. But once it passes the House, it still needs to move on to the Senate, as these lawmakers are facing a very real time crunch for trying to get something passed before June 5th. That is the day the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has outlined that the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills. Any one senator could hold up this process. So time is of the essence for them to really get working once this bill passes the House this afternoon, as sources up on the Hill have predicted it will. So this will really be a key moment as they are trying to avert default and get this bipartisan agreement passed.",

So the Sackler family said we can file for bankruptcy. We will take, at that point it was $4 billion. So they've gone up to $6 billion now through negotiation. We will take ultimately $6 billion of our personal monies and we will put that into the bankruptcy action. But we're asking for immunity for the future, for individual claims. But through that, you can give it to individual claimants. You can have abatement programs to help people at the local, governmental level of the communities to not use opioids and then also go toward medications for those emergency situations. And 95 percent of the states who are in favor of it but there were some that appealed, believing that immunity was not something that was right or fair. But the converse to that is it would stay in litigation for years. And the amount of money that would be taken up through the legal fees would be depleted for the people that really needed the money. And so ultimately, the appellate court here in New York decided that, under bankruptcy law, that immunity, you can do immunity and at the same time have equity to those that so need that money. So that is what is going forward. And I think it's a win for a lot of people because the states, the communities, the people will get those monies.",

They haven't figured out exactly what they are. What you need to understand at this point is that Kosovo declared its independence in 2008. Many countries recognize that but obviously not Serbia. The vast majority of Kosovo is ethnically Albanian, with the exception of a few municipalities, mostly in northern Kosovo, that are majority ethnic Serbs. Now in 2013, there was an agreement brokered that would've given these regions a certain level of self autonomy. But most of that agreement was never actually implemented. And so, in part, because of that reason, local Serbs boycotted local elections in April. The turnout was less than 4 percent. And what they ended up with was ethnic Albanian mayors in four municipalities in the north. Serbian protesters essentially tried to block their access to local municipal buildings. And obviously things flared from there, with the Kosovo police, with the Kosovo police brought in to quell the protests, the NATO peacekeepers brought in as well. And then things have only gotten worse from there. The U.S., which is one of Kosovo's primary allies, is not blaming Serbia for all of this. They are blaming Kosovo for sending in those police in the first place. The U.S. ambassador of Kosovo called it an unnecessary crisis. The U.S. has asked the Kosovo prime minister for two things, to withdraw the police from that area and to have the mayors work from other buildings other than those town halls. They think that that could reduce tensions. And so the ambassador said this yesterday. \"No one can be happy when less than 4 percent of your registered voters show up to vote. \"There is a need for those elected officials to proceed very carefully to accept that they do not have a large political mandate to effect change and to focus on the technical or administrative work of administering while we seek to establish conditions for a different political environment, which would result in different political representation.\" The U.S. though has made very clear that the prime minister has not been very responsive if at all to its requests.
