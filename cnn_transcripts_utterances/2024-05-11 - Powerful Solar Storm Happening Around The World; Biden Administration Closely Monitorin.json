The storm is classified as extreme level 5 out of five, a phenomenon that last occurred more than 20 years ago. And it's causing the northern and southern lights to dazzle many places that rarely if ever see them.And have a look, this was the sky above parts of Florida a short time ago. Remarkable sight for the balmy state north of the tropics. Now on the Southern Hemisphere the aurora australis were spotted over New Zealand as well as Argentina. We'll bring you more images from around the world throughout the hour. It all started when the sun erupted with a series of solar flares and what's known as coronal mass ejections, which launched particles directly at the Earth. The lights are expected to reach their peak activity this hour and into the morning until sunrise. The storm will likely continue through the weekend and potentially impact communications, satellites and power grids. CNN's Kristin Fisher explains how this historic phenomenon can bring about possible disruptions and breathtaking views throughout the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's called a coronal mass ejection and those highly charged particles have been barreling toward Earth at 500 miles per second ever since. The first particles began striking Earth's magnetic field Friday afternoon. And forecasters expect it to intensify into the night and perhaps through the weekend.",

And those changes generate currents, which can damage power grids, satellites, anything that has an electrical conductor involved. FISHER (voice-over): The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is describing this storm as an extraordinary and very rare event. One that also has them a little concerned. The biggest threats are to satellites and to global power grids. NOAA says it notified critical infrastructure operators and that mitigation efforts have been taken.

And the storms, the solar storms do not even have to be as severe as the one we are seeing now.The issue though is here normally the kinds of colors that you're seeing in the sky are greenish or a milky green kind of color. Some people report seeing some blue. This time with these spectacular colors, many people across Canada, who do not have cloud cover, will be looking toward the sky and continue to look to the sky because of those spectacular colors that we are not used to seeing. The other thing people are keeping an eye on is whether or not there will be any disruptions through anything technical, whether it's the electrical grid or anything else. In 1989 in the province of Quebec, there was quite a widespread power outage that scientists still study today. But back then, they did not have the satellite technology that they have now. They have reinforced those infrastructure grids. But also they have more sensors, more satellite technology. They know a little bit more about what is going to be happening with these solar storms and have a bit more of a prediction in terms of what will happen.

You have discussions still taking place between the Qataris, the Egyptians and the Americans. But of course, the two sides that need to agree are Hamas and the Israelis. And it appears, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions, that one of the big sticking points is the length of time that this ceasefire would take place. A reminder, Hamas is insisting that it will not agree to anything short of a permanent ceasefire. The Israelis are insisting on quite the opposite, that they need to be able to go in and take out those last Hamas battalions that are hiding out. They say, in Rafah. So Hamas is demanding that the Israelis agree to a 12 week cease-fire. The Israelis are only willing to agree to six because the Israelis think that, if you have a ceasefire that is three months long, it will be very difficult to then afterwards sent troops back into Gaza and resume the military operation. It would effectively mark the end of the military operation. And so that's where we're at right now. And also it's important to remember that there's a lot of pressure on the Israeli prime minister, who has elements of his own far-right government, saying that, look, they'll take down his government if he doesn't get the job done in Rafah.

And it's not a one day event. So even if you have cloud cover tonight, you will still be able to see it tomorrow because there's more than one coronal mass ejection on the way. So what is it? Well, it's just a ball of plasma that's being shot at the Earth. These things happen all the time. But rarely do we have them that go straight at the Earth. Think about how big three dimension today. It could go that way, it could go to the back, it could go to the -- it depends on where the sunspot is. Well, we know this is coming toward the Earth because of what we call the halo effect. When you see the cloud mass kind of come out of this, this is the sun right here. This is the sun being blocked by a disk. But when you see the coronal mass ejections come this way. It's like looking at somebody blowing smoke ring at you, you know what's coming. And you know what's on its way, that's the same idea, same kind of smoke ring that we're seeing. So yes, we have more than one still coming. So overnight, a big one, still landing on the Earth's atmosphere and we are still seeing that really bright colorful cloud all the way around the globe. Typically, the only place you're not seeing it is where it's sunny, where the sun has already come up and you can't see it. But it was very, very spectacular. Somewhere around I would say maybe one Z, one Zulu time, Greenwich Mean Time, somewhere around 9 o'clock, not quite 9 o'clock on the East Coast of the U.S. But it was still light. We couldn't see it in North America. But another one and then another one and another one, this is still going to be going for quite some time. This is what the solar wind looks like. And I want you to think of it like a, you know the seismograph in -- when you look in California and you see the Earth shake? Well, the sun wasn't shaking at all. The solar wind was doing just fine, being nice and flat. But then all of a sudden, around 2:30 or 2:40 this afternoon, the Earth began to shake literally. And so did the solar wind. And it came in very, very quickly. Get this number around your brain, 1.6 million miles per hour. That's how fast this solar wind is coming. Auroras seen farther south with a G5, big number. This is 5 out of 5. This is as big as we get. There are still levels of 5 but G5, we're already up there. Power outages are likely. And also satellite disruptions are also likely. So yes, it's certainly possible. So rare, the red coronas and then the most common are the green. This is what we see all the time across parts of Canada. But the less common are the purples.

Except in space, there's no sound, it would just be -- and these things, if they happen 12 hours apart, hypothetically, you could turn off the electricity in the whole world, which would be catastrophic. You know, none of us really in the developed world could go very long without electricity.

And when that happens, it can cause problems for power grids, for satellites. It -- whenever you wiggle a magnetic field, it induces currents and any kind of electrical conductor. And we as humans have put a lot of electrical conductors in the ground, from power grids to oil pipelines to railroad tracks. And so anything that's electronic or conducting can be affected when one of these CMEs hits. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
