The Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, joins us with his take on this controversy and whether he's open to being drafted for the ticket.Also tonight, CNN's exclusive new poll gauges President Biden standing after the debate, finding his approval rating at a new low while his race with Trump is unchanged. And more breaking news tonight, Donald Trump's sentencing for his criminal conviction and the Hush Money case has been delayed, the legal landscape changing after the Supreme Court's historic immunity ruling. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. While Blitzer is off today, I'm Pamela Brown and you're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news. Team Biden ramping up its defense of the president and his leadership as Democrats anxiety about his debate performance is reaching a new low. CNN's M.J. Lee has more from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the Democratic firewall around President Joe Biden is beginning to fracture, Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett becoming the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election following last week's poor debate performance. The congressman saying in a statement, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself. I'm hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. Today, the White House facing a barrage of questions about the president's debate performance. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was a bad night. He was not taking any cold medication. That is what I can speak to. I've asked his doctor, and that's what he stated to us.",

Let me ask you, do you accept this explanation from the White House just today that the president had a cold and it was just a bad night for him during the debate? GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Well, first the president has been very good to both me and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He provided the largest infrastructure grant in our history, which is helping us build the Brent Spence Companion Bridge, something multiple presidents have promised but only he's delivering. The bead money is going to help us to connect every home and every business to high speed internet. And we've used about a half a billion dollars in ARPA money to bring clean drinking water to places that have never had it. I think we've all, though, got to be upfront and honest that what we saw in the debate, it was rough. It's a rough night and regardless of polls that you see it, it's going to hurt the campaign. But 34 felony convictions certainly hurt former President Trump's campaign.

It would take a lot in terms of the way the rules work, in terms of the delegates, the pledged delegates, the super delegates, the unpledged delegates.

Remember, Trump's team is using yesterday's Supreme Court opinion to attack that conviction specifically focusing on pieces of evidence that were introduced at trial.

He is about to become the very first judge ever to apply this whole brand new doctrine around presidential immunity, which is all of one day old as we sit here right now.Here's how things are going to play out over the next couple of weeks. Next week, Donald Trump's team will submit their brief on July 10th. They're going to argue that some of the evidence introduced against Donald Trump at the hush money trial related to conversations and actions Donald Trump took while he was president, therefore, he's immune for that, therefore, that evidence was improper. The D.A. will then respond two weeks later on the 24th. I think they will argue that those actions were not official actions. They were personal actions. They were political actions. Judge Merchan has said he will decide the case by September 6th. And then if Judge Merchan does not throw the conviction out, he will impose sentence on September 18th. All things being equal, I think Judge Merchan is unlikely to grant Donald Trump this relief, but it is possible, and if Judge Merchan denies Trump's motion, this will absolutely become an issue that Trump will continue to raise on appeal, which potentially could end up back at the U.S. Supreme Court.",

And so I don't think that the idea that, well, you can't introduce anything that a president ever does while they're president, I think that goes a little bit far.So, I think that just Merchan is doing the right thing of at least having a hearing.

I think that, that he was very lucky this week.And nobody's talking about his performance at the debate, you know, there were lots of untruths told by Donald Trump at that debate, but that is not the focus. The focus is on Joe Biden. Remember, this campaign, according to the Biden playbook, was supposed to be about Donald Trump and disqualifying Donald Trump. And now it's been turned on its head.

Lee has all the details. M.J., what are you hearing? LEE: Yes, Pam. The president just spoke at a fundraiser in McLean, Virginia, and he really took ownership for the bad debate performance that we saw last week offering some explanations for the first time as to why he believed he performed so badly. And Pam, I should note, these are from pool reports and pool reporters who are in the room. So, we should just caveat that these should be taken as paraphrases from the reporters in the room. But the president apparently in this setting apologized to the group for the poor performance last week. He said, this is not an excuse, but it is an explanation. And he largely blamed the extensive travel that he did, the foreign travel that he did right before the debate. He apparently said that that was not a smart decision on his part. I'll just remind everyone that he traveled to France for the D-Day anniversary. And then he went to Italy right after for the G7 summit. And he apparently said in the room, I didn't listen to my staff. And at one point, interestingly, he said, I almost fell asleep on stage. I don't know how comforting that is going to be for any donors or Democrats that have been looking for anything reassuring from the president himself. He apparently also discussed the stakes of the election, saying that it is so critical that Democrats win this election, and that he felt good about the fundraising numbers that we have seen for Democrats and for his campaign since Thursday night. He also, at one point, talked about the economic recovery, but this was all but just six minutes that he spoke at this fundraiser, so not very long remarks. But, again, just very interesting that we are getting some of these explanations from the president himself for the first time on why he performed so badly. Obviously, that's been a little bit evolving starting with the campaign saying on Thursday night that he was suffering from a cold. But, again, the news here is that the president says he is blaming the foreign travel that he did right before the debate for why he performed so badly. Pam?",

But, you know, the president does do a lot of travel. I mean, he was traveling, crisscrossing the entire world, then going right to Camp David, obviously, prior to the debate, so I would want to hear more or about what he said. But what I can say having been in the room with him multiple times is he was fine those times. And I think the really important thing we have to look at in terms of the election ahead of us is what future do we want? I mean, do we want someone like Donald Trump running the country who incited an insurrection, or somebody who objectively speaking has had one of the greatest presidencies we've seen in a long time. And so, I think it's important that we focus on a lot of the dangers coming in, in November, and I'm very worried about someone like Donald Trump being president of the United States.",
