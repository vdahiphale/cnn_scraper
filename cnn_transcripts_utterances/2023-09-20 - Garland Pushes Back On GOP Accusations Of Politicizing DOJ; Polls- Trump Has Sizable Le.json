      "sentences": "Merrick Garland pushing back on GOP accusations of politicizing the DOJ, insisting he is not the president's lawyer nor Congress's prosecutor. So, was all this a preview of what's to come next week when House Republicans are going to launch their impeachment inquiry of President Biden?Plus, two Colorado cops going on trial today in the death of this young man, 23-year-old Elijah McClain, who was just walking home from a convenient store with iced tea when he was confronted by police. Three days later, he was dead. Tonight, I'll talk to a mother who lost her son at the hands of police, RowVaughn Wells, the mother of Tyre Nichols. And with all of these, all of the crucial issues we face as a nation, what is the Senate battling over? A dress code. Is a suit and tie a requirement to govern the United States of America? I've got some thoughts about all of that, and I'm going to share them with you tonight. We've got a lot going on tonight from Cassidy Hutchinson's accusation against Rudy Giuliani to Giuliani itself to Merrick Garland's pushback against GOP attacks on the DOJ. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We apply the same laws to everyone. There is not one set of laws for the powerful and another for the powerless, one for the rich and another for the poor, one for Democrats and another for Republicans. Our job is not to do what is politically convenient. Our job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress, or from anyone else about who or what to criminally investigate. I am not the president's lawyer. I will add, I am not Congress's prosecutor. (END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: I want to bring in Jay Michaelson. He clerked for Merrick Garland in his second year on the D.C. Circuit bench back in 1998. Also, Mimi Rocha, Westchester County district attorney and former AUSA in the Southern District of New York as well. I'm glad to have both of you here. We were all watching what took place on the Hill. I can't say that I'm surprised that he had a bit of a hostile crowd, as you well know. He likely anticipated it when he stepped on Capitol Hill today. He was defiant though, right? He was talking about not being the president's lawyer, not being Congress's lawyer. It's difficult, though, because he is facing criticism after criticism after criticism, weaponization, let alone the pace of his prosecutions. What was your take on his approach today to really be defiant in the way he addressed Congress?",

He is, like, to the core. And so, I think it backfires to try and make Merrick Garland, of all people, looked political. It just fails.He is an apolitical person who will defend the core mission of the Department of Justice and the career prosecutors. That's who he's defending. He's not talking about political appointees like U.S. attorneys. He's saying, sure, go ask David Weiss, the special prosecutor, Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, go ask him anything you want, but my career prosecutors and the agents, leave them out of this, they are just doing their job. And I -- he is so sincere in that, that I think trying to paint him as political really fails. And the one other thing I wanted to point out is, you know, they kept saying, well, DOJ has this really low approval rating. You know, that's your fault. No, that was the goal of Donald Trump starting back in 2016 or even before that. His goal has been, and these people are helping him carry it out, to degrade the reputation and the dignity and the legitimacy of the Department of Justice. They have tried to do that, and they've been somewhat successful.",

So, there was no choice that I think he could have made that would have been safe, right?Had he not appointed David Weiss in this case, they would say, why did you throw out Republican, you know, Donald Trump-appointed David Weiss to bring in this other person? You know, instead he went this way, and so they're attacking him this way. There is -- and I think you could tell, you know, in the way that Attorney General Garland conducted himself that he knew what was going on, that this was a political show, in a sense.

While we've been looking at those issues, there were some bombshell revelations today. There's an upcoming, a forthcoming book from Cassidy Hutchinson. She's accusing Rudy Giuliani of groping her.I want to just read a section for a moment of what she had to say. She said, the corners of his mouth split into a Cheshire cat smile. Waving a sort of stack of documents, he moves towards me, like a wolf closing in on its prey. \"We have the evidence. It's all here. We're going to pull this off.\" Rudy wraps one arm around my body, closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach from the hem of my blazer. \"By the way,\" he says, fingering the fabric, \"I'm loving this leather jacket on you.\" His hands slip under my blazer, then my skirt. Of course, she was 24 years old at the time that she says this happened. The power dynamic obvious. The accusations repulsive. What's your thought?",

She didn't even have the freedom to tell the truth before the committee until she got a new lawyer, so let alone come out with something like this.And look, he can deny them and, you know, my guess is those might end up being litigated somewhere, maybe just in the public arena, maybe in court, but the fact is that men who abuse power in one way usually abuse it in more than one way, and Giuliani has shown himself to be, um, very good at abusing his law license and abusing his power.

Since January 6th and beyond, let alone the administration of Trump and Pence and beyond, you don't hear the same criticism as to the why now? Why are you coming about this now? There is a level of credibility assigned and undermined in other directions. Both of you, thank you for joining me tonight. Really important to hear your insight on all this. I want to bring in Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and CNN senior law enforcement analyst. Andrew, I'm so glad to see you, although you're distant from me today. I usually have you by my side. But nice to see you from a distance for a moment. Listen, you know, you're used to being quite tight-lipped about investigations by necessity, obviously, from the FBI. You know, Attorney General Merrick Garland was trying to speak on many of these investigations, but he obviously did not -- was not forthcoming on everything, either by the fact that he'd already delegated it and wanted it to be known that he was not in control of a variety of different investigations under special counsel or perhaps he knew the power of a stray comment. From your experience from the FBI in leading investigations, help us understand what the gravitas is of the attorney general or any government attorney speaking about active investigations.",

So, I can tell you from my experience and having the -- or unfortunate experience of having had to testify in front of this committee and many others during my time in the FBI, these are moments that leaders in the Justice Department and in the FBI absolutely dread because you have essentially no margin for error.By definition, the work that you're doing is sensitive, it's criminal investigations that we do not discuss publicly, we don't discuss with Congress while those investigations are ongoing. So, you know, walking in the door, you don't have any satisfying answers that you can give these members. So, literally the bar for winning in this situation is survival. You just want to endure the beating and be able to get up on your own, under your own power, and leave at the end of it still having your job and able to get back to your office. So, you know, on that very low standard, I think the attorney general did a phenomenal job today. He had very little that he could share. He held the line in a consistent and reasonable way. I thought the Republicans really revealed themselves to be kind of a one-note chorus. You know, they all spent the entire day asking essentially the same three questions, and they all got the same answer, which was, I'm sure, wildly unsatisfying for them.",

We often look at Donald Trump and question whether he should be interviewed by various outlets and what his attorneys must be thinking and how they let him go in front of the cameras, let alone in front of somebody.We don't give as much thought to what's happening when prosecutors do so, when they are then in a position to possibly tar and feather people in the public square, and then be told that they have to and they ought to abide by due process rules. They can't get both done. But it's interesting when you think about this dynamic here. When you look at this from the perspective of what could go wrong, how does it undermine what the FBI or investigators could do if someone were to publicize or make a lot of comments about the investigations?",

When I was prosecuting, on the bottom of our indictments was signed the U.S. attorney, the attorney general in many of his instances, they did not have a direct impact on the day-to-day prosecutions or the day-to-day investigation.

The vast majority of them say, you know, I'm solid, I'm certain in my support for Donald Trump and the Granite State.If you look at the supporters of all the other candidates, what you see is very few of them are locked in at this particular point. And that is why I think this race is wide open, at least to the extent of who might be the alternative to Trump. We saw in this poll Ramaswamy going up. We saw in this poll Haley going up. We saw in this poll Christie going up versus the last UNH poll that we had.

He has failed to convert as a candidate who can be anything resembling a happy warrior.As Harry just mentioned, though, the fact that, you know, Haley, Ramaswamy, and Christie have doubled their numbers in New Hampshire, interesting, indicates fluidity. Also, Donald Trump's water level in New Hampshire is lower than you'd expect. There's 60% of voters in New Hampshire that are looking for an alternative. That's interesting.

You have to imagine there were people that liked DeSantis a few months ago that have switch ships to Haley, and that's a good sign for her.Another thing that came out of this poll was that the major rift in the Republican Party right now, policy-wise, is Ukraine. The people that like Vivek and Trump, they want to end funding for the war in Ukraine. The people that like Christie, to an extent, DeSantis and Nikki Haley, they are on the other side of that issue.

Why is that? Because if you look back at the polls back then, George W. Bush held a very similar lead to the one that Donald Trump now holds. He was, at the time, George W. Bush, I believe, was at 45%, in second place was Liddy Dole at 15%, and a guy by the name of John McCain, a pretty hawkish guy, you know, we're talking about foreign policy here, was at 12%. Guess what happened in the upcoming four months when the voting actually took place? John McCain came all the way back from 12% and won that primary with 49% of the vote, crushing George W. Bush, who came in at just 30%. So, as we're talking here, this is not just something in the hypothetical, theoretical that this race isn't over. We have seen in New Hampshire where a lot of New Hampshire Republicans and those independents who have owned that state might say, you know what, hold on a second, we want to take another look at these candidates and we don't want this primary just to be a runaway for the leading candidate.",

Why would any city object to having a police force?We have police force in Houston that understands those elements.

Nearly every GOP senator signing a letter today urging Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to continue enforcing the chamber's more formal unwritten dress code. That after he asked the Senate's sergeant-in-arms to relax the dress code, a move seen as a nod to Senator John Fetterman's preference for wearing shorts and a hoodie.Here to discuss, Rachel Janfaza. She's a journalist covering youth political culture and is the founder of \"The Up and Up.\" Also, here, Deirdre Clemente. She's a fashion and culture historian at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Glad to see you both. Let me begin with you, Deirdre, here because look, many Republican senators are against this decision. They argue that the dress code, if it's relaxed, disrespects the institution they serve. Doesn't actually make an impact. Is it disrespectful or are we talking about a sign of the times?",
