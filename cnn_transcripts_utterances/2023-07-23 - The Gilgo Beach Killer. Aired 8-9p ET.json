      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.In December of 2010 four bodies were found along a quarter-mile stretch of Gilgo Beach on the South Shore of Long Island, New York. All four victims were young women in their 20s who'd advertised sex work on Craigslist. Their bodies were found within a quarter-mile stretch of beach. They were all bound at the feet or ankles and covered with burlap to hide them. It was a shocking discovery, and it was just the beginning. Over the next year seven more sets of human remains were found in the area, most of them women. So was this the work of a serial killer? That's the question investigators have been asking for more than a decade with no answers until 2022, when recent DNA technology gave police a new lead. They now have a suspect, someone they say was living a double life as a husband and a father. Police feared he was targeting even more victims. Over the next hour CNN's Brynn Gingras will piece together how exactly police were able to I.D. the suspect and how the possible killer was able to get away with it for so long. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
