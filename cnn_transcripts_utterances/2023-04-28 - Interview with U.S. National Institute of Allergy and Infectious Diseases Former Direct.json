I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Three years after the strange new killer disease swept the globe, the world is now moving on from COVID and all that pain and loss. President Biden confirming America's state of public health emergency will end on May 11th. While the U.K. has shut down its COVID app that was required to prove vaccination status to enter certain public spaces. The toll is staggering to contemplate. Official estimates say the virus killed more than a million people here in the U.S., and about 7 million worldwide. But my first guest tonight says that is an underestimate. The real death toll could be 20 million, and it would probably have been double that without the vaccine. Dr. Anthony Fauci was undoubtedly the face of the COVID response as chief medical adviser to the president. We met up here, in New York, as he received the prestigious Calderon Prize from Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You have, you know, a phalanx of guards 24/7, or, you know, keeping you safe. What does that say to public health officials, and to yourself, about waging this war in the future or this struggle for life? DR. FAUCI:  Well, to me, it tells us we have to do it and we cannot be dissuaded from doing it because of the threats. You know, I am a visible public figure, but many of my less well-known colleagues who speak out the truth about things almost instantaneous, from the time they do that, I don't know whether it's bots or real people start just making harassing threats to them. We can't yield in the face of that, because it's such an important issue and that's one of the reasons why I will continue to try and inspire and encouraged, particularly younger people, to get involved in medicine and science and public health, and perhaps even public service, which I think that so important.",

What keeps you up at night about how, given the experience of what happened during theCOVID pandemic, nationally and globally, the next pandemic will be addressed? DR. FAUCI:  That's what I worry about. If we go into the next pandemic in a discombobulated way, where no one knows what the truth is or who is saying what, it's going to be even worse than what we've seen right now. Because, you know, I tend to look at this in two buckets of preparedness and response. One is the scientific preparedness and response and the other is the public health preparedness and response. What was a resounding success was the science, I mean, to be able to have the sustained investment in basic and clinical biomedical research that allowed us, literally, within days of getting the sequence of the virus to begin the vaccine development program to be in a phase one trial in 65 days. At the end of 11 months, to have a vaccine that was safe and effective, that is beyond unprecedented. I mean, if you had -- if we were having this conversation 10 years ago, I would've told you that's nuts. There's no chance that that's going to happen. That was the result of a sustained investment in basic and clinical biomedical research. Where what did not go as well was the public health, the infrastructure, the communications, the ability to get data in real- time as opposed to waiting in weeks and months to make the data that would inform decisions you'd have to make, that has to improve.",

And I didn't mean it as an affront to him, but I said, you know, this is really big time Monday morning quarterbacking here, which is what it is. So, rather than have a blame game, and that's one of the things that we have to stay away from because there were things that happened and it was a moving target and there were things that you did not know at the time and you had to, out of necessity, make a decision. And sometimes the decision was partially right. For example, let me give you an example of a partially right decision. I think the idea, when you having trucks, that were cooler trucks, pulling up to hospitals in order to put bodies in because the morgues were overflowing and the hospital beds were being challenged that you had a triage, you had to shut down. I don't think anybody who has any realistic evaluation knows that you've got to do something dramatic. Once that's done, then the thing that you need to now go back and analyze, I don't think anyone would argue with the fact that you had to shut down, is how long you keep the shut down and how complete it is, how does that relate to schools when you shut down schools, if you do. And I have been very vocal about this and I think that people who like to point fingers, I say, go look and look at the tape. You know, the tale of the tape, when I kept on saying over and over again, we've got to get the children back to school as quickly as possible. We've got to get them in school safely and we've got to make sure that they are not essentially out of school, at home, getting it over the negative consequences. Different parts of the country interpreted that differently. There were schools that stayed closed far too long and longer than they should have and there were those that essentially didn't close at all. You know, my daughter is a school teacher in New Orleans, they closed out for two weeks, and we're essentially open for the rest of the time and other schools --",

And when you don't know definitively, you've got to keep an open mind to all possibilities. If we do get a definitive determination, I will certainly embrace that fully. Right now, because we don't know what it is, instead of pointing fingers and blaming, we should be saying, it's either one or the other. That being the case, let's right now, start doing things to mitigate against the possibility that this would happen again versus that would happen again. And the two possibilities, as you know, lab leak versus natural occurrence. Having said that with an open mind, as a scientist, I have to look at the data and say, although either is possible, that doesn't necessarily mean they are equally probable. And if you look at the data that has been accumulating over the last year or several months, even most recently, it's pointing much more strongly towards a natural occurrence. But it hasn't been definitively shown. So, as long as that still remains the situation, you must entertain the possibility of both, and that is exactly where I stand.",

But you got lots of lovely commentary from the community, which I've been sent. Here's one. I stayed up all night with my parents having the most sobering conversation about their arranged marriage and their life back in the '90s in Pakistan.

The real sides that are never shown in any other movie are seen in this. Watching this movie was a real evaluation of family bonds and relationships. Were you worried? Were you at all fearful? Was the company fearful that somehow this would miss the mark?",

And that's been used to study cardiac problems, pancreatic problems, all kinds of things. But one kind of cell that they might make is an egg cell or a sperm cell that might help people with fertility issues. So, I focused on two companies. One is trying to make an egg cell from a stem cell and the other one is trying to create, basically, the ovarian egg environment in which an egg cell matures. So that an immature egg cell could be taken from the human body and then, put in this environment with - - which would -- kind of make the process of IVF but hopefully, be a little less invasive and time consuming.",

Especially, egg cells in particular are kind of scarce and they can be difficult to mature and grow and extract from the human body. So, that's one -- you know, just couples suffering from traditional fertility issues. But one area that I was especially interested is in female reproductive longevity. As we all know, women have a shorter reproductive lifespan than men do. They are bored with all the eggs they ever half and usually, by the time they are in their early to mid-40s, those eggs are no longer viable for reproduction. And, you know, we live in a time where we are living longer, we start relationships later, and that's caused a lot of -- that's a big burden for a lot of women to try to fit, you know, their career, their relationships, their childbearing, all, you know, before the end of their 30s. So, I think there's a real desire to prolong that timeline a little bit, which can have really massive repercussions. And then, the third demographic that this might affect, our same sex couples that would like to have a genetic child. So, Conception, the company that's working on making the human egg cell was -- two of its cofounders are gay men. And using that technology, it's possible that a sell taken from a male donor, using this technology, could be turned into an egg cell with two X chromosomes. So, that's part of the promise too.",

Nobody really -- one thing I learned in this article that was really interesting to me is that humans are pretty unique among mammals in that their ovaries age basically more than twice as fast as the other organs in the body. Including chimpanzees, our closest relatives, they can reproduce almost to the end of their lives. So, there's just -- it's just this kind of black box that science doesn't quite understand, and the argument is that, yes, if you could better understand that process, there might be a less kind of high intervention way of treating infertility, or at least prolonging reproductive longevity.",
