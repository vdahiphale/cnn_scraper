Prosecutors walking him through the early days of his relationship with Donald Trump and the Trump Organization, including how Trump first offered him a job. And just a reminder, there is so much focus on Michael Cohen here because he is seen as the key witness for the prosecution. The prosecution, of course, alleges that Donald Trump ordered Cohen to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000 in the days ahead of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter they had had. And then they also alleged that they falsified business records to cover up that payment. That transaction eventually drove a wedge between the two men. Cohen ended up going to jail, federal prison for breaking campaign finance laws. He has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. Trump for his part has denied any wrongdoing. We're going to be closely monitoring Michael Cohen's testimony here in addition to Donald Trump's reaction. He is, of course is there in the courtroom.

People are fleeing Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, against the background of Israeli gunfire and explosions. Israel says it is trying to prevent Hamas from regrouping there. Meantime, CNN reaching out to the IDF for a response after a director of ambulance services said that vehicles in the area were being targeted. Well, in the south, a U.N. agency for Palestinian refugee says more than 360,000 people have now fled the city of Rafah. That border city wants a designated safe zone after Israel ordered evacuations of several more neighborhoods. CNNs Jeremy Diamond has been following all of this on the ground for months now.

Because it's not just about the number of civilians who are currently living inRafah, some 1.4 million people before the start of this Israeli military offensive that has sparked these concerns from the United States and other countries. It's about the feasibility of not only evacuating that large number of people, but where they would then go. And when you think about the fact that the Israeli military has been operating in every other part of the Gaza Strip, except for Rafah in terms of ground forces, that means that the rest of the Gaza Strip in many areas, you have the majority of buildings that have been absolutely destroyed or partially demolished by Israeli military activity. And so, where they're being directed to now by the Israeli military is what's being called this expanded humanitarian zone of Al-Mawasi. That includes not only the coastal sandy area of Al-Mawasi, which is just north of Rafah, but also west -- the western part of Khan Younis, which, again, suffered enormous destruction during the Israeli military offensive in Khan Younis a couple of months ago, as well as some parts of central Gaza. And what these hundreds of thousands of people who have fled Rafah and are now heading to that area have found, is insufficient infrastructure. This area, largely, does not have working sewage, and many parts of it do not have running water lines. And there is also a difficulty for a lot of these humanitarian aid organizations to get the amount of aid needed to sustain so many people to that area. And also, keep in mind the fact that 400,000 people were already living in this Al-Mawasi area. So, you're facing enormous challenges on so many different levels, add to that the fact that the Rafah border crossing has remained closed over the course of the last week. And in terms of your last question, Becky, when we will see Israeli military activities expand, we are watching them do it bit by bit. And so, it doesn't seem clear that there will be one day where we see, you know, this enormous sweep of troops into central Rafah, instead, it seems that they are kind of portioning it off, evacuating segments of the population, and then, moving their troops into the specified areas overtime.",

You saw the President just last week go public with his threats that the U.S. could withhold further weapons shipments to Israel if they move forward with that full on ground invasion into Rafah. Now, one thing that administration officials over the weekend were trying to stress was that Israel needs to come up with a plan to ensure the safety and evacuation of civilians, the more than 1.4 million people who have been in Rafah. We have seen that about 360,000 were evacuated within the last week. But the administration is also pushing Israel to develop some type of plan for what happens in Gaza after this war ends. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned of what the repercussions could be without a plan in place if Israel moves forward with a major ground invasion into Rafah.

He is painting this picture of what a close working relationship they had. Jessica Schneider, joining us now, as we look at all of this part of that relationship.

That they had such this symbiotic relationship that, at one point, Michael Cohen decided to link or sync, I should say, his phone to Donald Trump's phone. So, they had all the same contacts. So, if someone was calling Michael Cohen would know exactly who was calling how he might be able to help the situation. Because as Michael Cohen has acknowledged, already, in his testimony this morning, it is fair to call him the fixer. He didn't -- he doesn't really like that term, as he said, but he has acknowledged in court that he really was Donald Trump's right- hand man who would fix any problem that came about. In fact, earlier in the testimony, he talked about how at one point there were about 20 subcontractors who had submitted bills to Donald Trump. Michael Cohen called them all up and said, look, you're going to take a fraction of what we owe you. And all but two of them said, OK, and that was just how Donald Trump did business. He was always trying to maneuver to get out of payment or full payment, and Michael Cohen was the man who did his bidding. Interestingly, Erica, Michael Cohen has also talked about the fact that Donald Trump was very much a micromanager. He was asked point blank by one of the prosecutors, was Donald Trump a micromanager, Michael Cohen said yes. So, that is how the prosecution is going to build on Michael Cohen's testimony to prove -- the prosecution will try to prove that Donald Trump knew exactly what was happening with this hush money scheme, Donald Trump knew exactly how it was going to be orchestrated, how it was going to be hidden. And that is the key to their case. So, Michael Cohen already starting to lay that groundwork. Now, it's just a matter of how this jury believes Michael Cohen. Again, the defense team is really going to try to cast all the shade they can at Michael Cohen, he is a convicted liar. He pled guilty to lying to Congress. So, that is something that defense team is going to seize on. But for now, Michael Cohen acting very relaxed on the stand according to our team inside the courtroom. And coming across very cool and collected and calm, Erica. So, we'll see as things get as the testimony gets heated up a bit. But for now, Michael Cohen is quite cool and calm.",

Now, look, we know that the second city of Kharkiv has been a target for Russia in recent months relentless aerial bombardment. It seems that if you talk to analysts that what's happening right now is not so much about trying to take over that second city, which Russia has never managed to occupy over the course of this war. It's more about drawing forces away from the eastern front where they've been making their biggest push and trying to create a buffer zone to prevent Ukraine from shelling the Russian border region of Belgorod. Now, all of this is happening, as well, Becky, as a shake up in the Russian government is taking place. Putin announcing a reshuffle and removing his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, who had not only been in that position since 2012, but had been a government minister since 1991.

That is why it's natural that on the current stage, the president to take a decision for civilian to be in charge of the ministry of defense. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The nominated civilian is Andrey Belousov, a career economist and former First Deputy Prime Minister.
