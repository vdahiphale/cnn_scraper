That is his first campaign events since last night's CNN debate against President Joe Biden. Trump directly addressing that face off at the very beginning of his remarks, attacking Biden and calling this an election between strength and weakness. I want to go straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is there. What have you noticed? We've heard from campaign advisors throughout the course of the day, obviously pretty happy with what happened last night. What sticks out to you just from the top of that speech?",

He made it again last night. He said Biden is behind all of his legal cases, that Biden is weaponizing DOJ, law enforcement, to try to win an election.No evidence for any of this. Two of the four prosecutions against Trump were brought by local district attorneys who don't even report to the federal government. The other two brought by, of course, a federal special counsel, no evidence Biden has had any contact with a special counsel, any personal role in bringing or running those cases. All four indictments were approved by grand juries of ordinary citizens. So this is something we hear pretty much every rally, pretty much every event from Donald Trump.

One, I'm not sure that that's necessarily should be viewed as a pejorative, but Chuck Schumer is not Palestinian. He is in New Yorker. He is one of the strongest supporters of Israel and the Democratic Caucus to the point where many pro-Palestinian members, or advocates have often run up against him. So why Trump went that way, I don't think that was in the script. President Biden, also on the campaign trail today. We're going to hear from him just this our again, in New York City.

They, -- I'm also not hearing from them saying it's time to turn the page they are asking themselves, what do we do now to ensure we preserve democracy. People are still very clear what the choices.

But it's unlikely that's going to be successful, of course. The obstruction charges that were covered in today's Supreme Court decision, those are related to people who were at a Capitol Hill on January 6, people who engaged in conduct in and around the riot, where Trump's obstruction charges are related in part to his efforts to install a slate of fake electors. It's different conduct. And while this opinion did not mention Trump or fake electors, specifically, Chief Justice John Roberts, he actually nodded to the possibility that this obstruction law could actually be violated by quote, creating false evidence. That's part of why we don't expect that this will be successful for Trump in court doesn't mean they're not going to try. And, of course, politically, he is painting this as a big win on Truth Social, which is fair, right? In the court of public opinion, he's trying to undermine the credibility of the justice system here, highlighting what the Supreme Court has suggested is prosecutorial overreach. And the best-case scenario for Trump, I'm told, is that possibly this opinion could help them exclude certain evidence if his January 6 case goes to trial and fill, that is still a big if and on Monday, we'll get an answer to the biggest question, legally for the former president, and that is if he has any immunity that can protect him from some or all of Jack Smith's federal January 6 case.
