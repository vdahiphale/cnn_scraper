      "sentences": "Today, we're learning new details about the man who carried out the terrorist attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day. The FBI says Shamsud-Din Jabbar wore Meta smart glasses, as you can see in this video right here, in two visits to the city in the weeks leading up to the attacks. He wore them to record videos. He rode a bicycle through the French Quarter and to help plan his truck ramming attack that killed 14 people.Investigators say before the attack, Jabbar said fire to his short- term rental house and he placed improvised explosive devices or IEDs on Bourbon Street. Investigators are also looking into Jabbar's trips to Egypt and Canada. Today, President Biden will travel to New Orleans to attend a vigil for the victims. Let's discuss this now. Joining me is FBI -- former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente. Tim, what'd you think of those glasses that this terrorist was wearing? I mean, that adds a whole new wrinkle to all of us.",

      "sentences": "It does, Jim. I mean, it's part of his pre-attack surveillance where he was involved in the planning stage. And what's great about those glasses is if he walked around holding his phone up and using video camera of it or any other video device, it would be at least a little bit noticed. It wouldn't be unusual, but it would be a little bit noticed by people on the street there.But the glasses allow him to take everything in, absorb all that data, review it later when he's alone, not have to worry about any POV. Because there's people in places that may not want to be on film and you turn your camera towards them, it might get people upset. But when you just look towards them with the glasses on, it allows you complete anonymity. And I think that's what he was looking for, data collection and anonymity.",

      "sentences": "I agree. It is unusual and it probably could be an indicator that maybe he was meeting with someone and that he was trying to gain their approval or maybe they endorsed what he was planning to do. I don't believe he was directly connected to ISIS. So, I'm not sure that we'll find there were any meetings with ISIS leaders or anything like that, but there may have been a radical person he was dealing with online that he met with, or something along those lines that encourage the behavior, if not the specific act.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's exactly what it sounds like, Jim, and it's tragic and sad, but it's inexcusable. The problem is that how many days prior was there a vehicle attack at a Christmas market over in Europe? And so, it's not like this is something that was out of the ordinary. This has been a tool for many years now. I mean, Nice, France was the biggest such attack. But it's happened. It happened to Chelsea in New York. So, it's not unexpected and it's something that should have been prepared for.Unfortunately, a vehicle blocking partially the end of the road on Bourbon Street was ineffective, and it left the sidewalks and the sides of the street completely open. As you said, the technology exists, it should have been used, and those questions will hopefully be answered not necessarily before the rest of the investigation is done into the killings itself, but those questions do need to be answered and remedied in all future large events anywhere in the United States.",

I was going to say, Tim, if you are the mayor or the city council in a city that has a high traffic tourist area, it seems to me you would be looking at this right now, that it would be -- it would basically be inexcusable for a city official in any major city that has a tourist area like this to leave these kinds of areas accessible to somebody in a big pickup truck or something like that. I mean, that has -- that conversation has to happen now, I would think.",

It's not ridiculously expensive as the video is showing right now, those temporary barriers can be used in lieu of something permanent, but there should be something permanent.

When you see something say something. And when somebody rolls a cooler down the street and leaves it and walks away, it's no different than in an airport when somebody leaves a piece of luggage standing alone, it should be reported.Anytime you see something suspicious like that, you should tell someone. It doesn't mean you have to confront the individual doing it, but you need to do something about it. And it could be totally innocuous. It could be that this guy was going inside to grab a six pack of beer and put it in that cooler and walk down Bourbon Street with that, or it could be that it's an IED.

This suit does also name Fox Sports and its parent company, Fox Corporation.There are some damning charges in this suit. However, Bayless and Fox have not yet responded. So, this may take a while to play out. But you see on screen there, some of the charges against him, probably most shockingly, the idea that he was offered -- he offered $1.5 million to have sex with this woman. Those allegations are made in this filing that was filed on Friday. And as I said, Bayless has not yet commented. Jim.",

She made an image here of the post owner, Jeff Bezos, the bald head there on the left, as well as others like Mickey Mouse representing Disney showing media and tech moguls bowing at the knee to President-Elect Donald Trump.This is the cartoon that Ann has given us permission to show. She says that it was nixed by her boss, David Shipley. She believes this was editorial interference at the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos. Bezos, of course, one of the tech moguls that's tried to cozy up to Trump in recent weeks. David Shipley says he was just concerned this was repetitive. He says a recent column have been published about the same topic. But I've seen many cases where cartoons and column columnists have repeated each other. Clearly, the column -- the cartoonist here believes this was a form of censorship by her bosses and she quit The Post as a result. There's been a real drain on talent at the post recently, Jim, as others have left, some of them expressing concern about the leadership of The Post. You know, for a decade, Bezos was seen as an exemplar owner of The Post. This billionaire who was willing to fund The Post, even when it was losing money. But in recent weeks, there have been concerns, but whether he's going to have The Post back in a Trump 2.0. You know, we've seen all this coverage recently, Jim, about moguls, media moguls, really tech moguls bending a knee for Trump. If some are bending the knee, others have to stand up straighter than ever because ultimately, it's about what the audience needs. You know, maybe these tech moguls think that shareholders need to see a relationship with Trump and that's best for shareholders. But when it comes to covering the news, it's about what's best for the readers and viewers. And so, we're seeing a lot of internal angst of The Washington Post about this right now.",

And my goodness, an editorial cartoon, a political cartoon, I mean, that's like the most harmless thing in the world. It's there to provoke.
