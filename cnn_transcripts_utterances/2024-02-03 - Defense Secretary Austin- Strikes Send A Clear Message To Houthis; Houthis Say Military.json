      "sentences": "So first, in terms of how they were carried out, we can talk about some of the platforms that were used here. US Navy FA-18 fighter jets took part in this launch from the Dwight D. Eisenhower, a carrier that has been operating in the region. We have seen F-18s teams from the Ike, not only take part in these sorts of strikes before, but also have played a big role in going after Houthi weaponry in smaller strikes, and shooting down many of the drones and missiles that had been launched.We also saw two Destroyers take part in this, the Carney and the Gravely, they have been in the region for quite some time. And similarly, have also taken part in these sorts of strikes before, as well as intercepting a lot of the Houthi launchers that have targeted international shipping and that's the core of why the US and the UK have done this, as well as the other countries that have backed this because these Houthi attacks have continued and from everything we're seeing, will continue. But as the US in the UK that have gone after trying to degrade a lot of -- and disrupt a lot of the Houthis' capabilities to go after this. In terms of what was attacked, the US went after 13 different locations, a total of 36 targets across those locations. According to a joint statement, those targets included a deeply buried weapons storage facility, missile systems and launchers, air defense systems, and radars. A short time ago, US Central Command also put out a statement saying they also targeted helicopters. That's an interesting one, first time we've seen the US go after helicopters. It's worth noting that in the video the Houthis released of the ship that they hijacked at the beginning of their attack on commercial vessels, there was a helicopter that played a key role in getting Houthi forces onto that ship, so perhaps a message there as well. The bottom line, this is the third time we have seen the US and the UK carry out this joint operation backed by a number of other countries, in this case, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand as well and Bahrain, backing this up trying to send a message not only to the Houthis, but also because the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group sending a message to Iran as well, that this isn't just an attack on the US and the UK, it is an attack on one of the world's most critical waterways in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying this loud and clear, if these attacks on international shipping don't stop on the US warships, I should point out, then these strikes on Houthi targets won't stop either -- Alex.",

And this is just in to CNN, the Houthis are now responding to the US- led coalition strikes earlier today on those targets in Yemen. CNN's international diplomatic editor joins us from Tel Aviv.

      "sentences": "And perhaps not unexpectedly, saying that they're going to meet escalation with escalation, remembering that the Houthis fought an eight-year war with Saudi Arabia, they believe they're in a fight with the United States right now, and they have, they believe the experience of withstanding year after year after year of aerial bombardment.Now given Saudi Arabia doesn't have quite the firepower, the number of munitions, a large coalition to bring to bear on the Houthis, the Houthis also know at the time, when the Saudis were fighting them from the air, they were getting intelligence, and they were getting air refuel capability from the United States. So the Houthis already feel they've got some experience fighting the United States, and they feel at the moment that they can still punch back. They will find clearly that the level of strikes and the capacity of strikes, and the frequency of strikes that the United States and its coalition partners can mount will be bigger, and are bigger than what the Saudis were able to do. But this doesn't alter the mindset of the Houthis, and that very much at the moment is escalation for escalation. They continue to say that they're doing this to save the people of Gaza. The narrative overall, whether you're listening to the Houthis or the Iranians or the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq or Syria, they all say, look, just finish the war in Gaza, just end all of that, and everything will go back to being calm. But what they actually mean is, end the war in Gaza on the terms that we want, where Hamas is able to be strong, where Israel is weakened, and therefore the United States' principal ally in the region is weakened, and therefore US interests in the region are weakened. I don't think anyone should kind of misunderstand what they're actually saying here when they say, you'll get peace, if you stop all of this. They're not. They're saying they want it on their terms where they come out stronger, and they are vowing to continue the fight here.",

Joining me now is the president of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media, Ian Bremmer, and the former NATO supreme allied commander, General Wesley Clark. Gentlemen, thank you both, for joining me this evening. Ian, let me start with you. We have seen things like this in the past few months, I mean, strikes on the Houthis in Yemen, strikes against the militants in Iraq and Syria, but how different do you think what we've seen over the course of the past 24 hours is, and what does it mean for what we're going to see in the next few weeks?",

Do you think we're a little closer to war when you look at these more than 30 targets struck in Yemen today and the real ramping up of activity against those militant groups in Iraq and Syria?GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, actually, we've been at war or Iran has been at war with us for 40 years. Undeclared, but they've pushed on us. You know, they used terrorist attacks against our Marines in Lebanon, so we just don't want to admit it because we don't want this. Iran has a very good strategy by their standards. They can continue to attack and whittle away at American interests, and then they can claim deniability, and I don't accept that for a second. I think ultimately, we're going to have to go to the source of this and that source is Iran, and we're going to have to put it at risk those assets they value most. Now, yes, that is an escalation. But we are ramping this up right now. And Alex, I think I just -- we just can't discuss this without also referencing Ukraine. Ukraine is really central to the US alliances in Europe and global credibility for the United States and they are really struggling now. So everything we do in the Middle East helps Putin deal with Ukraine. We have to keep that in mind. This is a multi-theater problem that we're dealing with and the longer we drag this out with Iran, the greater the impact -- adverse impact -- on our alliances and in Ukraine.",

I agree with the General, of course, that there has been a proxy war that the Iranians do not have deniability. All of these proxies, do not have massive weapons stockpiles, they are being provided ongoing weapons by the Iranians every week, every day that the Americans and others are trying to interdict. They are completely accountable for the fact that these attacks continue to go on. They're happy to have these attacks continue to go on. So clearly, the Americans are involved indirectly in a war with the Iranians.But of course, there is another theater. It's not just the Ukrainians are now a deep second place in terms of the interests of the United States, the time of US policymakers, the willingness to provide support. It's also that this is hurting Biden in an election year. And the longer this war goes on and the more we see escalation in the region, the harder it is for him to deal with Republican opposition saying you're a weenie, you're not taking this war to the Iranians. This never would have happened under Trump. And he's also taking it from the progressives in his own party that are saying you're on the support of war criminals engaged in genocide in Israel. That's a serious -- that's a serious problem for Biden right now. For a year, you know, you had bipartisan support for Biden's support on Ukraine. Now, you've got the divide in the United States and Ukraine, you've got the divide in the United States on Israel, you've got a divide in the United States on the Iranians and that is a hard, hard thing for Biden to see his way through.",

Remember, only eight days before October 7th, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, wrote a piece saying the Middle East is more stable now than it has been in a very long time and he had reason to say that, of course.I mean, the Saudis and the Emiratis had made peace with Qatar and the GCC. The Americans had the Abraham Accords. Israel was in a strong geopolitical position. The Chinese had facilitated a breakthrough between the Chinese -- between the Iranians and the Saudis. Only problem is that the Palestinians were still on the short end of that stick, and Netanyahu was driving all sorts of problems in his own democracy. Israel was more unstable, had their eye off the ball. So October 7th happened and the Biden administration was very surprised by that, in a sense, was caught flatfooted by that. And now they've got to deal with a crisis in a region that they really, really did not want. They really, really weren't prepared for. And absolutely, they're pushing hard for at least a temporary ceasefire. They're pushing hard to get those hostages exchanged and stop the fighting in Gaza for a period of time, so they can talk about political solutions with Gulf allies, for example, talk about providing security on the ground in Gaza, that is not an a permanent occupation by Israel, also talk about how to get Netanyahu out of there, who is -- who frankly, benefits from the war going on longer in terms of his own personal ambitions on the ground that aren't always aligned with those of Israeli national security. It's a very, very hard thing for Biden to get done, though, because there are so many moving pieces, many of whom are not aligned towards stability. MARQUARDT: And General Clark, we just heard my colleague Nic Robertson is saying that it's not that the Houthi necessarily want the end of the war in Gaza, they want it on their terms. So to what extent do you think that you know, what Ian was just talking about that that possible truce and pause in the fighting is so critical for these various other fronts?",

That was in response to the three American service members that were killed in Jordan. These strikes are part of an ongoing campaign with a coalition of countries. The President had previously approved multilateral strikes against the Houthis to defend U.S. vessels and commercial vessels in the region. This has been an ongoing activity by the Houthis that have raised alarm within the administration because it really does threaten the global economy. Some of these commercial vessels have had to avoid the area and it has become of increasing concern to many of those in that region. But, of course, this is just one of many things that the President is having to navigate in this region as he tries to avoid being pulled into a wider regional war. And a senior administration official stressed to me that these strikes in Yemen were not intended to escalate any conflict in the region, but rather directly related to the Houthis' actions in the Red Sea and taken to prevent or at least to deter them from continuing these actions. Now, of course, the U.S. officials have repeatedly said that these strikes are intended to degrade the Houthis' capabilities.

We'd love to be a fly on the wall for that. I think what's going to happen there is the court - the Supreme Court's going to be looking for some kind of an off-ramp here.They feel that they really need to supply some kind of uniformity for the cases across the country, and yet they're going to be very cautious about really wading into the merits too much. So, for example, they can look for off-ramps in the manner of process. They could look at Colorado and say, wasn't sufficient process here for the kind of decision they made. They could also punt to Congress and say you really need to have a congressional finding in cases like this. So it's - we'll have to see which way they go, but I would be surprised if they really want to wade too much into the substance, because what they want to do is to find a way to resolve it, but also not to make themselves the target for more political criticism.",

The Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis and the filings were concerning Willis and the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade. And in them, it was confirmed that there was a \"personal relationship\" between the two. But Willis denied that Wade had benefited financially from his being hired. What's your take on those filings that we saw?",

      "sentences": "I think those filings really provide the basis for saying that there's no there there. I believe those filings, including an affidavit, indicated at the time he was hired there was no personal relationship. Even if there had been, that doesn't go to the question of any prejudice to the defendants in the case. Maybe it's sort of an HR kind of issue where they're hiring someone she's involved with.Even now, if there is a personal relationship of some kind, there's no prejudice to a defendant, because they're on the same side. Two prosecutors having a relationship doesn't affect things. So one would think this might put the matter to rest, but the politics are so highly charged there that I'm sure she will continue to be the target of investigations, including there's like a political committee, a legislative committee that's trying to oversee her now in Georgia. MARQUARDT: Yes, they're not on opposing sides in this case. All right. Shan Wu, thank you very much for tackling all those different cases. Much appreciated.",

In other cases, people are also just being told to have basic preparations, meaning keeping up with the information, having an emergency kit and stopping by your local fire station just to grab some sandbags. That's exactly what a lot of these people here are doing.I spoke to many of them who've come throughout the day. We've seen the piles of sand essentially go down and get filled again. You see they put more sand over here because of the amount of people that were coming in throughout the day. And I want you to listen to what one of the L.A. residents told me when he was here to pick up some sand. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNAL (off camera): Once you saw, it made me a bit (inaudible) ...",
