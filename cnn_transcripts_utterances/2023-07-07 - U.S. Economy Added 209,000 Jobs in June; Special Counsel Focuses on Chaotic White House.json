All of that is such chaos and we know that because of the House testimony, but the reason this matters to prosecutors is that this is the moment where the voices around Donald Trump on what to do after the election are all collected there.There are the outsiders, Sidney Powell, Patrick Burn, Michael Flynn who get to the Oval Office and are talking with Trump one-on-one about what he could do, floating to him these ideas that he could appoint Sidney Powell as a special counsel, he could seize voting machines, he could harness the power of the presidency that he had to question the result of the election, and then there are others like Rudy Giuliani who still wanted something a little bit different, the fake electors. He wanted to use that to pressure and he wanted to use the court system, even though by that time they had lost many of their court challenges after the election. And then there's others, top officials in the Trump administration who come into this meeting, and this is where they really had this eruption of the different sides, where people like Pat Cipollone, the former White House counsel who we just saw there commenting, is informing not just these people, but Trump himself, there is no fraud and it's time to let this go. And so now we know from our reporting team that there are multiple witnesses that have been asked about this in the grand jury, in interviews for quite some time, but now is when the special counsel's office prosecutors are still making sure, zeroing in on what happened at this meeting. They're even talking to Giuliani himself about it since he sat for a voluntary interview over two days. And so this meeting, this date, December 18th, is quite pivotal because it is a moment, according to the House and Congress, where Donald Trump made the choice that he could continue to push these ideas of election fraud or he could listen to his top advisers and give it up and acknowledge that he had lost the election.",

If, in fact, the folks on the Trump team received information like that that could certainly act toward to the benefit of criminal charges because they were advised that what they were doing was unlawful or improper, you know, possibly violating state or federal law, or their law licenses.

Or conversely, they could just be amassing evidence of a massive nationwide scheme and charging it all in one jurisdiction.Really what it comes down to is what are prosecutors confident not just that they know or are comfortable with, but what could they get into court. And sometimes things that you hear or see or even believe in your heart as an investigator or prosecutor for whatever reason just can't make it into court, either it's hearsay or it's not substantiated or not corroborated, whatever it might be.

NATO last year condemned Russia for using the cluster bombs on civilians in Ukraine. Cluster munitions are reviled because of the risks they can pose to civilians for years, even decades after they're deployed. Still U.S. Defense officials say they will be included in a new military package for Ukraine.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is following this from the Pentagon for us this morning. What is it that sparked the decision for the United States to say, look, we're going to deploy these controversial weapons to Ukraine? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Sara, it's really the result of the changing battlefield conditions on the ground in Ukraine and the realities there of how the war is going. U.S. officials were not actively considering giving these cluster munitions to Ukraine over the last several months that Ukraine really had been begging for them but once that counteroffensive began and it was not going as quickly as U.S. and Western officials believed that it might, U.S. officials began to realize that Ukraine might not have enough artillery ammunition to last throughout the entirety of the counteroffensive if the U.S. did not begin to tap into its stockpiles of cluster munitions. Now the U.S. began phasing out the use of cluster munitions on the battlefield in 2016 so it has a very large stockpile of these weapons and importantly the U.S. says that it is going to try to provide Ukraine with the form of munitions that it has in its stockpiles that have a lower than 2.35 percent dud rate. Now, the dud rate is important because, of course, that is what could cause this long-term risk to civilians if those cluster munitions land on the ground and don't actually explode. Civilians could encounter them years later. Here is how Pentagon press secretary, Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, described it during a briefing yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: I will say that we have multiple variants of DPICMs in our stocks and the ones that we are considering providing would not include older variants with dud rates that are higher than 2.35 percent. We are aware of reports out there from several decades ago that indicate that certain 155- millimeter DPICMs have higher dud rates so we would be carefully selecting rounds with lower dud rates for which we have recent testing data.
