It's much more complicated. U.S. manufacturing is tied so much more strongly to China and there could be major implications economically for the U.S. So I think Biden and Xi are doing this kind of test of one another and this comes among the controversy over the spy balloon, it comes as Americans are increasingly saying they are much more worried about China than they are about Russia.",

You have seen a growing number of Democrats and Republicans saying the U.S. should provide F-16s or allow other countries to provide F-16s but there are still real divisions about it not just inside the U.S. but globally. So, I think what the Biden administration is balancing is both a political bipartisan support inside Congress but also how the American public feels about this, and also where the NATO allies, where the rest of the west is. But to us all of this seems like news because we are watching it unfold around this trip, but in reality the U.S. and the Ukrainians are talking all the time every day and none of this is a surprise and a lot of this is sort of a very careful orchestration of pressure and threats and timing. Biden also is concerned about an escalation with Russia and he is concerned about the implications for China, for Iran, which we now understand Russia and the Iranians may be talking about ways to mutually assist one another on the military front. So, there are all kinds of levers and implications here. But Biden's declaration of no F-16s now I think doesn't mean no F-16s ever. It means no F-16s right now.",

It's 40 percent of Republicans. And that's been a huge spike. It has been quadrupling over the course of the last year.But right now Fox polling finding Biden is doing the best job of handling Ukraine policy in Americans' eyes than he has been over the entire course of this conflict.

Authorities trying to clear some of the snow and the ice but they continue to say that it is extremely dangerous for the drivers here.This is the grapevine. Essentially, the highway that connects Los Angeles to San Francisco. And authorities are telling people, look, if you can stay home, you should just stay home because a lot of the drivers that were trying to pass through have been stuck on the side of the road or nearby hotels because there is nowhere they can go. I want to walk a little bit just so that I can show you the accumulation of the snow. You know, it's not the same as maybe other parts of the country, but the problem is that a lot of people just don't know how to deal with this type of snow here, even the crews, and authorities don't know how to deal with the snow. A lot of the cars here in this parking lot have been stuck in the snow. And to be fair, my producer's car also got stuck in the snow. So, we have been dealing with all of this over the last couple of days. In the Los Angeles area, a lot of rain, flooding, just cars that are stranded. And then also there are many, many power outages. Thousands throughout the state without power because of the wind. This is likely going to be a historic storm. We will have to wait to see what the total numbers of both snow and rain accumulation are going to be, but overall it is just, again, incredible to look at this and to say we are in southern California.

CNN's Elizabeth Cohen with more. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Boris, Amara, this is a really interesting study that looks at the connection between dementia and chronic pain. So, as we grow older, our brains actually shrink. Take a look at this picture. This is showing the hippocampus. That is a part of the brain that is directly related to cognition. And what the researchers found is that folks who had chronic pain, the hippocampus shrunk even more quickly than those who didn't have chronic pain. The researchers were looking at brain images of about 19,000 people. And what they found is that the hippocampus shrank more quickly when people were in chronic pain. Then there was another part of the study where they actually gave people cognitive tasks to do. So, let's take a look at what that found. Participants were given 11 cognitive tasks when they had pain at one site. Let's say they just had back pain. They had worse performance on one of those tasks when they had multiple pain sites. For example, let's say maybe they had back pain and shoulder pain. They had a worse performance on seven tasks. So, there are all sorts of reasons why you don't want to be in pain, and now one of them might be that you don't want to develop dementia. So, what do you do? Well, first remember there are some medications that do help with pain. You don't necessarily have to take opioids. There are other drugs. There are over-the-counter drugs. And also antidepressants actually can help against pain. Massage, exercise, acupuncture, those can all help. Psychological treatments can help. Also, weight loss can often help especially when it's certain types of joint pain. Boris, Amara?",

JANET IVEY, PRESIDENT, EXPLORE MARS INC.: Well, it certainly is upset the cosmic applecart. But here's what's amazing when we think about -- let's talk about literally the kind of scale of this. It's like, if we put the timeline of the surprisingly massive ancient galaxies into perspective, consider the age of the universe, 13.8 billion years old, or at least that's what we think, right? But if we can press this vast expanse of time into a single 24-hour day with the big thing happening at 12:00 a.m., these particular six galaxies were already in existence or being born at 43.2 minutes after midnight.

But the thing about these galaxies is that they would have maybe spun around at clouds of gas and does, collapse and simultaneously ignited stars. And that just upends everything that we previously had been thinking. Or maybe somebody thought it early on, and they said no, that's not how it goes. It's a much slower expanding process.So, the JWST team has its work cut out for them, but it's an exciting time.

It's like we're seeing the formation of a galaxy right now. This is dust blowing around. But we'll some stars split out two weeks until Selection Sunday. It's never too late to get the party started. Teams making their final push to make it to the tournament. Watch this. Seventh-ranked Arizona at home, up by to over rivals Arizona State. And The Sun Devils play spoiler, stunner at the buzzer. Desmond Cambridge with the game-winner from beyond half court, shocking the Wildcats by one. Now, number 13 Miami was up 25 over Florida State. And it looked like Miami would barely survive after Jordan Miller put the Kings up to with four seconds to go. But Seminole say, not so fast, my friends. Matthew Cleveland popping a three-pointer at the buzzer. Florida State completes the biggest comeback in ACC history in front of a shocked Hurricanes home crowd. And in the Pac 12 season finale, Utah's Alissa Pili hitting the buzzer-beater in the third against number three Stanford. The eighth- ranked Utah eventually take down the defending champs 84-78 earning a share of their first-ever regular season Pac 12 title. They won just five games two years ago. NBA now, 76ers and Celtics are tied, but with just one second to go, Jayson Tatum puts Boston up with the clutch three-pointer. Here goes Philly, though, a chance to answer. Joel Embiid draining a shot from the opposite free throw line, but the buzzer had just barely sounded. It was a little bit too late and Embiid knew it. The whole affiliate crowd there and can't believe it. Celtics hang on for a 110-107 win. The MLS season starting off with a bang. Atlanta United down one-nil to San Jose but Thiago Almada, he goes bonkers, a banger in the 93rd minute, tie in the game at one. And then in the 99th minute, on a free kick, the Argentina World Cup champ hits home his second goal. The game-winner, call him Thia-goal. The first MLS player to win a World Cup now scores Atlanta United's latest game winner in club history. Finally, the Braves getting burned by MLB is new pitch clock rule. Tie game, two outs, bottom of the night, bases loaded against the Red Sox. But Atlanta's Cal Conley, he's called out on strikes, a batter's box violation. He says wasn't set until five seconds left on the pitch clock. But the new rule says the batter has to be in the box and alert to the pitcher by eight seconds left. Conley stunned. The spring training game ends in a tie. Opening day is March 30th. So, it's not just the pitchers who are going to be underneath, it's the batter's too who better be ready. Kind of like our world when they're like, wrap, wrap, wrap, got to go. They're doing that pressure every day.",
