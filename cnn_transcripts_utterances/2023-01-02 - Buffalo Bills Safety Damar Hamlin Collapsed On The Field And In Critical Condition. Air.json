He is number three on the Buffalo Bills.He was hit during the first quarter of tonight's game between the Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals. That's according to the NFL. That he fell on his back just moments after getting up from an open field tackle of Bengals' wide receiver, Tee Higgins. The Buffalo Bills team trainers got to him within 10 seconds after he collapsed. An ambulance was brought on to the field, and he was even administered CPR. I want to go back to CNN's chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, CNN contributor Bob Costas, and NFL analyst and former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho. Doctor Gupta Sanjay, just thinking about what has happened here tonight. And there is a lot of uncertainty. We don't have all of the answers, obviously. He is in critical condition. We have seen what happened. There was the collapse and getting back up for a moment, of course, before he actually collapsed after that tackle was made. Do you have any insight into what could have transpired here? Do you think this was a cardiac, obviously, cardiac issue? What could have prompted it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really does seem like a cardiac issue, a heart issue primarily. It's -- we are speculating, Laura, at this point. And it's tough to watch that, what transpired on the field there.But a couple of things to just point out. As you said, he stood up for a minute or a few seconds at least before he collapsed. I think one of the things that people always think about with football and -- is brain or spinal cord injury. That doesn't seem as likely the case given that he did stand up at least for a period of time before he collapsed. There is a condition known as commotio cordis, which is basically something that occurs from a strong blow to the chest at a particular time in the heartbeat. And if it happens, it can essentially throw the heart into this very dangerous arrythmia.",

If that -- if that blow happens at the right time or at the wrong time, it can actually cause the heart to go into this abnormal rhythm, leading to cardiac arrest.It is rare, Laura. You don't see this very often at all. In fact, a lot of time, it -- when you do hear about it, it's typically in sports like baseball where you have a fast ball or something that hit somebody in the chest, something small that hit somebody in the chest at that exact precise time to cause this sort of problem. But, again, I just want to be clear. We don't know. What we do know is that he was requiring CPR for several minutes on the field. So, he was assessed very quickly, it sounds like within 10 seconds of his collapse. They determined that his heart was either not beating or it was in abnormal rhythm, and they began CPR. The goal at that point is to try and see if you can restore the heart's normal rhythm. And typically, that is done with something known as a defibrillator, an AED, automated external defibrillator. We don't know if that was used on the field. Clearly, in football stadiums, large venues of that size, they have them. There was an ambulance close by. So, that would have an AED. That would be critically important to try and restart the heart.",

So, you're right, it's not the ambulance or the hospital being on the field, but you have to be acting in those first few minutes to try and move the oxygenated blood through the body and/or defibrillate, you know, to restart the heart.But what is likely happening now is that they are determining, you know, trying to get an idea of exactly what the status of his heart is at this point. Most likely he is on a breathing machine because you're giving medicines that, you know, you are trying to improve the heart's function are doing things to restart the heart. What we've last heard was that he was in critical condition, which means that he has vital signs, he has a heartbeat, but they are not within normal -- their normal range. So, right now, it sounds like what they would be doing in the hospital is trying to stabilize him. You can become in critical but stable condition. And that would be sort of the next goal. Ultimately, you would like him to come into stable condition, meaning that all the vital signs come back to within normal limits, and ultimately be at a point where he's doing all those things on his own, not requiring a breathing machine, not requiring medicines to allow his heart to function normally. I don't want to minimize this, Laura. If you've been undergoing CPR for that length of time -- I mean, it's obviously a serious concern, a serious issue. When the heart is not beating well or not beating, all the organs are not getting enough blood flow for a period of time. So, they're going to want to assess the sort of impact of that decreased blood flow he has had on the rest of the organs. That's probably what's going to be happening in the hospital tonight and, you know, for the next period of time.",

It's unbelievable to think about this.Emmanuel, I want to go to you here because -- I mean, just thinking about it, you remind us and, of course, it is worth and bears repeating, that we're talking about a human being on this field who happens to be a football player, who has been injured in some manner that led to his collapse. And now, he's in the critical condition that Sanjay Gupta has described to us. Talk to me about your experience as an athlete and as a player and having witnessed injuries on the field before, obviously, unlike this. But what is the mentality? What is going through your mind at a time like this? And do you feel as though the players, by making it the decision, obviously, collectively not to return, is this a paradigm shift in the way that the sport has changed?",

I prayed for him as well. The players are in absolute shock. You can't play after something like this because you're so concerned about your brother, you're so concerned about your friend, you're so concerned about your colleague. But, really, Laura, I am thinking of this. The NFL, which owns one day of the week, two nights of the week, if you will, has never felt smaller. Right now, everyone is focused on Danar Hamlin's health, his well-being. Again, this is a son, this is a friend, this is a brother, this is a 24-year-old young man who is fighting to stay on a team. The Buffalo Bills are trying to stay on top of their conference. They are favored to go to the Super Bowl. Damar Hamlin is just trying to fight to keep his team afloat. He was not intending to go into this game and fight for his life. And so, if you really humanize all of this, this is something that none of these players have likely ever experienced before, and hopefully, none of these players will ever have to experience again.",

An ambulance did carry him away to the hospital where he is now listed in critical condition.I want to bring in CNN sports anchor Coy Wire and get your take because you mentioned this hit particularly close to home for you. You were a Buffalo Bills player. Yourself have had injuries. A titanium plate, I think, at some point in your body or neck. You watched and witnessed fellow players be injured on the field. I'm wondering what you, Coy Wire, are feeling tonight because this is emotional for everyone to watch and to see and to have this anxiety of what is happening to this young man right now in the hospital.",

And just watching that game tonight as a fan, you know, cheering my team on, wearing my colors, when I saw him fall, I knew there was something different. You know, I have a titanium plate and four screws on my neck. I was knocked unconscious several times in my career. One, I didn't remember what happened until the next day.But I've been in similar situations that those players on that field felt tonight. When I was playing with the Buffalo Bills in 2007, my teammate, Kevin Everett from the University of Miami, he's a tight end, we were covering a kick together and he hit the wedge and he just fell to the ground like a LED balloon, and he was paralyzed on that play. There were the ambulances, there were the huddles, there were the tears. When I was in college at Stanford University, my teammate, running back Kerry Carter hit University of Washington's Curtis Williams, and he was paralyzed from the neck down in the year 2000. He passed away two years later from complications from that hit. So, seeing that game and just thinking about that, I mean, you know, it brings emotions out of me and memories because typically, as players, we are trained to have a next play mentality. You know, I think that in years past, those players would have been getting small insults and the coaches would've been smacking them on the butt and say, all right, let's buckle up, we got to focus, let's get back to it. And if there's any sort of silver lining in this tragic situation, it is that our perception about player health and safety has changed. All of the CTE, all of the concussion talks, all of the lives that were lost, all of the lives that have been altered from the people who played this game, maybe those are in vain, because that game tonight was stopped. That has never happened before, Laura. That to me is a powerful moment. But it pales in comparison to this young man, this son, this young man who is out trying to help this community as a backup safety. He was getting an opportunity to play on Monday night football, Laura. I guess the Cincinnati Bengals made it to the Super Bowl last year and this happens. I can't imagine what he's feeling. I can't imagine what his mom is feeling, his teammates are feeling. But we can just send collective thoughts and prayers. I believe that works. I believe there is power in that. The last we heard, he is in critical condition, fighting for his life. And hopefully, just as I mentioned, whatever situation, that something can be learned from this, and that he has a speedy, healthy and full recovery, he can get back out, playing the game he loves, giving back and serving communities, doing toy drops for children like he loves to do. That is a young man who needs all of us sending him well wishes tonight.",

And so, this Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills game had extremely high implications for the NFL playoffs to try to get that coveted number one seed. That is the only seed this year that has the home playoff game, home field advantage, and these two teams could possibly, at the end of the year, end up in the championship to decide who goes to the Super Bowl to play the NFC champion.So, this game -- the magnitude of this game was extremely high, and to see this unfortunate incident happen early in the game and not just the Bills fans, not just the Bills players and coaches but the Bengals fans, all of them in the stadium, all coming together in understanding how big this situation was, much bigger than football. Football is irrelevant at the moment. And you see, as you noted earlier, the Bengals fans were there in their jerseys, presumably coming straight from the game, and went straight to the hospital to hold a candlelight in front of the hospital, obviously wishing Damar well. And all of the players, I mean, you saw Stefon Diggs, teammate of his, going to the hospital. I think I saw somewhere where they said he caught an uber from the stadium to get to the hospital and he had to kind of talk his way through police to get in and get them realize that he was his teammate, brother and friend, and they let him in.

We have an NFL statement that has been issued on the Bills- Bengals game. I want to read it for you here. As we are watching, people from outside of the hospital, Buffalo Bills fans, Bengals fans alike, human beings trying to show support outside of the hospital. But the statement from the NFL tonight reads, tonight, Buffalo Bills- Cincinnati Bengals game has been postponeda after Buffalo Bills Damar Hamlin collapsed. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced, Hamlin received immediate medical attention on the field by team and independent medical staff and local paramedics. He was then transported to a local hospital where he is in critical condition. Our thoughts are with Damar and the Buffalo Bills. We will provide more information as it becomes available. The NFL has been in constant communication with the NFL Players Association, which is in an agreement with postponing the game. Bob, what is your reaction to that tonight? COSTAS (via telephone):  It was the right thing to do, all things considered. This game has playoff implication which are significant or insignificant rather alongside the player's condition. But it is not like baseball where you can just play the next day unless they decide they are going to keep the Bills and Bengals in town and play on a Tuesday night. They are moving towards the playoffs. So, they're going to have to decide whether they simply cancel the game and the Bills and Bengals play 16 games while everybody else in the league plays 17. Both were short of making the playoffs. Seeding was still in doubt. So, perhaps they will say, look, freeze it right where it is and this game won't be played at all because it's very difficult if they are going to push it until next week. The playoffs start the week after that. There will still be another game to play. So, it is just a scheduling problem, which is, as I said, is insignificant alongside the condition of Damar Hammlin. But that is something to consider once we determine what Mr. Hamlin's condition is and the league decides what they want to do going forward.",
