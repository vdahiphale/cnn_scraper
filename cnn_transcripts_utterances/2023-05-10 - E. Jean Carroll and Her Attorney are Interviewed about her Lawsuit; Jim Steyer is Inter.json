Your perspective?ROBERTA KAPLAN, E. JEAN CARROLL'S ATTORNEY: So, you heard Donald Trump in that tape say that the judge here, Judge Kaplan, no relation to me, went out of his way to be unfair. Actually, the opposite is true. Judge Kaplan, in this case, went out of his way to be fair to Donald Trump. He gave him multiple opportunities to show up in that courtroom and testify, and Donald Trump decided not to. There are no issues in this case on appeal. They'll make them, but there are no serious issues on this appeal. And your colleague is absolutely right.",

Number two, as Senator Bennet was saying in that clip earlier, there's -- our government is going to have to step up and regulate this. They failed to do that with social media, and we can see the results. But there's clearly going to have to be government regulation and leadership here. And right now they're behind the eight ball again. But I do think it's going to be incumbent upon OpenAI, that's Sam's company, and on Google and a couple of the other major players to rein this technology in and not to experiment with it too much. And that is going to be relying, therefore, on the goodwill of large corporations. So that's why people like Common Sense Media are around, because we have to hold them accountable. And, quite frankly, this is a major experiment on our kids' lives, on their education, and right now it's being completely conducted by large companies. So, we have to get involved as parents now.",

I feel more optimistic, honestly, that the folks who are running these big AI platforms are concerned about the potential downsides and consequences than, for example, 15 years ago when social media was introduced and you had Mark Zuckerburg running Facebook and buying Instagram.I do think there is a greater sense of corporate social responsibility, and that's really important and we need to hold them to that. But at the same time, our government cannot continue to just live in a vacuum where they don't issue any kinds of regulatory structure because that leaves it essentially to the good will of corporations and then to parents like you and me and Phil.

This is pretty much right in line, maybe even a little bit lighter than economists had been expecting.And you can see the trend. I love to show, the trend is your friend, in all of these numbers. Never take just one of these numbers. Take a look at them together and you can see that we've seen peaking in the inflation story. This is the smallest 12-month increase in two years now. That's good news. Ten months in a row of just a little bit of deceleration. So, these prices are still too high, no question. And when you look within these numbers, shelter was 60 percent of it. Shelter, that's a sticky -- we call it sticky inflation. You also saw gas prices. Used car prices were up. So those are some of the biggest categories that we saw. Still have a lot of work to do. The Fed would like to see 2 percent inflation. So, 4.9 percent is still too hot, but slowing. Slowing. Slowing slowly.

Look now, on average, Trump has a 30-point advantage, over 50 percent.And I want to give you an indication of how strong that is looking forward, right, because polls are just a snapshot in time. Well, look at those who polled near or better than Trump's level at this point in non-incumbent primaries. Bob Dole in '96, won the nomination. George W. Bush in 2000, won the nomination. Al Gore in 2000, won the nomination. Hillary Clinton in 2016, won the nomination. So, people polling in Trump's position have generally gone on to win the nomination. And I'll point out one little last nugget. Members of Congress or governors endorsing Trump, so far in the 2024 cycle, more than 60. In the entire 2016 primary season, just 15. So the fact is Trump has very good polling. He has the backing of a lot of members of his party. At this point the Trump train looks very difficult to stop.
