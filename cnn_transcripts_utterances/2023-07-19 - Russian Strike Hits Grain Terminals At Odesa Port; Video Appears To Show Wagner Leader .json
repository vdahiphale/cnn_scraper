Defense officials accuse Vladimir Putin of deliberately targeting infrastructure associated with the Black Sea grain deal, the one Russia just got out of. Odesa's mayor described the overnight strikes as one of the most horrible nights since the Kremlin's invasion.And take a good look at this dark and grainy video. This purportedly shows Yevgeny Prigozhin, the man who waged an armed rebellion against Vladimir Putin last month. He's reportedly been spotted in public for the first time since his attempted uprising. The apparently unedited video was post on Wagner's social media channels and appears to show the mercenary leader greeting his troops in Belarus. Now CNN cannot to confirm the speaker in the video is in fact Prigozhin or even when it was recorded. CNN chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has been following this new development. So Nick, what more can you tell us about the video and Yevgeny Prigozhin's whereabouts? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I mean, the video itself is pretty inconclusive. You can see parts of it. It's very dark, very grainy. It sounds like Prigozhin talking there, and if indeed, it is verified or verifiable, it would essentially suggest that Yevgeny Prigozhin after a 25-day absence from public view is really going along with the deal that ended his armed rebellion against Vladimir Putin. In which the president of Belarus said bring yourself and your fighters to Belarus. It's taken a while, it seems, for him to get there, but some geolocation that CNN has done does appears to suggest that may be one of the camps where they were told perhaps Wagner fighters would go and some of the metadata in that file backs up the timing of its purported filming. So still some questions to be answered. But it came out hours after here in Prague the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency, MI6 gave a rare public speech. And questions after which he told me, when I asked if Yevgeny Prigozhin was alive or healthy, that, quote, he was thought to be floating about, which would have amounted to the first Western confirmation that frankly Prigozhin was still alive, let alone at liberty. So details certainly emerging today about where Prigozhin is, it seem, and the fact he may have gong along with the deal that ended his armed rebellion -- Boris.",

Here's what Sir Richard Moore, the head of MI6 had to say earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD MOORE, MI6 CHIEF: If you look at Putin's behaviors on that day, Prigozhin started off I think, as a traitor at breakfast. He had been pardoned by supper and then a few days later, he was invited for tea. So, there are some things and even the chief of MI6 finds that a little bit difficult to try and interpret, in terms of who's in and who's out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what happened to her in the fall of 2021 was an eye-opening event for us. She had a perforated appendix that was misdiagnosed. The doctors were convinced that she had a virus.And that misdiagnosis almost killed her because her body -- she started to develop sepsis, which is one of the harms that is discussed in this study by Dr. David Newman-Toker. And Dr. Newman Toker actually is somebody who after this whole incident happened and after Alice recovered from it and she had her appendix out, looked into her case on behalf of Johns Hopkins. And it's harrowing. I mean, what happens is -- so in this study the Dr. Newman-Toker takes a look at 800,000 Americans either died or severely disabled because of diagnostic error, which he says happens about 11 percent of the time. Now most of the time it's not death or serious disability, but 371,000 people died according to this study, 424,000 sustained permanent disability such as brain damage, blindness, loss of, limbs, or organs, or metastasized cancer. And so, this is a very serious issue. It's one that doesn't make the doctor popular among his colleagues, but it's a very serious issue and I'll be talking about it with Sanjay coming up.",

We were asking for imaging, can we get an x-ray, can we get a sonogram, and they would don't it. We don't need that data, is what they said.And Sanjay and I have talked about this before. And he talked about something called diagnostic momentum. Which is basically, for want of a better term, buying into a narrative. You know, believe being there. We believe this is a virus, therefore we don't need that data because we've decided it is this. And then just getting on that train for it's a virus, it's a virus, and ignoring all countervailing evidence that might suggest it's something else. Well, why is her white blood cell count so high, et cetera, et cetera. This has become an issue, a cause for my daughter, Alice. She talked about this on air a year ago with Sanjay. And in fact, while we were on vacation in Idaho, a family in Massachusetts found her on Instagram and started writing about their daughter who had a situation similar to Alice's, misdiagnosis. Doctors messed up, they made the wrong decisions. And before you knew it, me and my wife and my daughter, we were all involved with this family telling them what to do. And thank God that little girl is recovering. But, you know, you really have to be fierce. And people out there need to know they have rights as patients. Look, my dad's a doctor, my mom's a nurse. I revere the medical profession. But people make mistakes and patients are allowed to say, I really would like a sonogram, I really would like a CAT scan. I don't think you're taking this seriously enough or I need a consultation. I really would like the surgical team to come in. I need to talk to them.",
