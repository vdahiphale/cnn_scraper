And it's actually highly unusual for someone who's a criminal defendant, or even a party in a lawsuit, to go and sit and watch an appeals hearing like this today.But this really isn't just any appeals hearing. This is an appeals hearing on a question that has never been looked at before. How much protection is there around the presidency and given to people who had served in the presidency, whenever they're charged with crimes related to what they were doing while holding that office? And so Donald Trump and his lawyers, they have this one shot today right now before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, before these three judges in Washington, D.C., to make their case that Trump should not have to go to trial, that he shouldn't be charged, because he was president and has a level of immunity. That's their argument. And they are also making this argument that his case should be paused while the appeals court figures this out. That's going to be a major question today, as well. The three judges looking at this: Karen Henderson, who is a Republican appointee, has been on the bench a long time and has had a say in a lot of questions about the executive branch of the presidency before. And then two other judges who are fairly new to this circuit: Michelle Childs and Florence Pan, but have both written quite weighty questions and opinions before for this court. We're going to be watching to see what they ask, what direction they take the lawyers today as they're arguing. They're not going to be asking Donald Trump any questions directly, and they also are not going to be ruling today. But how they're asking these questions and what they're looking at is really a significant thing. The Supreme Court, if it goes there, which it's likely to do, they don't have to take this case if it goes before them. This court is the court that makes the determinations now. They did in Watergate. And so we're in really a significant moment today.",

The district judge, Tanya Chutkan, forcefully rejected that. She ruled, memorably, There is no, quote, \"divine right of kings.\" Now, when we get -- go into court today, these will be the judges who are sitting. Judge Henderson was put on the bench by George H.W. Bush, the father, back in 1990. Judges Childs and Pan were put on the bench by judge -- by President Joseph Biden.

The Pentagon says there are shortfalls in the process that can, quote, \"definitely be improved.\" CNN's Natasha Bertrand is for us live at the Pentagon. Natasha, in terms of this review, what do we expect to come from it?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, this is really going to be a review of the processes surrounding the notifications that are sent to senior national security and military leaders, as well as the White House when the secretary of defense needs to transfer his authorities to the deputy secretary of defense.It's also going to involve a review of how the deputy is notified, because we first reported that Secretary Austin's office did not notify the deputy secretary that he was actually in the hospital when they asked her to assume his responsibilities until days after he had actually been admitted to Walter Reed. So what we are learning from this memo is that, quote, \"This review will help to ensure: one, clarity and transparency when a determination has been made that certain authorities have been transferred; and two, that proper and timely notification has been made to the president and White House; and, as appropriate the United States Congress and the American public.\" Now, as you'll recall, the U.S. Congress and the American public were not notified of Austin's hospitalization until about four days after he was actually admitted to Walter Reed. So this process is basically going to help ensure that all relevant parties are notified when the secretary of defense is otherwise indisposed. Now, importantly, this memo makes no mention of the fact that the Pentagon did not also notify the White House of the secretary's December 22nd elective medical procedure that he underwent at Walter Reed. And that was a one-night hospital stay that also involved the transfer of his authorities to his deputy secretary, Kathleen Hicks. And so the memo asks the Pentagon's general counsel, as well as other senior officials, to examine the -- the events stemming from his January 1st hospitalization; makes no mention of that December 22nd stay, which of course, we all have questions about why the Pentagon did not also notify the White House and the president when the secretary was in the hospital overnight -- guys.",
