The unfolding disaster and the help that they need in Hawaii right now, we're going to get to it.I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. This is CNN News Central. Right now, Hawaii is battling unprecedented wildfire. Strong winds are a big part of the problem, making it difficult for officials to control the spread. I'm going to show you video taken overnight. I'm going to show it to you when it comes up, this video overnight of just showing the wildfires moving quickly across Western Maui. The drone operator estimated that the fire was moving one and a half to three miles an hour. There are currently three active fires burning on that island. Two other fires are spreading on the big island. We are going to show you flames -- you can see flames, large plumes of smoke encroaching on local communities in these islands. Officials say several buildings there have been destroyed. Hawaii's lieutenant governor had said this about the challenges that they're facing right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. SYLVIA LUKE (D-HI):  911 is down. Cell service is down. Phone service is down. And that's been part of the problem. Our hospital system in Maui, they are overburdened, people suffering from inhalation. The reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui Hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What's the situation?DICKAR (voice over):  Okay. So, I live and work in Lahaina Town and had to evacuate. I took some video that you may have seen already of Front Street when it really kind of exploded in fire, and then I evacuated. I grabbed some people I saw on the street who didn't seem to have a good plan. And I had told them, get your stuff, get in my truck, get in line. And there's only one road that leads out of Lahaina, so, obviously, it was backed up. But that's okay. We made it through. And I dropped everybody else off and then I went to a place in another part of Maui that's far away. And as soon as I got there, that whole area had to evacuate because of a totally different fire in Kula that was, I guess, heading down toward -- I was in Maui Meadows near Wailea, if you have a map. And all of a sudden, just as I arrived, that whole area got evacuated. So, now, I'm in a totally different part of Maui in a rain forest because I figured that was enough, and I'm safe here at least from a fire evacuation because it's a rain forest.",

The winds started overnight and there wasn't any real warning about this. So, there was -- sometimes there's a warning about an upcoming storm. Certainly, we get lots of hurricane warnings about hurricanes that will come close, but not hit us, but nothing like that. And the thing about this wind is it was a lot of gusts, 40 or 50 miles an hour, and this is in the middle of the night, because things were breaking, branches were coming down. And I went outside at one point and I had trouble standing up against the wind, but it was gusty. It wasn't a constant wind. And it was hot. That's the other thing. I've never seen a hot wind like this. It's called a wind but I've never experienced one where it felt in my house when the wind blew and a little bit of wind came into the room, it felt like there was a heater because we don't have heaters. So, it was a weird sensation, and I've been here for 24 years, never had that here before. So, this is different.",

But look at Kansas, a red state, 59 percent. Look at Montana, a red state, 53 percent, Kentucky, another red state where the pro-abortion rights side one. And that, to me, is not surprising given what we saw in our CNN poll yesterday, disapprove of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, 63 percent of voters overall, the vast majority of Democrats at 93 percent. Look at independents, 69 percent. Boy, wouldn't that be a nice percentage for Joe Biden to get in 2024?

The memo was written by Lawyer Kenneth Chesebro. He's listed as co- conspirator number 5 in the election interference indictment.

It's this idea that they wanted to make clear to the public that whatever they were doing was sort of the natural order of business. And that itself, I think, could come in as evidence sort of how exactly how controversial it was, that they needed to present to the public how routine it was or at least that they thought it was routine.

And so that's how they're going to frame it.It's an open question that will have to be sorted out at court, but that's how he sort of steps away from it saying, just, look, I'm putting it out there, this is what lawyers do, and we'll see what happens.",
