That came as a surprise to many, considering that Xi has never missed a G20 summit before.Now let's go right to CNN's Kevin Liptak, who's standing by for us in New Delhi. Kevin, the Foreign Minister in India said that the global crises facing this bloc are far more difficult, far more complicated and more worrisome than it's been for a long time. Given that and the fact that the divisions within the G20 are so sharp right now, what can President Biden hope to achieve?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's no doubt that the G20 is at a fractured moment when it comes to Ukraine. When it comes to how to confront China. And President Biden's real objective when he comes over here is not necessarily to paper all over all of those divisions. That would basically be impossible. But really to provide the developing world, an alternative to China. To convince these countries that the United States can be a better partner and he does have an opening on that front.As you said, President Xi Jinping will not be here in New Delhi for this summit. It is a lost opportunity in some ways. You'll remember at last year's G20 in Bali, President Biden and President Xi met for several hours. There's no chance of that happening here. But the president's advisors do believe that he has an opening here. To tell the world that the United States is here for the developing world and he does come armed with certain proposals to reform institutions like the World Bank. To provide hundreds of billions of dollars more in loans to the developing world. The United States says that this is not necessarily about China, but they do say that that this is an opportunity to provide better lending practices to some of the world's most vulnerable populations. Of course, the war in Ukraine is also looming over this summit. And in the lead up to President Biden's arrival, we're told that diplomats are working furiously behind the scenes to come up with some sort of language in a joint communique. Condemning the war in Ukraine. But remember, Russia is also a member of the G20. So how much these diplomats will be able to do remains to be seen. And it is a possibility that a communique does not emerge from this summit. Which would be a major disappointment for the man at the center of these talks, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. He is hoping to use this summit to bolster his reputation as a global statesman. And it has been remarkable as you drive around New Delhi, his face is plastered on billboards, on signs, you really can't walk 10 feet without seeing him. President Biden's first order of business when he arrives here in India later today, will be a meeting with Prime Minister Modi at his residence here in New Delhi.",

      "sentences": "President Biden sets off for the G20 summit in India, blinking warning signs for his reelection prospects here in the United States. A new CNN poll shows a 39 percent approval rating for the president. When you look into those numbers, there are dramatic signs of challenges across the board. Let's take a look at some of those numbers.On his approval rating. In that number, 39 percent approve, 61 percent disapprove, largely based on the economy. Some 58 percent of Americans believe the Biden policies have worsened the economic conditions here in the United States. That certainly is not something that the administration has been hoping for. They believe their policies from the infrastructure bill, to lowering prescription drug prices, to the Inflation Reduction Act would certainly be a calling card for his reelection. But with inflation still higher than most people would like, this certainly is a challenge for him. Now one other alarming number, 67 percent of Democrats say they would like a different candidate. When asked, 33 percent of Democrats say that they prefer President Biden as the candidate, but 2/3, 67 percent say they would like a different candidate. Of course, there are no other major Democratic candidates in this race. That is likely one of the biggest benefits for the president that he does not face a stiff primary challenge. But that number is striking in terms of the satisfaction with the president. Now going into the concerns. When asked this open-ended question, age was the reasoning among Democratic voters for why they want to move on to someone else. 49 percent of respondents listed age as the concern, 7 percent said mental sharpness, 7 percent said health, ability to do the job and 6 percent electability popularity. But that age number, 49 percent certainly hangs over everything. Now the economic conditions, of course, 58 percent say the policies have worsened it, but that is something, of course, the White House believes that they can turn around. They believe this is something through advertising and just messaging and explaining to the American people what his policies have done. They believe that is something that can be turned around. But when you look at the choice for President, of course, this is not a done deal yet. Former President Donald Trump is still very much in a robust primary of his own. But 47 percent say they support Donald Trump, 46 percent say they support to President Biden. Of course, that's within the margin of error, no clear leader. But one thing is clear in this deeply divided country, a pessimistic mood hangs over the economy, hangs over the country. That means President Biden is in for a very challenging reelection year ahead. Jeff Zeleny, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
