And I think that disconnect, as you saw in the obviously sign and everything else you said they live in a bubble and in a world in which what they're selling the Hispanic community is not buying. Hispanics want secure borders. Hispanics want economic opportunity. Hispanics don't want to be called Latinx.Hispanics want their cultures to be celebrated and respected. They don't want to be pandered to. They want to be Americans. And I think one issue that you constantly see is Hispanics want illegal immigration. It is not true. There are 1 million green card holders who come into this country every single year legally. The people who come into the country legally and ultimately become citizens vote in elections. Those who come into the country illegally do not. So the people who have to go through all this trouble to get to the United States of America the right way to pay taxes. When they go to vote, and they see the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City filled with people who did everything incorrectly and came to this country illegally, it really upsets them more than anyone else because they know the difficulty in the process to come to this country the right way. And I think the disconnect is people think because you are Hispanic, you therefore want lawlessness and you therefore want an open border. The truth couldn't be any further from that.",

The weaponization of government as much as people think defending it wasn't weaponization, you've never seen in the history of American politics, a prosecutor from Georgia bringing a state criminal case after meeting in the White House with the political opponent. No one could defend that. Why would a state case -- why would they even need to go to the White House in order to meet with White House general counsel on indicting a former president on a state case? So I think the weaponization of government, the complete abuse and the constant telling people what they should do. People are smart, people are intelligent, people are free.

If you watch all his history, it's the slap effect, right? It's really going after people.But what wasn't a joke was when Joe Biden called, with his own words, Trump supporters garbage. That's really how he felt. That's how he felt about Trump supporters. So the sort of thing that a -- not -- he's not even a surrogate, a comedian makes a joke, whether you agree or disagree, whether you find it funny or you don't, it's not attributed to the campaign, is definitely not attributed to the president. And conversely, Joe Biden, his own words tells people that they're garbage. So I think the media spun it out thinking that this is going to push people away. They're going to overlook the open borders, they're going to overlook failed economies, they're going to overlook inflation, they're going to overlook the Latinx. They're overlooking everything, women and men's sports.

The 2024 race long ago turned into the boys versus girls election, with polls showing Harris performing significantly better among women and Trump among men. But the question was, how big will the gender gap actually be? Well, we all know now it was big enough to hand Donald Trump the presidency. More than half of the male vote nationwide, 55 percent went to Trump, 42 percent to Harris.Men under 30 saw a dramatic shift from supporting Democrats in 2020 by a 15 percentage point margin to swinging back to the GOP by 13 points. A CNN exit poll also found men under 30 in Pennsylvania favored Trump by 21 points. In 2020, Biden won that same group by nine points. A part of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign strategy involved using hypermasculine voices like Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock, UFC CEO Dana White. Democrats may have miscalculated the strength and importance in appealing to men on their party's website under the headline Who We Serve, Democrats showed a diverse list of minority groups, including LGBTQ, Americans with disabilities, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, women, many other communities, no mention of men.

And let's look at some of the stats, 40 years ago the average age of the first time homebuyer was 36. Today it's 54. Pre pandemic the average home was $290,000. Post pandemic it's 420 with an acceleration interest rates, you're looking at the average mortgage has gone from $11,00 to $2200. Forty years ago two thirds of people under the age of thirty had a home, 60 percent had a child. Have all of a sudden young people opted out of having a home and a child? Or maybe they just can't afford it.And unfortunately the Democrats weren't able to square the circle of the fact that the economy is actually quite good. And some of Trump's policies, whether it be deficit spending or tariffs, will likely result in more inflation and greater interest rates and taxation on the young. But they weren't able to communicate that. They -- in the podcast medium can't be understated here, Michael, because some of the offensive things that we Democrats thought that joke is offensive. The Zeitgeist and podcasts is it softens people. Podcast hosts aren't looking for a got you moment. They generally want to present the individual in their best light. And it's more got the vibe of can't you take a joke? And if you look at the nine of the top 10 podcasts, eight of they lean right and Trump went on six of them. One -- I mean, there's going to be a lot of forensics here. But not acknowledging the struggles of young men as a broader theme will be a very big issue when we look at the autopsy that failed Harris campaign.

The short answer to that question is, I don't think so. I think team Trump will come in and put more pressure on the Europeans to get their defense spending up to two percent minimum. Twenty-three of the 32 nations have hit that mark. That is pretty good. It is getting better but there will be a lot of pressure.
