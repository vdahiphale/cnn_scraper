It was also, of course, the initial message two months ago after the first attempt on Donald Trump's life. But in the two days since the second apparent assassination attempt against Trump, the calls for unity have already given way to partisan finger- pointing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Know it's popular on a lot of corners of the left to say that we have - we have a both sides problem. And I'm not going to say we're always perfect. I'm not going to say that conservatives always get things exactly right. But you know the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we have - no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months.

Vance is, no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris. Would he want that? Why would you say that in a time when we're talking about bringing down the temperature and changing the eric and bringing the country together, unity, moving forward. We can disagree on policies, but we don't want anyone to have an assassination attempt. And so hearing some of the conversation on the other side after these attempts is - I don't get it. We should be, number one, members of Congress should be working on passing a budget that we should be doing, but we also are in the middle of this campaign cycle where talking about threats to democracy is not saying that I'm calling for someone to have threats against them.I'm a black woman in politics from the deep south. I understand the threats that I get when I had to very early on in my congressional career get personal security that I had to figure out how to pay for because I wanted my family safe. And so to hear something like this is something that we need to address in a way to get our leaders especially running for the highest offices to understand that they too are part of the problem. HUNT: Congresswoman, what do you - and I'm glad you raised your own personal experience because this has become something in modern times that is a much more acute issue for members of Congress, not just people that - at the highest offices. Obviously, we've seen political violence throughout our nation's history. But the tenor right now seems to be particularly acute. What is your diagnosis for why that is?",

And there are a lot of people who will here code words and they'll act on them. That's why it is important for leaders to understand that their words have power.So, saying something like, no one has attempted to assassinate another candidate is not OK, because that shouldn't happen to any candidate. It shouldn't happen to anyone running for mayor, for city council, for Congress, or president of the United States. This is the United States of America. And if we can't have leaders who at the bare minimum are understanding that no one should be the subject of political violence, then that's a problem.",

But the most important person on the face of the earth, many people would say, is the president of the United States. And what he or she decides to do affects the lives of almost everybody.So, I tried to go back and interview some of the former presidents and some of the current presidents as well. I mean I interviewed Joe Biden. I interviewed Donald Trump. And their view and reverence for the office is quite amazing. Even though they have political spats from time to time, they really agreed that what they can do as president of the United States really can change people's lives for the better.

Obviously, you spoke with Biden and Trump, who are - Biden currently president, obviously Trump vying to be president again. Bush's interview with you was in some ways - I thought in some ways more revealing than some of the others, in part because of that distance that he has. And he said this when you asked him - you talked about populism. He said, quote, \"you wonder why populism is on the rise. It starts with taking taxpayers' money, giving it to the powerful. It really irritated a lot of Americans and they haven't gotten over it yet.\" He is talking about the bailout for banks here. And then he goes on to say, \"we've had candidates say, you're mad, I'm going to make you madder, as opposed to, you're mad. I have solutions to make you less mad.

But from what I've read from others and from Maggie Haberman, it seemed as if his father was a domineering figure and really instilled in him the importance of always winning and not admitting defeat.Donald Trump is a unusual person to become president of the United States. The only person who had never had any government experience who became president of the United States. And so he didn't have a background that some other people had. But the amazing thing about Donald Trump, when you think about it is, he's been the nominee of his party three times in a row. And no other person's ever been nominated three times in a row by the Republican Party. So, while we can make fun of many things he's done, and people criticize him, and I understand that criticism, he does have the ability to rally his troops and he does have the ability to be the nominee of the party three times in a row. And I think even now we don't know what the outcome of the election is going to be. But the main thing I really wanted to do with this book was to say to people, vote. We have 80 million people in this country who could vote legally but don't vote. We how about 160 million people who do vote, but 80 million people don't vote. About a third of the electorate don't vote. And I just hope that people will learn more about the presidency, get interested in it, as I have been, and vote because it's 49 days away and I want people to really go out and vote.",

The Secret Service is now being asked about one of the world's wealthiest men, Elon Musk, the owner of the platform formerly known as Twitter, of course it is now called X, following the apparent assassination attempt on Sunday. One user of his social media site asking, why do they want to kill Donald Trump? Musk then responded saying this, quote, \"and no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.\" Musk added the thinking face emoji. After a swift backlash, Musk deleted that post and followed up saying basically it was just a joke. He said, quote, \"well, one lesson I've learned is that just because I say something to a group and they laugh doesn't mean it's all going to be - it's going to be all that hilarious as a post on X,\" and, quote, \"turns out that jokes are way less funny if people don't know the context and the delivery is plain text,\" end quote. Yes, OK. The White House called Musk's deleted post irresponsible. Asked by CNN, the Secret Service said they were, quote, \"aware of the social media post made by Elon Musk and as a matter of practice, we do not comment on matters involving protective intelligence.
