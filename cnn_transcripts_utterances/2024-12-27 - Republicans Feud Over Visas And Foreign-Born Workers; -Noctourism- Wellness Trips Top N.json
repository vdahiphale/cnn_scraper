In one corner you have the DOGE leaders, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are defending Silicon Valley for bringing in foreign engineers. In a long post on X, Ramaswamy wrote in part, \"The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy and wrong explanation. It's rather a key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math Olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.\" Ramaswamy goes on to blame '90s sitcoms like \"BOY MEETS WORLD\" and other media for celebrating average, saying we need less of this -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN SAVAGE, ACTOR, \"BOY MEETS WORLD\":  This is me, Mr. Average.

But this latest among his base -- frankly, at times on the campaign trail President-elect Trump seemed to hit -- hint, rather, I should say, at backing both sides of this argument.

REESE GORMAN, POLITICAL REPORTER, NOTUS (via Webex by Cisco):  This is kind of just your kind of normal MAGA civil war that we've been seeing just a little bit throughout since the campaign started. People fighting for control. You saw Loomer always tends to be in the middle of this.

I mean, when you're dealing with such a wide variety of issues and matters, particularly controversial hot button issues, you're going to have some disagreements.But something I think this lends the conversation to and it's something recent I and our colleagues up on Capitol Hill were curious about as well during the government funding drama of previous weeks was how much does Elon Musk talk for President-elect Donald Trump? We saw the whole situation with the government funding bill that Elon Musk first came out against, and that led to President-elect Donald Trump. There was a lot of curiosity among reporters of should we take Elon Musk's stance on something to understand that is where Donald Trump is coming from? And I think that this situation with immigration that we're seeing play out right now -- as Reese mentioned, this MAGA civil war -- lends itself to that conversation of does one thing Elon Musk say -- does that mean that President-elect Trump is leaning in that direction or moving towards that direction on that particular issue or topic? Now, the answer to that question remains to be seen. It could be determined on a case-by-case basis. But this just also leads to the conversation of we're in such an interesting situation right now where we have somebody so prominent like Elon Musk who has such a place at the table and such a strong voice in various conversations despite the fact that, of course, he was not elected president. And we're hearing that from a lot of folks who say I voted for Donald Trump for president and not Elon Musk for president. So this is just the latest example of this fascinating dynamic that we're seeing play out between Trump and Musk as we enter the Trump administration that we're going to have to continue to keep an eye on because it doesn't look like it's going to subside anytime soon.",

I mean, she kind of did herself in. And so she really has to find a way and she really found her way by just being who she is and saying her policies.She's not beholden trying to please Trump or please whoever. And you see this. I mean, you see some of the policies she comes out for Trump would never come out for because they're too moderate. They're a little bit more to the left of Trump. And then here we are -- she's doing -- she's siding with a more further right version of the Republican Party. She's really just kind of -- and I think it's just a testament to her is she's just not beholden to try to please anybody because she lost her race for the presidency. She really can't -- well, I won't say can't but likely will not be able to kind of win in a Republican primary in this day and age. And so she really just is able to speak her mind.

Sometimes we see folks on the ultra-right and the ultra-left join forces and agree with various matters. Yes, I think that this is very possibly an example of what we may see in the looming Trump administration, but I also expect things to remain very partisan. We're currently in a moment of high partisanship, high ideological differences. We've seen that play out on a number of different occasions, and I don't suspect that will change.
