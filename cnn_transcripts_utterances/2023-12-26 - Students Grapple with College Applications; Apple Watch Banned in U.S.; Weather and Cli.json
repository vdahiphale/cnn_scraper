So, the companies have been back and forth and we can show you on your screen just sort of what models this applies to. The companies have been back and forth about this issue for years.Fast forward to late October. That's when the U.S., as you said, International Trade Commission, stepped in and essentially sided with that California-based company, Masimo. And so that ruling takes effect today because the Biden administration did not intervene here. So, what this means is that, if you're looking for one of those models, one of those newer models of the Apple watch, if you're trying to get it directly from Apple, you might have a hard time. You can, however, get it from some of the other retailers who may still have it on their shelves until they run out. Now, the impact to Apple, which is, of course, is the big question, it's a huge, massive company, may not be as much as you think. I spoke to Dan Ives within the hour. He's been covering this stock for the last 15 years or so. And I asked him, hey, what is the impact to Apple? And he said it's not significant. He said, \"we estimate it to be $200 million to $300 million in lost revenue.\" He called it more of a PR black eye than a financial black eye. $200 million to $300 million. Listen, still a lot of money but not a lot of money for Apple. But he said this is more about the optics. It's not a good look when you're accused of essentially stealing someone else's technology.

I mean it's sort of like -- I think it was Axelrod who said early on that folks prefer the real thing versus DeSantis, which was the light Trump. And so he's appealing to the base, but it really hurts with moderates. It really hurts with, you know, swing voters for sure. And, you know, I can remember when I was in the congress, and I retired earlier this year, that so many people said, you know, I like what he's doing on the economy, but why doesn't he just end -- drop his cell phone into a bucket of water with some of these tweets? So, it shows that he's not going away. He's doing the same type of nasty, you know, name calling that he did during his four years in office that really hurt him in the '20 election. Man, if he had done a couple of things right, if he hadn't gone after John McCain, maybe he would have won Arizona. If he hadn't gone against John Lewis, maybe he would have won Georgia. If he hadn't gone against John Dingell, trashing him, maybe he would have won Michigan again, even though the vote difference was 150,000 votes versus when he had won it back four years before. So, he's not going away. And, you know, you look at the rhetoric, he's telling people to go to hell that don't agree with him, it -- the base loves it, particularly in Iowa, let's face it.

They say that these agencies are promising individuals travel to the United States but instead they are connecting them to smugglers south of the border. Now, one of the nationalities that's being targeted is the Senegalese, which makes this video that I'm about to show you make a lot of sense. We recently took this video in Arizona. Take a look.

We're not seeing 1,000 or more than 1,000 migrants behind me waiting to be transported for immigration processing. A senior CBP official telling me that while the scene has changed, the agency is not out of the woods yet. We've learned from non-profit organizations all along the border that hundreds of migrants are being transported to those areas from Eagle Pass to decompress. [09:00:04] We learned from Catholic Charities in the Rio Grande Valley that last week officials were transporting about 350 migrants per day. And, Poppy and Phil, the organization there tells me that now they're receiving about 550 per day. That just gives you a sense of the number of migrants who continue to pour into the U.S. southern border.",
