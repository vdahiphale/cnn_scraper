Whether it's a tragic mistake, or whether it was deliberate or careless, we don't know yet. That's -- that is the truth. But when we have the court making an order to withdraw from Rafah when we have a court ordering Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid is reaching civilians in Gaza, and we want to see tangible effects on the ground.

That doesn't lead to the imposition of as it says conditions of life, and so on.So there has been a little bit of argument about that. But look, I tend to fall on the side that it's fairly straightforward. And I think when you're dealing with questions of civilian or sub life, it's better to be safe than sorry. It's very difficult to conduct a major military operation without significant civilian loss of life. And the court has previously certainly independent judges have said separate judges and separate opinions have said that it's almost impossible to follow through with the rest of the court's orders, which is to allow adequate humanitarian aid without withdrawing military offensives. So it's certainly going to be difficult to fulfill the court's orders, while still engaged in military action.",

And it has the ability to encourage Israel to even pressure Israel to cease its military offensive in Gaza.If the U.S. were to either not veto, it doesn't have to vote in favor of resolution, it can just sit out the resolution, it can abstain. And that's what it did earlier this year with the Ramadan resolution, then that would be an enormous step forward allowing the U.N. Security Council to make orders that would be potentially binding on Israel. And then the further steps can be taken that states can be asked to implement countermeasures, economic sanctions, other ways of putting pressure on Israel, to step back from what it's currently doing.",

The death toll from a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv has risen to 18, making it the deadliest attack on Ukraine in weeks. Almost 200 people were inside a hardware mega store when it was hit. Five people remain unaccounted for. Ukraine's interior minister says the hours following the strike were hellish.
