      "sentences": "Well, Fani Willis survives, but this case is playing out in two very different courts. One is the court of law and the other, the court of public opinion, tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.All right, so now we know the answer to the question we've been waiting months to actually find out. Fani Willis is not disqualified from prosecuting Donald Trump and his co-defendants. But the judge, he didn't just issue a ruling. Judge McAfee issued an ultimatum. Either she goes or Nathan Wade goes. Nathan Wade went. And if you thought Robert Hur's one line throwing some shade at President Biden was savage, well, Judge McAfee's order hardly had any sunlight when it came to Willis and Wade, although there were moments that he recognized that the burden had not been met to show that they, in fact, had a conflict of interest that made a fair trial impossible. And there was one particular quote. \"Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices -- even repeatedly.\" All the scrutiny of Fani Willis and Nathan Wade and their relationship, who lived where, when, who paid for what, how and all it went down, it all threatens to overshadow a scrutiny of what this case is actually about. Let me remind you for a second because we've already been through the hearing and the trial about the personal. Now how about what is alleged in the indictment? The alleged efforts by the then president of the United States and his co-defendants to overturn the 2020 election of one President Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it didn't seem like she wasn't on trial during those hearings, but she is prosecuting now in this trial.So why is that distinction so important? Well, look, the court of public opinion is weighing her relationship with Nathan Wade. They're also weighing this decision by the judge. And now, they're weighing her credibility in this extremely consequential case. That's the court of public opinion. Meanwhile, a jury in the court of law will weigh the charges against Donald Trump and 14 co-defendants. Four of them, by the way, of the original 18, they've already pleaded guilty. Now, the charges, they include filing false documents, violation of the Georgia RICO Act, conspiracy and influencing witnesses. So, the question tonight, of course, is which case will weigh heavier in those scales of justice? Because if Lady Justice is blind, well, she certainly heard a whole lot. Did she not? I want to talk now to Tiffany Wright. I'm so glad that you are here because in this ruling today, Judge Scott McAfee called Fani Willis' testimony at one point dramatic and, of course, unprofessional. And I say the words, of course, only because I'm recalling what he said, not attributing that to truth. But when you saw all of this play out, Tiffany, you know, I don't know about you, but my chats were going off, watching the trial, watching the testimony, remembering all that was going on. How did you see this judge's approach to evaluating this? TIFFANY R. WRIGHT, FORMER LAW CLERK FOR JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR:  I thought his comment about her performance during the hearing being unprofessional was interesting. In one sense, I can't say I disagreed with that. Watching it in isolation, it may come across that way. But I think we should apply the same standards to similar conduct.",

Who you are determines how you saw this, right? And I did see people who saw it one way, said this is an unprofessional woman, how dare she speak this way. And then for me, though, as a Black woman, having been called unprofessional or being combative when I'm just being assertive and defending myself, that's what I saw in it. And so, I want to separate the bad choices, and I think we all can agree that there were some bad choices here. As a lawyer, you should not engage in sexual relationships with people who are connected in your cases in any way. So, she has to take the mea culpa on that. In the other sense, she was hauled before a court, forced to answer questions about her personal relationships when the core of the legal claim was really always ridiculous. She did not have a financial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of this or in the way it was handled. That's what Mr. Trump would have had to prove in order to win his legal claim. All of the other parts of it was a little bit of theatrics.",

Well, do our jurors agree and do they think race or gender played a role?We've got four jurors here, every day Americans, meeting tonight for the first time to share their opinions with each other and, of course, with you. Now, this is not a court of law. Our jurors are not rendering a verdict, but they will tell us what they think of today's ruling and give us some insight and a window into the court of public opinion. I'm glad that you're all here today. Thank you so much. Let me begin because the judge did say to Fani Willis that she could stay on the case or not disqualify, but that came at a cost, the removal of Nathan Wade. By a show of hands, which of you agreed with the decision for her not to be disqualified? All of you. So, let's unpack that a little bit more here as to why. Well, when you think about the reasoning why this judge said so, they said they did not meet the bar of proving that there was going to be a prejudice against the defendants. What was the most important aspect to you evaluating it? Juror four, you're nodding your head. LAKISHA GREENWADE, JUROR, LAURA'S COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION:  Well, when we look at this case, who's really on trial at the end of the day?

Felipe Santos and Terrsnce Williams. Both vanished from Naples, Florida and both vanished along the same road. And guess what? Both vanished after getting in a patrol car driven by the same white deputy sheriff. Both are believed to be dead.Twenty years later, that deputy sheriff, a man by the name of Steve Calkins, remains the last person to see either of those men alive. Now, he maintains his innocence. The cold case was little known until Tyler Perry and civil rights attorney Ben Crump teamed up to file a wrongful death suit against Calkins in 2018. But now, on a new episode of \"The Whole Story\" this Sunday night, I dig into the case along with CNN's Thomas Lake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He didn't notify dispatch that he was transporting someone from one location to another. The timeline of when he said it occurred versus the independent witnesses, all of that appeared that he was not being truthful about the encounter between Terrance Williams and himself.COATES (voice-over):  Those inconsistencies surfaced during a months- long internal investigation. Corporal Calkins took three polygraph tests during the probe. One of those tests indicated deception. Marcia, there was a time when Calkins was interviewed. I want to play this for you in this meeting. CPL. STEVEN CALKINS (voice-over):  I may have broken a couple rules, but I have broken no laws. I feel that this agency needs to stand a little bit taller here. I'm not going be dragged through the mud no more because a couple of scumbags are missing. Is this being recorded?",
