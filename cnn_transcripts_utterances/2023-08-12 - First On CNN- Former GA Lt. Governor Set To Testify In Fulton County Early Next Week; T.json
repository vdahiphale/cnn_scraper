But I think that there are other people that she's also going to be looking at.Obviously, Donald Trump, who is at the heart of this, I think she's going to be looking at a couple of the people who served as fake electors who did not take immunity deals. So, David Shafer, the Republican Party Chairman, there is probably pretty high on that list. She's going to look at people who were involved in harassment campaigns against election officials, and then people who were involved in this breach in Coffee County, Georgia where a voting system was compromised there.

Have someone literally read the transcript of what transpired in the other grand jury.The fact that they're calling live witnesses suggests to me that they may have some additional questions that came up during the course of their investigation. After all, the district attorney has been trying to negotiate as you pointed out a moment ago, some immunity deals, for example. Some of the fake electors. So, what they're going to be doing now, putting evidence in front of the grand jury, there's no other side there, there's no defense asking, you know, difficult questions or cross examining those witnesses. And so, as a result, the prosecution is going to put on his case. There are no rules of evidence that govern that. I would expect the grand jury to return an indictment.

I've done it myself personally, it is very, very challenging to represent a client who's facing criminal indictment on multiple fronts. Because while the prosecutor in this case, Fani Willis, and her team can focus like a laser on the -- what they need to do to get a conviction, Trump's team has to balance a bunch of different competing concerns.In other words, if he makes a decision in this case, that can impact the other cases. The indictment she brings could have an impact, for example, on witnesses who might testify elsewhere. So, definitely a challenge for his team. They've got a very compressed schedule to try to, you know, prepare for trial on multiple fronts. Also, this is an indictment that, you know, Trump cannot easily do away with, if he gets elected president. There's a pardon process in Georgia. That would not involve certainly the President of the United States. Wouldn't even involve directly the governor of Georgia. So, you know, there'll be a part and board that he essentially go to. He couldn't -- and the attorney general of the United States who might be appointed by a future President Trump couldn't get rid of that investigation directly. So that's one challenge. And this is also unlike that Manhattan case which is also not a federal case. This involves the core conduct in his presidency. This is truly charging him with this conduct wall president. And historic indictment. The first state indictment, charging a President of the United States with trying to subvert an election, trying to subvert the constitutional process and the peaceful transfer of power. So, it's a historic indictment. It's going to be a big challenge. And it's just yet another thing for Trump's defense team to try to deal with.",

There's all these other people who are unindicted coconspirators. People like oh, I don't know, Rudy Giuliani, Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, these sort of crooked lawyers, but they were not charged. There's one defendant in the courtroom that is Donald Trump.Here, it, you know, based on the reporting, it sounds like there may be a dozen people charged. What does that mean? Well, first of all, there's potential flippers, there's potential people who are going to flip and cooperate against Trump. In addition, these people may ultimately be witnesses in another case.

There was an incident yesterday that caused a lot of angst. People lined up for miles for hours, they open the highway and closed it because some are parking their cars and walking into the Lahaina just as cadaver dog teams which are finding remains. So they shut the highway down again, which frustrated everybody in line. There was a traffic fatality at the same time. So it's just one thing after another for Maui officials.

The program would be part of a broader funding request, that's according to a Homeland Security official. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, joining us now. And Priscilla, this could likely set up a battle with congressional Republicans.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Jessica, and it was already part of a supplemental that was expected to create those tensions. This is a bigger funding request for Ukraine, for disasters, and also for border management.Now of that $40 billion, $2.2 billion would be for border management operations according to a breakdown from the White House. Now, the Department of Homeland Security wants to use some of those funds, if approved, to set up new facilities that would be for migrant families. This is a very vulnerable population, one that this administration like others have grappled with. And what these new facilities would do is provide a place to put migrant families as they go through expedited asylum and deportation proceedings and allow them to go in and out, but then also remain there overnight. So this is a new concept. We have not seen this before. Officials say that it is not family detention that has come under fierce criticism before, it is a policy that the Biden administration ended in the first days of him entering office, and then one that when they considered reviving, they faced fierce criticism from their allies and Democratic lawmakers. Now, in a statement, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson tells me the following: \"This supplemental package will allow DHS to fund temporary housing facilities and services to manage families through the immigration process quickly and facilitate the removal for those who do not have a legal basis to stay.\" Now, Jessica, I have been talking to officials who say that they are monitoring an uptake of migrant families crossing the US-Mexico border. A few months ago, remember, we were talking about a potential crisis. That did not come to fruition in the way that the administration thought it might after the end of a pandemic-era COVID restriction ended, but they have started to see an uptick in these numbers, and again, it being a vulnerable population, they are seeing what tools in the toolbox they have to at least try to mitigate that early and trying to manage the weeks to come -- Jessica.",

Priscilla Alvarez at the White House for us, thanks so much for that reporting.And still ahead tonight, a group of teenagers who were able to hack into some of the world's biggest tech companies. The Department of Homeland Security says this should be a wake-up call. That's ahead. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:47:51] DEAN: A wake-up call after a group of teenage hackers were able to break into some of the world's biggest companies. The Department of Homeland Security led a review into how the group managed to breach Microsoft, Samsung, and others, and what the review found is that in general, it's far too easy for the cyber criminals in this case, teenagers to gain access. Glenn Gerstell, is a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies as well as a former general counsel with the NSA. Glenn, great to have you with us. First off, how did these teenagers pull this off? And how concerned should we be that they were able to do it pretty easily?",

This was a combination of just old-fashioned fraud and scams, coupled with rather sophisticated technical abilities, but it shows that despite all the complexities and safeguards we have in our computer networks, they remain vulnerable. They are globally vulnerable.This was a group of teenagers in England and Brazil, who as you said were able to attack everything from Samsung in Korea to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and they did it in essence, through stealing phone identities. The very same technique that enables you to take your current phone and upgrade it to a new phone with a new SIM card, so to speak, is exactly the vulnerability that they exploited. So that when you log into a lot of website, and you get a text message that says we want to confirm it's really you and so-called multi- factor authentication, they were able to get that message diverted to their phones instead of the real users' phones. So it was a combination of sophistication, as well as old-fashioned scamming.",

There's no doubt that in 2020 and 2021, we were experiencing waves of attacks, the SolarWinds attacks, the Colonial Pipelines attacks, ransomware attacks every day in the newspapers about everything from school districts to companies and so there's no doubt that the problem got out of hand.And I think over the last couple of years, the Biden administration and the cybersecurity community working together have made some big strides in this area, and I think the frequency of some of these attacks is reduced, hopefully, we're getting a little better. But the reality is, it's complex and it is in fact going to take a long time. The good news is, as a technical matter, we know how to do this. This is not a mystery disease. We know how to solve this. It is going to take time and money and unfortunately, in the meantime, we're going to have to endure some attacks.",
