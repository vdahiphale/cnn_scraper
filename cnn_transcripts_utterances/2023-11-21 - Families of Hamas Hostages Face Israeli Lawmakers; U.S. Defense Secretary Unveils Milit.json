Emotions were running high when some met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet for the first time since Hamas' attack on October 7th.Family members also attended a committee meeting in the Israeli parliament as they urge Israeli officials to do more to free the hostages taken more than 40 days ago. Now this comes as Hamas now claims it's close to reaching a truce agreement with Israel. U.S. officials also say negotiators are closing in on a deal to release some of the hostages Hamas abducted on October 7th. But they caution the details are still being worked out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL COMMUNICATIONS COORDINATOR: And we believe we're closer than we've ever been. So were hopeful, but there still work to be done and nothing is done until is all done. We are laser-focused on the American citizens that we know are being held hostage and we want them out, all of them, everybody should be out now. But here we are in a negotiation and we're getting closer to the end we believe of that negotiation so again I'm going to be careful. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, it seems like those negotiations are potentially soon bearing fruit. There are positive signs coming from the Qataris, from Hamas, from the Americans, and the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with hostage families yesterday says that he told them that it is his sacred and supreme mission to get those hostages released. You also have the Red Cross saying that it is ready to implement any deal that might be agreed upon on the ground to actually get people out.The broad parameters of the deal, which we know from U.S. sources, would involve releasing a number of hostages from Gaza. 50 is the latest number according to a draft proposal in exchange for an unknown number of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails over the course of four or five days of a pause in fighting. There could be more hostages from Gaza released if that pause is extended, but nothing is ever simple in Israel. You mentioned some of the families met with a committee of the Israeli Knesset yesterday. Among the lawmakers was the national security minister, a hardline far right politician who believes that the Palestinian territories should be annexed. And that meeting got extremely tense and extremely heated. And I want to play a clip for you. It's not translated, but trust me, you don't need to speak Hebrew to understand the high emotions inside that room. Listen. (VIDEO PLAYING) So part of the reason for those high emotions inside that room is that the National Security Minister is pushing legislation that would hand down the death penalty to terrorists and that may be all well and good under normal circumstances, but under these circumstances, hostage families believe that could potentially put their families in greater danger. And I want to play you a clip from one of those hostage family members. His name is Hen Avigdori. He, his daughter and his wife are currently held hostage in Gaza and here's what he told the committee. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HEN AVIGDORI, HUSBAND AND FATHER OF HOSTAGES (translated): I want my child back home, it's very simple, not to satisfy any enemy. I want my girl back home. This discussion to my understanding and my view is risking the lives of Jews, and instead talking about death, which was the most frequent word in this discussion, talk about life, 239 living hostages. Get them out and then talk about destroying, death penalty, anything you want. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Scott McLean, joining us live from Istanbul, many thanks.Well more than 12,700 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks on Gaza since the start of the war, that is according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank. The ministry, which gets its data from sources inside Hamas-controlled territory, says more than 5,000 of those killed were children. Now, Gaza residents are facing the threat of bad weather and sickness, making the enclave barely livable, as the U.N. aid agency operating in Gaza warns. CNN's Nada Bashir has more. And a warning, her report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Darkness and destruction inside northern Gaza's Indonesian hospital. Twelve killed here overnight including patients and a member of medical staff when Israeli tank fire hit the hospital, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run strip. The Israeli military says they were responding to gunfire from inside, targeting their troops. But the civilian toll has been condemned by the U.N.'s World Health Organization chief, describing the attack as appalling. For civilians in central Gaza, Monday morning brought with it more devastation. Local residents say this building was struck overnight, blaming Israel's ongoing aerial bombardment of the region. Locals here say more than a dozen were killed, now buried beneath the rubble. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment and allegations of an overnight airstrike on the neighborhood. Amid the rubble, bodies are pulled out one by one carefully wrapped in blankets. UNKNOWN (through translator): The building collapsed on top of 30 people. Many were killed and there are still people buried under the rubble right now. BASHIR (voice-over): The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas, but with each passing day, more civilians are killed. Among the victims on Monday, a young girl, carried away by a neighbor, killed alongside her father, a doctor at the nearby Al Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. This is not a war anymore. This is genocide, he says. This scene now all too familiar, even for the young. Many here are from northern Gaza, taking shelter in this embattled town, hoping to move southwards. The U.N. says hundreds of thousands have already fled northern Gaza. Many seen here over the weekend waving makeshift white flags, the injured chaining behind. It is a long and difficult journey. Many are exhausted and distraught. MOHAMED AL-SHAHID, DISPLACED JABALYA RESIDENT: We will die if we stay. One minute we will die. Many rockets fall on our heads. BASHIR (voice-over): Mohamed says his daughter was injured following an airstrike on a school they were sheltering in the northern city of Jabalia. Now they are hoping they will find some semblance of peace in the south. But even here, in the very place Israel is telling civilians to evacuate to, there is no escape. And as the weather begins to turn, the situation is growing more dire with each passing day. This family from Jabalia now sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis, making do with what little they have left. RANDA HAMUD, DISPLACED JABALYA RESIDENT (through translator): Yesterday was very difficult. Our tents flew away, the rain came down on us, we were drenched. We just want an end to the war. BASHIR (voice-over): But as the war threatens to intensify in southern Gaza, and calls for a humanitarian ceasefire continue to go unheeded, there is little hope remaining for the people of Gaza.

COREN (voice-over): The reason this left bank operation is so important for Ukraine is to open the road to Russian-occupied Crimea and to protect the nearby city of Kherson. A year ago, the Russians withdrew from Kherson, using the Dnipro River as a defendable natural barrier between the two sides. But in the last month, attacks on Kherson have intensified to the point where the region's military governor told me there were 700 incoming rounds in one day. This is revenge and now it's felt more, he says, because our soldiers are already on the left bank and our civilians are feeling this revenge. 300,000 residents used to live in Kherson, now less than a quarter remain, including 56-year-old Inna.

LIEBERMANN (voice-over): For weeks, some families have slept outside the defense ministry to remind the war cabinet inside that they will not leave and they will not let up. From hostages' square in Tel Aviv, they march to Jerusalem, picking up thousands of supporters along the five-day march to the prime minister's office, a public pressure campaign to force a meeting with Israel's leadership. Adriana Adri's mother-in-law is a hostage in Gaza.",

Now some families have their own fight. Far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir is trying to push a death penalty for terrorists through the Knesset, which the families say endangers their loved ones in Hamas captivity. Hen Avigdori's wife and daughter were taken on October 7. HEN AVIGDORI, WIFE AND DAUGHTER HELD IN GAZA (through translator): Maybe instead of talking about the dead, talk about the living. Stop talking about killing Arabs, talk about saving Jews. This is your job.",

Family members of those kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th met with Prime Minister Netanyahu Monday to get some answers but instead left disappointed saying the subject of any hostage deal was not even discussed. So why are we hearing from the Biden administration that progress is being made with President Biden saying he believes a hostage deal is close?SCOTT WALKER, HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR (on the phone): Well, we've heard from the U.S., now the Hamas leadership and the Qataris that a deal is very close. And this is a very dangerous, sensitive part of the negotiations. And, you know, they don't want to get their family's hopes up and there's still a lot to be ironed out, particularly on the logistics and the sequencing here for any release.",

Are they right or are other issues at play here?WALKER (on the phone): Well, we're not sure exactly the nature of the specific conversations behind the scenes. But from the family's perspective, you know, their hopes are being built up here in terms of -- there's a possibility of their loved ones coming back now. And so we just need to wait and see how the next couple of days pans out. But I can't stress enough that just because there's an agreement in place to secure the release, it doesn't mean the safe and a timely recovery of the hostages.",

What are the actual logistics involved in trying to release more than 200 hostages?WALKER (on the phone): Well, ordinarily, it's pretty challenging when there's just one or two hostages. But when you have over 200 scattered about an active war zone, often being held underground, it just raises the challenges even higher. And so there are channels of communication open, which trust has been built between the Qataris and the Hamas and the Qataris and Israel.

Yes, we've heard about the potential prisoner exchange, but what about aid or fuel? And that is what these last final sticking points will be about as to the details that both sides can agree on.",
