But frankly, also has a lot of appeal among independent voters and even some Democrats. I think there's political upside for Joe Biden to cut a deal on border security. And frankly, I think some Republicans are going to want to pump the brakes, because they're afraid he and the Democrats might benefit if they deal with this issue. But let's deal with Abbott, because I agree with you: it's a very big deal. It is setting up a fundamental conflict that's going to go through the courts. Why? Because the border is traditionally something done by the federal government not the states. But, as Eric Adams and other folks will tell you now, if the federal government is not doing its job on the border, someone else has to deal with it. So this is really sort of a form of stunt politics. And it's got some downstream effects that could be quite troubling. But it indicates how quickly this issue is moving in people's minds.

I mean, they -- they tried to exclude all services, including schooling, from people who were undocumented. And the backlash, you can feel to this day. You can't get to first base as a Republican statewide in California anymore. They blew off all of their Latino voters. They cost the party the state. And going forward, they'll -- they'll have a hard time getting a toehold again. And I see Texas going down that same road. I think there's -- it's going to blow up in their faces.

This began at 10 p.m. local last night, more than 12 hours ago. That fissure has grown; is now 4 kilometers long. It is only about 3 kilometers from town, which is a fishing town that's now been evacuated, 4,000 people. And the fears really had been for that town, which has been seen people being evacuated for the night for more than a month now. Because as you say, there's been this seismic activity, thousands of earthquakes over the last month in that area, signaling that some sort of volcanic eruption was on the cards. This is the fourth in that area since 2021, but by far the largest. And I think no one had expected it, Phil, to be as big as it is. The pictures really very impressive. There is also, near that small fishing village of Grindavik that I mentioned, also a thermal power plant that powers and provides heat and hot water to some 30,000 people in the peninsula. There had been fears for that. So, what we're looking at are those lava flows to see which direction they take. What we've been hearing, the very latest is that they appear to be moving North and East and, therefore, not necessarily towards the town. Still, authorities say it is the toxic fumes that are being released from the volcano that now pose the most serious threat, really urging residents not to try and get anywhere near that volcano as they might go and try and have a look or get closer to it to try and get pictures. It is still extremely dangerous, and its lava flow is extremely unpredictable. We expect an update soon from authorities who have been meeting with civil defense forces, trying to figure out how they can continue protecting both the town and the thermal power plant. But good news for travelers, it doesn't appear for the time being, at least, Phil, that we're going to see any repeat of what we saw in 2010 when we saw that huge Icelandic volcano that caused some of the biggest travel disruptions to European air space since World War II.

And Vice President Kamala Harris will take center stage in that, launching what is called a Reproduction Freedoms Tour. Hosting events that the campaign says will highlight the harm caused by state abortion bans. That's their argument.And the first stop is Wisconsin on the 51st anniversary of the Roe versus Wade decision, which of course, has now been overturned.",

Bank of America's chief U.S. economist told his clients yesterday he believes Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could stick the so-called soft landing, slowing the economy without leading to mass layoffs and recession. Certainly looks that way right now. Our panel is back with us: John Avlon, Leah Wright Rigueur, and Errol Louis. John, I want to start with what the vice president is going to be doing. Because I actually think when you talk to people inside the White House, you feel like her team has stabilized. She's kind of found her lane, to some degree. This is where she's most effective, unequivocally; on this issue in these types of tours. And this issue is, to the extent the Biden campaign is maybe not Zen or sanguine, but they feel like they have issues on their side, this is No. 1 for them.",

You know, Democrats have been outperforming in every election -- special, you know, in the '23 elections -- in large part because of this issue. You know, when restrictive amendments have been put forward, even in red states, they lose.So the framing of this as a freedom issue seems to be working for Democrats. And it is very much in sort of Kamala Harris's wheelhouse as VP. That said, I think there's a danger of putting too much of an emphasis on this issue alone. It is a strong suit. No question. It has accounted for Democrats outperforming significantly in the last 18 months, but I don't know that the election will come down solely to abortion.",
