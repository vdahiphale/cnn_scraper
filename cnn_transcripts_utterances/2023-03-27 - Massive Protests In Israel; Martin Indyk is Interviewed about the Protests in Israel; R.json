The largest labor union calling for a general strike. Everything from the malls to McDonald's have shut down. Even the airport. Even planes taking off for the airport for several hours was completely halted as part of the strike.Some of the major Israeli ports in Haifa and Ashdod, their workers are also striking. We're also hearing from nurses striking. Never before in Israeli history has there been such a massive general strike and it's all about this massive judicial overhaul. Now, the latest drama over this overhaul started on Saturday evening when the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, dared to make a speech calling for the reform to be halted, for the legislation to be halted. Keep in mind, he's a member of Netanyahu's own party. He is the defense minister. And he was warning that the divisiveness over this reform was causing a real and credible threat to Israel's security, as hundreds of Israeli military reservist have said they would not heed the call to serve because of this massive overhaul that, I should remind you, what allowed the Israeli parliament to overturn supreme court decisions amongst a litany of other issues that they play -- that they want to push through. Now, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he ended up firing the defense minister 24 hours after that speech. That led to spontaneous, massive protests throughout the night in Israel. Those - while we've seen more than 12 weeks of protests in Israel against this massive overhaul, the protests overnight, they felt different. They felt angrier, and they felt more violent. And they lasted well into the night. Then today we had these massive strikes. And now more protests, more people out to the street. Now, while Benjamin Netanyahu has not yet come out and spoken specifically about these judicial reforms, we have heard him say in the last hour or so, a tweet saying, I call on all the demonstrations in Jerusalem, on the right and on the left, to behave responsibly and not to act violently. He says, we are brotherly people. But yet no word on what his plans may be over the judicial overhaul despite reports that earlier today he was going to announce a freeze. So far, though, nothing.

And as part of the agenda of some of his ministers, who actually - Likud minister for justice, and he could easily fire, but he's embraced this -- this judicial reform movement -- it's actually a revolution movement -- to try to give him the ability to stack the courts -- the court, I should say, the supreme court, in a way that people -- Israelis generally suspect is designed to protect him from the consequences of the prosecution that he's now -- trial that he's now going through. So, it looks like there's more of a personal agenda than a national agenda that he's pursuing.Plus, he has these other members of his coalition. The far-right religious people are basically settlers who don't want the supreme court to interfere to protect Palestinian land rights in the West Bank. And the religious parties that don't want the supreme court to promote equality. Of course there -- there (INAUDIBLE) students to serve in the army. So, all of his -- his coalition members have a stake in this judicial revolution that he's trying to push, apparently for personal reasons. And that's why I think he's --he's stuck with it despite the widespread opposition of hundreds of thousands of Israelis going into the street every Saturday night for three months now to protest it. And it's just been building and building and yet it doesn't turn back when the defense secretary, defense minister, says this is going to affect Israel's security, and he fires him, it's like Nixon and the Night of the Long Knives.",

So, we're all waiting, as you say, in anticipation for there to be a decision by the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, on whether to move forward and ask this grand jury to seek an indictment, or to not and to drop the investigation without charges. But in the void, what we've heard a lot is House Republicans doubling down over the weekend, saying that they want the D.A., Alvin Bragg, to testify. They're also talking about having -- coming up with possible legislation to prevent a local prosecutor, like Bragg, from investigating a current or former president going forward in the future. Now, Bragg's office has swung back. Bragg has said that, you know, this is unprecedented interference by a federal body, Congress, into a state and local investigation. And he said the only purpose it serves is to hinder, disrupt and undermine the work that his office is doing. He also says that they will continue to follow the rules and the law. You know, but, again, we are all waiting with anticipation to see what will happen today, if we get any shot of any of the witnesses or potentially one or more witnesses coming in, but we really have to wait for Bragg to make a decision on what he wants to do. And so, here we are. We'll be here again tomorrow. Jess. Jim. SCIUTTO: Kara Scannell, in New York, thanks so much. Joining us now is Sophia Cai. She's a congressional reporter for \"Axios.\" Sophia, thanks for joining us this morning. I think we need to take a moment to highlight what happened this weekend with the leading Republican candidate for the nomination in 2024 warning of death and destruction to his supporters if he is indicted. He attacked Alvin Bragg for what he said was prosecutorial misconduct. You say as well - and I want to ask you to share some details, that he went after a reporter. I mean these are all things that this former president has done before. Sometimes with great criticism from Republicans. We haven't seen a great deal of it right now. Tell us first what you learned about the president's interaction with a reporter on the flight home. SOPHIA CAI, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Yes. So, the president really got very frustrated by an NBC reporter who continued to ask about the Manhattan D.A. probe and suggested that the former president was frustrated, you know. And he really didn't like that. He called the reporter fake news. He told the reporter to not ask any more questions. And it became a very confrontational gaggle on the plane.",

I mean, the former president, he used the first 30 minutes of the rally to talk about all of the investigations that, you know, in his view have been unfair. He says they came after him. They got all of this information and came after his family members.And, you know, two things can be true for all of this, including, you know, currently the most pressing one with the Manhattan D.A. and the hush money. He both, you know, on the one hand, wants to appear very defiant of the investigations for his supporters. He wants to appear strong to that base, to the voters, including those at the rally. And at the same time, you know, he does feel pain. And he used that word. He says, you know, it does really take a huge toll on me and my family. So, I think there's some really conflicted emotions here. And the last thing I should mention is that he feels really bothered by the uncertainty around this current investigation into the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. And that uncertainty you see on social media. You see it -- you saw it in the gaggle with us, you know, on his plane, on their way back. He, in one conversation, he said, look, I have no idea what's going on, and I think that's true. He has no insight into the case. And he suggested, and this was new this weekend, he suggested that that probe was dropped. He said,  think it's dropped. I think -- you know, and that, I should say, no evidence -- no evidence whatsoever. You know, of course it's ongoing. But he's in all of these different places at once, yes.",
