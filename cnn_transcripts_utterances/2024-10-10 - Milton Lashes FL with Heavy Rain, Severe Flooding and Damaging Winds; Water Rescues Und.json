She is a woman of color and she is of a new generation. And as you know, when both President Biden and President Trump were running against each other, the country was like saying, can we actually turn a page? And I think it was Nikki Haley said, was the first one that does that, is the first one that's going to have a leg up in the campaign.So, she is not Joe Biden, as much as they want to try to make her Joe Biden. But she was and is part of the Biden administration and part of all the historic gains that were made from the American Rescue Plan, to the bipartisan infrastructure law, to the CHIPS Act, bringing back manufacturing. But she has continued to work really, really hard on demonstrating that she wants to continue the fight to lower the cost for everyday Americans. Which is why the other day she came out with her plan to help the sandwich generation. Those of us that have older parents and lots of kids. I have eight brothers and sisters. Between us, we got 38 kids and I got a mom that's 92. And we're all balancing that. Everybody in America is doing that. If you want to have a pro-growth economy, you have to help folks stand up. She's been very aggressive about that. She's put out now an 82-page economic plan, and she's talking about that. And she's basically going to fight really, really hard, as needs be, unfortunately, to protect the freedoms that Donald Trump wants to rip away from us. And she's going to be very aggressive and take it to him. And so, you can expect her to be her own person. She has demonstrated that throughout her life, and she will do that when she's the president of the United States.",

Look how many people are needing help to get out this morning as the sun is coming up.Tampa is 70 miles north of where Milton actually ended up making landfall. Tampa's mayor this morning is urging residents to stay inside because it is still not safe. I'm going to show you what happened in St. Petersburg. Drone video showing Tropicana Field. We'll pull this up for you, drone video showing Tropicana Field, the roof just shredded from hurricane force winds. Inside that stadium is where first responders were all set to be staged to help.

As you noted, and you see in that drone video, the roof of it just shorn off. And that was one of the bases of emergency operations. You had emergency responders sheltering there. It gives you an idea of just how powerful this storm was.I should note that for the most part, the neighborhood surrounding the immediate neighborhood, surrounding Tropicana Field, considering how strong this storm was and the rain and storm surge we were set to see appears to be in relatively decent shape. But obviously, that's with the caveat that we don't know exactly how all the areas of Pinellas County are doing. We actually spoke to a sheriff's deputy this morning that had blocked off access on a bridge into Pinellas County. He reported that there had been some downed power lines, and that is a major part of the concern. The unseen danger that still lurks underneath floodwaters, underneath rubble, potentially. We do know, as you noted, that some areas are flooded out and rescues are underway, especially in the eastern part of Hillsborough County. You mentioned Plant City. We understand there's some two to three feet of flood water in certain areas, and a senior citizen's facility had to be evacuated. Back here in Pinellas, part of the concern is with the Barrier Islands, those places that are at sea level, that have the coast on one side and the bay on the other. A lot of debris from Hurricane Helene was left over in those areas. They are impossible to access right now. Nevertheless, officials are putting out the word to stay indoors. They want folks to stay inside to avoid those unseen dangers as they survey the damage and get a better idea of just how devastating Hurricane Milton was to this specific area. Kate.",

And the damage is a lot more widespread than we first realized. When we came out here earlier this morning, it was so dark out on top of the power outages. It was hard to tell. And now, as you can see, just total devastation. We've seen trees just snapped right in half, vehicles that had rolled across multiple lanes of traffic, ending up here, just feet away from a neighborhood pond area. A big chunk of the dock that's also in this community lake and pond area, that was now pushed all the way up onto the road. Debris scattered everywhere.Now, if you take a look to the side of us here, as neighbors start making their way out, they're also realizing just how serious this is. We've seen multiple vehicles just kind of pulled over to the side of the road, many of them with the windshield blown out, glass shattered everywhere, park benches, a reminder of what was here not even 24 hours ago. Certainly, a much different vibe out here. As you can see in the distance here, trees barely recognizable and homes just shattered in the distance there. It looks like it's a small RV that's actually toppled on its side. So, it really just kind of reinforces just how strong that storm and wind must have been last night. Now, first responders have said that they reported to the scene here for a tornado, that they took at least five people to the hospital. Three of them had to get trauma lifted out of here, which, as we know, means they were seriously injured. Several others were treated on the scene. And as of right now, we're still just trying to talk to people in the know, see what they know, how they've made out overnight and really just where they go from here. So, as the day goes on, we'll certainly asses further and hopefully, have some updates throughout the day and check in with you.
