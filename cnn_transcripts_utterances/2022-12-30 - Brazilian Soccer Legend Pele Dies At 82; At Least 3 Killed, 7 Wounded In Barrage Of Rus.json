And that and that just speaks volumes as well, because, you know, there was nothing -- there was no challenge, really, that he wasn't capable of overcoming, especially when you affect on his life story. Remember his life story, Michael? He grew up in relative poverty, football with no cleats, with no boots, his youth team, initially at least. Football itself, what was it? It was a ball full of socks tied together to form a football.Overcoming all of that, as a teenager, wins the World Cup, 1958 World Cup, winning it as a teenager. But then you go to the 1962 World Cup and that tournament in '58 changed his life forever because at that point, he's literally the one they all want to beat. He's the mark man, if you like, out there on the football pitch. He would get injured early in that 1962 tournament, didn't play in the final. Fast forward four years to England at 1966 tournament, the year England won, I should point out very much a marked man back. Remember, he'd won the World Cup for the first time as a teen. After that, there's only one guy that the opponents but look, he had just too much for the opponents. He and Brazil were going for a third straight World Cup triumph in 1966. And what he was doing was so groundbreaking in terms of his movement, his passing, his dribbling, a magician, an opponent simply had no answer to it all. What do they do? What do they resort to? They take out their frustration on him. Brazil actually were eliminated in the group stages that year. But again, what happened six years later, 1970, having almost retired from the sport, comes back to win the World Cup for a third time. Again, that just speaks to his mental fortitude and his courage. And I think that is just and just put a little bow on this. OK, so I'm English. Full respect. We win the World Cup in 1966 for the first and only time.",

It included everything from controversy and celebration to a sad farewell and the ascension of a new monarch. CNN's Max Foster has a look back.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): A seismic year for Britain, the Commonwealth and the world for the family at its center and incomparable 12 months they will never forget. In January, Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages. With the Queen's oversight, Andrews stepped back from public duties to focus instead on defending himself against allegations of sexual abuse brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre. The Prince paid an out of court settlement for an undisclosed amount, and the case was dismissed. In March, William and Kate toured the Caribbean to a backdrop of negative media attention and accusations of colonial nostalgia. The trip was meant to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. However, the royals, William said, were not in the business of telling people what to do. For most Brits, the late Queen was the only monarch they'd ever known. Ruler for more than 70 years, an unprecedented platinum jubilee delivered one last hurrah. Four days of pomp and ceremony were scheduled for the height of summer a standalone opportunity to celebrate the life and legacy of her majesty. Parades, pageants, and a few old faces.",

Since being diagnosed with cancer, Pele had undergone surgery, but in the beginning of 2022, doctors said the disease had spread.
