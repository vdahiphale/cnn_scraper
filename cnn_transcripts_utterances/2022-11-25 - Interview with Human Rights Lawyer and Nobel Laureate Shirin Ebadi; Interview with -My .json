Now, journalist CharlayneHunter-Gault shares her five decades of writing about black lives in \"My People\". And, Jann Wenner, the founder of \"Rolling Stone Magazine\", takes Walter Isaacson behind the music and the glittering rise of rock and roll. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And tonight, we take a deep dive into the global struggle for civil rights, from the United States to Iran. What, if anything, has been learned from movements of the past? And our today's protest leading to significant change? Women, and their male allies in the Islamic Republic sure hope so. Females have been at the forefront following the death of one of their own three weeks ago. In a country intimate for crushing dissent, these women are trying to force authorities to pay attention to their demands, sometimes at their own peril. Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  This is Nica Shaku Rami (ph), one of the thousands of young Iranians who took to the streets on September 20th. But Nica never made it back home. She disappeared. 10 days later, her parents found her, a lifeless body at the morgue of a detention center in Tehran. Nica's (ph) aunt spoke out in BBC Persia interview. I was in contact with her until 7:00 p.m. on September 20th. Her friends said Nica (ph) put a story on Instagram to show she had burned her head scarf and she said to her friend, she was running away because security agents were after her. That was the last contact of her. According to her aunt, Nica's (ph) phone was switched off and her social media accounts deactivated. At the morgue, they showed a body. They only allowed her mother and her brother to identify the face. They were not allowed to unzip the cover to see the torso. While the circumstances of her death remain unclear, human rights groups have documented the brutal force used against protesters. Iranian security forces have dragged unveiled women by their hair, with some also reported sexually reported according to Amnesty International. Iranian state media released this CCTV video that investigators say shows Nica (ph) going into a building, possibly following from it later. They say they've arrested eight workers who are there. Authorities say there's no evidence the teenager was killed by police. Prosecutors say they've launched an investigation into her death. That comes just weeks after Mahsa Amini collapsed and died in Morality Police custody. Amini's family say doctors told them she had head trauma and believed she was beaten to death. Police said the 22-year-old died of a heart attack. They deny any wrongdoing. And it's been nearly three weeks since that investigation was announced. At Nica's (ph) funeral, this mourner cries, today was your birthday. Congratulations on your martyrdom (ph). Nica Shaku Rami (ph) was buried on what would have been her 17th birthday.

So, can you explain to the world why the death of one woman created so much protest that has gone all over the country and it's still going on after three weeks? EBADI (through translator):  The killing of this innocent girl was actually the last straw for the women. And the people don't forget that for 43 years, the Iranian people have not had any response for any of their demands from the government. And the only way the government has responded to the peoples demands has been to either imprisoned them or kill them.",

That it is women of all different, you know, there are religious women, there are less religious women, there are young women, there are old women, and their men? EBADI (through translator):  The very important issue is that the people have tried every way possible. They thought maybe they would be able to persuade the government to negotiate with them. They tried to reform, but it processed, it did not work. And unfortunately, the government turned a deaf ear to people's demands. That is why the reformists and anyone else who thought that they could reform this regime were disappointed. Now, they know that they have no other solution but to change the constitution.

And they'll say this is a profoundly religious country, and everybody else needs to just pay attention to that. What do you know that's different about the makeup of the country right now? EBADI (through translator):  It's very different this time. It's widespread. A lot more widespread than before. Even schoolgirls, pupils have come to the streets. And grandchildren are protesting alongside their grandparents. And this is not limited to one or two towns or cities in Iran. It's spread all over provinces in Iran. I will just highlight one incident in Zahedan, in less than two hours, they killed over 70 people. Well, the people cannot tolerate this anymore, especially people who have put up with this government for 43 years. They tried very patiently to persuade this government to follow a court of reforms.

You're the first and only Iranian, not to mention a woman, in fact in the Islamic world to have won a Nobel Prize. Is there any legal recourse, you're a lawyer, before that you were judge? People like Nasrin Sotoudeh and the other lawyers who've tried to help women over the last several years. Themselves have been put into jail. Is there any root in this, sort of, framework to change this, or are you saying the only change is an overthrow of this government? This type of government? EBADI (through translator):  I am very sorry to be saying this, but yes, the only way is regime change. Because, based on the constitution -- the articles in the constitution which have changed the regime to a theocracy to a despotic regime, the -- in the constitution, they actually say you that cannot change this regime. And it's strange that this constitution that was written some 40 years ago actually says, very explicitly, that based on the constitution, you cannot change the government. So, the whole constitution is wrong. We have to change the constitution for a start. Which would lead to the downfall of the regime and we want a regime that the people want. And I repeat, the people want a regime change. They want to democratic and secular government. They no longer want a despotic theocracy. They no -- people can no longer tolerate that.",

And they demoted me to the position of a clerk in the very court I used to preside over. Naturally, I did not accept this. And I left and after a while I started my own law firm. And I focused on defending victims of human rights. And my goal was to accept in -- by arguing every case, highlighting how wrong the laws are in Iran. So, not only did I want to help my clients but through my cases I wanted to prove to the world that this is our law. And this is what it results in. And I am so glad that you also covered my last case in Iran. And thanks to the support of the people and women, in particular, I managed to change the custody law in Iran for women, for the benefit of Iran.

EBADI (through translator):  I think it is different and I really hope that the people will succeed. But there's something I want to mention. If this time, and I repeat, if again this time the people -- the government manages to stage it, another crackdown, and repress the people. This will not be the end. There'll be yet another protest in, let's say, six months' time. The people do not want this government. There is no way to reform this government.

And I fell in love with the comic strip character, \"Brenda Starr\". And, again, remember, this is a segregated time. And so, I was five or six years old, and I said to my mom one day, you know, when I grow up, I want to be \"Brenda Starr\" -- like \"Brenda Starr\". And she didn't say, oh, no. That's a white girl. You can't do the things that she does. My mother, who also grew up in a segregated society said to me in response to what I said, well, if that's what you want to do. And that was so inspirational. And the other thing they did in that black community, our schools only got the hand me down textbooks from the white schools with pages missing. And so, every year the black community would come together and raise money to make up for some of the deficits in our school. And the winner -- the family that get -- that raised the most money, their daughter or son would be crowned king or queen. Well, one year, my mother and grandmother had been all over our little segregated town. My uncle's girlfriend, who -- well, there were quite a few of those, but they had money.

I interpreted a fan of Bob. I mean, I think in Bob's work, he embodied everything that we stood for in kind of a moral way and in an aesthetic way, and attitude towards society. So, I sought him out right away, and within a year met him. He came to interview me. I was asking him for an interview, and he came to interviewed me and see if that would be acceptable. It was a big scoop for us. He hadn't given an interview in three or four, five years. He had been in Woodstock. And from there on, we kind of became allies. And over the years, he gave 10 or 11 really amazing important interviews from various \"Rolling Stone\" writers. And in the course, we became good buddies. You know, I mean, Bob, unlike his reputation in person, if he's in a mood, is a great -- he's very funny, very personal, very easy to be with. And we have a lot of fun. We always -- every time we get together, at least once year, we have a lot of laughs and poke fun at each other. And he reads (ph) me for, kind of, discussing Gods (ph) in magazine. Ron and I read him for doing all those awful records, I mean, everybody knows that they're no good. And it goes much more than that. But he's at the soul of \"Rolling Stone\". He's in the opening quote of the book and he's in the very last chapter. That -- the anthem he wrote for our generation called, \"Forever Young\" you know, which I still subscribe to.

And he knew he had a place in \"Rolling Stone\" and with me that was both a place that would give him freedom at length to do whatever he wanted to do.

Singularly lifted us up into the journalism stratosphere of putting one of the best flyers of the time to one of the biggest national story there is, and usually the elections.

Nobody wanted a strong point of view in a -- when I was in magazines, when you were in magazines. People lived by their magazine and view. It shaped your world view.
