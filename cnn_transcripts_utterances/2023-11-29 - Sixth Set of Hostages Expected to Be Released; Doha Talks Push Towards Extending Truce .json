In the videos and photos, you can see an 84-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair. A masked gunman with a rifle flung over his shoulder wheeling her to the Red Cross convoy as a crowd cheers and records on their phones. Other images show heavily-armed gunmen escorting a 17-year-old girl, Mia Leimberg. She clutches her dog in her arms. Mia was released with her mother. This is a photo of them.

It has been underway.It centers on three crucial pillars, according to four senior administration officials. Pillars that are being worked on on a literal hour-by-hour basis, they say. No. 1, getting the hostages home. That has been underway, in that process, surging humanitarian aid to Gaza and what comes next. Both in the near term. Intensive and, officials say, blunt and candid discussions on the next phase of Israel's combat operations and longer-term efforts in the region to lay the groundwork for a post- conflict Gaza. We start this morning with team coverage. Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv. Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Oren, to start with you, what details do we have, or new details do we have about the exchange that's set for today?",

Now, that has shifted by a few hours, earlier or later.But crucially, we have no indications that it's off for today, which means on this sixth day, what as of right now is the final day of the truce agreement, the release of ten Israeli women and children is set to proceed. After that will be a release of 30 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons. And that, as of right now, marks the end of the truce. There are, as you point out, intense diplomatic efforts involving, of course, Hamas, Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the U.S., to see if it's possible to continue that truce and keep it going. But it requires the release of more women and children. There is a belief that Hamas is holding it up to extend this for at least a few days, perhaps two or three. The immediate focus is on getting it to go another 24 hours. And that's where the effort is right now. They're already looking at the future beyond that. Israel has promised very much to restart its military campaign in Gaza even stronger than before, as the White House tries to caution Israel away from the same sort of devastating campaign in Northern Gaza from carrying out that same sort of effort in Southern Gaza. So as of right now, the hostage exchange, the hostage release set for a few hours from now, we'll obviously keep an eye on that. And then the movement who are trying to extend this truce even further. It remains a big question. A key point, Phil. If you want to extend it beyond women and children, that may take an entirely new set of negotiations and a new set of parameters. Women and children have been released. One Israeli for three Palestinian. And if you're going to talk about releasing elderly men, as well as soldiers, that may be an entirely different set of negotiations.",

      "sentences": "So one challenge is that Hamas isn't holding all of the hostages, which means it needs to get them from other organizations and militant groups in Gaza to be able to carry out these hostage releases.That was one of the big points at the beginning. Hamas needs a pause in the fighting and no drones overhead so it can move the hostages around. For example, Israel has said that the family of 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage in captivity, is not actually held by Hamas. And that is a challenge in and of itself. It also means the hostages are held in different locations. Some have said through their families they were held underground, some above ground. Finding them, getting them to a point, and then getting the terms around that release, it remains an enormous challenge. We have seen this truce, of course, on the past several days on thin ice more than once as they try to extend it. We'll see how thin that ice gets, how fragile this agreement gets in the final hours, at least as the agreement was explained to us, how it's set to play out. We'll see the hostage release tonight, the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jail, and then the truce itself, if it's not extended, will expire early tomorrow morning.",

Oren, thank you.The major diplomatic breakthrough to secure the humanitarian pause and hostage exchange, it's really brought into sharp focus just how critical President Biden, the Biden administration have been throughout. In conversations with senior administration officials, it came to more than a dozen calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At least three calls with the emir of Qatar, the central intermediary with Hamas's political wing, including a critical call multiple officials told me unlocked a major roadblock to hostage releases on Saturday. There are also at least three calls with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, which helped structure the surge in humanitarian aid and those hostage transfers. Arlette Saenz, over to you on the North Lawn. For all of the moving parts here, American officials say they've kept a steadfast focus on those two American women that have not been released yet.

Now, these two women who the U.S. has yet to name. It's unclear where exactly in Gaza they're being held. Administration officials have been quite frank in saying that they don't necessarily know the conditions or whereabouts of these hostages. But that they urge Hamas to ensure that they are released. There's also the fact that there are some other groups beside Hamas who are holding some of these hostages. But the White House also said that so far, they are not concerned. They don't believe that Hamas is intentionally holding onto American women, they believe that this is something that can still move forward, and they are hopeful that it could potentially come today. And if it doesn't, then all eyes will be on whether there will be an extension of a truce, as President Biden has said that he will not stop until all of these hostages are back home.",

And they immediately sent out a patrol boat and an aircraft to scour the area. They say that they saw the wreckage of what was believed to be a U.S. military aircraft. Now it's just after 8 p.m. now in the evening. It is dark, but that search operation does continue. A number of patrol boats now looking for the other five that were onboard this Osprey. Now, we know from officials, the Coast Guard saying that they believed they received an emergency call for an emergency landing at one point during the afternoon. Now as I said, the cause of the crash is unknown. There have been a number of crashes of these Ospreys over the past two years. In fact, just three months ago, three U.S. Marines were killed when an Osprey crashed in Australia during a training exercise. And also, just last year, five U.S. Marines were killed during a training accident in California. Just before that, four U.S. service members lost their lives during a NATO training exercise when an Osprey crashed in Norway. So clearly, that will be looked at very closely. But the focus now is where exactly and what has happened to the other five onboard. As we know, one has been confirmed to have lost their lives at this point.

SHANE GOLDMACHER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": I mean, I think the short answer is no, there aren't signs enough to -- to disrupt Donald Trump. But I think this does have a big disruption in the campaign and in the primary, which is there's a primary inside the primary, which is Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, trying to be the one anti-Trump figure. And this is a real big part of that. This is a lot of money and an important group coming in and saying we think that, at this point in time, that candidate is Nikki Haley.

ADAM KINZINGER: I think what it shows us is that they're putting their money and their team and the volunteers behind her, because they started telling us earlier this year, was anyone but Trump. It can't be Trump. And so they're really doubling down on that and pointing out that Ron DeSantis is also not the choice for Republicans. And so looking at the field that's left, they chose Nikki Haley, who has the most momentum. Ad we have seen that her poll numbers have increased, especially after each Republican debate, which there's another one coming on. They're putting their money behind it, and I think it's telling as well that, you know, in Iowa, Kim Reynolds she put her support behind DeSantis. Both these scenarios do not choose Trump.
