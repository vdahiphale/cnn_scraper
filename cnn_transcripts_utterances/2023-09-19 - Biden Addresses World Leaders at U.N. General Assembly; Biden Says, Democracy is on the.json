Any minute, President Joe Biden will enter the hall behind me and address the world. We are expecting his motorcade to pass by us. Any minute now, we will see the beginnings of what look looking like the security for that.The speeches have already begun. The president Brazil, Lula da Silva, is now speaking before the delegates there. Brazil traditionally the first nation to address the United Nations General Assembly is going to be the first president to address the general assembly. For President Biden, it is a tall task today. He needs to rally the world to sustain support for Ukraine and its defense against Russia's aggression. This will be the first time later today that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will walk into this hall since Russia invaded his country, a crucial moment for him as well. And for President Biden, of course, not just the international community that is the audience but also the domestic audience, as he is in the middle of a re-election campaign. Interestingly enough, the domestic audience and the international audience is looking for, in some ways, much the same thing. They want to see stability. They want to see leadership. And we are now getting a sense of what President Biden will say to the collective audience. Here with me now, CNN Chief International Analyst Jim Sciutto and CNN White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche. Kayla, I understand we are now getting some excerpts from what the president will say in just a few minutes.",

      "sentences": "John, officials had said that Ukraine would figure prominently in this president's address this morning. And now, we are getting a glimpse of exactly what he plans to say.The White House providing excerpts from the speech, saying that the president will say, Russia believes the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequence. But I ask you this, the president will say, if we abandon the core principles of the U.N. Charter to appease any aggressor, can any member state feel confident that they are protected? If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? The president plans to answer his own question, and say, the answer is no. But, essentially, he is going to be broadening out an argument that he has long made to allies at the G7 and NATO, arguing that what's happening Ukraine could happen anywhere if Russia's aggression is allowed to continue unchecked.",

Although there remains bipartisan support, but the question is will it be as great as it has been so far.President Biden aware of those politics, as is the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He knows that this time is key, and that those support may never be stronger than it is today. That's a challenge for him going forward. But I think from President Biden, this is about Ukraine, it's also about Taiwan. It's about what they see as a global standoff between democratic or largely democratic countries and authoritarians, but also, you will hear the phrase of, the international rules-based order, right, the idea that counties follow laws. They don't invade other countries, violate their borders, because Vladimir Putin wants to or because Xi Jinping wants to in Taiwan. And I think part of that message, as Kayla was quoting there, is meant to be for everyone, and say, listen, if you let that stand, no one is safe, whether you are a democrat or authoritarian, and if you allow, if we, at the members of the United Nations, allow Putin's rule to win, then all of us suffer.",

And we are now learning that there are going to be more echoes of that in the 2024 campaign going forward.President Biden has been meeting with donors. He's doing a slew of fundraisers here in New York while he's in town. And last night, he seemed to be road testing a new message where he was once again challenging former President Donald Trump and saying that he remains a threat to democracy. And the direct, quote, that President Biden said to donors last night was, in 2024, democracy is on the ballot once again. Let there be no question, Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy. And I will always defend, protect and -- democracy. Sharpening that message against his most likely opponent in the 2024 election and saying that democracy once again is on the ballot, essentially the same argument he made in 2020.",

The word they hear, and I often hear, is terrified of what a Trump presidency would mean. That's not my judgment. That is the judgment of folks leading countries or at senior positions around the country because of that very change in the U.S.Well, I believe that is The Beast going by just now, the president's limousine, as he enters for his speech. And, by the way, that is not an undue expectation given what Trump's public positions are. I will end the war in Ukraine in a day. Many believe that means end U.S. support or significant U.S. support for Ukraine if he were to be elected. There is a fear that he would not just think about pulling out of NATO but pull out NATO, not just think about reducing U.S. soldiers on the Korean Peninsula but pulling many out or all of them out. That's the way the world sees what's at stake in 2024. TAUSCHE:  And President Biden is also fond of sharing the anecdote from early in his term where he was meeting with many of his European allies. And he said America is back, and they said, but for how long? So, clearly, this is a question that looms large in the minds of many allies over the weekend. Germany's foreign minister was asked what a second Trump presidency would mean for some of these alliances. And she said that the world, NATO, Europe, would at least know what was coming the second time around, that it wouldn't come as quite such a shock as the first time, but Germany's chancellor has said that he very much wants President Biden to be re-elected for that reason.",

And he can take up the mantle of global leadership and attempt to elevate these priorities from the U.S. agenda. But if he is not re-elected by the American electorate, then that doesn't matter anymore.And so, you know, many leaders watch domestic polling closely as a barometer of how that message is landing. And, certainly, you know, that's something that the administration knows full well, that the president, his image is boosted by being president, but, ultimately, it's domestic issues that drive his favorability here.",

Biden will make that point today because you can't solve climate change without negotiations and agreement with a country like China. It's just not possible. And administration officials I speak with, I'm sure Kayla has the same experience, will often say, listen, we set our red lines here with Russia and China. But on climate change, we have to be at the table with China because there's no hope. Otherwise, that's just a requirement.

This is a subject matter where he feels like he owns the subject matter. And aides say that he's relatively unassailable. And at the G20, the hope was that he would be able to step into a relative power vacuum with leaders of Russia and China not president. They hope something similar here at the United Nations, although there are a lot of other issues to tackle. We saw the U.N. ambassador, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield, there walking with the president. She told reporters last week that the administration is aware, that there's frustration among the rest of the world that there's this very heavy focus on Ukraine.That's one of the reasons why you'll hear the administration talk quite a bit about the global south. Brazil's leader has said that Brazil can be a leader of the global south. He has been lobbying President Biden for a seat, a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. So, certainly, there's going to be a bigger conversation about what the world order looks like and how the U.S. sees that.",
