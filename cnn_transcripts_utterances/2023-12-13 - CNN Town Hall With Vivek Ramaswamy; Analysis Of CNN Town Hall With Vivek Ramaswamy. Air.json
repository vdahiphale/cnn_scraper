I think we are reaching a new generation of voters in this country. We have been to most of the college campuses across this state. And I don't think that's something the Republican Party has done a great job of. There's a reason why these revolutions, these revivals are often led by the next generation. Thomas Jefferson was 33 years old when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. I'm an old man by comparison, actually, to Thomas Jefferson. And I will say this. It's going to take a president who, yes, comes from the outside, is a businessman. I believe it's going to take an outsider, with sharp elbows at times, to come take on the federal bureaucracy, to shut down agencies that need to be shut down, to implement that 75 percent head count reduction I want to see in the federal bureaucracy. But it's also going to take a president who has a deep first personal understanding of the law and the Constitution. And those two things don't usually go together. I have actually hired many people in my career over the many companies that I have started. And those two skills, you might have the academic law professor types over here, you might have the business types that are going to get something done. That's what gives me my sense of purpose in this race. And I think I'm the only person in this race who brings both of those attributes, an understanding and a commitment to the Constitution. But combine that with being an outsider who can actually get things done, and I think that's going to take the combination that actually takes to revive this economy and revive our constitutional republic.",

They're using eminent domain to seize farmland to build a carbon capture pipeline using federal subsidies. I'm the only candidate in this field who has taken a clear stand in being against those kinds of policies, the unconstitutional use of eminent domain. So, we can go into other specific examples, but it comes down to a commitment to the Constitution, a deep understanding of the Constitution, swearing an oath to the Constitution and keeping it, and combining that with being an outsider, and, yes, reaching and inspiring the next generation of Americans.

The country that put a man on the moon can get this done. It's just a question of political will. So, one thing I've said is we will use our own military to secure our own border. Right now, we can use it to secure somebody else's border. Let's use it to secure our own southern border, and our northern border too. Don't forget about that. Our northern border has seen more illegal crossings this past year than the last 12 years combined. That's where this front is going. And I've visited both in the last several months. If we're able to do that, use our military, complete the border wall, stop federal aid to any Central American country until they have secured their own borders for every country between Venezuela and Mexico. Then I want to implement, I would say, the best border policies of all, which is ending the illegal incentives to be here. End birthright citizenship for the kids of illegal migrants to whom the 14th Amendment does not apply. End federal funding to sanctuary cities using our own taxpayer money to pay effectively for breaking the rule of law. And then there's the hard question. I don't want to leave you hanging on that one, because many people skip this one, but this one's the hard one. I do believe that anybody who's in this country illegally needs to be returned to their country of origin. Not because they're all bad people. In fact, many of them are good people, many of them. If we're being honest, if we were in their shoes and there's a president of the United States, who's been giving them a wink and a nod to come on over, if we were in a tough spot, maybe we would have done the same thing. So, this is not a value judgment about those people. It's a value judgment about this country. We're founded on the rule of law. And as a father of two sons in the White House, I can't look them in the eye and tell them they have to follow the rules when our own government isn't following its own rules. So, then there's the question of how, and this is the part many Republicans skip. There's only 6,000 or so ICE agents on the front line. How could they possibly tackle millions of illegal migrants who are in this country illegally? Here's the answer. There's a provision in the law. We don't need new laws. The existing law, it's called 287(g). It allows you to actually serve an ICE agent to allow local law enforcement across this country to serve their warrants. That's a million law enforcement officers. We can then get that done, but again, all it takes is a president with a spine. And if I swear an oath to the constitution, I intend to keep it. That's how I'm going to lead this country, and I think that's how we're going to solve not only the border crisis, but the crisis of the abandonment of the rule of law in this country. That's how I expect to lead.",

If you've relied on the government, we're not going to be able to retroactively date that.But from January 20, 2025 going forward, if I'm the president, if you're born in this country as the kid of an illegal immigrant, you will not enjoy birthright citizenship. And that's what the 14th Amendment says. It says it only applies subject to the jurisdiction thereof. That's in the opening section of the 14th Amendment, when it talks about birthright citizenship. So, in the same way -- and I want people to understand this because some people call this a controversial view. I don't think it needs to be. The kid of a Mexican diplomat who's here legally and he's born in the United States, that person doesn't enjoy birthright citizenship. Nobody can test that. Well, if the kid of a Mexican diplomat who's here legally does not enjoy birthright citizenship, neither does or should the kid of a Mexican or Venezuelan migrant who's here illegally. And there's been case law on this at the appellate court level. The one case that's been ruled agrees with me on this. I believe the current Supreme Court agrees with me six to three on this. All we need is a president with a spine who, I go back to that first question, Abby, understands the constitution.

Seems like a technical subject, a lot of people don't like to talk about. I think this is fundamental.So the Federal Reserve has, since the late '90s, taken on the role of playing effectively God for the financial system, for a lot of that period, raining money from on high like manna from heaven. We've been skiing on artificial snow and it's really flowed down through the top one percent. A friend of mine actually has a funny expression but I'll share it with you. He says, you know, if you're a nurse, you'll go home with some extra latex gloves. If you're a teacher, you might go home with some extra pencils. If you're a banker, you go home with a few extra dollars. And that's the way it's worked through the Federal Reserve System. Trickledown economics, I believe does work when it's driven by gains in the real economy, but it doesn't work when it's created by artificial paper wealth generated by Fed Reserve policies. So I put the Fed back in its place. The reason real wage growth has not gone up for the bottom 99 percent adjusted for inflation. It's been flat. The reason why is the Federal Reserve has treated wage growth as though it's a leading indicator of inflation and try to tamp it down like a game of Whac-A-Mole for the last 25 years. So you get what you pay for. My view is I'll put the Fed back in its place. A single mandate for the U.S. Fed. What is that? Dollar stability. Peg the dollar to commodities. That ties the hands of our government. That's a good thing. We had our greatest GDP growth in this country before we left the gold standard. I think that's telling. So when the dollar is stable, that's how you actually helped the bottom 99 percent in this country. That's how you see a real wage growth. And I want people to understand, you hear a lot of tales of mythology. I would say about the current economy. Let's make it simple. What's going on? Prices are going up. Interest rates, including mortgage rates to buy your home or going up. But wages have remained flat. And so I'm not going to be the person who comes in here and tells you. Some people say, am I too pessimistic at times? I'm a realist. I'm not going to tell you the American dream is alive and well right now. It is not. It's alive and hanging on for life support. But I believe it can be. And I do think it's going to take now more than ever the CEO in the White House. Somebody with fresh legs. Somebody I believe from the next generation to look at this differently, apply some basic economic common sense. And that starts with reform of the Federal Reserve. So thank you for that question.

I admire him because he was one of the few truly intellectual presidents we've had. And so I like to explore ideas. One of the things an 11th grade English teacher, Mrs. Smith taught me is that you don't really understand what you think unless you can offer the best statement of an alternative view. And so that's where I did my books. I wrote my book -- first book was \"Woke, Inc.\" And I often joke, I agree with about 95 percent of what's in there. And so my view is this, what we really need is a 12 percent flat tax across the board. Ordinary income, capital gain, corporate, flatten it all out. And then here's how we get the money back for the system. End the croniest deductions. The deductions and the loopholes and the -- and the rebates that a lot of corporations, a lot of special interests have lobbied in. It's about $700 billion a year, just the tax compliance costs, just the out of pocket costs, not even counting the time you spend preparing your taxes. Give that back to the people.

I want us to be able to look our kids in the eye and tell them that I want you to grow up and be like him. It has been a long time since we've held our presidents to that standard. That's standard I want you to hold me to, that's a high standard. Now I think about that in judging the way I comport myself in different areas. Am I going to tell me kids to go to school and be a bully? No, I'm not. But I'm going to tell them if somebody bullies you or hits you, you're going to hit him back 10 times harder. And that's the way I'm going to lead this country. You can't -- you have to be -- as we say in our family, you have to be strong enough to protect your kindness. So if you watch the debates carefully, I don't engage in four-letter words. I mean, there are other candidates who have called me dumb, scum, and worse that I'm not going to repeat here. I didn't go after them, but if they're going to come after me, I'm not going to be a president, whether it's Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin or anybody else, who's going to roll over.

I can tell you now, having gone somewhat deep in this, it's not. I mean, the reality is this. We do have a government, first of all, we have technology, that has lied to us systematically over the last several years about the origin of COVID-19, about the Hunter Biden laptop that we were told was false by 51 CIA experts and otherwise, before we now know that it was true.

Some of them hit me for being on TikTok because it reaches you all. I think we should be reaching out to young voters. What I see isn't a base of young voters who's against our shared values, I see a lot of peers in your generation and our generation that are lost, hungry for direction, right? The left will prey on that vacuum with race, gender, sexuality, climate. I'm not going to blame them. I'm going to blame the Republican Party. We've gotten lazy just criticizing that vision without offering our own vision. Individual, family, nation, God. Yes, I said the G word. That beats race, gender, sexuality, and climate if we have the courage to actually stand for something. And so, I believe that your generation -- I believe that we're at a tipping point. And there's a reason. You know, I talked about Thomas Jefferson. He was 33 when he wrote the Declaration. He also invented the swivel chair while he was at it. Think about that founding spirit. We're the pioneers. We're the explorers in this country, the unafraid, the people who nobody and no government dares to stop. That's who we are as Americans. Our pursuit of excellence, that's what makes us American. And I think it's going to take somebody in your generation, somebody whose best days in life are still yet ahead to see a country whose best days are still ahead of itself. And I hope that's the case for me. I don't take every day for granted. Every day we wake up is a new blessing. And I'll leave it at that. I don't take tomorrow for granted, but I hope my best days are still ahead of me.

You lose your way a little bit.I don't know about you, but I did some stupid things, right? But we're stronger for it when we get to our adulthood on the other side. So, no, I don't think we have to be that nation in decline. And tell the people in your class the same thing. We can still be a nation in our ascent. If the people of the last 25 years got us to where we are, maybe we try something a little different. Somebody with fresh legs.

If you care about somebody, you tell them the truth or at least what you believe. If you care about yourself, you tell them what they want to hear. And I'm -- I've a feeling I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear on this one.So I think the diversity, equity, inclusion agenda has been abused. In the name of diversity we have, at many of our universities, totally sacrificed diversity of thought. In the name of equity, we've perpetuated a lot of inequity and inequality of opportunity through affirmative action and otherwise. In the name of inclusion, we've created a new culture of exclusion where certain points of view aren't welcome. So especially in a university setting, what do I care about? Diversity of viewpoint. This is important, actually. I think diversity of viewpoint is part of what this country was built on. Well, the best way to foster diversity of viewpoint is to screen candidates for the diversity of their views, actually. Many look at the board members of many universities, you're going to go through their partisan affiliation. It's not 80/20. It's going to be like 90/10 in the other direction. That's completely at odds with the representation of this country. So do I value diversity of viewpoint? Absolutely. Do I think we're doing a good job of that? No, we're not. And it's not an accident. In the name of diversity, we've actually created a new culture of conformity. And so I think it's entirely possible to have a group of 10 people who look similar to one another who have different views. I think it's entirely possible to have a group of 10 people who look different from one another or who look the same as one another but have different views, or look different from one another and have the same views. And so I think the best way to screen candidates for the diversity of their experiences is to actually ask them about the diversity of their experiences. And I think the use of these racial and gender quota systems I think have actually created a new form of racism in the United States that otherwise would not have existed. It's sad to me. I mean, I've hired, not because I was thinking about it consciously, plenty of Black women in different positions of authority, in this campaign or other companies or whatever. And I can tell you it saddens me when people look at somebody who I hired on the basis of merit and say they only got that job because of their race or gender. That doesn't do anybody a favor. And so I think if we restore true meritocracy in this country, and embrace true diversity of thought, chances are we're actually going to have a bunch of different shades of melanin and a range of genders in different positions. But let it be not the goal. Let it just be a byproduct of actually selecting for people who are the best person for the job, and especially in a university setting, diverse viewpoints as well. That's what I'll say. (APPLAUSE)",

It was not. That is according to the FBI Director, who I should note, is a lifelong Republican, who was appointed by former President, Donald Trump. He testified as much before Congress.

Make no doubt about it. There is no evidence that what he is saying is true. To the contrary, the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, has said it's completely wrong, that there were any agents in the crowd, trying to instigate this. When you look through the video, there is no evidence, of police, rolling out the red carpet. There is evidence, at times, of police standing by, while people walk past them, which seems to be a measure of simply the fact that people were either leaving, or that the police were so overwhelmed that it was at the point at which there was nothing else to do. Most importantly, though, look at what the courts have done, as they've looked at this. As of last July, 30 months into it, about 350, according to Department of Justice, 350 defendants had been charged, with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers, or employees, including many attacks, on the officers, in question here.
