It was more just playing defense or sticking to the issues that he was trying to push forward on. And there were things he could have fact-checked him on.I was kind of stunned by the Obamacare that he let him get as far as he did on suggesting that Trump was the savior of it. I think that, to be honest, Tim Walz was a little in over his head tonight. I think his performance got better by the end of the night. The best moment and, unfortunately, it's probably with the fewest voters are going to have seen, was the January 6 answer. That felt like the moment that he kind of taken the bay on J.D. Vance being the nice guy and trying to be friendly with them. In that moment, he's like, wait, this is somebody I don't trust, this is somebody who has lied about things, and he kind of found his bearings there.

And so, I do just want to acknowledge that that part was positive.I also think people have been kind of tough on Walz tonight (ph). I don't think he had a great night. But substantively, since that's what people are happy about, I thought he explained his home policy, home building policy really well. Vance was just blaming immigrants for everything. We talk about standing of businesses. I think, for a lot of African- American voters and Black male voters, this idea of entrepreneurship is important. He hit that very well. Much better on gun policy. When he talked about abortion, he says pro-woman, pro-freedom. I thought that worked really, really well. And what I loved on the immigration answer, he made a biblical reference. You know, my favorite part of the Bible, Jesus says you're going to be judged by how you treat the least of these, the addicted, the convicted, the afflicted, the evicted. And he held that up.

Vice presidential and presidential debates have a lot more to do with the feeling about the candidate, whether or not you trust the candidate, whether you like the candidate, whether you agree with them on the issues that you -- that you're paying attention for, etcetera.If one were just going by traditional debate scoring, and again, that's not what this is, J.D.

He's not messing around playing games up there in the debate stage and pretending I'm all with you with my heart, and then supports policies that have nothing to do with what you just said. He is what he is. And I think that's what's going to come across to the American people. That's what came across today.So, I'm not surprised that a bunch of independents and maybe people that aren't that involved in politics, they watch it, they think, I like the guy. He may not have used the exact right words here, didn't say the right thing here, but I like him and I believe in him.

He added that he was -- quote -- \"sympathetic to the view that a national ban was necessary to stop women from traveling across state lines to obtain abortions.\"And he also said in his website during that Senate campaign that he was -- \"100% pro-life\" -- end quote -- and that he favored eliminating abortion. These categorical words were on his website until Trump chose him as his running mate. They certainly included no caveats about opposing a federal legislation. And then in the Senate, as recently as late last year, he explicitly pushed a national ban as early as 15 weeks gestation, as a debate moderator said to him. He can try to spin that as just a standard, but it's not like a goal or a target. That was federal legislation or the idea of it, at least, that would have banned abortion at 15 weeks.

And remember, heading into this evening, one of the most important goals for Tim Walz was really to paint a stark picture, a difference between the Harris-Walz vision and what Donald Trump and Vance are proposing. The campaign does believe that was on clear display. And you'll see that the governor, moments ago, was speaking to reporters and he said -- quote -- \"I think it was a good debate.\" And specifically, he said, we got to see a contrast, and I think the ending sums it up.
