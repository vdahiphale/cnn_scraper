They want jet fighters, they want more long-range missiles, we should provide those. We should give Ukraine what it takes to win this war. Now, what it takes to fight to a stalemate? That's the only -- there's only bad for civilians, and ultimately bad for all of us who have to pay for the cost of rebuilding Ukraine.

And this is really potentially a key witness for the Republican-led House Oversight Committee as they continue to investigate Joe Biden's handling of classified documents. Now, our sources telling me and our colleague, Paula Reid, that Chungfeels pretty responsible for this whole thing. So, it'll be interesting to see what kind of testimony she is willing to provide to lawmakers when she sits down with them. Now, they've requested a really wide range of documents and information from Chung. Her lawyer is saying that you know, it's going to be limited in what she can ultimately hand over. But ultimately, at the end of the day, this really is the first firsthand witness that the Republican-led committee is going to hear from as it investigates Joe Biden's handling of classified documents.",

But we just don't know if that's what they said in their report so far.That's because right now, we've only got a portion of this report, just a couple paragraphs that doesn't name any names doesn't specify what recommended charges this special grand jury has at this time that the district attorney, Fani Willis, will be looking at and considering bringing, except for one. We do know that the special grand jury now in this report says they recommend perjury charges or they recommend the district attorney consider bringing perjury charges against witnesses they believe may have lied to them. We do know that this grand jury in the months of their work, they heard from about 75 different witnesses, everyone from election workers and public officials to people who were election deniers, who were efforting on behalf of Donald Trump in the state of Georgia. Trump himself, they did not hear from but they certainly looked into that infamous call that he placed. And the other thing that they found after listening to all of these witnesses doing all of their work and putting out this report, we do know that they found unanimously that there was no widespread fraud in Georgia in 2020, a crucial finding that will set up the other recommendations we'll be looking for, Kristin.",

I have talked to a number of prosecutors and defense attorneys, and the consensus is if Donald Trump is indicted, and I repeat if, that it is most likely to happen in the Georgia case. And really for two reasons. First of all, as Katelyn mentioned, you do have that phone call, the actual audio tape of Donald Trump calling the Georgia Secretary of State in 2020 and saying find me 11,780 votes, one more than Joe Biden had.So, that's fairly strong evidence. And I think the other reason is because for the Fulton County district attorney to indict Donald Trump as explosive as that would be, is not as inflammatory as the Justice Department -- the Biden Justice Department indicting the former president who is now running to replace Joe Biden in 2024. So, for a variety of reasons, if there's an indictment, people are looking to Georgia.",
