So before the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court put SB4 on hold, a majority on the Supreme Court had decided to let it be enforced. I'm curious, do you think that signals that the court is open to ruling that the law is constitutional?REP. JASMINE CROCKETT, (D -TX): I absolutely do believe that. I think that this court has been pretty obvious in their signalling, a little bit more obvious than maybe years past. We saw It happened definitely when it came down to the decision on whether or not Trump would stay on the ballot or not with the Colorado decision. They kind of gave us a signal. We know when the leak decision came out as it relates to Dobbs, we kind of knew what the writing on the wall was going to be. But prior to, they allowed that to go into effect as it relates to some of the Texas abortion cases that were moving through the courts. And so I think that this court has typically kind of signalled and lead into where they plan to go. And I think that this is a bad sign for Texas and the United States.",

I want you to listen to what he said at a press conference earlier today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHIEF MIGUEL RODRIGUEZ JR, LAREDO POLICE DEPT.: I can tell you that this law is not about us going out there and doing roundups. This law is not about us going out there and asking for papers and immigration status. This is not about that. This law is very clear that whenever we can apply it, is through a lawful detention or an arrest. Very important that we train and train and train because we want to avoid the racial profiling part of this law, that it lends itself for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm mostly handling criminal defense cases or doing civil rights cases, I can guarantee you that just as he stated, it lends itself to that. There's only so much racial bias that you can teach someone not to have. Interestingly enough, I just had a conversation yesterday about why there are some proponents of AI and believing that, you know what, no matter who you are, when you put people at the center of something, there will always be some sort of bias. And so it is very concerning because the way that this law is written is going to allow for those bad apples to just go out and cherry pick people based upon them saying, well, I thought that they crossed the border illegally.This is a problem, especially when we start talking about our southern border that tends to have more Latino folk located there. We know that we saw recently law enforcement. I want to say it was Christmas maybe of last year, the year before, where we saw, that there was an American family out of El Paso, and there was a tragic death because law enforcement decided to pursue them because they thought they were crossing illegally. That is not enough. This should not pass any type of muster, and the application is going to be disastrous again, as we have seen time and time again. What we need to do, is we need to have comprehensive immigration reform. You're absolutely right. When it comes to the backlog, you know, what we need to do? We need to pay people to work. That's something that the president has tried to offer time and time again in a supplemental package. And ultimately, when the Republicans rejected that, he said, fine, we will absolutely look at what we're doing as far as immigration and actually reform the immigration system and not just put more money into it. And you know what? They came to an agreement, a very conservative agreement, and that was turned down. It is time for this do-nothing Congress to do something that the immigration system is not going to do. It is time for this do-nothing Congress to do something that the American people can rely upon as making sure that they are protecting not only U.S. citizens, but those that are seeking asylum in our country that is supposed to be the land of the free and the land of opportunity.",

How does he balance that when it comes to the two wings of his party, including he's got the progressive wing, but he also has people he's trying to appeal to who want to see more done on immigration, who might actually favor the Texas law or at least understand why Texas is taking action? DEANVirginia. These are voters that are --they consider themselves independents. They maybe voted for Nikki Haley. They don't want to vote for Trump. It's voters like that that you're talking about that maybe are supportive of stronger immigration measures. And you do have to balance those types of voters, which will likely play a key role in winning these handful of states that he's going to need to win to put them over the edge in November. With making sure you're progressive voters show up and don't stay home. And that is a tricky thing to do. And you have to be able to kind of walk, that line and give everybody a little something he was able to do it in 2020 with the help of people like Bernie Sanders and others who came together and built this coalition for him but as Gloria noted in some of the polling we're seeing those numbers with some of these younger voters in particular starting to soften.",
