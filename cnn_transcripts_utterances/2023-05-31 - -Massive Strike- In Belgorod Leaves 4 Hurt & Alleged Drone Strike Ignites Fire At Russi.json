You see the pictures there. Local officials say a fire put out quickly and there were no casualties. Still, the scope and frequency drawing attention. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv. Fred, we've seen a series of these attacks on both Russian-held territory in Ukraine but also crucially the territory of Russia. What are Ukrainian officials saying about this or are they keeping deliberately coy?",

Here's a look at some of the other headlines we've been following this hour.Alabama's governor has just signed legislation banning transgender women from playing on female college sports teams. This follows other new rules considering trans athletes, which include locker room restrictions and the use of puberty blockers for minors. A transgender rights group says the new ban is part of a, quote, \"systemic attack\" against LGBTQ people. Plus, a widely used tool for submitting college applications is adopting a new feature. Colleges will be able to hide race and ethnicity on applications submitted through the common app. This move is designed to make it easier for schools to adjust to any forthcoming legal changes as the Supreme Court nears a decision on affirmative action.

Still, nearly one in five teachers say they would carry a firearm at school if it was permitted.Jennifer Mascia is a writer at \"The Trace,\" which is a news organization dedication to covering gun violence. Jennifer, thank you so much for being with us to talk about this. Obviously, it's an incredibly controversial idea. It is actually in effect in some places. Tell us what it looks like where they're doing this in schools. Are these teachers trained? How much are they trained? Are they actually carrying these weapons on their person? Are they locked up? Tell us how they're doing it. JENNIFER MASCIA, WRITER, \"THE TRACE\": So 28 states have laws that permit staffers or designated school officials to have access to guns. And it really depends. State law can authorize this. But really it depends on district-by-district policies. So the study's authors note that we need to look at this more because, to break down every district's policy, you may have 35 different practices. So what happens, we actually, my colleagues at \"The Trace\" about five years ago, we looked at a middle school in western Ohio. And there were gun safes with handguns, nondescript black safes in undisclosed locations around the school. And only designated staffers knew exactly where they were. So you have a situation where, if a shooting is isolated to a certain part of the school, is it possible for staffers to reach those guns in time? Even when there are armed guards on school campuses, there's still casualties. Even law enforcement has a very hard time intercepting these shooters before they can kill.",

What you said is correct, a lot of these shooters pick these very deadly weapons because they want to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.So if somebody breaches a campus with an A.R.-15, even when there's an armed guard there, they're likely going to -- because of the power of that weaponry -- kill people before a teacher could access a safe and whip out a handgun. Even if the handgun was accessible in a desk or in some kind of a biometric safe that students couldn't reach, that teacher is likely to be shot or killed before they can intervene. It's very tricky.
