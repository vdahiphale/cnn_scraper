      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.We start today with breaking news. In our law and justice lead, a federal judge has just paused Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case, which could lead to his March 2024 trial being delayed. Judge Tanya Chutkan says she is waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in and decide if it will take up the question of whether Donald Trump ultimately has immunity for the alleged crimes he committed while president. More on that story in a moment. Our other major legal headline also involves the U.S. Supreme Court, which is now set to play a major role in the 2024 elections. Today, the justices announced they will decide whether to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug, even in states where it remains legal. The case concerns mifepristone, which, one coupled with another drug, is one of the most common abortion methods in the United States, a prescription regimen that patients can use at home and have been for two decades. This new case could be decided by July 2024, which would throw the court right smack dab in the middle of an election, where access to abortion and whether to be illegal is once again a key issue if not, for many voters, the key issue. Today, the justices also announced today they will be considering an appeal from unindicted January 6th rioter. The justices will have to decide how a federal obstruction law can be used related to the Capitol attack or if it can be used at all. That could impact hundreds of criminal cases, including that of Donald Trump. We're going to break down the impact of all of these major cases starting with CNN's Paula Reid who is taking a closer look at how the mifepristone case could affect millions of women across the United States. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court says it will consider whether to restrict access to a widely used abortion drug. Mifepristone, when taken with another drug, is one of the most commonly used methods of abortion in the U.S. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): Has this abortion drug been on the market for more than two decades? DR. ROBERT CALIFF, FDA: Yes, 23 years, I think.",

And the testimony from three university presidents from Harvard, MIT, and Penn, who failed to say whether calling for the genocide of Jews violated their schools' codes of conduct. That disastrous congressional hearing last week, the president of Penn, of course, resigned five days later.Harvard president Claudine Gay had also been under pressure to resign over her comments at the hearing which she later apologized for. She has also been accused of plagiarizing parts of four papers published between 1993 and 2017. Harvard's governing body says it is, quote, unanimously standing in support of president Gay, despite all of this and their analysis found, quote, no violation of Harvard's standards for research and misconduct. President Gay is proactively requesting for corrections in two articles to insert citations and quotation marks that were omitted from the original publications. And now, House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who has been leading the charge to highlight antisemitism across college campuses, is calling out for her alma mater to no longer stand by its president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): This is a moral failure of Harvard's leadership and higher education leadership at the highest levels. And the only change they have made to their code of conduct, where they failed to condemn calls for genocide of the Jewish people, the only update to the code of conduct is to allow a plagiarist as the president of Harvard.

She declined to come on.So, let's bring on Congressman Raskin. So, Congressman Raskin, your first question to Stefanik was about that dinner that Trump hosted with Fuentes and Kanye West, and another Holocaust denier. You also asked this, quote, you regret endorsing Trump for president 2016, just days after he tweeted an image of the Star of David superimposed over Hillary Clinton's face in a thick pile of cash? Yes or no, Ms. Stefanik? Did you -- did you get a specific response at all to these questions about antisemitism in the Republican ranks? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): No, not at all. She did just what the Ivy League college presidents did according to Ms. Stefanik. She evaded. In fact, she completely dodged the questions. She said that Donald Trump was the greatest president there'd ever been forward Jewish Americans. Then she gave five reasons that were not in answer to my five questions, but they included things like him moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and hit having destroyed the Iran nuclear agreement. Those were all foreign policy issues related to Israel that have nothing to do with the questions I raised about domestic violent antisemitism, like the guy who showed up at the Tree of Life synagogue and murdered 11 in the worst antisemitic attack in American history. She has herself dabbled in great replacement theory. And, of course, the mass murderer in that case invoked great replacement theory about how Jews and George Soros were bringing in alien races to replace the native white population. And that's something that's been invoked in other mass murders, including in Buffalo, in El Paso, Texas, and I asked her to deal with that question. But she wouldn't. So, she completely dodged and evaded everything I asked her about. But there are more and more questions being asked about her indulgence of or embrace of antisemitism by Donald Trump and by the Republican Party.",

We love your country. You have a great prime minister.So, He treats American Jews like basically visiting Israelis, which partakes obviously of antisemitic myths about dual loyalty, and so on. But, you know, the issue with Elise Stefanik is that while she's posing as a great champion of the Jews and an opponent of antisemitism on campus and for college presidents, she won't say anything about presidential antisemitism when it comes to the White House. The real president of the United States and that, of course, is a much greater threat to Jews in America when you have Donald Trump who says things like they are very fine people on both sides of an antisemitic race riot called by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.",

I would immediately dispatch the campus police to go over there to see if anybody is in danger, because in the age of tens of millions of AR-15s in our society and lax Republican gun laws, that person could be an immediate danger to Jews and anybody else there around.And if they're not, they probably need an immediate mental diagnostic.

People in Congress who are about to get swept away with Elise Stefanik's McCarthy-like crusade. She wants to dictate who's going to be college president or university president in private colleges across America. Are these really the worst offenders? A Haitian American president at Harvard, a Jewish American president at MIT? Has she done the complete study of racism and antisemitism in the campuses? Because she was giving hypothetical questions. There might be some real cases of antisemitic violence or racist abuse that are taking place there. And what about the campuses where there's sexual harassment, sexual violence, where presidents are looking the other way? Is that can be our new job? If it is, let's do it systematically and give people some due process rights. In the meantime, the boards of Harvard and MIT have been standing by their presidents.
