And they're urging people to use high quality masks, not just your basic cotton face covering, things like a KN-95, KF-94 and N-95 respirator mask.

Of course, he was. It looks like he's wiping away tears, getting pretty emotional after his son's first touchdown pass. Here's what Brock Purdy said about that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BROCK PURDY, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS QUARTERBACK:  The emotions on their face and just the way they looked down at me from up on the railing, man, it just means a lot. They believed in me even though I was the last draft pick and all that kind of stuff. Like they've always been telling me you're good enough we know that you can do it. And to see them after that performance meant a lot to me. And so I'm very blessed to have them as my family.",

Welcome back to CNN This Morning.And new this morning, back on the court, that is Brittney Griner's agent telling ESPN that the WNBA all-star had a light basketball workout yesterday in Texas yesterday. The workout happened just two days after Griner returned to American soil after nearly ten months in imprisonment in Russia. Griner's first move, appropriately a dunk. All right, so, big picture here, the WNBA fought for Griner's release from Russian detention since last winter. And this is just the latest effort from the league in recent years WNBA members have helped flip a Senate seat in Georgia supporting Reverend Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, when Republican Senator Kelly Loefler, who own the Atlanta Dreams, spoke about against the Black Lives Matter movement. In the summer of 2020, the WNBA dedicated their season, the whole season, to Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old killed by police in that raid of her home. Players wore Breonna Taylor's name on their jerseys in an effort to raise awareness for black female victims of police violence. And then you'll remember this, one month later, when Jacob Blake, an unarmed black man in Wisconsin, was shot seven times in the back by white police officer and partly paralyzed, well, the players once again stood up, postponed several of their games. Some wore shirts that spelled out Blake's name each with seven bullet holes represented. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, who you heard from on the show Friday, told me about a year when we sat down why these players consistently speak up and stand up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I highlighted the NBA and how you guys were leading on social issues during George Floyd, what you did with the jerseys and so on, even ahead, even before the NBA, before the guys did it.I'm just wondering how that ties into it. I think there is a tie between what Trevor Noah said about black women leading the way that they could you know what and find out and how much he had learned from black women in his life.

And I think this is when people are realizing kind of the dangers and perils of people going overseas and the impact of what those pay equity issues are, right?So, we want to start the conversations early so that we don't get to the point. And I think there's just this kind of inherent understanding of black women who want to take care of others and seeing how impactful that is.
