In fact, he stoked those fears. And I've heard for about the last year of Democrats saying, hey, he needs to step aside. You know, these are the two oldest candidates. They're the least popular candidates since we have been polling in the 1930s. And now those cries from Democrats will be louder. I'm sure he's already being lobbied. And the question is whether or not Democrats do that publicly. Because the process is, right, that he has these delegates, and he would have to actually step aside and throw them to someone else.

And so, you know, there is a small cabal that does think about these things, but has it ever been activated?In modern presidential history, we don't know the Democrats who have been in this moment. In fact, for months now, all the talk has been that Republicans will need to do something like a bait-and-switch in the moment where Trump becomes a convicted felon, which he now is. But, still, it seems that, after last night, the onus really is on the Democrats. I don't know that it would be the family, so much as truly the Democratic Party leadership beyond Biden and Harris, to be able to want to be the ones to say, we want to put up someone else. There is a lot of time still before Democrats convene in August for them to do so. There's also this window of time, as I have understood it, for Democrat leadership to do also a replacement of the nominee in the aftermath of the Democrats' convention. For Republicans, it's a bit different, but, again, the calls are not coming from the Republican side. It seems entirely that it's not impractical to replace Biden, because Republicans will not stop. The calls will be relentless about him being too infirm to even finish his time in the White House for this term.",

The last time we really saw him speak publicly in this sort of a forum, he actually went dark branded, right, at the State of the Union, and he did exactly what he needed to do.And what he was saying tonight, and when his policy points got through, there was no cognitive decline. There were issues with communication. And so if it's just on policy and the issues, you know, Biden was clearly the person who was the most articulate in his positions in this debate. I mean, Donald Trump, when he was in the White House, he lied, according to the Washington Post, 30,573 times over four years. And I was reminded tonight how easily he just, the lies just slip off his tongue. So if it was a matter of substance, Biden took it, but if it's a matter of style, which that's what debates are truly about, we really don't remember the issues. Trump really knocked this out of the park. And it's important to note that in five presidential debates, this is the first one that he has won.",

I mean, are we forgetting the pullout from Afghanistan? That is where Trump nailed him continually.You know, the deaths of 13 service members were not mentioned by Biden. And I think there was a moment in which I think everybody felt, how can this continue? It was a tough debate to watch when Trump brought out lie after lie. And Biden at times couldn't even finish his sentence, felt confused at moments because of how he worded things. You know, I just think on its face, what we saw was truly Biden bringing a knife to a gunfight. I hate to use that cliche there, but it couldn't apply more. I mean, this is a situation where you've got a former president who chose to take a certain direction with that debate last night when he saw what he was up against. Trump chose to use lies in the place of substantive policy points. Biden came again and again with what he's accomplished in office, but all that was glossed over because of his delivery. So, again, places where Biden didn't land punches, I was disappointed. He could have done that with abortion. He could have nailed Trump on the border by saying that Trump never finished the wall that he promised. So many missed opportunities. And that's why we are sitting in this place today where you truly have to question who can take down Trump.

So just to keep that in mind, as you see these results, that little bit of shift won't make a difference here. Look at the big question of the night.Who won the debate? We asked debate watchers in our instant poll. And the answer is a resounding Donald Trump did. 67 percent of debate watchers in our poll say Donald Trump won the debate tonight. Joe Biden, 33 percent say he won the debate tonight. Now, this group of debate watchers, they told us who they thought would win the debate going into it before the debate. And take a look at how that changed over time. 55 percent thought before the debate that Donald Trump would win the debate. 45 percent thought Joe Biden would win the debate. Look at what the debate did to those expectations. That's when Donald Trump did much better than expected. Joe Biden did worse than expected among this group. And compare this to these two men debating four years ago. That's not always a comparison we have. Obviously, the rematch is pretty unique. And so take a look at the complete reversal. Again, that top line there is the debate tonight. 67 percent say Trump won. 33 percent said Biden. The next line is the second debate in 2020 where Biden won there by about 14 percentage points. 53, 39 in our instant poll that night. This looks a little bit more like the first debate. Chris Wallace moderated, 60 percent, Joe Biden won that debate that night. 28 percent said Donald Trump won the debate that night.
