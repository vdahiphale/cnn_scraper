Hamas claims that the Bibas family members, the mom and the two kids, were killed in an Israeli airstrike, although that has not been confirmed.

Hamas claims that some of the women still being held captive are, in fact, soldiers. It's a claim that Israel rejects. Now, you might have noticed that most of those women are in their teens or 20s. One of them you saw being kidnapped and she had a bloody stain soaking her pants between her legs. And if you are worried about what Hamas might be doing with these women in their teens and twenties, you are not alone. Sources tell me that this is in fact a big fear among top Israeli officials. And we heard a bit more about this fear, and that's all it is as of right now, a fear, from the U.S. State Department earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I am convinced though every single civilian death and especially children is a tragedy, and we don't want to see it. In comparative numbers, if you compare Israel to perfection, of course we'll fall short.

I mean, what Mark Milley did was stand up in defense of the Constitution.And so the worry, obviously, is there's an extremely stringent process for picking generals, right? Very, very a political process. It's always about competence. It's always about sterling character and experience. And there's a real worry that Trump will reach down into the pool of colonels, let's say, which is a much bigger pool and pick people again, who are obedient to him. The thing that Trump never understood about his, quote unquote, generals, so he used to say my generals, they're not his generals. They're the Constitution's generals. The generals are there to defend the Constitution. They report to the President, but they are mandated by law to resist illegal orders. And so the worry in the next Trump administration, if there is one is that, he will pick people again, as he might do in the Justice Department, pick people to be generals who are loyal to him and not to the Constitution. And that is a serious anxiety that people should have.",

Which sounds silly, but if you know history, there is democratic backsliding.Go -- people out there, go ahead and Google democratic backsliding, it's a term.

I mean, look, a lot of the things that we talk about could have -- that might happen in a second Trump term might sound paranoid are alarmist, right? But the reality is, you have to look at the record of the man who is seeking the presidency. And he has shown time and time again, that he doesn't acknowledge democratic guardrails. He doesn't care about democratic institutions. He cares about himself and his own preservation of power.And so what the basement of that, what the floor of that is, is open for debate. But I think that none of us are going to err in being too cautious about speculating about what happens. I think that it's all rooted in his own record and what he's saying out loud as a presidential candidate.",
