Still on their to-do list right now, several decisions, including important cases on abortion, guns, and, of course, former President Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity. All still to be decided before the summer recess.CNN's Joan Biskupic following all of this. And, Joan, as is tradition, Joan, June is crunch time for this court especially.

But they're - they are the ones that I think most of our audience would be watching most closely. And the really overriding one is Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal trial for four counts of election subversion in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the Justice Department. A lower court said that that case could go forward, but the Supreme Court has stepped in and essentially delayed the trial. So, we'll see where that one goes.The other one involves the January 6th defendants who are objecting to being charged with - under a statute that makes it a crime to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding. And the question there is, mostly an element b, destruction of actual evidence. But that one could also affect Donald Trump, but it could affect many more January 6th defendants. And then we have two really important ones involving abortion access. And it was two years ago, Kate, as you recall, that the Supreme Court struck down all constitutional abortion rights. And the two cases in that area are, one, involving the federal Food and Drug Administration's expansion of access to the abortion medication drug known as Mifepristone. And whether the FDA's approval and wider access to that drug can stand. The other one involves - applies to states, like Idaho, which is in the second case, that have bans on abortion, and how they might - must have to accommodate a federal law that insurers that women who - whose health is at risk, and might need an abortion in an emergency room setting, how they can still get that kind of emergency care, even in states that ban abortion, Kate.",

And that leaves a lot of recipe for fire. And that is what we're witnessing here across the San Joaquin County region.The good news is that the winds have died down. But the backdrop to this is that the mercury in the thermometer is skyrocketing. In fact, today we have heat warnings in place. Las Vegas could feel temperatures up to 120 degrees. That would be the heat index. But excessive heat watch across parts of Arizona and into the central valley of California, where the San Joaquin and the Corral Fire is currently ongoing. And 120 record high temperatures throughout the next couple of days. And you can see how triple digit heat will blanket places like Palm Springs, to Phoenix, to Las Vegas. But right along this - this ridge of high pressure that's bringing the heat over the southwestern U.S., there has been active severe weather. And that's what we're monitoring for the day today. We have another multi-day severe weather setup that is taking shapes. So, Chicago, Dallas, Little Rock to Jackson. And then for the day tomorrow, we see from Des Moines to Kansas City. Currently right now, a severe thunderstorm watch with some stronger thunderstorms moving into the Oklahoma City area by about noon local time.

To put that into some perspective for you, in the entire month of April, Trump plus the RNC raised 76 plus million dollars. So basically Trump, according to Lara Trump and the RNC, raised the equivalent of an entire month in 48 hours. There was a lot of Republican coalescing around the former president of the United States.And I will just point out, Kate, it does seem that appearing in court does pay off for Donald Trump because look at the Trump big fundraising days.

That's what he is speaking to.

Actually, x investigation in this case, because it happened on CNN, and I'm not sure if it caught a lot of attention, but it gets to some of the tensions within the Republican Party. Our Manu Raju was talking former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and Matt Gaetz, congressman from Florida, the issue around Matt Gaetz came up. And there had been a federal investigation into Gaetz into whether there was some kind of trafficking with under age women. That investigation, as far as we know, was dropped. And Gaetz denies it. Yet McCarthy, the former speaker, still seems really upset with Matt Gaetz over the fact that Matt Gaetz helped get him bumped from the speaker's chair.
