And former president Donald Trump ahead in Arizona. Harris tonight addressing concerns from some Democrats with just weeks to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Listen, this is -- there's no question I say to my rallies. This is a tight race. It is a margin of error race. And that's why I'm out here and will continue for the next 24 days to be traveling around our country, talking with folks about the issues that matter most to them, and offering them what I believe to be solutions.

The Harris campaign also seeking to draw a comparison after Harris's doctor detailed her medical history in a new letter saying she was in, quote, \"excellent health.\" The campaign hoping to put pressure on 78-year-old Trump to be more transparent.And as this race for the White House comes down to the wire, many are looking to the polls to get a sense of where this race stands. Look, there's one person right there, Harry Enten, our CNN senior data reporter. Harry, this race is incredibly close. I don't have to tell you that. Everyone I know asked me, what's going to happen, and the bottom line is, it's just really close. We don't know. HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA CORRESPONDENT: I have no clue what's going to happen. And you know, what's so amazing to be about this race is I thought it was close in a month of September, somehow it's become even closer. You can see it in these Great Lake battleground states. You go back three weeks ago it was a tight race in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Three points in Michigan, two points in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. You come today, holy Toledo, holy cow, look at Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Now we got a one-point race. It's somehow even tighter. And if we expand that out, we don't just look at the Great Lake battleground states. We look at the sunbelt battleground states as well. And somehow -- I mean, look at these numbers. They're crazy. One, one, one, one, one, one, and then Arizona is a relative blow out at a two-point margin for Donald Trump. I mean, all of these states are so close, these seven pivotal battleground states. And as I've mentioned, they've somehow become even tighter. The bottom line is, is we have 24 days until the election. You know, I make my living on trying to tell folks who's going to win. And I got to be honest with you, I haven't got the faintest clue.",

So let's talk about black male voters. All right? Look at the margins. And what we see is we see, compare it to where we were four years ago, compare it to where we were eight years ago.Look, Hillary Clinton won among black male voters by 71 points. Joe Biden won amongst them by 69 points. Those are within the margin of error of each other. But take a look, The \"New York Times\"-Sienna College poll that came out this morning has Kamala Harris ahead but by only 50 points. You know, if I were to go back through the history books, I think you'd have to go back to probably the early 1960s, probably the election between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy back in 1960 to see a Democratic candidate leading among black male voters by this small of a margin. It's truly something that we've seen across the surveys, something is going on whereby, look, we're used to seeing a gender gap among white voters, but now we're seeing a very large gender gap among black voters. You see it right here. Kamala Harris again ahead, but doing historically poorly for a Democrat among black male voters. Donald Trump, give him some credit doing historically well for a Republican candidate, at least in the polling so far among black male voters.",

If you look at the polling based models, they on average give Kamala Harris a 53 percent chance of winning.Folks, these are in the exact same neighborhood. The only thing you can really take away from either the polling models or the bettors is that it is a coin toss. I love elections. I study elections, I watch old election night tapes. I can tell you that in any point that I've been following elections, at this point in the campaign, there has not been a single one as close as this one with 24 days left to go.

Yes, I'd point out that while the 2000 election didn't look this close 24 days out, it came down in the end to 537 votes in Florida. 537 votes in Florida. So you never know whether a race that looks very, very close will actually end up very, very close, or a race that looks like there's a decent margin for one candidate will end up that way.So we're much better off, as much as we love the numbers, and certainly Harry and I are two people who love the numbers, but people are much better off focusing on their choice and trying to get their choice elected in whatever ways are open to them. So that's what I would say about that. Now, look, it is close but none of the polls are the holy grail. You know, they were not handed down by God to Moses on the mountain. So -- and they changed from day to day. And we can all site contradictory polls, even in Arizona. I agree three with Harry, there's a plus five in \"The New York Times\"-Sienna poll for Trump in Arizona. But we've also seen other decent polls recently where Harris was ahead by one or two, or Trump was ahead by one or two. So you never know, and it's well within the margin of error. So my message to people is calm down. Take a chill pill, and go to work for your candidate. And we'll all find out together, whenever that is. It may not be election day. I hope it's over that week.

And he and his team believed that it could help propel him to the White House in November.Now, one of the things to pay attention to here is just how dark he has begun. As you said, he referred to Aurora as a war zone. At one point, he referred to the country as occupied America. We talk about this idea of him using this fear-based rhetoric and it has been incredibly ramped up. Even on the stage before he took the stage in Aurora, Colorado, they had giant slides behind him, images that looked to be AI of hooded figures with guns saying, your apartment complexes under Kamala Harris. The next slide was your life is better under Donald Trump. But again, this fear-based messaging is something that they believe is working for them and if you look at the recent poll numbers, it's not clear that it's not working for him. We have seen how tight this race is. We have seen how close those margins are. There are thousands of people here. There were thousands of people in Colorado.

My district, California's 25th District where he stands, has the most renewable energy production than any other district in the state of California or the entire nation for that matter.

We passed the Farm Workforce Modernization Act by the -- with the endorsement of a lot of growers in the Farm Bureau. The second concern is to make sure that any immigration policies have comprehensive immigration reform that will have a pathway to citizenship and that will secure the border so that we prevent drugs, guns, or people who want to harm people from entering our country. But one of the things that's very important, and this is what Kamala Harris has excelled on, is to address the root causes of immigration, that will lead people to flee an authoritarian, violent government, that will lead people to flee from starvation due to natural disasters, or a failed government where there's drug lords who are terrorizing their communities, and invest in hope by bringing in the American private industry to also open up transparency and fight against corruption. Look, I was there with Kamala Harris at the inauguration of the first woman president of Honduras, where she specifically fought for our country and said that we need you to have more transparency, have anti-corruption policies, so that American businesses can come and invest and to create hope and opportunity so that people in Honduras will stay in Honduras.

But if they come out anywhere near what Zelenskyy wants, then it's going to be something that the Ukrainians can probably hang their hat on for at least another year or so.",

      "sentences": "So that Cabinet session now expected for Sunday has a lot to talk about and it's worth saying that the country has now come out of the High Holy Days of Yom Kippur and a week ago, Rosh Hashanah in the middle of that, the October 7th commemoration. So, the sort of political landscape going forward doesn't have any sort of big national bumps in it, if you will.We know that there is going to be discussion or we're expecting there to be discussion about how Israel should respond to Iran's ballistic missile strikes over a couple of weeks ago under extreme pressure from the United States to keep the response proportional, and not escalate tensions in the region. It is still not clear what the strikes will look like when they'll come. I think the only certainty at the moment is that they will come, but in the midst of all of this, you know, the Cabinet has to deal with a war on two fronts, the one in the south and the one in north. And in the north against Hezbollah, they've expanded the operations across the Lebanese border there, declaring another close military zone, telling another 24 Lebanese villages, 19 of them new ones adding totaling the list. Now, villages that they've told this, given them evacuation orders, to move away from the border for an extended period up to 30 miles away, 136 villages now fall into that category. So, the northern border -- the airstrikes as well, continuing so the pace of operations on that northern front, likely getting discussion as well because that is heating up. And over that period of the Yom Kippur, the IDF saying that incoming that was from 6:00 PM Friday to 6:00 PM Saturday, incoming 320 missiles and on Saturday, some of those missiles or intercepts from them, raining shrapnel down on villages in the north, three people there, three civilians were injured in that. And in Gaza, more evacuation orders being issued by the IDF telling tens of thousands of more people to evacuate their homes in the North of Gaza to get out of the way of what they described as forceful military operations. This could last for an extended period. More and more people in the North of Gaza facing these evacuation orders right now, as the IDF says, that its going after Hamas there, that is trying to reconstitute. So a lot for the Cabinet to be discussing. But center focus for the people of Israel and of course for the region, the discussions about how to respond to Iran. Nic Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv.
