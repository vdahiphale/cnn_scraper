So, the first one we are watching is in the House Financial Services Committee. That is where we are going to hear testimony from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.Yesterday, he received quite the bipartisan grilling in the Senate and so he's going to be in the hot seat again today. He was grilled over interest rates and jobs. So, I expect we'll hear more of the same today. And the second hearing we're watching is in the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee, which is having a hearing on aviation safety, something that has been in the news quite a lot lately. They'll hear from the FAA acting administrator, and it comes, of course, amid this new string of incidents, safety incidents, as well as new scrutiny on the FAA, which we should point out still does not have a permanent leader. So, this will be an opportunity for lawmakers to ask what is going on with all of these close calls that are happening on runways lately. And, finally, the third we are watching is in the Senate Intel Intelligence Committee, which is having its worldwide threats hearing. They're going to hear from top intelligence officials, including the CIA director and the FBI director. We are expecting China to be a big focus of that hearing, of course. And it's also just an interesting every year, because the public and lawmakers do not always get the opportunity to hear directly from the intelligence committee. So, we are watching a number of different topics and, of course, no shortage of news here on Capitol Hill today. Jim and Erica?",

They wanted to support her on this road trip down to Mexico for that medical procedure. She said that when she saw that video that Rosa was just talking about, she feared that her daughter was going to die. And now she's trying to process the fact that Woodard did pass away and trying to sort of go through that. She didn't want to talk too much about him.

A producer on special report, their political newscast, texted to Kristin Fisher, saying that he had to leave because he no longer could defend -- imagine defending where he worked to his infant daughter as she grew up trying to teach her the right thing. He didn't think Fox cared about that anymore.
