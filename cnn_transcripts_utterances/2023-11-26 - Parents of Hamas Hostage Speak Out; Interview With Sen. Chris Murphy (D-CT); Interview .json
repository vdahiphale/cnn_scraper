Hamas is set to release more Israeli hostages from Gaza, including, we are learning, an American citizen. This is the third day of a four-day pause in fighting. Israeli leaders have a list of the people who are expected to come home today after weeks in Hamas captivity; 41 hostages, 26 of them Israeli, are already home now. And this morning, the Israeli prime minister's office said they believe 201 hostages still remain in Gaza. We saw a 9-year-old Emily Hand run into her father's arms. He was originally told that Emily was dead, before learning she was a hostage, so this moment of pure joy was once unimaginable for him. For others, the reunions are bittersweet. The Or children were released Saturday. Their mother was murdered on October 7, and their father is still being held by Hamas. The question now, whether this fragile truce could hold longer than four days, allowing more aid into Gaza and more hostages to come home. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live in Kerem Shalom. Jeremy, what's the latest?",

But even though those two releases showed the promise of this deal with Hamas, yesterday, we also saw its fragility, as there were multiple issues that led to delays, hours-long delays in those hostages ultimately being released, Hamas claiming that Israel was not allowing sufficient aid into Gaza. But I'm also learning now of another major behind-the-scenes struggle. Israeli officials pushed to try and include the mother of 13-year-old Hila Rotem, who was released as part of the 13 Israeli hostages yesterday, but who wasn't released was her mother. And that is not in keeping with what we have seen in recent days, where mothers and children who were taken hostage together have been released together. I'm told that Israeli officials fought hard behind the scenes yesterday to try and get the mother included. But, at this point, her condition, her whereabouts are simply not known. But now, Dana, we are looking at next steps, not only trying to sort out whether today's release will go forward, if everything will go smoothly, or if we will have bumps in the road like yesterday, but also looking forward. We are on day three now. Tomorrow will be day four, which is the last official day of this 50 Israeli hostages deal in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. But there is an option to extend, 10 additional hostages per day, earn an additional day of truce and 30 more Palestinian prisoners. So now officials will turn to that issue as well to see if this truce can be extended -- Dana.",

And so I think that their main priority has to be degrading Hamas' capability to militarily strike against Israel and its people again. You can't ask the Israeli people who survived the attack to return to their homes near the Gaza border if you have not degraded Hamas' military. So I think that needs to be priority number one in terms of making these judgments. And I have no problem with continuing to negotiate for hostage release.

The long-term peace and stability of Israel depends upon the degrading of Hamas' military capability. And it has to be the highest priority, because Hamas is trying to wipe Israel off the map. And they're doing so with Iranian, North Korean and Russian assistance. And so the U.S. has to be supportive of what Israel is trying to do militarily, but always provide the kind of advice that friends provide in terms of when is enough enough.

And there should be no campus in this country where a Jewish student is afraid to leave their dorm, a Jewish student is afraid to go to their classes, a Jewish student is afraid to go to even have a meal in the dining hall. I mean, that is outrageous and it's wrong. I think governors in those individual states should be sending State Police to make sure that they're protected on those campuses. And we need to have university presidents who are willing to stand up and be counted against hate. And that's exactly what's going on here. We saw this display also at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. These are folks who are ignorant. And when they talk about intifada, my guess is, two-thirds of them don't even know what intifada is.

Ultimately, Hamas will get stronger, not weaker, in the long run, if all of this civilian death allows them to recruit more effectively and ably inside Gaza. Listen, we regularly condition our aid to allies based upon compliance with U.S. law and international law. And so I think it's very consistent with the ways in which we have dispensed aid, especially during wartime, to allies, for us to talk about making sure that the aid we give Ukraine or the aid we give Israel...",

I ultimately think we need to sort of think really hard about the way in which our young people are receiving information about this conflict. We need to hold accountable the social media sites, in particular, TikTok, which is just full of virulent pro-Hamas and antisemitic material. The college campuses need to have a better means of accountability for this kind of hate speech. But we also have to recognize that these young people are getting their information from somewhere, often from a Chinese-controlled social media platform that has in its interests trying to turn America against each other. And one of the means they may be doing that is trying to promote a lot of pretty hateful and divisive material about the conflict in Gaza.",

And it obviously was more important to him to see to see people than to take care of his living arrangement. One of his friends told us how he told her, \"Oh, I have to go and see an apartment.\" Then she convinced him to go and see the sunset on the beach instead. (LAUGHTER) O. NEUTRA:  And they ended up talking about life. And, eerily enough, she told -- he told him about us, and she said that he even mentioned to her how he knows that, if anything happened to him, his parents would do anything for him.
