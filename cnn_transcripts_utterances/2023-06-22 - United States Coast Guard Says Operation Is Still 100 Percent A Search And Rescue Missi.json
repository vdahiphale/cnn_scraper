Although, the U.S. Coast Guard says it's not entirely clear what those noises are. A state-of-the-art French robot, capable of operating at more than 6,000 meters underwater is on its way to the search side. It's not able to lift the sub on its own, but it could hook it to a ship that can then get it to the surface. OceanGate expeditions lost contact with the Titan, early Sunday, less than two hours into its dive. Each trip begins with 96 hours' worth of oxygen. Meaning, Thursday morning could be a key deadline for finding the sub.
