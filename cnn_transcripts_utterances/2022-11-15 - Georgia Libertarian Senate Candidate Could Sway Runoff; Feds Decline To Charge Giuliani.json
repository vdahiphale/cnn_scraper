I'm glad to be with both of you. It doesn't have the effect of giving any type of legal shield. You know, and I've been on your show before and I've been pretty critical of the legal performance that Trump has had so far. I mean, I think he's been lackluster, that might be generous to say that. But you got every prosecutor around this, get their knives out for him now, and he needs to move to take the offensive position as opposed to being defensive. And so essentially what he's doing, and I think it's, you know, good legal advice, or whoever he's talking to him is giving good advice. Get out in front. That way, you're going to have access to a 24-hour news cycle, the tail everybody in the country that all these investigations are a witch hunt. And I don't think the case ever gets to a jury because I think there'll be appellate decisions that (INAUDIBLE). But as you go forward, it takes just one year to also believe it's a witch hunt.",

And I don't know that this really has a lot of impact. But if you go forward in some kind of broad conspiracy climate, he's a big puppet master. And if you're just believe this, then you can understand how Trump's a leader. You have to do anything for your calls and people to reach or your calls for people to have to make too many steps and not keeping a case simple, I think it can have an effect.
