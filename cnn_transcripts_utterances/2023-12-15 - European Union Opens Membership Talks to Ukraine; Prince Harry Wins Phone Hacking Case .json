And we should note that those two things are tied, that the U.S. has been the leader here. And the concern is that if the U.S. doesn't stand up, its European allies might not stand up either. Congressman Mike Quigley, who's a member of the Ukraine caucus, he said to me, if we go south, speaking of the U.S., our allies will, too. And that speaks to the decision you just highlighted there, which is that the E.U., overnight, their continued aid blocked by Hungary, often an ally of Putin. And already, Erica and Poppy, Ukrainian forces have been forced to ration ammunition. They've already been outfired, outgunned by Russian forces there, by ratios as high as five to one, seven to one. And as they ration their ammunition, a senior Ukrainian military official told me that the casualties, that's having an effect on the battlefield, that's leading to more Ukrainian casualties.",

Sullivan definitely wants to emphasize to Abbas that the U.S. is trying to pressure Israel on the question of violence in the West Bank since October 7th. While all the focus has been on Gaza, there has been a spike in violence that has seen some, almost 300 Palestinians killed at the hands of extremist Israeli settlers as well as Israeli forces.But then there is a much bigger question about who will govern both the West Bank and Gaza following this war. Israel has made clear they do not want a boss. They do not want the Palestinian Authority. They haven't said clearly what kind of government they actually want, but at the same time, the U.S. is saying it has to be a Palestinian authority that is revamped and revitalized. Does that mean that President Abbas is still at the head of it? That remains unclear. We don't expect Sullivan to come here and say, President Abbas, you need to step down. But he is wildly unpopular among Palestinians. He is seen as corrupt. And at the same time, the American support for Israel means that the Palestinian leader is certainly going to have some very strong words for Jake Sullivan.

And so that got people asking, well, does that mean that the timelines are out of sync? Jake Sullivan says no, that they're not contradictory. There is an expectation that at some point in the future that the war will transition from what they're calling a high intensity phase to a low intensity phase. The White House has made clear they hope that that happens in the near future. They're not putting a specific timeline on it. They're saying that it's going to be conditions-based without laying out exactly what those conditions are. We have reported that U.S. officials are hoping that that is going to be in the next few weeks, not in the next few months. And so we could see these heavy operations continuing now for several more weeks, perhaps until the end of the year, and then that lower intensity phase starting next year.

Have they gained much more intelligence being in Gaza over the last month-and-a- half and now they can do this? Why wouldn't you take that approach from the beginning? MARK ESPER, FORMER TRUMP DEFENSE SECRETARYThe phase of the operation that Jake Sullivan has talked about in my mind is way later. It's almost what you would recall that we did in Afghanistan and Iraq once things were stabilized, where special operators would go in and out in a night raid using helicopters. I don't think they're anywhere near that right now with regard to the operations. That said, I think they should be transitioning to more use of infantry and less dropping of high explosive bombs from the air. That's what it's going to take.",

That's intentional, and those words mean a lot.What we've also learned from intelligence assessments is that nearly half of the bombs Israel is using in Gaza are unguided, right? And so they don't have that precision. Can you speak to what these, I guess, they're called dumb bombs? I don't think a lot of people know what those are, explain what they are. And can you speak to, if you cut out the use of those a lot, does that result in many fewer civilian deaths?",

A guided weapon is guided by either laser or GPS or other means. And so you do have less accuracy. But just because you're using dumb bombs doesn't necessarily mean that you'll cause more casualties. It depends on how they're applied and what situations. I was a little surprised by the number that they're using.But what was interesting is, you're right, on one hand, President Biden came out and said indiscriminate bombing, right, which was not helpful. But then Jake Sullivan came out later and described what I believe is the process by which they go through the Israelis, the IDF, the intent to limit casualties, how they factor in the targets, the proportionality, the use of the appropriate munitions. And the fact that the way Jake described it seemed to suggest that it was not indiscriminate. So, look, there was a difference there. I think better use of not just smart bombs, but bombs with smaller explosives and increased use of infantry to go into these buildings room by room, clear it out. They can make -- they can use more discrimination when it comes to lessening civilian casualties. So, that will be the way forward. But, again, hundreds of miles of tunnel underneath Gaza that's going to need to be cleared at the end of the day.",
