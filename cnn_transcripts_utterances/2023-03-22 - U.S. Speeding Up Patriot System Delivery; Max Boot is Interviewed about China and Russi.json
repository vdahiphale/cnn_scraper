PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: DOD, in close coordination with Ukraine, has made the decision to provide the M1A1 variant of the Abrams tank, which will enable us to significantly expedite delivery timelines and deliver this important capability to Ukraine by the fall of this year.",

Here you can see behind me a decommissioned system, much like the one the Ukrainians will be using once they get back to their home country. BRIG. GEN. SHANE MORGAN, COMMANDING GENERAL, FIRES CENTER OF EXCELLENCE: Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive and absolutely a quick study due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone. It was easier, though never easy, for them to grasp the patriot system operations and maintenance concepts. BERTRAND (voice over): But the stakes are so high that CNN was not allowed to film or photograph the training, an effort to protect the Ukrainians who will be back on the front lines in just a matter of weeks, and to shield the U.S. from blowback from Moscow. U.S. officials emphasizing that the patriots are purely defensive and not a threat to Russia. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a point defense system. It's got to be placed in a location that is defending a target like a capital city, Kiev, or a ports city like Odessa. So, it -- this is not a weapons system that can be moved around on the battlefield based on changing threats.",

These are going to be placed at very strategic locations throughout the country. And Ukraine is only getting two of them. But, Ukraine's air defense systems that they have right now are really not cutting it. They can't protect, for example, against ballistic missile attacks, and Russia has been deploying those more frequently. So, these patriot systems will be a game changer the Ukrainians do believe.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is back in China following a three-day summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite being pegged as a peacemaking journey, their meetings didn't produce any breakthroughs when it comes to Russia's war on Ukraine. Joining us now, Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" Max, good to see you this morning. Certainly did produce plenty of photo ops, which was good I think for both sides in terms of what they wanted out of it. When we look at, though, where this puts the world, John Kirby, saying we can't reasonably look at China as impartial in any way earlier this week. This relationship, he was noting, is more about pushing back against the west, particularly pushing back against the U.S. What's your level of concern about this deepening relationship between China and Russia?",

I might start to hit the panic button if China were actually to start providing munitions for Russia, and particularly artillery shells and missiles. Russia is running low on both of those types of munitions. They desperately need them from somewhere. If China were to provide them, that could really tilt the balance of power in the war in Ukraine. That is not happening so far. China is providing economic support to Russia in the form of microchips and cell phones and other things that are now embargoed by the west.And, of course, China is benefiting from oil that Russia sells to China. But it's still a very much limited partnership, and it's something that is a -- certainly of concern, but it's not -- what China is doing is not a game changer in the war in Ukraine.",

And I think what we're seeing is that, although before the war China and Russia proclaimed this limitless friendship, there are actually sharp limits on their partnership. And you didn't see them talking about limitless partnership during Xi's visit to Moscow. In fact, it's a very limited partnership where they both want to triangulate against the United States. They see the U.S. as their common enemy, but they also have a lot of divisions. And one of the big ones is that China is economically dependent on trade. It's the largest trade nation in the world. And it needs to trade with the United States, it needs to trade with Europe. It does not want to become as isolated and as sanctioned as Russia is. And so there are sharp limits so far on how far Xi is willing to go to buddy up to this indicted war criminal in the Kremlin.",

Just recently China brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore diplomatic relations, which I think was a positive step forward. And that's been sort of the cover for Xi and his visit to Russia is that he is advancing this Chinese peace plan. I don't - I don't see any real -- there's no real evidence that the Chinese peace plan is going to produce peace. But, obviously, it will be a PR win for Xi, and it will at least create some - some, you know, some fodder for propaganda so that he can claim he's not just sticking with Russia, he's actually trying to act as a peacemaker. And so I hope he does talk to President Zelenskyy. I think that would restore a tiny bit of balance in that relationship.",

And, obviously, that's a dealbreaker from the standpoint of Ukraine. I think the actual -- the one thing that China's actually done for pieces is that Xi has made clear he does not approve of Putin's nuclear saber rattling. And since Xi made that clear last fall, you really have not heard Putin engage in those kinds of nuclear threats. So that is the one positive thing that China has done. But, otherwise, it's been largely on the side of Russia, although in a limited kind of way, not offering Putin everything that he wants.",

You know, last week you had the International Criminal Court actually indicting Putin, and so there are not going to be any western leaders who are going to be journeying to Moscow, but this is a way for Putin to signal that he is not isolated, that he has an alternative to the west, and he is - he is cozying up to China, but he's doing so in a very subservient position. You know, at the beginning of the Cold War, Russia was the big brother in China was the little brother. And now that position has been reversed.

Now, look, state investigators have not said what that information is. And in 2015, when Stephen Smith was found dead in the middle of a road in Clarendon (ph) County, it was originally said to be the result of a hit and run.But, look, we have gone through those investigative files from the highway patrol back then. Those investigators did not think it was a hit and run. They said that there was no debris in the ground, his shoes were still on his feet, the injuries on his body did not match with being hit by a car. What we're hearing from law enforcement at the state level today is that they agree with that assessment and that they have been investigating Stephen Smith's death as a homicide since they opened this case. Now, an attorney for Stephen Smith's mother, Sandy, tells us that the chief of SLED, the state law enforcement division, told him that they were waiting until the Murdaugh trial wrapped up so they could basically devote more resources to this but also in case witnesses in the low country area, people who had information about the death of Stephen Smith, that maybe they would feel more comfortable coming forward. Now, we need to be very clear about something. There have been no suspects named in the death of Stephen Smith. There have been rumors and there are a lot of documentaries and podcasts and people on social media talking, but nobody in the Murdaugh family has ever officially been named in connection with Stephen Smith's death. In fact, look, they're still asking for information and tips right now. But Buster Murdaugh's name did get thrown around in some of the interviews after Stephen Smith's body was found with highway patrol investigators. Again, not a suspect. And Buster Murdaugh released a statement this week saying that, look, he's been trying to focus on grieving his mother and his brother, while his father was convicted of killing them, but that he was unable to, quote, ignore the vicious rumors for any longer. He said, this has gone on for far too long. These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death. And my heart goes out to the Smith family. Again, this is a nearly eight years old murder at this point that they are looking into, Erica, John, and they are asking anybody who may have information to please reach out to them. His mother hopes to be able to exhume her son's body to maybe get more information about his death.",
