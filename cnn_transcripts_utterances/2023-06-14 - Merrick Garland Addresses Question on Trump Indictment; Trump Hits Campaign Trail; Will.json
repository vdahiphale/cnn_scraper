This decision comes just as two key indicators show prices did ease quite a bit in the past month. Joining us now, we have CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans. So, Christine, the question I think on everyone's minds is, will the Fed be done raising interest rates, even if they hold them steady this month?",

And we're waiting for Jerome Powell to talk to reporters, and maybe clarify a little bit about the future of rate hikes. But I think there is nearly unanimous expectation the Fed will not raise interest rates today, because, as you said, Brianna, it has raised rates 10 times over the past year in an unprecedented rate- hiking spree to try to control inflation in this country. Indeed, at last check, 99 percent of market participants thought that there would be no rate hike today, that the big news today would be no news, in terms of a rate increase. Very few people think the Fed will raise interest rates. And part of the reason, Brianna, is because the inflation numbers, the last couple of days, at least, have been coming in very, very well. We saw consumer inflation yesterday come in at the slowest in two years. And then producer prices -- that's factory level inflation -- today came in at 1.1 percent. That is an incredibly low number that has a lot of people hoping that the Fed's work is starting to pay off.",

So that is a below-normal number, which is really remarkable, considering what we have had to happen over the past year or so.And when you look at consumer prices, consumer prices are now rising more slowly than wages. So, for a long time, we were talking about wage growth was so good in this country, except all that wage growth was being eaten up by higher prices you pay for everything. Finally, that's not the case anymore. And wage gains are bigger than the consumer -- consumer price gains. So that's an interesting moment for consumers and might give consumers a little bit of breathing room. But this Fed meeting, we should reiterate this matters to every single family, because, when the Fed raises interest rates, it raises borrowing costs for everyone, and it taps the brakes on the economy, which can affect jobs and can affect all other parts of the economy that you and I both feel every day. So that's why this is always such big news when the Fed moves or, in this case, won't move.",

Right now, we're just still in the magistrate phase, right? So Donald Trump has entered that not guilty plea. He has the provisions that he has set. And then there's a couple of things that are going to happen in the next couple of days or weeks. So, in two weeks, Walt Nauta is going to be entering a not guilty plea. We do know that he didn't yet because he doesn't have an attorney in Florida to help out his existing legal team. But once he gets that, he's going to be putting that plea in. He has been arrested, as well has been processed, just like Donald Trump. But, after that, then the prosecutors are going to provide a list to the defense team who Donald Trump and Walt Nauta can't discuss the case with. They can also speak to one another about the details of this case. And then they will start turning over evidence as well. So the Justice Department has all of the evidence they have collected in this case, and they have to hand that over to Walt Nauta and Donald Trump, especially things that they have collected that would be considered exculpatory, that could help their defenses.

Now, the Justice Department could make an argument that the judge's ruling so slowly and so unfavorably against the Justice Department as to indicate that she's acting with bias. But you really don't have a lot of latitude here, because what you have is, have nine -- how many federal judges -- 900 nationwide, 900 little fiefdoms. And they run their own worlds. And as long as they're not violating the law, they really have a lot of latitude to take as much time as they want.",

This is just something we will have to watch very closely. I don't think DOJ has many options at this point. But they will -- they will certainly stay on top of it.
