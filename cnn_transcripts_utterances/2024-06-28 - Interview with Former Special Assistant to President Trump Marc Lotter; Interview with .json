In a televised presidential debate, optics are everything, but the devil is also in the detail. Last night, a fumbling Joe Biden faced a serial liar, Donald Trump, in the first live debate. Today, Democrats are in damage control mode and Republicans are jubilant. But speaking to his supporters after at a watch party, President Biden appeared unfazed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  He's just a liar.

America now faces a choice, a visibly aging man who failed to live up to that moment or an authoritarian leaning convicted felon, facing even more courtroom trials ahead. According to a post-debate CNN SSRS poll, 81 percent of voters said the debate didn't affect their vote choice. Few people are as well placed to discuss the current moment and the momentum going into this summer's conventions than veteran democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, and Marc Lotter, who served as special assistant to President Trump and was director of strategic communications for his 2020 campaign.

So, you know, when people remember back to the Trump administration, they remember we had a strong economy, no inflation, a secured border, and all of the problems they face right now fall at the feet of Joe Biden. So, I think so many of the voters out there look at these kinds of debates through that prism. And if a candidate on either side makes a misstatement, like Joe Biden saying no troops died on his watch, despite the fact that 13 Americans were killed in his botched Afghanistan withdrawal, they're probably going to wash a little bit of that under the rug for both sides because they're unscripted, without a teleprompter, recalling all of this.

So, Donald Trump, as you said, Marc, made strong claims. But listen, 16 Nobel prize-winning economists have warned that a second Trump term would reignite inflation. They say Joe Biden's economic agenda is vastly superior to Donald Trump's. Also, as you know, Marc, and I'm sure you've been reading these, he, Donald Trump, had a meeting with executives just in the last few days, and they said remarkably meandering, couldn't keep a straight thought and was all over the map. And it's also been pointed out by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at Yale that not a single person among Forbes 100 CEOs has donated to Trump's campaign. So, these are facts.

They actually lowered people's taxes. Real, hardworking, middle class Americans saw their taxes go down. They saw the amount of revenue to the federal government go up. We saw jobs coming back. Obviously, we were recovering when the pandemic -- from the pandemic as the election took place, and we had no inflation. 1.4 percent when the -- when Joe Biden took office.

You also have Donald Trump campaigning Friday in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Hasn't been Republican in 20 years. Minnesota's now in play. So, the swing state map is growing in Donald Trump's favor.

We'll see what it does. We'll know soon. Listen, there's going to be a debate. There is -- there's no question that -- the question that whether, you know, Joe Biden should step down is going to be debated now. I mean, it's -- we're past that point, given what's happened.

He botched killing millions of people. He closed businesses. He closed schools, losing their homes, people all over this country. America was flat on his back.

That's why I call him Donald Herbert Hoover Trump. And then he lied about how great he was for veterans.

And not, crucially, that split screen with Donald Trump. He had a chance there to draw that distinction before American voters' eyes of how he talked versus how the former president talked. And that's not to minimize Donald Trump's many lies yesterday, but in terms of energy and focus and clarity, I mean, it's a tale of two different Bidens, isn't it, what we saw there and what we saw last night.",

We have to acknowledge that. And listen, Trump -- Biden's going to have a lot of rallies in the coming days and weeks, and I'm sure he'll try to hit that point. And by the way, there is a format difference as well, right? I mean, it did look that the president was reading from a teleprompter there, much as he was the State of the Union night when he performed so well, by all accounts. Is that the difference going forward? We'll see. But certainly, the debate format last night did not serve those interests.

The regime has urged people to vote as a way of legitimizing its rule. Now, in this snap poll, which comes just a month after the hardline President Raisi died in a helicopter crash, four candidates who are remaining on the ballot, all were men, millions of Iranians, though, have been expected to boycott the election. Disillusionment with violent crackdowns on protests and women's rights, and their own dire economic situation are forefront. And for more analysis, let's bring in the New York Times reporter, Farnaz Fassihi, who has covered Iran for decades. She's an Iran expert and joins me from New York. Farnaz Fassihi, let me just start by asking you, because I know the Trump debate and Biden debate went around the world. And the Iranians do -- I'm not even talking about the people, but the regime is constantly trying to figure out who's going to be president and what they should do in terms of their policies in the light of it. Give us a little bit of how much the American presidency matters, even in a place like Iran. FARNAZ FASSIHI, REPORTER COVERING IRAN, THE NEW YORK TIMES AND U.N. BUREAU CHIEF, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Hi, Christiane. Thank you so much for having me. So, the U.S. presidential election factored pretty largely in the Iranian presidential (INAUDIBLE). Most of the candidates, when they were speaking at rallies (INAUDIBLE) each other on television, kept saying that the next president of the U.S. is going to be Trump and I'm the best person to deal with him. So, there was kind of a rivalry and a foregone conclusion in their minds that Trump is going to be the next president, and Iran needs to have sort of a strong conservative or -- on the reformist side, a reformist president. So, you know, President Trump was really -- had a presence in the Iranian debates and election rallies.",

Even though there's a reformist candidate, as you mentioned, when you were giving the summary of the situation in Iran, there's widespread voter apathy. I think that the government qualified a reformist candidate this time to make the election appear more competitive, to bring in the reform faction, which had boycotted the parliament elections and try to incite people to come out and vote. But in practice, we're seeing that the majority of Iranians, if we just go by what the turnout has been, are saying no to the Islamic Republic. And the -- you know, there's a lot, of sort, of disillusionment that really change can come through the ballot box. Iranians have gone through many presidential elections. You and I have been on the ground in previous elections where they had hope for change, they came out and voted, nothing really happened. And we're seeing that reflection in the polls today, that even the reformist candidate hasn't been able to really rally the crowds.",

I'm going to just tell you -- ask you to stand by, Farnaz, for a second, because we now have our correspondent in Iran, who is Fred Pleitgen.

The Imamzadeh Saleh Shrine on Tajrish Square, of course, as you know, you've been here so many times. And there is a polling station out here. You're absolutely right. And as you can see, at that polling station, there are actually still fairly decent lines that we can see here. We can see a lot of people still here lining up. This is the men's section. There's a women's section that's also next door. To us, it seems as though, Christiane, many people are coming out and voting a little bit later then maybe they did, for instance, in the parliamentary election that was held earlier in the year, because it was extremely hot today throughout the course of the day. So, I think many people waited for things to cool down. We are now, of course, past 9:00 p.m., going on to 10:00 p.m. here, local time in Tehran. The local authorities have already said that they have extended the voting until at least 10:00 p.m. They might extend it a little bit further after that. What we've seen -- and we've been at three polling stations here in Tehran, in various places, in the center of Tehran, a little bit in the north of Tehran as well. I think from what we saw the participation to us from the small sample that we had looked as though there might have been a little more people actually going to the polls than, for instance, in the parliamentary election a couple of months ago. There was interestingly one gentleman that we spoke to, spoke very good English, and he told us that he was a young voter, he was 28 years old, and he believed that because there was a moderate on the ballot that he was coming to vote. And he'd actually brought his friend as well. And he said that because there's a moderate now on the ballot that he wanted to also come and cast his ballot as well. Again, these are very small sample sizes. There is also absolutely no doubt -- and we've been around Tehran the past couple of days, since Monday, and certainly, there were a lot of people who told us that they, frankly, we're not going to come out and vote at all. However, the fact that there are, sort of, at least two different political streams to choose from now may have mobilized, at least, a few people to come to the ballot boxes. Of course, we're going to see that tomorrow when we find out what exactly the turnout has been. And of course, also the results as well, Christiane.",

They are mostly determined by Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, and by the Revolutionary Guards when it comes to these regional militant groups. However, we've seen in -- you know, precedent shows us that different administrations in Iran make a little bit of a difference. They set the domestic agenda and they do have influence over some foreign policy issues. We saw that, you know, the government of President Rouhani managed to negotiate and sign a nuclear deal with western powers and had more of an open approach, and social things were a little bit eased up, including, you know, enforcement of hijab. And then, when President Raisi came or when President Ahmadinejad was that we saw when conservative government comes, there's more of a defiant attitude, there's more this attitude that -- you know, that President Raisi sort of turned away from the west and pivoted Iran to what Russia and China and really strengthen those ties, selling drones to Russia for the war in Ukraine, selling oil at a discounted rate to China.
