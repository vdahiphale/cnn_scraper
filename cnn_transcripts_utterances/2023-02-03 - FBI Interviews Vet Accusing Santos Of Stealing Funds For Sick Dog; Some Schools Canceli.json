According to the American Heart Association, heart disease kills more women than all forms of cancer combined. There is good news though because many cases can be prevented. So here to tell us about that is CNN's medical correspondent, Dr. Tara Narula. And also with us is journalist and T.V. personality Star Jones who is a national volunteer for the American Heart Association and had open-heart surgery to fix an aortic valve malfunction in 2010. I want to talk about that experience because I know it's so personal for you. But Doctor, first, can you just tell us what are -- what are the numbers? What is the data here of just how concerning this actually should be for women and men who are watching? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  You said it in the intro. We say it every year. It is the leading cause of death for women in this country. It kills more women than all forms of cancer -- one woman every minute. And every year we come on T.V. and we talk about the statistics. But I think what has to start happening is this has to become personal for women. They have to understand that this is their sister, their mother, their best friend, their coworker. We have to realize that there is no face of what cardiovascular disease looks like. I can look like you or you, or me. I had a woman in my office yesterday who was shocked at 50 years old. She was the picture of health. She runs, she eats well. She was shocked to find out that she had heart disease.

It can look like jaw pain, arm pain, back pain, shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, fatigue, palpitations, lightheadedness or passing out, or even breaking out into a cold sweat or nausea. So there's a whole host of symptoms. And unfortunately, a lot of times we hear oh, I just thought it was anxiety or my acid reflux. And I always say we want to make sure it's not your heart, first and foremost, and then we can look at everything else. But it's important to recognize those warning signs. And again, if you feel it, seek care. Don't put it off. Don't put yourself on the bottom of your priority list. Put your health on the top. It's so, so important. Women tend to do that all the time.
