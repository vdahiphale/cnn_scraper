I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" former U.S. President Donald Trump just hours away from facing a judge in his third indictment, this one for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election. Coup leaders in Niger meet with Wagner-backed military neighbors as the U.S. orders all non-essential personnel out of the country. And a Canadian real estate agent gets slapped with a $17,000 fine after surveillance video catches him helping himself to a homeowner's fridge. In the hours ahead, former U.S. President Donald Trump will head to a federal courthouse in Washington for his first court appearance on criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This will mark his third arrest and third arraignment in just a matter of months. Security has been ramped up in the nation's capital and around the courthouse ahead of Trump's arrival, with law enforcement now monitoring for any possible threats or protests. All this after special counsel Jack Smith's investigation led to an indictment with four counts against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the United States. An attorney for Trump argues the former president did nothing wrong. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now it comes as France's fifth and final evacuation flight has now taken off from Niger's capital, carrying French and other European nationals. France says it's flown more than a thousand people out of the country and the flights are now over.

Instead, they are outrightly seeking support from their neighbors whosupport them. The vice president of the Committee to Safeguard the Homeland, Salifou Modi, who was fired by President Bazoum earlier this year, and now the vice president of the coup leaders, went to Mali, met with the Colonel Asimi Goita, who is the military junta leader there, and they discussed ways to strengthen the security cooperation, he says, according to this statement from the Mali presidency, as some people are planning military interventions in their country, in Niger. And this is important because after French troops left Mali, they invited the Wagner group in. They are fighting there alongside Malian forces against the extremists in that country. And so this meeting is important because it does appear that explicitly the Nigerian military junta reaching out to the Wagner group to invite them into the country as a form of support is not exactly clear. They haven't said that explicitly. But then after that, this Vice President Modi goes to Burkina Faso and meets with the Captain Ibrahim Tlaure there, the other military junta leader, and says that they don't want Niger to become a new Libya. And they said something that's interesting here, that we have to past that we have decided to undertake a certain number of activities to secure our populations of our two countries. Again, the background here, Mali and Burkina Faso said that any military intervention in Niger would be tantamount to an act of war against them. They also got support from Guinea. These are the only three countries that recognize the military junta in Niger.

Just in the last few hours, the Russian Defense Ministry has issued a statement saying that the Russian air defenses were able to shoot down six drones overnight in the Kaluga region, just southwest of Moscow.And they say no casualties or damage has been reported so far as a result of what the defense ministry has described as a foiled terrorist plot by the Ukrainian government, though no response from Ukraine at this stage. And typically, we do not hear responses from the Ukrainian government when it comes to attacks within Russian territory. But of course, Ukraine's own air defenses have been tested for yet another night by Russian drones. Some 22 drones reportedly shot down by Ukraine's air defense systems, including 15 attack drones. And this follows a barrage of attacks that we saw overnight on Wednesday. 37 Iranian-made Shahed drones partially shot down, but some, of course, causing damage and landfall. And of course, others meeting their targets, particularly in the Odessa region, where we saw damage to the port infrastructure there. And that has really raised concern, of course, over the food security situation as we continue to see Russia targeting Ukraine's port infrastructure. But we have seen continued attacks across Ukraine's southeast region, particularly overnight. We have seen attacks in the city of Kherson, where at least three people have reportedly been injured as a result of Russian shelling in a nearby church in the city center. We've also seen to the northeast continued shelling and airstrikes in the Zaporizhzhya region. Of course, this battle continues to grind on as we continue to see the targeting of not only port infrastructure, but of course, civilian infrastructure as well.",

It's going to go further afield. It will include things like food security, energy environmental issues, nuclear safety. These are really broader issues.

Drones hitting Moscow is a problem for President Putin. That is where the rich, the influential, the elite work and live, and the particular targets most recently have been specifically buildings in this city complex, as it's called, which have government offices and important financial offices. So symbolically, and you would have to say somewhat militarily, although it doesn't really carry out too much damage, but symbolically it's very, very important. So I think Putin is going to try to say this really isn't having an effect, but that is not going to go over, I think. The question is, what is Ukraine trying to do with these?

For those under the age of 8, it's 40 minutes a day. Those between 8 and 16 years of age, it's an hour a day. And then if you're 16 to 18, it's extended to two hours a day. Now once you've reached your limit, the mobile device will shut down all the applications. There are a number of exceptions. emergency services, educational products such as online classes, apps for physical and mental development, you know, they will be exempt. And parents can also choose to exempt apps, plus opt out of time limits for their children. We spoke to one parent this morning in China. Let me read to you what this mother of two had to say. She said, I think it's good. On one hand it can protect their eye vision as many young kids cannot stop themselves while watching something they like. It helps automatically cut it off. On the other hand it's easier for us parents to control our kids screen time. Without parents' approval they only have 40 minutes. Most importantly the content under the teenage mode is more positive and healthy. Now parents might be very happy about this but internet companies and their investors certainly were not. Shares in Chinese tech firms fell dramatically yesterday on use of these restrictions, some falling almost 7 percent but with trading resuming today they have bounced.

You recall that he's on trial for corruption, charges he vehemently denies. So about three years ago, there were petitions to the Supreme Court here to say that, look, Netanyahu's on trial for corruption, therefore he shouldn't be prime minister or be able to run for prime minister.The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, no, it's OK for him to be prime minister so long as there's no conflict of interest. Rolled on to this government, and it unveiled its controversial overhaul plans, those plans that have caused hundreds of thousands of Israelis to pour out onto the streets week in, week out for more than six months. And the attorney general said, as a result of that, look, Netanyahu's got legal problems. Therefore, it would be a conflict of interest for him to be involved in this judicial overhaul. So what does the government do? It amends a basic law. These are one of the closest things that Israel has to a constitution, to say that it would be much harder to remove Netanyahu from office in the event of a conflict of interest. And that's why we are here today. The three Supreme Court justices are hearing petitions saying that, no, that law was done specifically for Netanyahu, specifically tailored to him, and therefore represents an abuse of power. That's what the attorney general says, too. And so the result of that right now is that if the justices agree with those petitions, then that law could be struck down. And that would be the first time the Supreme Court strikes down one of these so-called basic laws. And the significance of that against the context of these controversial judicial overhaul plans is that when all 15 Supreme Court judges meet for the first time in September to hear the first part of that judicial overhaul, this so-called reasonableness bill that we've been talking about the past few weeks, perhaps it will have fewer qualms about striking down a basic law if one has already been struck down before.
