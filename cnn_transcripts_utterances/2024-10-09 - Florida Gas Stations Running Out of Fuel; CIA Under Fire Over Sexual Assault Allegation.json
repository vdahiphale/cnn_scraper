So I have a staff that is definitely dedicated to getting the hotel back and rebuilt, as well as an ownership group that is standing firm behind us and ensuring that, as soon as it's deemed safe and we can get the workers back and cleaned up and a crew on site to start some of the repairs that are needed, we want to try to get the restaurant and the hotel open as quickly as possible to get all of our employees back to work as quickly as possible.",

And we always come back to the property, and it's picking up a few pieces of tree limbs here and there, clearing the sand out, or picking up some pavers back behind the pool deck. Helene was a completely separate mess. It was walking over two feet of sand and shell in the restaurant and bricks in the pool, and never seen devastation like this.

And victims have -- some victims have said that the agency has in the past discouraged them from reporting assault to law enforcement. Now, the CIA has undertaken this kind of big reform effort. And one of the -- over the past year, really. And one of the big things that they have done is put in place a federal law enforcement officer whose job it is to try to facilitate some of those interactions. And so, at that point, that's one of the -- at this point, that's one of the big things that we're watching, Pam, is to see whether or not that works, whether or not you sort of get to a point where victims at the CIA feel that they understand the process and are being appropriately advised of their rights to go to law enforcement. BROWN:  I have done a lot of reporting about sexual assault at the Coast Guard and it being covered up.

So that's the 7 percent figure that you're comparing that to of agency employees reporting over the course of their whole career. Across the federal government, the U.S. military is probably the best comparison point here. It's another large National Security Agency that's really publicly struggled with the issue of sexual assault in its ranks. In the last -- in 2023 alone, active-duty women in the U.S. military reported experiencing just under 7 percent -- just under 7 percent of active-duty women in the U.S. military reported experiencing some form of assault or unwanted sexual contact in 2023 alone.

And we're seeing those impacts already because we have these outer bands that are coming on shore. This is very common in hurricanes. These outer bands will run into friction on the land and then start to spin up some of these tornadoes. And we have seen multiple tornado warnings across Alligator Alley here, all of these pink and purple boxes. But what's really remarkable is, these cells are just so discrete and they're dropping pretty large tornadoes for a tornado threat in a hurricane. They are tagged as considerable damage observed on the ground. We are seeing some of these funnels. Typically, with tornadoes in a hurricane, they're usually pretty skinny, pretty brief, and pretty weak. But some of these are really packing a punch and are incredibly dangerous. And, again, you see multiple of them here across the Florida peninsula across South Florida. This threat continues through the day until 9:00 this evening, as we continue to pull in these outer bands along the peninsula. So this is one that we will need to watch closely through the day today -- Pamela.",
