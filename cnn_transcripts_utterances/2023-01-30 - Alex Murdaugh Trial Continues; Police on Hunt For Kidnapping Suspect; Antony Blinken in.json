A sixth Memphis police officer was just relieved of duty for alleged involvement in the deadly incident, five previously fired officers charged with murder. Those five were members of the department's SCORPION unit that was disbanded over the weekend. This comes as new charges could be in play and as Congress faces new calls to act on police reform. CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now. Nick, anybody who watched this video can see that at various points there were more than five officers at the scene. What do we know now about this sixth officer's role?",

You're looking at a photo of him there. And we have reached the attorney, the man who says he's representing Mr. Hemphill, who said to us that he can confirm that that is his client. He also says that it was the bodycam footage of Mr. Hemphill that we saw in video one. Has per departmental regulations, Officer Hemphill, the attorney says, activated his bodycam. He was never present at the second scene. He is cooperating with officials in this investigation. A lot that we don't know, though, about this latest officer who has been relieved as a result of his involvement in Tyre Nichols' arrest. We don't know exactly what he did to catch the attention of the police department that put him on administrative leave. We're working on trying to get those answers. But we know just very quickly as well, Kasie, that he was part of the crisis intervention team of the Memphis Police Department.

And SCORPION unit, I mean, what a moniker to give an elite police unit. It stands for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods. And they were launched in late 2021. And they were heralded by city leadership. In fact, in January of 2020, to the mayor of Memphis, Jim Strickland, praising this unit, saying that it led to 566 arrests; 390 of them were felonies. He also said just in a matter of a couple of months of being on board or active, rather, that they had seized about $100,000 in cash. But we were hearing today -- even though the police chief on Friday told us that she has no other evidence that members of this unit had engaged in similar activity, we were told today -- I was told by Benjamin Crump, the family attorney, that, tomorrow, he plans on hosting a press conference with a 66-year-old man who claims that he was assaulted by members of the SCORPION unit.

It's always an evolving process to put in good ideas and good laws that cover the type of issues that we see that manifest themselves, even really terrible things like this. But I think what's important is that there have been a number of changes to policy and rules and regulations and law that have been put in around the country since the George Floyd homicide. And it's the implementation of those that's really important right now. If you put a unit like this out on the street in this environment, and you look at a number where they're pulling in 170 or 180 people into custody every month after the unit gets started, you have got to take a close look at what they're doing, what those charges are, what the probable cause is, what the reason for the stops is, all of these things. That's about the supervision of these things. These units can get out of control really quickly. And if you're not paying close attention on the supervisory part, then you have got a problem. The other side of it is the culture. If you're calling it the SCORPION unit, what message are you sending to the officers who are in it and to the community? Are we going to hurt -- scorpions sting, right? So, what's the idea behind that? Making sure that those officers understand that constitutionally protected policing is what is necessary in cities right now is really important.",

I went back, and I met with the gang unit after that, and I made it very clear that this was not the mission that I wanted accomplished. I wanted to do very different things to connect with the community and respond to what the community needs were. You can't make everybody who's between the age of 15 and 25 a suspect. You need to be very cautious about how you go at this. And that change made a difference there.

And people will say, oh, my goodness, this was terrible. But the terrible part of it was that people weren't paying attention to it in real time. We have systems that allow us to do that.

And he says that, through that, through the Abraham Accords, he thinks that's the way to ultimately reaching some sort of solution with the Palestinians. I think a lot of people would disagree with him. But that's how he focused that. Now, Antony Blinken tomorrow is heading to Ramallah, where he will meet with Palestinian leaders. And he said in a photo spray with the Israeli foreign minister that he will be bringing that same message to the Palestinians, that they also need to take steps to de-escalate the situation. Last week, the Palestinian Authority severed its security coordination with Israel. That is seen as really a vital tool to help at least keep some sense of communication between the security forces. He will be likely urging them to restore that. We heard from the Americans last week. They said that they didn't think that was a good idea. Very much a high-stakes trip.

They did release several photos of him, warning folks that he might try to change his appearance, perhaps by shaving his beard or his hair are changing his hair color. They are asking folks to pay extra attention to his facial structure and eyes, since, obviously, those features are very difficult to change. Now, the district attorney said that he tried to kill this victim in Grants Pass, Oregon, very close to the California border, while intentionally torturing her and secretly confining her in a place where she was not likely to be found. Police say that she was bound, severely beaten, but that he fled the scene before officers arrived. This was Tuesday. They think he may have had some help in evading capture. On Thursday night, authorities raided a property nearby about 20 miles north of Grants Pass, where they found a bunch of evidence, including us car. They arrested a 68-year-old woman for hindering prosecution. They believe she was helping him hide out. But, again, he managed to escape, leaving the small community on edge.

While that case was still pending in court, Foster was charged with felony assault battery and kidnapping for allegedly attacking another woman who was his then-girlfriend. This was in 2019. That victim told police that he strangled her to the point of unconsciousness, very similar to the Oregon case, several times. She said he kept her tight up for two weeks, burned her with lye. As part of a 2021 plea deal with Clark County prosecutors, Foster ultimately actually served less than 200 days in prison.

He also said that he tried at least twice to turn his son over. This was a very bloody, gruesome crime scene, Kasie. So it would make sense that he would have had some blood on him. But the investigators did not search his entire home that night. In fact, they waited more than three months to search Murdaugh's home, even though they had a search warrant. Now, there was another really interesting moment in court today, where there was a witness, a special agent named Jeff Croft. He took the stand and testified that he had spoken with someone and interviewed someone, a witness who said that he had been calling Maggie and Paul Murdaugh that evening and texting them. This was a guy who had his dog. He was texting with them about a dog that was at the Murdaughs' kennels, which is where the murders took place. And the special agent testified that there was a text or a call to Paul Murdaugh at 9:29 p.m., 9:42, p.m., 9:57 p.m. And this same person also texted Maggie Murdaugh at 9:34 p.m., saying: \"Tell Paul to call me.\" Of course, neither one of them ever responded to that person.
