And the Biden administration appears to be expanding an agreement with Ukraine, allowing counterstrikes inside of Russia using U.S. weapons. How far will Ukraine go in hitting back on Vladimir Putin's own turf? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, preparations for the CNN presidential debates are revving up right now exactly one week before the must-see showdown between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Our correspondents are covering the candidates and the lead-up to their face-off in Atlanta. First, let's go to CNN's Kayla Tausche. She's over at the White House for us. Kayla, how is the president preparing? KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, President Biden will be huddling with his aides at Camp David, the mountainside Maryland retreat just north of here, for the next several days. They'll be poring over materials of prior Trump appearances, binders of questions, topics, possible punches, counterpunches, sifting through and culminating into a mock 90-minute debate in a few days once they feel like they've refined their message. At that debate, we've now learned that the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is likely to reprise his role standing in for former President Trump behind the podium, as he did four years ago in the prior election, according to sources who are familiar with the matter. But the messaging for the Biden team is pretty simple. They believe that voters have been tuned out and disengaged up until this point. And they believe that voters have missed some of what they see as the more incendiary things that Trump has said. So, they plan to call those out and to hold the former president accountable. One of those pieces of material that I've learned that they plan to raise is Trump's comments in December, that he plans to be a dictator on day one, but that he says he won't be a dictator after that. Now, as far as the setup on stage, some of those details are also starting to come together. Biden's team won the coin toss and they had a choice between choosing their position on stage or having the last word on stage. They chose the right podium. So, Biden will be standing on the right and former President Trump will speak last on stage. So, certainly, as these details are coming together, final preparations are being made and now it's down to figuring out, Wolf, what exactly they're going to say to each other.",

We know in past debates he has talked over Biden, he has been very aggressive not just toward his opponents, but also the moderators. This is something they've worked behind closed doors to rein in. And lastly, just to Kayla's point about Biden winning that coin flip on stage, Donald Trump also got to choose who would get to speak last and they chose that they want to give closing arguments.

Look, I think at the end of the day, both of them will have plenty of time. And the last word probably does not matter as much as what happens in the full debate going up until that period.But, Wolf, it's so striking I've been spending a lot of time going back watching both of the debates from 2020, the same men, but, boy, everything has changed not only in the world but also between them. So much of the last debates were dominated by coronavirus and Trump's handling of it and his record again and again then former-Vice President Joe Biden was going after Trump's record. Now, it's President Biden's record that he has to defend. And in the history of these debates, that's one thing that often trips up incumbents, because defending your record does not allow you to talk about the future, and to give some other attack lines in. But what's so interesting about this, history is probably not our best guide here in terms of the struggles of incumbents because both of them are incumbent presidents and neither one of them have debated for four years. They both did not have primary debate. So, so much is on the line. But, again, this is a unique situation, a sitting president versus a former sitting president, we've never seen it before.",

Sources are telling us at CNN that President Biden is likely to pick his personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, to play Trump in these mock sessions that he's going to be going through preparing for the debate. What does that tell you?NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, listen, Biden obviously has a team of people around him who are very familiar to him, who have prepped him for debates, prior people like Ron Klain, people like Bob Bauer. And, you know, that's a team of people he trusts, that's a team of people who really, I think, have served him well in the past. If you look at those past debates, he pretty much won the last debates against Donald Trump, and it really, I think, sealed the momentum he had in that 2020 race. They're looking for that momentum again here. They expect Donald Trump to be Donald Trump. For all this talk about all the sort of prep and policy briefings he's supposedly in, Donald Trump will likely show up as Donald Trump, which is someone who tends to be meandering in terms of his speech, disjointed in terms of his speech, very sort of disjointed overall in terms of what his arguments will be and living in the past, right? Expect him to sort of litigate 2020 again. So, listen, I think out of the two, Joe Biden is the more practiced and polished debater. I do think he's got to figure out about how do you lay a vision forward for the country rather than getting mired down in his own policy and his own legislative achievements, which are quite formidable, but he's got to be more forward-looking.",

The New York Times is writing this, let me quote from The New York Times, the expectations game is a particular challenge for the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has spent months casting the 81-year-old Mr. Biden as a husk of a man who can barely walk or formulate complete sentences.

I would make him have to defend the fact that household incomes from for a family of four are at the lowest they have ever been in over a decade. I would make him have to defend that the ability to buy a home is almost nonexistent for a large percent of the American people. I would make him defend the fact that inflation is driving up costs for everyday goods. I would make him defend the fact that the immigration crisis is out of hand. I would make him defend the fact that we're seeing aggression from adversaries such as Russia and China and does not appear to be a path forward or a strategy from this administration to tackle those issues. That is what I think could separate the former president.And to Nia's point, we did see once in 2016 after the former president won, he gave that speech and everyone was surprised like, oh, wow, this is a different version of Trump that we're not used to seeing.

I mean, despite everything that has happened, the convictions have not moved it. The turmoil in the Middle East really hasn't moved it. You know, the national polls are -- there are some limits to what we can gain from those.But state by state, when you look at all of these battlegrounds, it is remarkably tight, almost always within the margin. Now, that's not necessarily good for the incumbent president, because the incumbent president would certainly like to have an advantage.

Now, since she's been overseeing this case, like I said, she's been under scrutiny, especially for all the things she hasn't yet done. She currently has six motions to dismiss outstanding. There's still a question lingering about a possible gag order, and there's no trial date. Now, some people have also asked if some of her delay tactics are meant to help the former president. If you talk to his legal team, I'll be the first people to tell you that they don't feel like she has really helped them.

It's not surprising to me that federal judges, more senior federal judges might approach another judge to step off the case because there's all kinds of reasons why judges step off of cases, you know, whether it's a matter of recusal or a conflict of interest or simply this judge may not, based on their workload, be the right person to take it.So, I'm not stunned by this and particularly given some of the some of the points that Paula had raised about why people were concerned about how she's doing in the case.

Some of the article that came out of The New York Times, it said that some of the other judges urged her to turn over the case because to someone who was, quote, older and more experienced of a jurist. And other judges sometimes are new on the bench. She maybe has made decisions that certainly I disagree with in terms of the law, but the way for that to be adjudicated is for the appellate process to work out.
