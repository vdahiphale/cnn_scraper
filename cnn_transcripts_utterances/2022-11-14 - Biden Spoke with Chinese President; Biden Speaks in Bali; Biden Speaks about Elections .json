      "sentences": "A very good Monday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.Any moment now President Biden will speak and take questions after a crucial meeting with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Biden facing a critical test on multiple fronts in his first face-to-face meeting with the Chinese leader since taking office. Challenges for China as well. Talks lasted more than three hours. They took place on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. The meeting comes amid still growing tensions on trade, the military standoff over Taiwan, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both leaders come into the talks with political wins at their backs after Xi was given a third term, breaking China's constitutional two-term limit, and Biden, of course, with better than expected political results here in the U.S. Let's speak now to CNN's Phil Mattingly, who is there in Bali as we wait for President Biden to come to the cameras. And, Phil, it seems, according to White House officials, that the president did raise both Taiwan and human rights issues with the Chinese leader. What do we know?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, the White House was very clear that the president was going to be very candid about objections that U.S. officials had, concerns that the U.S. had when it came to China's actions, in particular when it came to Taiwan and some of the aggressive behavior U.S. officials have seen over the course of the last year, particularly in the Taiwan Strait, but also on human rights issues as well. And according to the readout that was released by the White House after the meeting, those objections were raised.However, it's important to note that there are a couple of elements here that were critical given just how poor the state of relations has been over the course of the last two years. First and foremost, it's affected both leaders, at least according to the White House, agreed to empower their senior officials to open lines of communications and maintain those lines of communications. Jim, as you know well, the ability for U.S. officials and their counterparts at the highest levels to communicate over the last two years has largely been frozen, and minimal at best. So, reopening those lines is critical. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, President Biden tasked him with visiting China in the - in the months ahead as they continue these things - these issues, Jim. I think one of the big things we're going to hear from the president here in just about a minute and a half, his view of President Xi's perspective. We have the White House's perspective. We know the concerns and the priorities, what President Biden felt President Xi's perspective was is incredibly important at this moment.",

And do I think he's willing to compromise on various issues? Yes. I think he understands that -- look, I think -- how can I say this tactfully? I think the -- I think the election held in the United States was still -- leaves a little bit uncertain -- has sent a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play. The United States is -- the Republicans who survived, along with the Democrats, are of the view that we're going to stay fully engaged in the world and that we, in fact, know what we're about. And so I don't get any sense that there's more or less confrontation. We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position and we agreed we'd set up, and we did, mechanisms whereby we would meet in detail with our -- the key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them, or how -- if they weren't resolved, on what basis were they not resolved.

Does the retaking of Kherson in Ukraine signal a turning point in the war in your opinion that the Ukrainians -- where the Ukrainians could realistically pursue their ultimate goal of expelling the Russians completely, including retaking Crimea? If so, does the U.S. intend to support and facilitate that goal as you've been doing so far with their other goals, or would you perhaps see Kherson as a different kind of inflection point, basically a good time to start negotiating now that they've got a -- some more strength than they had, you know, a few weeks ago?

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one. Number two, I made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did, they meaning North Korea, that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf and it would not be directed against North Korea -- excuse me, it would not be directed against China but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies as well as American soil and American capacity.And so -- but I do not think that -- it's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means because I made it clear -- and I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our allies, South Korea, as well as Japan, and that it would be - we'd be more up in the face of China, but it wouldn't be because of China, it would be because of what was going on in North Korea. So -- and, again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams with our national security adviser, secretary of defense and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to see - and we're not going to be able to work everything out. And I'm not suggesting it's going to -- this is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going to go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe there's a need for concern of a -- as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war. And I think that - I'll conclude by saying it this way, I want to be clear and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping, that I mean what I say and I say what I mean. So, there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern is -- I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts. So, we went into -- I look at my team, how long did that meeting last? Three and a half hours. So, we covered an awful lot of territory. And I must say that he was as straightforward as he has been with me in the past and I think that we understand one another, which is the most important thing that can be done. I guess all of you are going swimming from here. It's not far, but -",

These lockdowns are continuing. Covid and zero Covid policy at that is still very much in place there and you see heavy restrictions on the people of China and a continued grip over them with the control of their movements all in the name of national health security and really ultimately national security.And that's been the big shift that we've seen out of President Xi Jinping. We just saw that just a few weeks ago at the party congress when he was essentially canonized into this third term, allowing him to continue this rule for life. And he shifted the focus from economic power to national security. And that gives him a lot of leeway to push forward in his intentions in trying to continue to put pressure on the U.S. One thing that was really interesting that you pointed out, Jim, is how President Biden started, and that was saying that the midterms reaffirmed democracy, because if there's one thing that the Chinese state media loves to seize on it's the division within the U.S.",

And, look, I think it's also a reflection of the days leading up to this meeting when he was in ASEAN, when we were in Cambodian, he as meeting with Asian Pacific leaders. And top U.S. officials, top Biden advisers, made clear repeatedly over the course of the day and a half, two days we were in Cambodia, they would hear from world leaders who brought up the midterm elections, who made clear they saw that Democrats had been viewed though a more successful lens certainly than was expected.What was stressed to me throughout the course of the last 48 to 72 hours is just how closely everyone was watching the midterm elections, not just at home, not just because John King's on the magic wall, but from an international scale of things, to see what's going to happen next. And I think they have felt, the Biden team, like they've had some wind at their backs, moving -- going into this meeting with President Xi. And I think that's why you heard the president bring that up from the start. That's why you heard the president conclude with that. They feel like they're in a very different moment, not just at home from where they were expected before the election, but abroad as well. And I think that was something he took into the meeting with President Xi Jinping, but I also think it's something that reflects his overall approach, which it -- whether he would acknowledge it or not, it provides some type of comfort, that his theory of the case that he ran on, that he's really kind of proceeded the path along - over the course of his first two years in office has started to bear some fruit, both on the domestic agenda but also in the fact that many of the Trump beholden to some degree republicans lost their elections or maybe didn't have the power that they once thought they did. That's something he wants to bring into these meetings, particularly given the stakes and the scale of this bilateral relationship.",

China's incarceration of more than a million Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, it's crushing of dissent in Hong Kong.

I think that's, you know, partly the -- President Xi has made a calculation that he needs to ensure that his people are safe from Covid. He thinks that's going to be best done by locking down the economy and society. Whether that's right or not is to be seen, but I think -- I wouldn't view it as a source of weakness, but just a different set of priorities. Whether he's going to be able to sustain that or not, we'll see.",
