LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Definitely, Kaitlan. It is very clear right now, the administration does not have many answers. What did these objects look like? Where did they come from? Who owns them? Do they definitely not have surveillance capabilities? All answers -- all questions without answers. And one thing that we just saw the White House being very clear about is that the U.S. military did not shoot down UFOs. We are told by officials that they have been pretty sensitive to the fact that this is sort of a mysterious situation and ripe for conspiracy theories and that a decision was made that even without a lot of concrete information about these recently downed objects, that the White House felt that it was important to at least rule out the fact that there was no extraterrestrial activity, that these were not UFOs that the president ordered shot down. As one official told us, everyone wants answers that no one has at the moment, but, again, the White House felt that it was important to at least rule out that these were not UFOs. I will also tell you even though we've not heard directly from the president yet addressing this issue, we are just seeing a flurry of activity with senior administration officials trying to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): After just a week of training, Ukrainian tank crews show off their new skills on a Polish gun range, the first time their Leopard 2 training has been put on display. The crews pulled direct from Ukraine's eastern battlefront. Too soon to say what's best about the Leopard 2, Ukraine's tank trainer says, but the machine is good quality. And what is most important, my soldiers like it a lot. Their training fast-tracked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, compared to the Polish standard, eight hours a day, five days a week. Polish instructors say the Ukrainians will be ready in a month. Most of them have some tank skills already. The Polish brigadier in charge says. They're so keen to learn, we have to hold them back. In peacetime, it's rare, if ever, the tank crews race through their training like this. It's a sign of how much they're needed at the frontlines. They're being accelerated through their Leopard 2 apprenticeship. Poland's president, who has been at the vanguard of pushing NATO allies to give Ukraine modern battle tanks and is sending 14 of Poland's, came to meet the Ukrainian crews and see their progress.
