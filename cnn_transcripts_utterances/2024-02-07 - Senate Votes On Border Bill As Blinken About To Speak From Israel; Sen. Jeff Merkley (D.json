We're going to bring you that when it begins.But as we watch on the Senate side here, there is a vote underway on a border security and aid package to Ukraine and Israel, a compromise that took five months to come together between Republicans, and Democrats and the White House. And ultimately, you are watching it die on the Senate floor there on the left. Let's talk a little bit about this as we are - this vote is still underway. I want to talk now with Democratic Senator from Oregon Jeff Merkley. He's also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And, sir, as I understand it, you voted yes on this border package. I know that you had some pretty major reservations, some big concerns yesterday. What changed your mind? SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): Well, it isn't just a border package. It is getting on to the bill. It's a motion to proceed to the bill that contains the aid for Ukraine and also international humanitarian aid. So in the - my argument here is we needed to get on to the bill in order to start the amendment process and try to get to a final bill that we're comfortable voting on. I do have major reservations about the provisions of the border package. But as it turns out, the Republicans, after saying we have to have this package in order to do Ukraine, now they're saying we have to not have this package. They want to leave this as an open sore, an open problem at President Trump's direction through the November election.",

But if you're opposed to the bill, generally speaking, people do not vote for cloture. Sometimes they do and traditionally maybe they do. But a lot of times, more recently, they don't.Why did you think it was important to then move on to the bill, which, by the way, is not going to happen as we expect cloture to fail?",

It's not even closing debate on passage of the bill. And there's components of this that are incredibly important.The Ukraine aid is massively important. This is a Munich moment. This is like when Chamberlain in 1938 goes to Hitler and says in Munich, go ahead, take a piece of Czechoslovakia, and we'll just look the other way and say peace in our time. Republicans opposing the aid to Ukraine are saying the same thing. They're saying to Putin, go ahead and take Ukraine. We'll just turn the other way and pretend everything's all good and peaceful. That is absolutely wrong. I think any historian would go back and advise Chamberlain he made a mistake in 1938. Future historians would say we're making a mistake today if we do not fund Ukraine.",

And so that means that this effort is now dead. Five months of work in really hard-gone efforts there and they are just washed away there.The next step, Senator, of course, is going to be just an aid package for Israel, Ukraine, as well, obviously, as other priorities. But what do you want to see there and are you going to try to propose specific changes, as you've been very critical of Israel and how it's prosecuting its war?",

So there's absolute changes that need to take place. President Biden proposed a $14 billion package that expanded to $20 billion, more security on the border, more Customs and Border Protection individuals, more asylum officers, so we can have those asylum hearings in a short period of time, more of family monitoring programs to make sure they show up for hearings. All of that is really the type of fixes that we need. We need bipartisan partnership to implement those changes.",

One of the things that Republicans debated in a very lengthy lunch that was described to us by members coming out of it as robust, as vigorous, as frank discussion around what precisely should happen next is that Republicans are arguing they want to have clear commitments from Democrats to get some amendments on a supplemental package for aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. And they do not want Schumer to just quickly move forward with that package without giving specific promises that they're going to get some votes to potentially change that bill.So right now that is the discussion underway among Republicans. But we should note and take a step back that Republicans have been united in this conference about trying to find the best path forward and yet have been unable to figure out precisely what that is. And specifically when it comes to aid for Ukraine, the majority of the conference supports it, but there are differences among members about how they want to move forward and precisely whether or not they are going to ultimately support it. So I think there's just a lot of question right now about how Republicans want to move forward, Brianna. And note that there's still a huge underlying question mark around how Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, would proceed even if senators could move forward with aid to Ukraine.",

After a series of critical meetings in the Middle East, Secretary of State Antony Blinken may be leaving empty-handed. We're expecting to hear from him at any moment, and as soon as we do, we're going to bring that to you.Earlier today, you see there he sat down with Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure to get him to sign on to a deal that would pause fighting in Gaza and free the remaining hostages. After that meeting, though, Netanyahu bristled at Hamas' demands, calling them \"delusional.\" But he didn't rule out further negotiations. We're joined now by former hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin. He's the Middle East director of the International Communities Organisation. Thanks so much for being here with us. I'm curious, in light of Netanyahu's reaction that we just outlined there, what does that tell you about what it's going to take to get those remaining 100-plus hostages home?",

Netanyahu is not willing to make any deal that will leave Hamas in place.The Hamas proposal that was issued last night essentially leaves Hamas in control of Gaza. That's a nonstarter for Israel, but it's also the only way of getting the hostages home alive. So we're kind of at a dead end here.",

People will take to the streets again, as we did for 40 weeks prior to the war, in protest to the Netanyahu government.And because of Netanyahu's failures on October 7th and everything that led to October 7th, all the polls indicate that he has no chance of winning these elections, and this will be the end of his political career.",

And you published a column on this today, and in that column you wrote that the war can wait, the hostages cannot. Their families have been so outspoken on this, telling the government, do whatever it takes to get them out. Do you think that they should continue to have hope?

They were dragged from their homes, they were dragged from a music festival, they were dragged from army bases and taken hostage into Israel, while - into Gaza, while Hamas murdered 1,200 other Israelis. The government has a moral responsibility to bring them home.When I said the war can wait, the hostages cannot. The hostages are dying, they're being killed. Israel can renew the war after it gets the hostages home. There's nothing to prevent them from doing it. And I'm sure that Hamas will provide ample reason for Israel to continue the war even after it's declared over. Hamas cannot rule Gaza, cannot threaten Israel. It is bad for the Palestinians, it is bad for the region, it's bad for Jordan and Egypt, and it's certainly bad for Israel. So we have a responsibility to ensure that Hamas will not continue to rule. But what we need in order for that to happen is for there to be a political, after the war, a political solution where there is a two-state solution that's viable. That's going to require the Biden administration to recognize the state of Palestine, along with the other OECD nations, so that Palestine becomes real for the Palestinian people. No longer a 30-year open-ended peace process where people talk about the two-state solution, but only recognize one of those states.",

And this, since the beginning, has just been getting worse and worse every day.I was, a lot of my time in southern Rafah, I would go up north up to Shifa Hospital. But in southern Rafah, in the south, it was originally 200,000 people and one of the most densely populated. It's a small piece of land. It's not like 1.5 million. So I was there as everybody was migrating down. First thing to go was all the trees. If people were fortunate enough to have food to cook for their family, they need a fuel source. So they cut down all the trees. Now, when I left not too long ago, people were resorting to digging up the roots of those trees that had been cut down in order to make a cup of tea for their family or to cook - to make some bread.
