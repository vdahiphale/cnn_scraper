Well, did there come any times during the month or two that followed the election when the topic of Stormy Daniels came up? Answer, yes. Can you tell the jury a little bit about that? Davidson, after the election, Michael Cohen called me fairly frequently. And there was one particular day. It was on a weekend in mid-December. And this is the period of time after the election. But before Donald Trump had been sworn in as president and it was -- I think it was on a Saturday morning and I was shopping for a holiday. And I got a call from a very despondent and sat in Michael Cohen. And I was at an apartment store, which is a whole kind of other story because it was sort of strangely decorated. And so the whole situation was very odd that he was calling me and I was in a strangely decorated department store. And it was a long phone call and he told me he was depressed and despondent. And he said that he used very colorful language about that stage of his life. Question, you are quoting so you can repeat the language. Answer, he said something to the effect of Jesus Christ, can you effing believe I'm not going to Washington after everything I've done, important there, for that effing guy? I can't believe I'm not going to Washington. I've saved that guy's ass so many times and you don't even know. Question, and did?

A lot of people are aware that Donald Trump had this affair with Stormy Daniels.And I don't know how many people are paying attention. Look, voters often don't start paying attention until just a couple of months before the election, usually at the end of the summer. And so, I will say though that for those that are paying attention, maybe those voters who are on the fence about Donald Trump and maybe aren't sure they really want to support him because they don't really like his character, but maybe they kind of like the policies, a case like this at the forefront of their minds certainly doesn't help them with their kind of image of Donald Trump. Look, he had an affair with a porn star and then tried to cover it up. And mind you, this affair happened just days after his wife gave birth to their son. So, it could go both ways. I think that with his base, they're going to be hardened in their support for him. It's not going to make any difference. They have shown they're going to stand by him no matter what, even if there's a conviction. But for some voters, this could potentially persuade them.",

I just want to note in listening to your very dramatic (INAUDIBLE) of this, the fact that Michael Cohen ever thought he was going to Washington in some big capacity as attorney general or White House chief of staff or secretary of state, I think he floated all of those things, is beyond the realm of reality, even in a Donald Trump plan for an administration.",

And there was an exchange regarding a statement made by Stormy Daniels that came up that she made. And so let's get into it right here.So, Joshua Steinglass, the prosecutor asks, okay, can you read for us the statement? This is Stormy Daniels -- a statement drafted for Stormy Daniels. Davidson says, to whom it may concern, over the past few weeks, I've been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship that I had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago. The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017, and now again in 2018. I am not denying this affair because I was paid, quote, hush money, as has been reported in overseas-owned tabloids. I'm denying this affair because it never happened, period, next paragraph. I have no further comment on this matter, period. Please feel free to check me out on Instagram at the Stormy Daniels, and he says, excuse me, at the Stormy Daniels. Joshua Steinglass then asks, Mr. Davidson, how would you characterize the truthfulness of this statement? Davidson, I think it's technically true. Question from Steinglass. How do you explain that, or can you explain that? Can you explain how it's true that it says an alleged sexual relationship, which basically denies them having a sexual relationship? Is that right? Answer, yes. Question, how is that technically true? Answer from Davidson, because I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that there was a relationship between Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump. I believe their relationship is an ongoing interaction.",

Can't be any worse, I think, than that cross-examination in the attorney general's case of financial fraud. And the judge found in writing that the judge found Michael Cohen credible, notwithstanding the past which he's owned up to and the fact that he was brutally cross-examined.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Uncertainty at UCLA after police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment in the wake of a standoff with hundreds of demonstrators Wednesday night, police breaking down barricades, shooting rubber bullets, launching smoke bombs and flash bangs and arresting more than 200 protesters. The protest site dismantled after a clash erupted Tuesday night when counter-protesters, some of whom were pro-Israel, threw objects at tents, hurled fireworks and pulled down barriers set up by the pro- Palestinian encampment. UCLA's chancellor calling the attack a, quote, dark chapter in the university's history. In the morning light, only trash, graffiti and discarded tents remained of the encampment. The camp is now swiftly being cleaned up. Nationwide, more than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses in the last two weeks, including at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and Portland State University in Oregon. Police officers in riot gear cleared barricades, pushing out more than two dozen protesters holed up in the college library. But many of the protests in recent weeks have been peaceful, including this one at George Washington University with dueling demonstrators. Some universities like Columbia initially sought to negotiate with protesters, while others called in law enforcement from the start to manage emotional protests focused on a highly charged international crisis.",

And again, the question is without knowing what former President Trump's intent is, what really does that speak to as far as his intent is concerned? Now, obviously, the prosecution is going to move on eventually to Michael Cohen where they'll attempt to supply intent but the jury is going to have to make a judgment about whether or not you have to believe Michael Cohen in order to believe that that in fact was Donald Trump's intent and whether or not Michael Cohen's testimony, at least in that regard, has been corroborated sufficient that a jury could return a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

They were fully capable of exercising leverage against Donald Trump in order to extract what they wanted. You can call that extortion. You can call it whatever you want.
