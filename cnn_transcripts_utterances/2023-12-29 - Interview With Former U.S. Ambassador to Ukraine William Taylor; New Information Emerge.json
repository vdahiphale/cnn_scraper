There's a smattering of outcomes.

What was your immediate reaction when you learned that the secretary of state had sided with you and the two other voters who filed with you, both of whom are or were Republicans? ETHAN STRIMLING (D), FORMER MAYOR OF PORTLAND, MAINE:  You know, my first reaction was a good day for democracy, good day for our Constitution. It made clear that the rule of law applies to everybody in America, no matter what office you may or may not have held. Hard to imagine that a president would commit insurrection against our country.

And those three bodies have all said, no, indeed, what we all saw on January 6 is actually what happened, and he is an insurrectionist. And two of those judicial bodies have determined that the 14th Amendment applies to the president. So I think our strongest evidence, without doubt, is Donald Trump's actions.

So it will be tough. But I'm hopeful that, when and if it gets there, they will put aside their partisanship, just as our secretary of state did, just as the judges in Colorado did, and look at the law. It's kind of hard to look at this and say that that wasn't an insurrection on January 6, that Donald Trump didn't incite that insurrection, invited people to Washington, and then sent them to the Capitol, and that the 14th Amendment, of course, applies to him. So I'm hopeful. Maybe hopeful is too strong of a term. I think it might be possible that the Supreme Court will put aside their partisanship and do the right thing, but we shall see.",

This scramble took place because the Trump campaign officials realized that two of these certificates were stuck in the mail.

This is like -- yes, so this is a high-level decision to get the Michigan and Wisconsin votes there, to -- and they had to enlist a U.S. senator to try to expedite it, to get it to Pence in time. (END AUDIO CLIP) Z. COHEN:  So, according to Chesebro, the Trump campaign even considered chartering a private jet to fly a staffer from Michigan and Wisconsin to D.C. to deliver these physical copies of the fake certificates, because the idea was Mike Pence had to bring those certificates to the House floor in order for them to be counted, if he actually went through with the plan to reject Biden's legitimate electors. So, really taking you behind the scenes here of what happened in just even the days leading up to January 6 and how this fake elector plot does tie in with the broader effort to pressure Mike Pence and also overturn the election overall.",

We do know from sources that Ken Chesebro has reached out to Jack Smith and effectively offered to cooperate, but he has not heard back yet from the special counsel's office, which is an interesting sort of radio silence, left on read situation there. He's an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal case. Obviously, we know, too, that Chesebro is cooperating in seven state-level investigations focused on fake electors.

People could still access it from another side, and the metro was already working. Right now, we are not very far from that area, but actually in a place where there's some warehouses. And these warehouses behind me was actually hit during this attack. Let me just take you inside and show you what -- actually, the destruction that is inside, because the warehouse was hit. It caught fire. When we arrived here, the smoke was still very visible from the outside. Right now, we can still see smoke in the inside. The smell is actually also strong, and, for some time, we couldn't access the inside of the warehouse, because firefighters were still trying to stabilize so nothing could actually fall. We now have permission to enter. And, as you can see, there is -- the structure is completely destroyed. The roof of the warehouse is totally destroyed, and we are actually walking most of the time on shattered glasses, on fragments of the warehouse, but also of the equipment that was inside. I was speaking with the general manager of the company, which is actually a German company working in Ukraine, and he was telling me there is only electrotechnical equipment here, there's no weapons, and it's now mostly destroyed, so warehouses destroyed. They will have to look for a new one. What is inside, they're trying to understand whether or not they can still recover something, and now estimating also the cost of the destruction. The company is still going to continue working in Ukraine. That's at least what he was telling me. But it's very difficult right now to recover from all this loss. You there was no one inside the warehouse when the attack happened. It was in the early hours in the morning. But, speaking with the firefighters, at least -- I mean, two people asked for -- to be assisted by the emergency services, because this was the main warehouse that was hit, but there's also other buildings around. So two people needed to be assisted by the emergency services. As I was telling you, firefighters are still here. Work is still being done in these warehouses. There's still a lot of smoke. And the smell is really strong. But, as you were saying, not only Kyiv was hit, which was very unexpected. We know sirens have been going off in the capital for almost every day, but it was not -- no one was expecting this size of destruction, but also other cities in Ukraine.
