The heaviest snow fell across the Sierra mountain range over the last 24 hours where it picks up almost six feet of snow above 5,000 feet. And all of that moisture that fell over the Sierra mountain range now pushes up through the central Rockies into the northern plains and upper Midwest today and tomorrow. Some of us already dealing with these sleet condition. You'll see the pink popping on radar. That's ice. Yes. A quarter of an inch to half an inch of ice expected up to an inch in some of these areas that are under the ice storm warnings. So, this will continue on. And then the thunderstorms, you'll see the lightning starting to fire up in parts of Nebraska down into the Texas panhandle already. This is going to be a continuance over the next 24 to 48 hours. Blizzard warnings in effect that is 25 mile per hour winds, over a three-hour period of time where visibility is going to be knocked down to a quarter mile if not longer. We are talking about winds in Goodland, at 50 or 55 miles per hour, sustained with gusts even stronger than that. of course, as that low pushes to the north, you can expect that in Rapid City, North Dakota as well here in the next or two. That area of low pressure, you will see areas highlighted in red, where we will have the most vulnerable areas of severe weather again stretching from the central plains back across the southeast, moving into the lower Mississippi Valley where we will have that threat of damaging winds, hail, and even long-lived tornadoes.

Look, I mean, John, let me begin with you for a second here because, look, in less than a month, a special counsel. You've got Jack Smith issuing subpoenas for Brad Raffensperger and local election officials at battleground states, asked a judge to hold Trump in contempt for failing to comply to the subpoena. You got multiple people before and a grand jury as well. And by the way, we're learning -- I think he is still in Europe recovering from a bike accident.

Obviously, DOJ is a separate and it tends to be a separate entity from Congress and government. But I wonder, politically, what do you thing the ramifications of this will be. Do you think this is still a politically-viable investigation where the electorate is behind it? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDNET TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Well, look, the investigation has momentum. I mean, it has been going, as you pointed out, for a couple of years. A lot of people have been interviewed. A lot of documents have been obtained and grand juries were in paneled. I mean, this thing has momentum. And so, it strikes me, given the people that he is currently seeking to talk to, that they are getting to the point where they're going to start making some decisions. So, yeah, I mean, it is viable because real things happen. January 6th happened. The phone call to the Georgia secretary of state happened. A lot of things were said and done and were really done right out in the open. We all saw it with our own two eyes. And so -- also, I would just say, political liability of an investigation, public opinion of an investigation, it's really kind of irrelevant. I think the point of all this should be justice should be done no matter what public opinion is. That's what we should all want here, for any crimes that were committed to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and for everybody to have their day in court within the system that we all agree to. So, that's what I want as an American. I hope the special counsel gets us there.",

DeLand's family says they have been communicating frequently, but then, the messages stopped. KENNETH DELAND, FATHER OF KEN DELAND, JR.:  We were just exchanging how he was doing and, you know, he has been traveling, he has been having a great time. We just shake our heads. We don't understand why he's not reaching out to us. CARROLL (voice-over):  His family launched a website, seeking answers and detailing his last known whereabouts. November 27th, his parents last heard from him on WhatsApp. That's when they say their son boarded a train headed for the Valence, France. Two days, November 29th, the public prosecutor's office in Grenoble, the city where DeLand was studying French, opened an investigation after his fellow students reported him missing. November 30th, the last known activity from his phone. Then, December 3rd, DeLand made an $8.40 purchase at that sporting goods store located just about 80 miles from Grenoble.

If we can find a way to make this happen continuously, what you do is capture the heat, and almost certainly capture the heat, boil water and make steam and make a turbine just as we do now in a coal- fired plant or a natural gas-fired plant or a nuclear plant if you're using fusion.

So, this maybe another one in that line. What's going to happen next? We, the United States, are going to try to extradite him.
