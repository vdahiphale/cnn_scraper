I think we see here in the headline like him talking about Kamala Harris having, quote, \"turned black,\" which really harkens back to the Barack Obama era, right? This is like beginning of birtherism conversation about whether or not she's actually black, which to me just kind of feels played and old and tired, but also antagonistic. I think that one of the things that Shermichael was talking about prior to the speech was - or the conversation was that this was an opportunity to reach out to black voters, which is something I really disagree with, because I think that when we see these kinds of moments, this isn't about reaching out to black people at all, because if you look at what he did, there's nothing that you can point to in this interview where he has said something that really reached out to black people. This is about reaching out to white people that feel like they can make a less - they feel a little less racist in this choice when they see him showing up with black people when they show him coming up to black conventions and doing those kinds of things.

We've seen him attack the organization saying that he would - that their equipment was bad and you all had me holding up in the back, where we've seen other reporting that he was resisting to the fact checking.

If we see any of those kinds of things, he's always projecting.And this issue about education, where we see him being - where he's calling her stupid, and lazy and not valuable and all of these different things, this is projection, right? And so we see this from him time and time again. We know that Donald Trump ran a university that was for profit and ended up being shut down because it was fake. We know that Donald Trump does these kinds of things all the time. And so when it comes to him calling Kamala Harris uneducated or not smart, we also know that this is a racist attack, right? We know that black people are always being called lazy, being called unqualified in the ways that we've seen him do repeatedly. So this is on brand for Trump. I don't know what this has gained him.

And we may ask questions in a way that get at issues in a way that other journalists won't. And so it's important that these candidates visit the convention and speak with us directly. But as I said before, you know, Donald Trump isn't your average political candidate, and he requires a very specific and focused strategy.So I think the interview probably didn't unfold the way some of us would have hoped, because when you ask a question, but then the answer doesn't relate to the question that you asked, you know, then you're not really finding out the answer to the issues that are really on your mind or that you really want the candidate to address.

I mean, that is the conversation going on here. There was a gasp, and then there was laughter. And laughter - mocking laughter - the kind of laughter that is uncomfortable for any candidate in a room. People were taken aback by, when you guys were talking about what he said about Vice President Kamala Harris, saying, oh, she's always grabbed onto her Indian heritage, but she's suddenly become black. That is just a lie. That is not true. It is not something that anyone has seen during her entire career.I mean, let's remember that her career started long before, her career in politics started long before her becoming a vice president. There was something else, though, that we haven't yet talked about, haven't quite picked up on yet. When he was asked about vice president, his vice presidential pick, JD Vance, he was asked about some of Vance's comments, and if he thought that they were appropriate, and whether or not he is happy with his pick. He evaded that question, but here's what he said about JD Vance that I think is worth noting. He said, \"Historically the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact. I mean virtually no impact,\" virtually never has it mattered. He was talking about the person who he chose for vice president, basically saying that it doesn't matter who's on the ticket. Now, in Trump's case, that may well be true. We have people who have come here who are Trump supporters, not a member of NABJ, who liked what he had to say and put all the blame on the Democrats. But it is interesting to note that he has basically slammed his own vice president in this crowd, saying that, really, it doesn't matter who his vice president is at all. We should also just talk about the tone and tenor of what happened here. I don't think train wreck is too far to go. This went off the rails immediately with the first question, which was a question that a lot of people had been asking at the conference. This is a person they have seen go after black journalists, saying negative things to black journalists about their questions, calling their questions dumb, saying that they are stupid. And so there was a question as to why he should be trusted with his commitment to the black community. It was a valid question. The answer was never given, and it was really a moment where people could see that this choice of having Donald Trump here could turn out to be problematic. But he got 45 minutes. He talked for the whole time. He answered some questions. And people sort of left here, honestly, disappointed. They were hoping to have a deeper conversation, to hear what some of his answers were to some of the questions about policy. They didn't really get that today. Boris, Brianna?",
