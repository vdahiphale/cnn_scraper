Also, Republican strategist, and former RNC communications director, Doug Heye. And, Ashley, I want to read you some reporting that we just got from the White House from MJ Lee, who has a quote from one campaign official saying, \"any reporting that we're panicked or deeply concerned would be wrong.\" Now, when I read that, I immediately thought about the movie \"Wag the Dog,\" where Robert de Niro basically says, I've got no information for you on the B-3 bomber. I mean who's saying that they're panicked here? Why are they saying they're not panicked? What's the concern there",

Well, Donald Trump had his best primary yet this cycle and he's still dropping 30 percent to Nikki Haley. You know, more than 250,000 people voted against Donald Trump last night. So, how - how should that concern the Trump campaign going forward?",

I think of Kevin Bacon in \"Animal House\" saying, all is well, be calm, while all hell is breaking loose in the background behind you. Michigan voters, 100,000 of them, Michigan Democrat, sent a message to the Biden campaign. They said, we are not happy with you. That's a problem.Nikki Haley's results in South Carolina, and in other states, say that Donald Trump has a problem when it comes to the general election. And what we see is, for November, independent voters, and America by and large is saying, we do not want this sequel. This is the movable object against the resistible force. And both of these candidates can lose to each other and they're the only candidates potentially that could lose to each other. That's a problem for both of these campaigns. And it's why there's a lot of angst and handwringing that's still going on within the parties.",

But it was also the college counties, like around Ann Arbor, that you had high numbers of people voting uncommitted. What can President Biden do in terms of outreach to younger voters that he hasn't done already? I mean he's already forgiven all the student debt that he can. He's already showing up on Seth Meyers and TikTok. How does he reach the younger crowd?",

Some aren't on TikTok, some are. But he's going to need to continue to have this conversation with young voters, talking to them about their issues. Young voters, also most voters at this point in our electoral cycle are not single issue voters, so they care about the war that is happening in the Middle East and in Ukraine. They care about student loan debt. But they also care about the environment. And so the president needs to show up, not just on college campuses, but other places -- not every young person goes to college -- and have these conversations with them, listen to them, engage with them, continue to prove all the things that he's done and let them know what he will continue to do if they trust him with four more years.",

She's certainly making an argument that general election voters want to hear. And it's -- and it's a strong one. The reality is, that's not where the Republican Party is. She's conceding some of that. Whether she stays in past Super Tuesday I think depends potentially on some of these results. But, yes, she's not going to say, I may get out after Super Tuesday, because at that point you might as well get out before Super Tuesday. So, she's going to continue to say the things that she's been saying and say them loudly and frequently because there is an audience that wants that. It's a small audience within the Republican Party, but it's there. And if you're an independent voter, you like that messaging a whole lot.",

And so there is a coalition that can be assembled to address thisissue head-on. But I think that the shortsightedness of the senator's bill does not address the issue.
