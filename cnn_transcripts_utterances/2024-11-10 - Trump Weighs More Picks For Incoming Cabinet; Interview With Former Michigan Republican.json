With the countdown clock ticking towards inauguration day, President-elect Donald Trump is focusing on key positions and priorities for his second term and also celebrating another big victory. CNN can now project that Trump will win Arizona completing his clean sweep of all seven battleground states and as we wait to hear of his administration picks, Trump is sending out a clear message that he is emphasizing loyalty in his new hires. The president-elect is now ruling out two former cabinet officials who criticized him in the past. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump said he would not be inviting former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley and former secretary of state Mike Pompeo to be a part of his new administration. The president-elect is now preparing for an Oval Office meeting this week with President Joe Biden, a political tradition that didn't happen four years ago when Trump was defeated by Joe Biden as Trump was fighting the election results of 2020 and President Trump never invited incoming President Biden for a White House meeting. We have got a team of correspondents covering these developments. Sunlen Serfaty is at the White House for us. Let's begin with Alayna Treene, near Trump's Florida home. Alayna, good to see you. So what more are you learning about how the transition is going?",

Now look, when I talked to Donald Trump's campaign about this, theysay there are a couple positions that he is prioritizing over all others. And that really their goal right now, their main focus is trying to fill out his cabinet. But the top positions that Donald Trump views as the most important include his attorney general, the CIA director, the department -- excuse me, the secretary of Defense as well as the secretary of Homeland Security. But I do think what you mentioned there about what he said last night -- he did not announce new hires -- but he did announce who he does not want to serve in his second administration. I think that is very notable. Him saying that he does not want Pompeo or Haley in his administration does signal that he is really -- valuing loyalty above all else. It also shows that his team, excuse me, is keeping very close track of who has shown loyalty to him, who has been supporting him over the past several years and who is not. Now, as for Pompeo, I can tell you my conversations with some of the people involved in the transition process, they said that many people who are close to Trump actually believe that he did right by Donald Trump, that he was a great secretary of state. However, there was a lot of anger towards him for not endorsing throughout the entire Republican primary. And I'm told as well that in private conversations, Trump had actually asked the people around him whether or not they thought he would be loyal and whether he could trust him. Now, as for Nikki Haley, I'm told that Donald Trump really still harbors a lot of animosity towards her for not only the attacks that she lobbed at him throughout the primary process, but also for staying in that primary so long, Fred.",

But this was an invitation that was not afforded to Biden by Trump in 2020 as he continued to fight the allegations, the defrauded allegations and the falsehoods about voter fraud that happened in that election. So, it is very clear that the White House, in speaking to their aides and the president explicitly himself saying that this meeting on Wednesday is going to be about the smooth transition of power, about ensuring that there is a peaceful transfer of power and about ways that the country can be brought together after a grueling election season.

He has plans next week to travel to Peru for the APEC Summit, Brazil for the G-20 and then early in December, he will be traveling to Angola.

So you take those factors and Michigan has always been a purple state. You know, Trump won the state by about 11,000 votes back in 2016, Biden won it by 150,000 in 2020. And you said that Trump came back to win by about 75,000 this cycle. So it's a tough state to call, (INAUDIBLE) for sure, Republicans and Democrats, very close.

She talked about putting Republicans in her administration, including a member of the cabinet, similar to what Obama did when he picked Ray LaHood as his secretary of Transportation. But you know, now Republicans have a real chance to govern. They're going to have all three branches between the House, the Senate, as well as the White House. They have a lot to look at in terms of an agenda to pursue. He is going to get -- Trump is going to get his cabinet members. That should be done pretty much by the time that he is sworn in on January 20th. But there are still some pretty big issues. You know, the continuing resolution expires December 20th. And as you look at the leadership races that are going to occur for the next Congress, that are going to occur literally in the next week or two, both in the House and the Senate, they're going to have to make promises, the Republican leaders whether that be Thune or John Cornyn, maybe Rick Scott in Florida, but Mike Johnson in the House as well. They're going to have to tell their rank and file what they are going to do in terms of the continuing resolution funding levels, as well as you know, figure out how to govern with the new administration.

The next cycles don't look very good for Democrats. He can push forward as many nominations as possible, with judicial nominations.In terms of his legislative legacy, the Chips Act and the infrastructure bill are both actually bipartisan. But if he has any concern about their future under a Trump administration, he can push more money out the door to try to spur on those two initiatives. It's in foreign policy that his legacy, besides his political legacy, is most at stake and there he has some challenges to meet in the next two months. The first challenge is Iran. The last time that a foreign government tried to kill a former president and now a president-elect, the Clinton administration responded by attacking that government. It was 1993. The former president was George Herbert Walker Bush, and the country was Iraq. It's really important for the United States to send a military message against any foreign state that seeks to kill either a living -- a current or past chief of our country. So I suspect the discussion between Biden and Trump would be about how to respond and when to respond. It would be a lot easier and better for the country if the response is by Biden and not by Trump. It actually gives President Trump, President-elect Trump, some more diplomatic latitude if the response is from the previous administration. Of course, Iraq -- Ukraine is another foreign policy legacy here, conversations with president useful. What will be useful, though, is to give the Ukrainians a stronger hand. We know that the American people have given a mandate to President Trump to engage in some kind of negotiations to end that war. The Biden administration has an opportunity to strengthen the hand of the Ukrainians in that discussion there are a number of limits we have placed on Ukrainian use of our weapons that could be lifted in order, as I said, to achieve a stronger hand for the Ukrainians in a Trump- led negotiation. And finally, the president, I think wants to cement his legacy as promoting the rights of all Americans, but particularly of American women and in 2020, Virginia was the 38th state to ratify the equal rights amendment. There are legal complications, but it is possible that the administration could promote publishing that amendment because it has received three quarters of the states necessary to make it part of our constitution, and that would be a way of symbolically, at least making clear that despite the outcome of the 2024 election, American women are protected, respected and have equal rights.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, extremely serious.Todd Golden says he's been participating in this inquiry for the last month, but the rest of us didn't actually learn about this until literally just a couple of days ago, when the student newspaper broke the story. The newspaper is the \"Independent Florida Alligator\" and they say that he is being investigated for a series of charges, including allegations of sexual harassment allegations of sexual exploitation, stalking and cyberstalking of multiple women, including students, unwanted sexual advances, sending photos and videos of genitalia. And this is all based on a Title IX report that was apparently filed at the end of September, on September the 27th. Now under federal law, schools cannot comment or even confirm Title IX inquiries, complaints or investigations. Todd Golden, in his defense, is now going on offense. This is the statement that he released saying, quote, for the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality -- confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry. I have recently engaged the attorney, Ken Turkel, to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing. My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review promptly. Meanwhile, the season has just started. He is coaching the team. They've made a good start. They're 2-0.",

You should be doing this when you can tell me if I'm delivering this correctly two top playoff teams go down in stunning upsets. The fourth seeded Miami Hurricanes couldn't handle business against Georgia Tech, while the third seeded Georgia Bulldogs couldn't escape a maelstrom at Ole Miss. Here's Andy Scholes.

We had a huge SEC matchup in Oxford.Ole Miss hosting third ranked Georgia, a very rainy day in Mississippi. Third quarter Jaxson Dart is going to throw the touchdown to Antwane Wells Jr. That made it 22 to 10. And the Rebels defense was just amazing all day long. They had five sacks, nine tackles for a loss and with 16 seconds left, the Ole Miss students -- well, they jumped the gun and rushed the field. The refs made them all then get off the field because the rebels still needed to take a knee to end the game, and once they did, all the students rushed again and they went, of course, to tear down those goalposts the final in this one, 28 to 10, Ole Miss. First time Georgia lost to a team other than Alabama since 2020. Now, Georgia Tech meanwhile, pulling off a stunner against Miami. The Canes down five with the ball late in the fourth, but Cam Ward gets sacked here. Jordan van den Berg recovers for Georgia Tech. They shock fourth ranked Miami 28 to 23. Their students rushing the field as well, going straight for the goalpost. Now, they didn't get the whole goalpost down. They only broke off the uprights. And the students, they took one of those uprights out of the stadium and they threw it in the pool at the president's mansion for some reason. All right. Finally, we also had a shocker in the MLS playoffs last night. Miami hosting Atlanta and winner take all game three. Messi a magnificent header in the 65th minute to tie the game at two. And tempers flared as Messi's teammates not happy with Atlanta goalie Brad Guzan bumping their star. But fast forward to the 76th minute. A Miami defender, he goes down and is just laying in the box. Atlanta. They play on and Barton slips a header to take the hold on pulling off one of the biggest upsets in MLS history. So Atlanta fans super excited and get this their entire team makes about $5 million less than Messi alone. Fredricka, this though big loss for the MLS. You know, Messi and Miami, they were the best team all season. And you know for national appeal the league was certainly hoping to have Messi in his first full season playing for the MLS cup.

They could really feel that wildfire smoke.So that's why you have poor air quality alerts in effect for parts of New Jersey. New this goes until midnight. And then it stretches all the way up the Hudson Valley up to Albany, where we have these air quality alerts because of the smoke from these fires. And we've been able to see the smoke from satellite and again, its cutting across New York City, making it pretty hazy again it smells. And that air quality is poor. This Jennings Creek Fire has burned more than 2,000 acres. Again, the ground is very dry. We had gusty winds and dry air over the weekend, and you can see the multiple fires that have sparked and you see the smoke there in the sunrise. We've got red flag warnings in effect for Connecticut and Massachusetts where we still have gusts up to 35 miles per hour. That relative humidity is very low and the drought conditions again, have just been a problem. The good news is we do have some light rain starting to move into this area. That should help quench some of this. So, hopefully, help make some of those conditions better. And we really need the rain because these drought conditions have taken over more than half of the Northeast.",
