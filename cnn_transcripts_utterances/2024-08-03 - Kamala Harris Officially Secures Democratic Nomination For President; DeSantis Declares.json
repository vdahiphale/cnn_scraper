And there's some speculation about some of them who are getting more serious consideration. But the Vice President is going through a lot of things about them, trying to find who she has a rapport with, who she can trust, she doesn't know any of the men on that list very well at all. And so it's that plus obviously thinking about policy issues and how they're going to be on the stump. A lot of what she's trying to do is to look for, of course, first of all, who can help her win, but also who can help her fill out this idea of a future oriented ticket, which is what she wants this campaign to be about. I've covered the vice president for a long time, she likes to take her time with decisions go through a lot of data. She is not able to do that in the same way on this.

These are not people, however, that Harris has served with much or has had a whole lot of exposure to aside, obviously, from the last three and a half years where she's been the vice president.These are high level Democrats. These are people who have been -- within the White House's circle during the Biden administration. And so these are people that she's encountered, but not necessarily somebody that she's been in the trenches with, so to speak, to be working with a possible exception to that could be Pete Buttigieg, who obviously is part of the Biden administration, and also was one of her contenders when Harris herself ran in 2020. But it's that chemistry that really is going to, as was noted earlier, define this relationship, the New Democratic Party leadership that Harris is really trying to put forward this future of the party. And so, no doubt that is something that's really tops on her mind when she comes down to making this choice.

That was something that was notable in that June debate, where we didn't hear a lot about audience reaction, because there wasn't one. And that's something that, you know, we come to here as reporters and kind of try to gauge how something is landing when a candidate says it.But I think for the candidates themselves, that can be a good way to kind of crowd test what they're saying. And so it's not a big surprise that Trump is out with this. But as was noted earlier, this is really going to be, I think, a back and forth that we continue to see until if there is an agreement for the September 4 situation that he's put forward. But Trump said in that same line of messages last night, that if Kamala Harris doesn't agree to this debate, then he'll just hold the Fox News townhall himself and probably get across a lot of the same messaging that he would try to do in a debate.",

But in anticipation of that happening, they've started to issue a lot of those warnings and watches out ahead to give people as much time as they possibly can to prepare because people don't think I don't need to prepare for a tropical depression. But they do if they think it's going to be a tropical storm or even a hurricane.So yes, we have brand new just issued within the last hour some of those new hurricane watches. But here's where the storm is located. You can see just on the southern side there of Cuba, still tropical depression for the sustained winds at 30 miles per hour, it needs to get up to 40 miles per hour before we start to see that transition over to tropical storm strength. Here's a look at all of the watches and warnings. This pink color right here that does include Cedar Key and much of the Big Bend of Florida. That's where we have that hurricane watch. Now you've still got a tropical storm warning along much of the west coast. So that includes Tampa, St. Pete down through Naples. And pretty much all the way down to that Southwestern point. You still have some tropical storm watches in effect for the Keys. And I know that may not sound kind of like it should make sense because it would clearly hit this area first. But that's because we just simply don't know if it will make it to tropical storm strength before it continues to pass over that area. Because here's a look at the track, it's going to be awfully close as it crosses over the Keys whether or not it's still going to be a tropical depression or a tropical storm, but it is expected to become a tropical storm, especially once it gets out over those nice warm open waters. The thing here is right before landfall gets up to about 70 miles per hour. Remember, 75 is a hurricane, so it's going to be awfully close. And the key thing here too, is even when it continues on, notice how it really slows down. So flooding is going to be the biggest component with this particular storm. Now we talked about it getting awfully close to hurricane strength. A lot of that is going to have to do with the water temperature and look at how warm it is in this particular area. You're talking those low 90s right in there. That is fuel for the storms. That's why the National Hurricane Center is saying it's not out of the question that this could become a low end category one hurricane before it finally makes landfall in Florida. You've also got storm surge that's a factor. So flooding from two different ways. You've got flooding from all the rain that's going to come down and all of that water that's going to be pushed back in so two to four feet pretty much up and down most of the west coast of Florida. Look at some of this widespread rainfall of six to 10 inches, because there will be some spots that could pick up well over a foot of rain before this system finally exits well out into the Atlanta.",

And what we learned was that there was a lot of radio traffic, there were text messages, there were phone calls, but that information was pretty scattered.

That's where the Secret Service and the Pennsylvania State Police were station. This is all critical because what we know is that local law enforcement had been tracking this shooter for quite some time. They were passing information around about it. 30 seconds before the shooting, there was a local radio call that went out but that information apparently didn't make it out of that unified command post where the local law enforcement agencies were stationed.

Listen, I'm trying to make sense of this because before this week's jobs report, before Friday morning, there was widespread optimism that the Fed had achieved this soft landing that we've been talking about easing inflation, but not triggering a recession.

We're now talking about them doing a jumbo-sized rate-cut instead of just a normal-sized rate cut.

You know, if you lose your job, you're going to spend less, which means that the restaurant you would have been eating at is going to end up laying off people. And so, it tends to feed on itself.

People are like, of course, politics are supposed to matter, but they must, right?And the thing that former officials will pretty consistently tell you is, of course, we were aware of politics, you know, we're human beings setting policy in a very politicized environment, but we really tried to not pay attention to them when we were setting policy, because if you go down that road, if you start setting policy with an eye, either beat to helping the President or to sort of resisting calls for interest rate-cuts the President is making now. It's a really slippery slope. When do you stop and where do you lose your independence along that road? And so, I think -- I think it's pretty clear talking to them that politics aren't a huge factor and how they're setting interest rates. They really do try and extract from them.",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly, the signals, Amara, are different this time. You remember that the Iranians struck on the 13th of April this year after on the 1st of April, Israel struck a diplomatic and Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus.Now, on that 13th of April strike in which they fired more than 300 missiles and drones. That they really telegraphed exactly what they were going to do. So, it wasn't a surprise, Israelis, the Americans and others were prepared for it. One has to wonder how able the Israelis would have been to sort of shoot down most of those projectiles if it were not for the help of the United States and others. And that strike was seen as something of a flop. It really didn't cause any damage or much damage in Israel. And this time around, however, what we're seeing is that I think the Iranians are much more angry over the target, Ismail Haniyeh who was killed in the early hours of Wednesday in the heart of Tehran. Now, I mean, symbolically, that is a real slap in the face to the Iranians, and certainly, the messages the Iranians are sending is that the response will be harsher and quicker. Last time it was 12 days, perhaps, the Americans, particularly, I seem to think it's going to be a much quicker response. But what kind of response is difficult to say. keep in mind that on the 13th of April, it was just the Iranians who were firing on Israel. But the Iranians have developed what they call the ring of fire concept, where it's not just Iran against the Israelis. You have Hezbollah here in Lebanon that has been firing on an almost daily basis into Israel, and of course, Israel firing back. You have the Houthis in Yemen. You have various militias in Syria and Iraq, and don't forget, there are U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, who until January were a fairly regular target of those militia. So, all of those groups taken together, certainly could work in coordination to target Israel and also American targets. We heard Hassan Nasrallah; the Secretary-General of Hezbollah the other day, saying that they would strike back for the killing of the Hezbollah commander, not only on Israel, but who stands behind Israel, which of course, is the United States.

Ben mentioned that barrage and how crucial U.S. forces were in blocking that. You also have U.S. forces may potentially have to evacuate Americans. Think of Americans in Lebanon, how would they get out? Maybe that would be through U.S. warships, maybe that would be through U.S. help. You have to also remember, there are very important trade routes that are along this area, that is a hot zone right now, including the Strait of Hormuz in the past, the Houthi militia, that's a militia, of course, again, backed by Iran in Yemen that has been able to cause chaos along the route. Again, U.S. forces could be involved in unblocking that. But what is most crucial to U.S. forces right now is to try to find a way to turn down the temperature because you're absolutely in a tinderbox conflict right now with very little way out. And that is because mediation efforts that were led by the United States' hopes of a ceasefire that the U.S. had said was just on the doorstep. All of that, of course, now, under question, put to one side when you have a Prime Minister Netanyahu, who seems to be barreling on through with these assassinations of key figures across the region, and no hopes of a ceasefire when the negotiator, the mediator for the Palestinian side, Ismail Haniyeh, his assassination is what's triggered this crisis.",
