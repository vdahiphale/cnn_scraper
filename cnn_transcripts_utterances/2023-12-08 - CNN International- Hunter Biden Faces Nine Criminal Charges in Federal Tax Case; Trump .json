And former President Donald Trump has numerous federal and state court cases that will stretch well into next year and will almost certainly interfere with his campaign schedule. The Justice Department says Hunter Biden could face up to 17 years in prison if convicted of the tax charges. The investigation into the president's son was on the verge of being resolved in July when a plea deal fell apart. CNN's Evan Perez has the details on the new charges. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: A federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against Hunter Biden, charging the son of the president with failure to file and pay his taxes and filing false tax returns. The charges, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, include three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors. Special counsel David Weiss accused Hunter Biden of engaging in a four-year scheme during which he failed not to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes that he owed for the years 2016 through 2019. He also allegedly filed false tax returns. Prosecutors claimed that Hunter Biden used a company that he owned to claim false tax deductions. Prosecutors said that he used the money instead to, quote, fund his extravagant lifestyle. Now this is a time that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from business dealings in foreign countries, including Ukraine and in China. Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that Weiss bowed to Republican pressure to file unprecedented and unconstitutional gun charges to renege on a non-prosecution resolution. And now, after five years of investigating with no new evidence and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full, the U.S. attorney has filed 9 new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors. Prosecutors used the 56-page indictment to detail some of the ways that they say Hunter Biden spent money. Instead of paying taxes, he spent money on luxury clothing, on payments to escorts and dancers, and other personal expenses, such as an apartment for his daughter. They say he spent $188,960 in adult entertainment. Hunter Biden tried to seek tax deductions for a $10,000 membership to a sex club, according to prosecutors. And he also claimed tax deductions for wages -- for payments to women, including one who was pregnant with his child. Now, none of these allegations in the indictment mentioned any reference to President Biden. And prosecutors say that the investigation into Hunter Biden is ongoing. Evan Perez. CNN, Washington.

Bartov says he found no evidence of fraud in Trump's business deals. CNN's Brynn Gingras has that.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump, expected to take the stand on Monday as the final witness for the defense in the civil fraud trial that is really nearing an end after about two months. But in the courtroom for the defense, the second to final witness is an accounting expert. That really was the strongest witness for the defense that we have seen yet. Really, this witness basically said that the statement -- the financial statements of condition that are at the heart of this case. Which of course, if you remember the New York Attorney General has said, had overinflated assets done by the Trump's, and they did it intentionally. This witness countered that for the defense. Basically saying that they weren't out of the ordinary. That no accounting principles were violated and that he, in his judgment, hasn't even seen a case of fraud here. And even questioned the Attorney General as to why they even brought this case forward. So really the strongest witness that the defense has put forward. The former President sitting at the defense table listening to this testimony. But again, the big day and the big final day will be Trump when he finally does take the stand in this trial that has started really in October. And we won't hear a final decision. Of course, the judge making that final decision until January. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And interestingly, it says that in one, two-hour series it says of precise strikes. It says it killed numerous terrorists. Now at the same time, we've heard from the health authorities in Khan Younis saying that dozens of casualties came into hospitals there. And so, the fighting there incredibly intense. We know of course, the death toll so far in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas run health ministry, more than 17,000. Now Israel says that it's killed around 5,000 Hamas militants. But even if the Hamas run Health Ministry figures are precise, and if the IDF figures are precise, that's still, you know, around 12,000 civilians that would have been killed since the war began after that -- that massacre by Hamas on October 7th.",

Now, Daniel Hagari, he's the chief spokesman for the IDF, he was asked about this. And he didn't seem to specifically reference these images. But what he did say is that once there is fighting, intense fighting, such as we've seen in Khan Younis, for example, once the dust has settled and they -- after they finished engaging with the enemy, people emerge either from buildings or from tunnel shafts. And in Hagai's words, they say the IDF investigates and checks who has ties to Hamas and who does not. We arrest them all and questioned them. Now there's the Committee for the Protection of Journalists says that that one journalist may be among those who were arrested and or detained. And Euro Med Monitor has accused, which is a an NGO, accuses Israel of detaining and abusing dozens of Palestinians. We've reached out to the IDF to get some more details on those. In terms of the stripping down to the underwear, it's assumed that that is to avoid the risk that some, if there are militants among them, would be wearing suicide vests.

They're the kind of the key part of so much of Ukraine's artillery attacks that they may begin to slow down in arrival here too.Now Ukraine, I think, has perhaps been concerned this moment. It might begin to arrive. It might be the beginning, as I said, of a broader doubts in Western capitals as we head into the second -- the third year now of this war next year, that would possibly there may not be a decisive victory ahead for Kyiv. But I think there are many Ukrainians here who feel certain that Russia is holding its ground. Will use any pause to reequip, to regroup and then potentially push forwards ahead.
