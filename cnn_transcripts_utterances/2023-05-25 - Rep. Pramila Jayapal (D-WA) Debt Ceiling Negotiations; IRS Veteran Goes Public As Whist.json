And let's not be fooled into thinking that was a budget. It was not a budget. In fact, they pulled back all of their appropriations bills this week because there is no way to square for the American people what they're saying in terms of they want to increase Pentagon spending. They want to hold veterans harmless even as they are pulling money away from veterans for the Burn Pit fund, which helps people who were injured in war. And if you do all of that, Poppy, there's no way to not have significant cuts to health care, to school and education, to people's childcare, Social Security.

Let me just end on this because you've been a big voice and the progressive caucus has in urging the Biden administration to invoke the 14th Amendment here to essentially ignore the debt limit, raise it -- saying look, they have that constitutional authority. Janet Yellen has said that's legally questionable. The Biden administration has viewed it as problematic just with the timeframe we're in. And I thought it was interesting that Senate majority whip Dick Durbin warned, quote, \"Inserting it into the process now tosses this into the courts and God knows where it ends.\" And then, Republican Sen.

Republicans are using this as a hostage- taking move because they couldn't get these cuts that they're trying to get in during the regular negotiations and appropriations session. I think the American people have to understand that is what is happening.So is it our preference to use the 14th Amendment? Of course, not. We think Republicans should raise the debt ceiling. That can happen today, Poppy, if five Republicans who are responsible to their constitutional obligation get out there and sign the discharge petition for a clean debt ceiling raise with Democrats. So I don't want to use the 14th Amendment but what I am saying is that if it's a choice between a catastrophic deal for the American people either through default or through these awful spending cuts, then I think the president would have to go to using his unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling.",

We know that he believes that there were -- that there were some political or some partisan interference here by someone beginning in 2020 but also continued into the Biden administration. And not a lot of specifics in what he is saying but he does describe this October 2022 meeting where he says everything came to a head.

MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Right now, you've got to give these to yourselves once a week as shots. And so we've seen in results, actually just published this week, both from Pfizer and from Novo Nordisk -- Novo, of course, makes Wegovy and Ozempic -- that they have pill versions of this and, so far, in trials the results look similar when it comes to weight loss -- up to 15 percent of body weight over more than a year of taking this. And so these are still in trials right now. They are -- at least the Novo one -- they plan to file for FDA approval this year, potentially.

And I got to play for her a number of times -- most notably that time she did David Letterman's show in the '90s and she did a song called \"I Don't Really Want To Fight No More.\" And her great manager, Roger Davies, was with her right down in there in the trenches with us. And I got to be in her band for a second.And I'm telling you when I thought back and remembered seeing her on \"AMERICAN BANDSTAND\" with Dick Clark doing \"A Fool in Love\" in about 1960 -- I don't know what, '69 -- I didn't even understand it then. It was so complex. Now I realize it was like Ornette Coleman. It was so complex and avant-garde -- her sound. And then getting to work with her -- unbelievable. I can only imagine what John Fogerty -- what he feels like when he hears how she takes it slow first -- nice and easy -- and then she takes a song and does it nice and rough. Oh, my goodness.
