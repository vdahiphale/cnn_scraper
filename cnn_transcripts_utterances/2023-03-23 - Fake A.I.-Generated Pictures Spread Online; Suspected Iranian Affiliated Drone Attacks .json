We put the word \"fake\" over it, so it is clear that it is not real and it can't be reproduced, but perhaps you can see just behind the \"K\" there, it is Donald Trump running away from police. This was created by a man named Eliot Higgins. He's the founder of the investigative group \"Bellingcat\" after Donald Trump said falsely that he'd be arrested on Tuesday. We will show you more of these in a second. Let's bring in our panel. We have Juliette Kayyem, CNN national security analyst, Gideon Lichfield of \"Wired,\" Jessica Washington from \"The Root,\" and political commentator Evan Siegfried. Guys, great to have you. I think these deepfakes are terrifying. I think they're terrifying. I think that-- when I saw these, I know they're fake. They have fake written all over them. But still, I had a visceral reaction to seeing them. There's something about seeing a former president. Let me put up another one. Here's another one. This is a -- this one is about Donald Trump. It shows him in the middle of a police -- fake Donald Trump, of course -- the middle of a police (INAUDIBLE). He is falling to the ground.

CAMEROTA:  And here's one to prove your point of how if you look closely, you can tell that it's fake. Let's look at this one. This is, um, again fake, Donald Trump surrounded by police.

In fact, earlier today, General Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said since the beginning of 2021, U.S. forces in the Middle East have come under attack from Iranian proxies and drones 78 times. If you do the math there, that averages out to about one attack every 10 days or so, and that doesn't include the rocket attacks. You saw one of those just a couple of weeks ago. And inf act, a top U.S. general, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs was in Syria earlier this month visiting U.S. troops and one of the questions on his mind was forced protection.

UNKNOWN (voice-over):  The captain became incapacitated while en route. He's in the back of the aircraft right now with the flight attendants. MUNTEAN (voice-over):  Southwest Airlines says the incident started on flight 6013 from Las Vegas to Columbus, Ohio. Flight tracking data shows 27 minutes into the flight, at 37,000 feet, the flight started to turn back for Las Vegas.

Do not fly a lot for two years, so we're sort of re-gearing up. But that would mean, of course, that when we study security systems or safety systems, you want to avoid the single point of failure, right? If you got one pilot, you've got one single point of failure.
