Rahel Solomon joins us now. Rahel, I call it verbal reassurance, but also, I think, some explanation of why they moved so swiftly in the measures that they took?

And Julia, as you know, part of the story about why SVB failed in spectacular fashion as the way it did in the way that it did was because of a lack of competence, right? When SVB communicated, some would argue poorly, that it needed to raise cash in order to become more liquid. Well, that really sent off a panic between investors between Founders, and we saw a traditional bank run. So we saw the federal regulators really step up in dramatic fashion and very quick fashion over the weekend to try to prevent the contagion right? Try to prevent that panic from spreading. And Julia, really quickly, I just want to provide a bit of --. I just spoke to a Founder who had her money tied up at SVB for the last five years or so she said they had actually been a really great banking partner. She didn't find it shocking in terms of what we're learning about their risk management. But she said that from Wednesday to Friday, it was sheer panic within the Founder community within the tech community, as our Founders were hearing from their investors, some saying take your money out other saying everything is OK. She said, as of Saturday, some of her business accounts were bouncing that the money was not there from her SVB line of credit. And so in the sheer confusion about what would happened to SVB, she started to move some of her expenses to her personal credit card. It really just gives you a sense, Julia, of just the range of emotions that Founders and employees, of course of the startups must have been going through this weekend. And why we saw such quick action from the federal government and why President Biden again, trying to stress that this was a limited situation, but that the government will do everything, do whatever is needed to try to prevent any contagion to try to prevent any additional fragility beyond what is already evident?",

But it's understandable why people would be concerned, particularly with some of the smaller banks whose stock prices have fallen dramatically in the last 4 to 5 trading days. But I think as we'll see with time, things will smooth out as people understand the program, and really get their arms around.

When we hit those kinds of rate moves, we had the bottles, Orange County, California filed for bankruptcy, and Mexico had the peso crisis. So I was asking these management teams, why haven't we seen the barcode? Now, unfortunately, we have 24 hours later. And I think you bring up a good point, because the - tragedy, the financial crisis, was a credit led problems. This has nothing to do with credit, this all has to do with interest rates, and a mismatch between the lengths of time that the bonds mature, versus the funds they're using to support those bonds. You have to go back to 1979 and 1980, when the first Pennsylvania Bank went under with this problem. That's how long ago, and I think what the regulator's will obviously do is now take a look at interest rate risk, as well as credit risk in assessing the bank's health.",

Now, I don't want to point out, I don't want to suggest regulators don't look at interest rate risk, they do. But this upside down bond portfolio problem came, you know, out of - field because of the speed in which the information was moving, which is also this is something very different that we've never seen before, to see a bank that was healthy at 3:59 pm on Wednesday. Go out of business by Friday morning was absolutely breathtaking. And so part of what needs to be addressed by the regulators is how quickly information moves and when it deals with confidence, we've got to be very careful with that. So that's another issue that will have to be addressed. Once everything settles down is how do we handle the speed in which this information can move around?",

So efficiency and information can be really good in the financial sector except in this kind of situation. And very quickly, do you think there's also a problem in communication between bank management and the regulator's? I'm just trying to imagine a bank management trying to explain leveraged crypto to a regulated to ensure that they understand that what's going on and how things move with interest rates. And I'm even struggling to explain it here myself.

That bit is unclear, but we have had a statement from them, which says the joint venture that is that says the bank has a standardized corporate governance structure and independent balance sheets, they say that operations are sound. Interestingly, over the weekend, we had at least a dozen Founders and companies coming out saying very clearly that either they had no exposure to SVB, or very insignificant exposure. It was a lot of reassurance going on a lot of nothing to see here. So far, that appears to be the case not seeing any huge market moves as a result of that.

And recapping our top story today the race to shore up confidence in the U.S. financial system, PresidentBiden addressed the nation a short time ago in a bid to bolster public confidence following the second largest bank failure in U.S. history. In the past 24 hours, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and the Bank Regulator, the FDIC, have said customers of Silicon Valley Bank, including well known tech names, and startups will be able to access their cash today. That includes all uninsured deposits. So just to remind you, that's amounts over $250,000. But now, the questions really begin over how regulators failed to see this coming? Joining us now Sultan Meghji, he's Former Chief Innovation Officer at the U.S. regulator, the FDIC and now a Professor at Duke University's Pratt Engineering School. Great to have you on the show Sultan! I think what's become very clear, and we've already discussed this, on the show is concentration risk, concentration of deposits being made from startups from the tech sector but also concentration risk on the balance sheet of a bank that was investing in government bonds, mortgage backed securities that are very sensitive to interest rate rises, the combination, a perfect storm. SULTAN MEGHJI, PROFESSOR, DUKE UNIVERSITY'S PRATT ENGINEERING SCHOOL: That's exactly right. And, you know, it's not just this bank, which really, I think some of the concerns across the banking regulators, including my former agency. We have this across all of the regional banks right now to one degree or another.

Regulators guaranteeing the uninsured deposits that collapsed Silicon Valley Bank that's just one of the emergency measures announced. We're seeing truly extraordinary moves lower however, in U.S. bond yields 10 year yields, which had been approaching 4 percent in the United States not too long ago, now below 3.5 percent. What does this reflect? Well, the expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will have to reevaluate its rate hiking path in the wake of this crisis. As Jared Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets told us earlier this will help ease some pressure on U.S. banks that are currently holding treasuries, U.S. government bonds that will currently be sold at a loss if they had to raise money. Now, a number of regional banks however, under intense pressure in early trade, as we've mentioned earlier lots of these banks will probably need to raise money and where would you rather have your cash as a depositor today in a big bank, or in a small?

Realistically weunderstood that we were going to get access to the $250,000 fairly quickly and that is $250,000 that FDIC insurers. However, a $250,000, for us is a relatively small amount of money, and would have only kept us alive for a handful of days. The other thing to understand that's really important, given that I'm the Founder and the CEO, is that if I pay employees I should say, have they worked, and I can't pay them. I am personally liable for that payroll. Even on Friday, we had a withdrawal for our 401k that the employees had already deposited, that did not go through it bounced. I'm personally liable for that. And that's a very high consideration. So $250,000 would have let us go for a handful of days. But I basically would have had to shut down the company by the end of this week. There was no other contingency plan. So over the weekend, of course, I was scrambling to find dead options and other cash options. Our investors started stepping up in a meaningful way there. So we knew we started having some options, but nothing that was going to last that long. So the news on Sunday evenings was quite relief.",

There's two things, first of all, those who because of the terms. It was pretty standard practice for SVB, for debt to say, hey, if we're going to give you debt, you need to put all your capital in our bank. So that was that was piece number one. But piece number two and this is one thing that's really important to understand. We don't think so today because of latest news but just you know we go Silicon Valley Bank was considered the gold standard. Silicon Valley Bank was the bank for the hot tech startups, all the way to public companies. And when your startup and you raise money, like we have, we've raised over $60 million a day; you have to have a few things, right? Have the right lawyer have the right accountant. And you have to have the right banker. And these bankers, the Silicon Valley bankers, they have the relationships with the investors. They are considered kind of top tier.

We wired the money on Thursday. But we were just a little too late, unfortunately. So the money did not get out of our Silicon Valley Bank account, and did not make it into our Chase account. Hopefully that happens today. I've been obsessively checking my email, nothing from the FDIC yet. I've been checking the website and just say that there's a technical error, and they apologize for the inconvenience. So hopefully the money will be able to be transferred shortly.",
