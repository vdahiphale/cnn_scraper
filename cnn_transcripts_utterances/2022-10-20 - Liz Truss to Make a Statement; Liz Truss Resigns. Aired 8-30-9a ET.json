You're looking at live pictures outside 10 Downing Street where they just set up that lector outside the door and we've been told we're about to hear a statement from the prime minister, Liz Truss.Now, she has been under enormous pressure just six weeks into her job. Just six weeks into her job, there have been all kinds of calls even for her resignation. She has lost her chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary because of the economic turmoil inside the country. And again, we are expecting a statement any minute now. Let's go right to CNN's Bianca Nobilo, who is live for us in London with what we might expect from this. Bianca.",

      "sentences": "John, this is stunning. A prime minister for six weeks. You'd think after the turbulence of the years that had come before, that perhaps Britain would be in for a period of more stability, but certainly not.The prime minister said that she was elected on the mandate to address Britain's economic crisis. But that mandate was always slim. By less than 0.1 percent of the electorate, John. Now, the prime minister, I believe, might become the shortest ever serving prime minister. I know there was one deep in Britain's history who died unexpectedly after a period of weeks. But I think Liz Truss may be the shortest serving prime minister in these circumstances. She has acknowledged the pressure that has been building within her own party, the country at large. The last week saw polls come out putting her at the lowest approval rating of a prime minister ever. Other polls came out which showed that the prime minister and people that elected her wanted her out. And they possibly wanted Boris Johnson in her place again. She then had resignations and more and more of her lawmakers coming out saying that it simply wasn't tenable for her to continue. The drip, drip became a tidal wave of opposition to her staying in post. And what's happened today is the party grandees, the most influential members of the conservative party, the chairman of the party, the chairman of the powerful committee that chooses how prime ministers are elected, and her deputy prime minister and close confidant have all visited her in Downing Street. They've, obviously, discussed and acknowledged the political reality that she simply can't continue, John. And this was all set into another gear and largely precipitated by those chaotic scenes I was talking about last night that have led conservative lawmakers to tell me, and to tell the media, that they were simply so ashamed, depressed and horrified at what their party has become.",

So that was what set this all in motion. And then we got to the point where we are today. What are the possible implications now really for the rest of the world, for the United Kingdom, which had been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, of course a key ally to the United States? What changes? What might we see there?",

      "sentences": "John, you make an important point because Liz Truss is both a victim and an architect of her political misfortune. A victim because she became prime minister at a time when the country was in deep economic turmoil. We've just had inflation figures go into double digits. That was announced yesterday, 10.1 percent in the United Kingdom over the last month.But she also had a series of unforced errors. For example, that economic package, which you referenced, which she announced after becoming prime minister, went a lot further and faster than what she'd promised in her leadership campaign. It had tax cuts for the wealthiest in the country, slashing of corporation tax and other measures that deeply unsettled the markets and sent them into a spiral, causing the Bank of England to make this unprecedented financial intervention. It caused deep consternation within the party. It was very difficult to find any economist that could agree with the course that she was taking. And this made many within her party question not only her economic judgment, but also her political judgment because at a time when the country was grappling with this cost of living crisis, and a lot of people in Britain are wondering whether or not they can afford to pay both their heating and their food bills, the prime minister announcing reducing taxes for the wealthiest and removing caps on bankers' bonuses. It's just very peculiar political decision making and terrible optics. [08:40:01] So, after that happened, and then Britain once again looks like an unstable partner and an unstable ally, this has been a motif and a reoccurring theme since Brexit that sometimes the country can't be trusted. There have been promises from Boris Johnson to break international rule, and others. In terms of where Britain finds itself now, in a deeply embarrassing and unstable position. And this has been the concern from lawmakers within Liz Truss' own party. They can see how this is being interpreted, not just by this country, but the world at large. Britain had been playing an influential role in Putin's invasion of Ukraine. It's a key partner to the United States and is an important part of that Trans-Atlantic alliance and still does have a major role to play in Europe and on the content. But when we're having a revolving door of prime ministers and chancellors and home secretaries, clearly it's a very difficult partner to engage with. And there has been shock and consternation on the continent as well about what is really happening here in Britain. And we even had Joe Biden speaking out last week expressing his concerns about the policy direction that Liz Truss was taking. And as we both know, that's quite unusual for a president to do and to remark of a key ally.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And that is according to the stats official, she is the shortest serving. The last time was in 1827 when after a more than 100 days a prime minister resigned. Those are just the stats.But what you have here has been the drip, drip, drip since she met the queen. You remember the first dramatic picture of Liz Truss was when she met the queen on the eve two days before the queen died. And that was the last official action that the queen did under her constitutional role as monarch. And then it looked like Liz Truss almost had a baptism of light really, that she was going to take this mandate and move on to what could have been a successful premiership, except, except, except she decided, in cahoots with her then chancellor, to settle on a financial package which they dubbed a mini budget that nobody knew about, nobody approved and there was no mandate for that sent the markets tumbling and has sent this country rocking and ricocheting from one disaster to the next over the last more than a month or so. And she could no longer hang on. Her members of her party, starting from last night, officially, and maybe just before, even on my program, started to say that we will not support her, we cannot support her, she has to go. The question is, after she's made this extremely short statement outside Downing Street, the question is what happens next, what is the procedure. We're told that there should be a leadership contest, but what she's laid out, in a very, very short time, she suggested that within a week or so a new leader should be found. Well, how? Does that go to even the members? What's happening here is a distinct lack of the democratic process, Brianna, because she was not elected by the people. And this is what happens. After 12 years of this party in power, through austerity, through Brexit, through the demise of Britain on the foreign stage, except for in Ukraine, this is what's happened. A country -- a party that appears to be unaccountable to the people. So, you've heard the labour opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer, today again say there needs to be a national election, a general election to help this country out of the crisis that it is now and at least put it to the people.",

And then you had \"The Daily Star\" actually doing a live stream of a head of lettuce and Liz Truss, asking, which one is going to last longer. And, actually, the head of lettuce seems to have outlasted Liz Truss. She has come down in such a fashion here.But when you're talking about this going in one week, right, if you're talking about an election and it's not part of the democratic process happening in one week, what would that look like in terms of stability and the reaction that Britain is going to have to that?",

As I understand it, he's just ruled himself out.The other sort of option that the media were talking about in the week, and we were, you know, discussing to some extent, it's impossible to confirm, is that there's a compromise perhaps in having Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt, who are from different parts of the party, as a -- as a double act, if you like. But that doesn't work in the same way it would work in American where you could have a vice president and a president. You know, how would they share the responsibilities of prime minister? There have been deputy prime ministers. There's one at the moment. But they don't have any sort of constitutional authorities. So how are they going to work that out? It's not clear. They've got a huge amount to work out in a weak (ph) conservative party. But they're utterly divided and they've broken. So, it's difficult to see how they're going to get through it. Obviously, people look towards the monarch in these situations as well, as someone that can bang heads together. A big test for King Charles as his first constitutional crisis, if you like, is he going to run a mile from this, like his mother would have done, or might he get involved and try to find some sort of resolution.",

And certainly the policies and the chaos were not in line with what they needed in this difficult and unstable time.So, can you talk a little bit about the atmosphere and also how that needs to be corrected by whoever may next come in, and really how many options there may be for someone with the proper temperament to bring that?",

      "sentences": "Well - so there are global headwinds. You know, the global economy is heading towards a recession. So there was that sort of issue that she had. And then there's the cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom, as exists in America and around the world. So, difficult times to walk into it.But she didn't read the room. She accentuated all of those problems by then coming up with a budget which was cutting taxes, but particularly for the - for the wealthy, which didn't sit well, of course, with the public, but wasn't costed out. Basically, you know, she couldn't afford to cut those taxes and she wouldn't outline how she would cut spending as a result. So, that's really what caused the market chaos. And then she didn't respond effectively to that when her party then got very upset about it, justifiably. So, the next person coming in has to take the sort of Jeremy Hunt point of view, I suggest, which is, he worked with the Bank of England. He worked with the city, trying to find some sort of way through with a budget, calm the markets, and then he was going to presumably move on to sort of supporting the conservative party. So, someone's got to come in who has authority with the economy and the markets and the international community. We even have President Biden coming out criticizing Liz Truss. It was extraordinary. Someone that has that credibility and can pull the party together enough to get through to a general election. But, frankly, the problem you've got is that the people - that person is going to asks for support are the people that are going to lose their jobs in a general election because, as John just said, the polling numbers for the conservative party are absolutely appalling. If we went to the polls right now, they'd be absolutely wiped out and all those MPs would probably lose their job, or most of them.",
