This is CNN News Central. All right, the major breaking news this morning, we're standing by for Nikki Haley to officially end her presidential run, which will all but solidify a Trump-Biden rematch. And now with Haley soon out, it is all about November and winning over her supporters. The Biden campaign now gunning for Haley's voters as they make a new push to take down the man they just called wounded, dangerous and unpopular. Right now, Trump has over 1,000 delegates as Haley announces in hours that she is exiting the race. John Berman is in Denver. John, what are we hearing from Haley as she's about to make this announcement in just a few hours? What are we hearing for her as far as whether or not she is going to back Donald Trump? Has she said anything on those terms?",

Colorado is a state that both Donald Trump and President Biden won on Super Tuesday, but Super Tuesday was so yesterday. We're now in this brand new, historic phase of this campaign. The first presidential rematch is Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson, the first time Donald Trump hopes to be a president to serve non-consecutive terms since Grover- Cleveland. This is truly historic. And if yesterday was Super Tuesday, today is sort of Haley Wednesday. Nikki Haley dropping out of the race very shortly, and both candidates, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who are left trying to win over her voters, Joe Biden much more explicitly, the Biden campaign putting out a memo even before we learned that Haley was dropping out, specifically targeting Haley voters, so everything we're about to see today and in the next few days seems to be fighting over that urgent political terrain. Let's get right to Charleston, South Carolina. Kylie Atwood is there. That is where we will hear from Nikki Haley shortly with this major announcement that doesn't just end her campaign, Kylie, but reshapes the rest of the presidential campaign.",

Let's go to the Trump campaign now. Our Alayna Treene is in Washington covering that group. And it is interesting, Alayna, because while Nikki Haley's going to say that Trump needs to earn her support, he hasn't really been trying to do that at all over the last few months.",

      "sentences": "That's right, he absolutely hasn't. And I think it's interesting because, you know, unlike with some of the other former Republican rivals that Donald Trump had faced and then dropped out of the race and became surrogates, I think that's very unlikely, at least for now, to happen with Nikki Haley.Donald Trump and his campaign have long been very frustrated with Haley. They think that she was standing in the way of uniting the Republican Party behind him by remaining in the race for as long as she had. But we also know that Donald Trump had long faced Nikki Haley with skepticism. He argues that she had flip-flopped on a lot of issues. He has questions about her loyalty after she had announced that she was going to be running for president. So, there's not a lot of love between the two. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. But, of course, we know that anything is possible with Donald Trump. We know that people have nine lives with him. So, what is true today is not always true for the future. And I can tell you from some of my conversations with outside Republicans, including those who are loyal to Donald Trump and some of Donald Trump's allies, that some people do actually think Nikki Haley would be very effective in a future Trump administration. But, again, if the election were tomorrow and say Donald Trump were to win, of course, this is just a hypothetical I'm referring to, I don't think that would happen. They are very, again, frustrated with Nikki Haley. And I think it's interesting if you actually compare this to Ron DeSantis. We know that last year, the majority of 2023, Donald Trump had really aimed most of his attacks on the Florida governor. And part of that is because he had a personal animosity for Ron DeSantis. But because of the way that DeSantis dropped out and immediately endorsed Donald Trump, he kind of laid off DeSantis, right? I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon with Nikki Haley.

It's if he was convicted of a crime, which is still, in fact, think he was fit for the presidency. And overwhelmingly in all these states, they said, yes, he was. And, again, look here, how they voted in the GOP primary. Think Trump is fit for the presidency of convicted. Look at this across California, North Carolina, Virginia, an 85-point margin for Donald Trump. If you don't think he was fit, you voted for Nikki Haley, but it was just a 47 percent margin.

The Philippines is accusing China of acting illegally in this area, and a top security official today has said that if China thinks that this is going to weaken the Philippine's resolve, they're going to be really disappointed. They're going continue trying to assert what they say are their legal rights.And a number of years ago there was an international arbitration court that ruled in favor of the Philippines in this territorial dispute. This isn't the first time that there have been these confrontations at sea. They've happened over months in the past. One of the different things that happened here were that Filipino servicemen were lightly injured and there were some damage to some of vessels. Also, we were the first among the foreign journalists in decades to be on board one of these Philippine Coast Guard ships as it was trying to run the gauntlet past this much larger Chinese fleet. And I might add the Philippines is a mutual defense treaty of the U.S. If things escalate, the U.S. will be beholden to come to the Philippines' defense potentially against China, which commands the world's largest Navy.
