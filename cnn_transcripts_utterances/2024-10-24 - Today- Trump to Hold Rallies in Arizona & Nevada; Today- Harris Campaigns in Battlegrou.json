And then from here, he will go to Las Vegas, Nevada, the two largest population centers in these two key battlegrounds.Trump has not spent as much time out West as he has in those Rust Belt states or fighting to hold on to North Carolina or take back Georgia. So this is an opportunity for him to reconnect with Arizona and Nevada voters who are going to be very, very crucial in this election. The signage around here suggests this is going to be an event focused on the economy. \"Make America Affordable Again\" is on some of the signs. Also, crime, it says, \"Make America Safe Again.\" But we also know that when Trump is in Arizona, he likes to talk about his top issue, and that is the border. So we expect plenty of conversation about that later today as well. Trump comes into today having said that he intends to fire the special prosecutor, Jack Smith, who is overseeing two of the federal cases against him if he is elected.

Let me explain why. Let me give you a little bit of timeline here of how this has happened.In their first trial, it ended in a mistrial. In that case, they were saying that this was all self defense because of the emotional, physical abuse that they were dealing with and physical. And then they also said, as far as the prosecutors were concerned, that this was all about hatred and the fact that the two young men had been disinherited from their parents' will. That didn't go forward, obviously. Then, in the second trial, they were convicted of first degree murder, lifetime without the chance of parole. So they have been in jail for over 30 years. But what has come to light is this leather letter that was not admitted into evidence in that second trial that was written by Erik Menendez to their cousin Andy Cano several months before the murders occurred. And I want to read part of it to you. It says, \"I've been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening, Andy, but it's worse for me now. I never know when it's going to happen and it's driving me crazy. Every night I stay up thinking he might come in.\" So they're saying this letter, which alludes to that abuse as well as the change in California law, which means you can reference other resentencings that have happened out there in other legal cases means that they could look at this case differently. And part of the argument being made by the district attorney, George Gascon, is that in light of where we stand as a culture in the country, this view of the abuse could be seen differently by a jury. So that is why they're looking to vacate it. Now, one thing, though, I should tell you is that despite what the district attorney says, it's going to be up to a judge to make the decision in this case. The judge will have to consider whether or not the brothers were, in fact, abused victims, will consider if they have been rehabilitated while they have been in prison and whether or not they are a danger to society. This hearing is already set. That is set for November 26. But what could happen is another day could be scheduled to figure out whether or not to vacate. What the defense wants here is to figure out whether or not they can show this new letter or whether or not they could just get it vacated and move from there.",

We had an unbelievable expert most recently in one of my cases where the expert was able to actually locate the time of when that letter was allegedly written. Why? Because the ink degrades over time and it degrades in a certain way.So you'll have an expert come forward. They'll look at the degradation of the ink. Then they'll also look to other types of letters and say, well, Erik Menendez claim - says that he wrote this letter months before the killings of his parents. Well, did he actually author that letter? Let's look at other letters. Is it actually his? They'll be another expert that will look into a handwriting analysis and make sure that the handwriting is consistent with other writings that Erik Menendez has had. So all of that, it's fairly simple and something that the D. A. S. Office will generally do, especially as a defense attorney. When we have this type of evidence, we absolutely present it to the prosecutors and say there is no truth. Here's something that's compelling. You need to know this exists. My client's innocent.",
