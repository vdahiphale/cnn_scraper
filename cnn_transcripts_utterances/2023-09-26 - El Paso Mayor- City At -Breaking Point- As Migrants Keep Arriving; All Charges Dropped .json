The charges against the Philadelphia police officer who shot and killed Eddie Irizarry, the man who was out of a traffic stop and shot several times, those charges have been dropped. This officer was facing seven charges, including murder.Let's get straight to Danny Freeman, who was just in court. Danny, can you give us some sense of what happened? Was there new evidence that came to light in court?",

      "sentences": "Sara, in this particular case, there was no new evidence that was brought up in court. And frankly, we saw in that courtroom just a few moments ago the same video from body camera footage worn by the two officers who were at the scene at the time. We saw the surveillance video that attorneys had released prior to this preliminary hearing today.And there were testimonies from both the partner of Mark Dial, the officer who was on the stand. There was also testimony from a detective who is from the officer-involved shooting department. And after all of that little over two hours, the judge in this case, Judge Wendy L. Pew, said that she agreed one hundred percent with the defense in this case, and dismissed all charges related to Officer Mark Dial. And, Sara, I just want to talk a little bit about what may have been some of the key moments that were brought up here. One of the main things that was brought up and discussed by both the prosecution and the defense was the knife. You might remember that Eddie Irizarry, he was driving the wrong way down the street. Police were chasing him. He parked his car on that one-way street. His windows were just about all the way up. That's when officers came around. And there was this moment where we heard it on the surveillance video, we also heard it on body-worn cameras as it was played in court where the other officer who was there, the partner, testified that he shouted knife, knife. And then the defense basically said -- and he also when you hear it back, shouted that there was a gun. And then moments later, Mark Dial, the officer fired into the vehicle. And the thing that came up, Sara, was we and the judge saw a picture of the knife in question. They brought out a picture of the knife and how it was actually positioned in the car. And knife, Sara, to describe it to you, had a handle. It was a -- it looked like a hunting knife. There was a switchblade, but it had a handle and a serrated blade. It's clear that that knife, which is something that the defense harped on saying that could have been a gun in the eyes of the officer. It's clear the judge took that evidence an extreme amount of weight and agreed with a defense who argued at the very end that every tragedy is not a crime. The defense said this is a hundred percent not murder. The judge agreed. Sara.",

You said it was played in court. And I want to warn people that this is really disturbing video for you to look at right now. But here is the video of what happened. We're going to stop it before the most gruesome parts. But if we show that video, you can see the officers coming up to the car. And here is what it sounds like and looks like at those moments.

Very disturbing video for anyone to see, including, of course, the family. When you're in court, is the family in court listening to all this? Because one of the things that stands out to me is that initially, the first judge who saw this case revoked his bail and forced the officer into jail. This is a very different look at this case from this new judge.",

But I just want to paint a picture of the inside of this courtroom on the third floor of the Criminal Justice Center behind me. We -- the media, we were actually in the jury box so we were inside the main space where the bulk of this hearing was taking place. [11So, we were looking out actually on the audience. The people who were in the court just viewing. The entire right side of the court from our vantage point, Sara, were Philadelphia police officers and family members it seemed of other Philadelphia police officers. The entire left side were predominantly family and supporters of Eddie Irizarry, the man who was killed in the situation. Many of the people on the left side of the courtroom, they were wearing shirts with Eddie Irizarry's picture on it. And when the judge made this declaration that these charges would all be dismissed, the right side where there were several police officers, many jumped up. There were cheers. And then on the left side, there were many tears and a lot of frustration. And then folks had to basically make sure that there was an orderly process as people were leaving the courtroom. There were some words exchanged between the left side and the right side. But for the most part, inside the court was peaceful and civil. But that moment was truly a stunning one. I should also say there were tears during this two-plus hour preliminary hearing, Sara. There were tears from family members of Eddie Irizarry because they played the video of him being killed over and over again. And I should say each time the body camera footage of the moment of Irizarry's death was played, Officer Mark Dial who was sitting at the defendant's table. He also was crying and taking tissues as well. So, as you can imagine, Sara, an incredibly emotional day in court as a judge dismissed all charges against the officer who killed and shot Eddie Irizarry. Back to you.",

He never did. 2012, he was reminded of this. He never did. That's one.Number two. Joe Biden recognizes that our democracy is in crisis. He's going to break the norm. He's going to do something that presidents have never done because there's no second chance for him. He needs Michigan. And by the way, there aren't just striking workers in Michigan. They're also in Ohio, and they're in Missouri. Biden is not going to win Ohio and Missouri, but he could help Democrats in both states, particularly Sherrod Brown in Ohio.",
