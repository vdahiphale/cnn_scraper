American troops made it all the way to Mexico City, and the US annexed much of today's western United States. The future founder of the Republican Party, and Illinois Congressman named Abraham Lincoln passionately opposed the war.But today's Republicans have Mexico in their sights once again. Back when he was president, Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper if he could launch missiles at Mexico's drug cartels without Mexico's permission, and then blamed the attack on another country. We could do it quietly, Trump said, no one would know it was us. Esper told him the idea was ridiculous, an act of war against one of America's biggest trading partners. But Trump would not back down, and an Oval Office fantasy -- DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER US PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will deploy all necessary military assets --",
