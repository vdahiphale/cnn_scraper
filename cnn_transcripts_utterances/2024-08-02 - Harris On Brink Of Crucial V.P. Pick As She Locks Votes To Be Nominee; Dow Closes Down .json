We'll tell you what we're learning about the make-or-break interviews Harris is planning with top V.P. prospects this weekend.Also tonight, breaking news on the economy, the Dow Jones Industrials closing down more than 600 points, the market's sinking as a weaker than expected jobs report raises fears of a potential recession. Plus, amid rising tensions in the Middle East, the U.S. military taking new action tonight, sending warships and other assets to the region as Iran vows retaliation against Israel following the killing of a Hamas leader. We're covering this breaking story at the Pentagon in Israel and in Israel this hour. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Boris Sanchez and you're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, Kamala Harris is about to make the biggest decision yet in her new presidential campaign, as she's also making history, sealing the votes needed to become the first woman of color to lead a major party's ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Yes, I'm happy to know that we have enough delegates to secure the nomination. And later this month, we will gather in Chicago, united as one party, where we're going to have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jeff, the next 72 hours are going to be crucial for her campaign as she sifts out a V.P. pick. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENTWhat's so striking about this is that four years ago, next week, she accepted that phone call from Joe Biden to be his running mate. Now, she is going to be making that offer to someone else, something that she hasn't necessarily been planning on. So, she doesn't have a long relationship with a lot of these candidates. But Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is seen by many Democrats as a leading contender. Why? He's a good campaigner. There's no doubt about it. He's been out every single day kind of showing this, but also Pennsylvania, a must win state. However, is she going to go geography or biography? There's no question that the astronaut sort of background of Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, also so impressive and important, also the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, has been a fiery campaigner. He's the one who branded the Trump campaign as weird. And a lot of Democrats are taking notice of that, and then a few other potential contenders as well. But we do believe that this weekend is when she will decide who she's most comfortable with and she and her husband, Doug Emhoff, will have a meeting perhaps stretching some period of time, private, of course, and then she'll roll this person out at a rally on Tuesday in Philadelphia. I'm told do not read anything into the Philadelphia, even though Josh Shapiro is the governor of Pennsylvania, because other candidates also -- she's also going to Arizona by the end of the week, so we're not sure about that. But all eyes are on Governor Shapiro.",

At the same time, there's sort of a delicate dance where you can't overhaul a campaign in three and a half months. But as the candidate, you want to put your stamp on it.And we've seen Harris do that in terms of, you know, completely changing the message. It's not about democracy. It's about freedom. She's prosecuting the case against Trump. We've seen her just sort of try to put her unique spin on this, but at the same time manage the campaign that she inherited.",

In fact, some of the people on the outside, they say, let's look back to 2016. This is roughly the same time that Kellyanne Conway got brought into the Trump campaign. There are changes that are naturally made anyway. Obviously, this is extenuating circumstances because Harris just became the nominee, and she also just became a candidate right before that. But I think you're looking at likelihood of getting more staffing for the Trump campaign, changing strategy in some ways.

And so they understand what it takes to win.They are also consummate team players because it is really important. She's not going to push aside the team that she currently has around her because they also have been very successful, this lightning in a bottle that has occurred since she became the candidate and now the nominee. And it's a historic day today, Boris, as you know, you have noted it, and I have had the pleasure of being a delegate to cast my ballot for the first woman of color that is going to be the nominee of a major party and hopefully the first woman president of the United States. And so I think that the strategy is to bring this disparate group of strategists and operatives together. They all know how to win. They all know what needs to happen in the next 90-something days.

I don't think the Trump versus Biden race T.V. ads were going to matter all that much. But with Harris in the race, the Trump T.V. and what they're trying to do to define her matters a lot. And the Harris T.V. and what they're trying to do to shove back on that also matters a lot. So, I think we went from a race with two really well-defined candidates to a race with one candidate who the American people know her, but they don't know a lot about her.

I think that's been a message a lot of people in this country, a lot of people in the party needed to hear that that mattered. But at the same time, everyone knows that Kamala Harris is someone who believes in the state of Israel and will defend it. I think President Biden tried to make that separation, but it took quite a while to get to that point.

It would be an interesting message for her to do. So, I think he's the best choice. She's got interesting people, but Pennsylvania, they can't win without it.

It was destroyers, U.S. destroyers, in the Mediterranean Sea that intercepted several of those launches, so they may be in position to do that once again, depending on what Iran's anticipated retaliation looks like. Austin also ordered a fighter squadron to the region. It's unclear from the statement what types of fighters or where they will go, but we have seen U.S. fighters be instrumental in intercepting certain types of launches, for example, Houthi launches over the course of the past several months.

But she's going to have to put a finer point on it and she's going to have to do it pretty soon.And when I talk to friends and advisers and officials who have worked with her, there are a few themes that emerge. They say that she is going to be leaning pretty heavily on the Biden budget as a blueprint, as a starting block of sorts, to choose from that what policies she wants to really promote as her own. And she cares deeply about policies affecting working families, small businesses, and promoting investment in underserved communities. They describe her as pro-business, but also interested in holding business accountable. So, there's no clear -- she's not really a clear ideologue in that way. And so it's really hard for the market and for investors and for donors to a certain extent, too, to understand exactly where she stands on a lot of these issues. [18:35:01]",

So how does she sort of, while coupling what Biden's track record achieved for a lot of Americans, also kind of create her own lane?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, look, I think there are two points here before that. Number one is that we have seen election after election that voters views of the economy tend to track with their views of how they think about the president, whoever the incumbent is. And so people were not happy with Joe Biden, long before that debate performance. And that was part of why people were saying that they didn't think the economy was in good shape, even though, today's numbers aside, a lot of indicators are positive about the economy. The other thing here is that we've got Kamala Harris needing to figure out how she connects with the Biden administration record, but also come in her own place, as Kayla was saying. A couple days ago when she was in Atlanta, she talked about the theme of the economic part of her speech was, I get it, right, and talking about that, what it is that people are going through. Not talking about the economy and these numbers or jobs reports or Bidenomics or it was worse, but how -- people are struggling in the way that they are and making them feel better about it. The other thing here that's going on is that we know that travel was higher around July 4th than any year previously. A lot of people actually are doing better than they feel about it.

And in particular, there are three deputy secretaries at the department of energy, treasury and commerce that she leans on, I'm told, quite heavily.She also has what I'm told is on speed dial, her former economist, a guy named Mike Pyle, who continues to advise her from the outside, who was her economist for a long time before leaving to go to the National Security Council. So, she has a range of people advising her, as well as people from the business community, someone who is a high up executive at Citigroup for a very long time named Ray McGuire. He's a major donor as well. So, she's getting a lot of input from a wide array of voices. But what exactly the common theme of those conversations still is not clear.",
