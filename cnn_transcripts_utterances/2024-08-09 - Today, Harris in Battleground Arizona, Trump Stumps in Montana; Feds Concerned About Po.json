      "sentences": "Good morning, everybody. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz are taking their surging campaign out west with a rally and another crucial swing state, Arizona. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is back with a campaign event in Montana, which is not really a battleground state in the race for the White House. And that rally is happening five days after his last one. Yesterday, he said he hasn't gone to a single swing state this week because he is, quote, leading by a lot. That is not true. In fact, Harris is ahead in many of the most recent polls. The vice president's momentum has Trump changing course and now agreeing to debate her in September after saying for five days that the matchup was, quote, terminated. It's a challenge Harris is welcoming enthusiastically.

I'm looking forward to it and hope he shows up.",

Joining me now, CNN Political Reporter Daniel Strauss and CNN Senior Reporter Isaac Dovere.Isaac, we just learned that the political arm of the League of United Latin American Citizens, known as LULAC, has endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket. It's the group's first presidential endorsement, if we have this right, in its 95-year history. The Latino vote has not gotten a whole lot of press in recent weeks, but it's one of the keys to the election. How big is this for the Harris campaign and how is she hoping to maintain this momentum that she's enjoying right now, because it's certainly swung in her direction? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes. Look, when it comes to the Latino vote, this is an area of voters that has been hotly contested by both Republicans and Democrats, where Trump was making a lot of inroads against Biden and Harris hoping to and the campaign is win Arizona and Nevada herself, as Joe Biden did in 2020. Latino votes key there as it is another place, by the way, in Georgia, too, a lot of Latino voters. But for the Harris campaign, it's trying to figure out how to bring her message across to them. Let's take a look at an ad from the campaign. This week is one of their first ads targeted at Latino voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so they're either going to get on message or they're not.Harris has no policies on her website. She won't take questions. She's renouncing all of her past positions. She's all over the place.

How is it that we're hearing, you know, from Trump in this fashion, do you think? What's going on?

PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORThis is what Signal 30 is. My sister Kathleen got me a job when we were in high school working at Astroworld, which was this, you know, amusement park in Houston, and she was on the grounds crew, and I worked on the rides. And one of the rides was this great roller coaster, Texas Cyclone, and every single day in those hot Houston summers, some kid would get off the Texas Cyclone roller coaster and lose his lunch, and the grounds crew had a code for that on the radio. It was Signal 30. And I watched that. I wanted to call Kathleen and say, Kathleen, Signal 30 at Mar-a-Lago, because it just meant you'd lost it and literally lost your lunch.

She's not running on anything. She's running on, you know, running away from her past positions. But he has to make the case. He had it down against Biden, strength versus weakness. It was simple. Everybody got it. Everybody knew it. In this case, Harris is just running on, I'm not Trump. Trump has to run on something better than that and define her as something worse than that. And that's really where the campaign has to figure it out this week.

I don't want to hold her to a standard of perfection, but I have been so impressed. Her campaign this morning released a new ad that I loved. It is a tough on border security ad, something Democrats have not been talking about. It is a great ad. It shows folks in uniform. It talks about her being a border state prosecutor and prosecuting drug gangs and prosecuting fentanyl. She is taking the fight on Trump's very best issue, border security, right to him with real strength and with a terrific message. So, I actually think she's obviously got a ton of substance.

I actually spent some time with the governor yesterday morning. We had a ribbon- cutting ceremony to kick off the Illinois State Fair. And some of the media asked the governor about his opinion about Sheriff Campbell and should he resign during that ceremony. And the governor repeated what you've just played that people are frustrated and people feel like, as an elected official, that the sheriff should be answering some questions. And I personally believe that's why the governor has requested that the sheriff resign, is because citizens want questions answered. And from my perception as mayor, when I talk to citizens in my community, stakeholders in my community and the Massey-Wilburn family, what people want to know is the hiring process at the county level, how did Sean Grayson get hired and the training process at the county level, what is the training process? And I feel like even though Sheriff Campbell is a friend of mine on a personal level, I feel that that's where the community is frustrated and thinks that they are not getting their answers, it's where was the hiring process, how did this happen, and what was the training process? And as elected officials, sometimes the answers we give aren't our favorite answer because sometimes the honest truth isn't what's best for us as an elected official that we did our best job, but that's what needs to be said, if that's the case.
