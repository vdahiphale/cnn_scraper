And so the campaign looking forward it doesn't really see this verdict changing the calculus of the election entirely. It may have been different if it was an acquittal but of course this is a race that's going to be decided on the margins.

But also making the case that they know that things are not easy for everyone, that not everyone is feeling the growth in the economy and that there's still a lot more to do. But smartly, they are going to use this verdict to lean into the message that they have already had from the moment that President Biden announced his reelection, and that is that Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy.

So the more he leans into it the more somebody might say, oh, it does look like he was involved. So they have to be careful on that. Number two, Hunter Biden is going on trial this week and he's got other trials he's going to face.So it's not like the Biden family is, you know, super clean on criminal trials right now. And number three, I think they also have something of a hypocrisy problem right now. You know, on one day, Joe Biden says, well, it's irresponsible to question the judicial system and to say it's rigged, and it's terrible, and we have to respect the judges and everything. And on the next day he says, the Supreme Court tried to stop me, but I did it anyway, when he's talking about student loans. So I'm confused about which parts of the judicial system we have to respect, because he wants to respect the ones in New York, but not the ones that the Supreme Court.

Great to have you on this Sunday afternoon. I want to start first with the decision that Natasha was talking about in her report, that the U.S. will now allow Ukraine to use American munitions to carry out strikes inside Russia. Help people understand what makes that decision so impactful. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, some American weapons systems, Jessica. Just have to put a caveat on that. Because of the tactical battle in and around Kharkiv, there's a decision now by the president to allow some weapons like the HIMARS shooting short- range artillery up to 50 to 70 kilometers away to strike targets on the other side of the border. What Mr. Zelenskyy has very upset about is he wants more latitude and using ATACMS missiles that have anywhere from 172 to 300-mile range. He wants to strike deeper into targets in Russia. And the president has not allowed that. So there has been the availability of some weapons to go against those Russian forces that are actually lingering on the other side of the Ukrainian border and Belarus and in Russia. And that's a very good thing. There's been many of us who have said that should have happened a long time ago. But there's a concern, you know, the risk involved is that the Kremlin will see anything that strikes deep into Russia and it could possibly miss the target and maybe hit, I mean, I'm going to give an example, hit an apartment building with Russian citizens could be an extreme provocation that the Russian leader could use to say, hey, see, I've been telling you all along this is a U.S. war. They're using proxies to do this. They're giving them their weapons. So that's part of the calculus in all of this. And it's frustrating for the Ukrainians, but truthfully, having been in these kind of meetings, I understand the risk calculation involved.",

Nick Paton Walsh talked about with that tank crew, they were upset because the tank was broken down.I'll remind folks that I said it was not the best tank to give to Ukraine because there are maintenance challenges and you have to have a highly trained crew to address some of the things. But, you know, some of the indicators they talked about like condensation on the instruments, that's BS. The fact that that Russia knows how to hit these tanks, it didn't have enough armor, that's BS. That they couldn't clear wood lines or they would shoot multiple rounds in a building and it wouldn't explode. I know for a fact, having fired these vehicles and having been a tanker all my life, that this is a crude that's not either selecting the right weapon system or isn't maintaining their tanks very well. Now at the same time, I'll say this, Jessica, that whenever you get two disgruntled tankers on a tank that's broken down, they're going to give you every reason why it doesn't work and how this piece of crap is something they shouldn't have.

It is a historic trial for several reasons, but much like Donald Trump's conviction in New York, there could be a significant political impact on top of the legal ramifications for the president's son whatever the outcome of the case ends up being.CNN reporter Marshall Cohen has more. MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Hey Jessica. Hunter Biden will make history tomorrow morning when he walks into a federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, and will become the first ever son of the sitting U.S. president to go on trial. Special Counsel David Weiss, who has investigated Hunter Biden for many years, filed a three-count indictment against the president's son. It all relates to a gun that Hunter Biden bought back in 2018. It is against federal law for a drug user or drug addict to buy a gun. And that is the allegation here. Two charges of lying about his past drug use on a federal gun form and one charge of unlawfully possessing a gun as a drug user or drug addict. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and he is fighting the case. But he's going to have to go up against some pretty powerful evidence. Prosecutors have lined up testimony from three of his ex's, including his ex-wife and including from Hallie Biden, his former romantic partner, who is the widow of his brother, Beau Biden. Prosecutors say that these women can tell the jury about Hunter Biden's drug use and that it happened around the time when he bought that gun. Now, let's be clear here that Hunter Biden has been very public about his lifelong struggle with alcoholism and his very, very serious struggle with crack cocaine addiction. He wrote a memoir about it in 2021 describing the depths and the grip of the addiction, describing this as one of the absolute lowest periods of his life. That is what's going to be scrutinized in this case. Prosecutors, by the way, Jessica, they are going to use some excerpts of that memoir against Hunter Biden to try to convince the jury that, yes, he was using drugs when he bought that gun, and therefore, he should be convicted. So jury selection begins tomorrow. There are 250 Delaware residents that are lined up to be examined to potentially serve on this jury. And once all is said and done, both sides think that this case could last one or two weeks -- Jessica.",
