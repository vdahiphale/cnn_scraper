That's where Hezbollah militants say their retaliatory strikes on Israel in recent hours have been, quote, a complete success.This is what played out in northern Israel after the group said it fired more than 300 rockets from Lebanon. Israel says the group fired 200 rockets. Still, Hezbollah called that the first phase of its retaliation for the recent killing of its top military commander. But earlier, Israel said it hit Hezbollah positions just as they were preparing to launch their strikes. Israel also says its operations are continuing, and it accused the group of endangering Lebanese civilians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now we don't -- even though Hezbollah claims that they were successfully struck those Israeli targets, we have yet to see any sort of confirmation on that. We do know that there has been an intense series of Israeli strikes on Lebanese towns and villages in the south of the country.

No one should gather in a group of larger than 30 people. That people should restrict their travel and essentially be aware of where their shelters are.Certainly, that applies very clearly along the northern part of Israel, closer to the border with Lebanon and in Haifa, that port city close to the border, the shelters there, the air raid shelters, have been opened up for people to take cover should they need to. So, this was always going to be one of the indicators from the Israeli government about how seriously they took the situation and the potential for an escalatory threat by Hezbollah. In the recent weeks, they have been telling people, no, the instruction hasn't changed. The instruction hasn't changed. Well now, the instruction has changed. But it does feel as if, at the moment, we are in a phase where the IDF is assessing what damages they may or may not have had to the targets that Hezbollah claims, and also trying to assess what impact they have caused with their preemptory strikes and whether or not there are other packages of strikes at weapons dumps. That the sort of thing that we've seen the Israeli air force do over the past few days inside of Lebanon to see if there are more sites that they would want to strike inside of Lebanon. We are still hearing the occasional fighter jet in the skies above us, and while Ben Gurion Airport is no longer on a shutdown here in Tel Aviv, we haven't yet seen civilian aircraft flying into the city. It doesn't mean that it won't be happening, but it is all indicative of this sort of raised awareness threat level and an advisory level, I think, is perhaps the best way to put it for the civilians and citizens of Israel at the moment.",

Joining me now from London is Jasmine El-Gamal. She is a Former Middle East Advisor at the U.S. Department of Defense.I want to get your perspective, having been somebody who has worked in the U.S. government, what signals are you hearing from the White House right now as these warring parties' kind of issue threats and shoot at each other? And bring us up to date on what the Biden Administration, the military assets that it has brought to the region, as we're reporting on this escalation in the border conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. JASMINE EL-GAMAL, FORMER MIDDLE EAST ADVISOR, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: Good morning, Ivan. It's good to be with you. So obviously this is something that has been expected for many months. I mean, we've been talking over and over again for months now about the fact that an escalation was imminent. We've been talking about the risks of an escalation, of a miscalculation, the risks of a regional war. And so, in a sense, this was not a surprise. We knew that Israel had assassinated a top military commander of Hezbollah. We knew that Hezbollah was going to retaliate, and today it began that retaliation. And I say the word began, because I think this is the beginning of a series of escalations that we're going to see in the region. Now, Israeli intelligence had gotten word that Hezbollah was going to retaliate. They were saying that there were up to 6000 rockets that were going to be launched towards Israel, and Israel then preemptively struck, so that only about 300 of those rockets, give or take, actually struck Israel. Now, a couple of things to note about that the targets that were targeted were military targets. So, we can say that Hezbollah wasn't targeting -- you know civilian targets in Israel, it was not targeting shopping malls or daycare centers or any of these kinds of worst-case scenarios that the Israelis and that the U.S. had anticipated in their -- in their sort of basket of responses that Hezbollah might respond to. They were military targets, and so the preemptive strike prevented that from happening. Now to your question about the military assets that the U.S. had sent to the region. As we've discussed before on the program, when the U.S. sends military assets to the region Ivan, it is for two reasons. One is to deter a response, or to deter military action from its adversaries. It's to say we -- you know, you don't want to do this, because the second reason is we're going to respond if we need to. You don't send military assets to the region if you're not prepared to use them. And so even though the overall message and the primary message, the primary sort of objective of these military assets is to prevent an escalation. The secondary objective is to be prepared, in the case of an escalation, to actually respond, and that's what we might see now. In case there is additional escalation in the region, in case there is a second or third strike by Hezbollah that the military assets of the United States are there to respond if necessary.",

That's just hours after Hezbollah started what it called the first phase of its retaliation for the killing of its top military commander by Israel last month, just outside Beirut.The militant group fired at least 200 rockets into Israel in recent hours, with Israeli air defenses working to shoot them down. Earlier, Israel said it conducted preemptive strikes on the militants across the border using about hundred fighter jets in the operation. The statement said thousands of Hezbollah's rocket launcher barrels were destroyed. Now, for more analysis on this unfolding situation, I'm joined now by Retired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan, live now from Brisbane. Good to see you again Mick. I want to ask you about what is going on right now and the conflict we have seen across the border between Hezbollah and Israel over the last ten and a half months, versus the full-fledged ground war that was fought in 2006 between these two enemies. That's a conflict that I covered firsthand. How would you compare that last round of intense fighting between these two enemies to what we've seen unfold over the course of the last year? MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.): Well, I think we could say that Hezbollah has been more provocative this time than it was in July 2006 when that previous Israeli operation into Southern Lebanon occurred that was based on the ambush of some Israeli troops. Several were killed. But this time, you've seen thousands of Hezbollah rockets go across the border and cause damage and death and destruction in northern Israel. So, if anything, Hezbollah has been far more provocative and Israel has shown more restraint in going across the border and attacking them.",

      "sentences": "No Ivan, I don't get that sense. In fact, Hezbollah, in its latest announcement, said that it has completed with success its military operations for today, calling it phase one. Now the question is, when, what? How is going to be phase two conducted, if at all?Certainly, there's doesn't seem to be a lot of appetite for a repeat of or something worse, from what we saw in 2006. You know and we're expecting to hear later today from Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of Hezbollah, which will obviously give us a better idea of where this is going? But he's made it clear all along that Hezbollah's firing at Israeli targets was in support of the people of Gaza, that he also made it very clear time and time again that if the war ends in Gaza, Hezbollah will stop firing at Israel, and we saw that in fact, he did make good on that back in November of last year, when there was an eight day pause in the fighting and it was quiet on the border between Israel and Lebanon. Now the problem is, I think what is got many people worried here in Lebanon and elsewhere is that in the past, the United States, through its diplomatic efforts, was able to put an end to wars in Gaza, wars in Lebanon. The war in Lebanon in 2006 lasted 34 days and came to an end. Previous wars in Gaza, the last big one, 2014 was about a month and a half long, but it came to an end. But the United States, for whatever reasons, has failed miserably to stop the fighting, to put pressure on Israel and to put pressure on others, to put pressure on Hamas, to bring the fighting to an end. And the longer this war goes on, the more dangerous it becomes in terms of spreading from just the border area in Lebanon and Gaza to across the region, keeping in mind, of course, that Hezbollah is a member of the so-called Axis of Resistance led by Iran, which includes the Houthis in Yemen, who have very successfully, despite the best efforts of the United States and its allies, to continuously interfere with navigation through the Red Sea. You have the various Shia groups in Syria and Iraq, who have slowed down their targeting of American forces in Syria and Iraq. But the threat is still there. So, the longer this war goes on and the longer the U.S. diplomacy fails to bring it to an end, there's always the danger that, despite today, perhaps Hezbollah is saying they're done for now, that something could go terribly wrong, and it could suddenly ignite into the regional war so many have feared for so long Ivan.",
