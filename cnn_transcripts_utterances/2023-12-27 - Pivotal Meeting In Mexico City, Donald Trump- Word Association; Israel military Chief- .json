President Biden sending two top cabinet officials to Mexico City to meet with the Mexican president. Will a new plan emerge to stop the unprecedented number of illegal border crossings?Plus a new survey shows voters associate Donald Trump with words like revenge and dictatorship. And believe it or not, the GOP frontrunner seems to be bragging about it. And it's time to say goodbye to 2023. We've got a countdown of the biggest political stories of the year. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines in INSIDE POLITICS. And at this hour, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas headed to Mexico meeting with the Mexican president about the crisis along the southern border. The goal, convince him to take action to help stop tens of thousands of migrants before they reach U.S. territory. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez leads us off from the White House today. Priscilla, what does the administration hope to actually get out of this trip from a policy perspective?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, simply put, they want help to drive down the number of border crossings that administration officials have been seeing creep up over the last several weeks. Now, this is not what the President wanted to have to face, heading into the 2024 presidential election because this of course, is not only a logistical challenge for the administration, it's also a political one, as he faces heat from Republicans and Democrats.So the senior U.S. officials going into these meetings with requests from Mexico to try to get more help to drive down these numbers. What those look like according to the officials I've spoken with include, for example, moving migrants who are on the northern border of Mexico, further south. Decongest that area, as well as controlling railways. Those are used by migrants to more quickly get to the U.S. southern border, and also providing incentives like visas for migrants to remain in Mexico and not make the journey north to the U.S. southern border. Now all of this is an extension of a call that took place between President Biden and the Mexican president just last week, where the two agreed that additional enforcement was urgently needed. Now numbers since then have dropped slightly according to a Homeland Security Official I spoke with. The number yesterday of encounters at the U.S. southern border was around 6000. Compare that to earlier this month, when they were over 10,000 encounters on a daily basis. So that's some reprieve for the border towns, but officials are chalking that up in part to the holiday. So they're still bracing for what could happen in the days to come and all of this ratcheting up the pressure on President Biden to do what he can and work with his Mexican counterpart to try to get some relief for these border towns.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ROLANDO SALINAS JR., (D) EAGLE PASS, TEXAS: Our city here in Eagle Pass, we've been getting slammed with 2000 to 3000 people a day.

The populations that are coming, including from places like Venezuela and Cuba, make everything astronomically more difficult.And Jessica, I think that leads into there are negotiations, there are bipartisan negotiations about some type of immigration plan. And it comes as we hear, not just Republicans upset with the administration, but Democratic governors and Democratic mayors upset and frustrated. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO: We've had an uncoordinated approach without significant federal support. This is not sustainable. MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: The federal government said to New York City, we're not going to do our job, you do our job. You take care of 4000 people a week, Eric, you and your team.

      "sentences": "Certainly. I mean I think what's complicated the matter, obviously, is that this has been now connected. Border security has become an issue that is connected now to all different types of foreign policy issues, including Ukraine, including Israel.You know, I interviewed Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries last week and what he was telling me is that, you know, at least from his perspective, he's not interested in a deal that only capitulates to these kind of short term, right wing solutions to immigration. He was really looking for a deal that's more long term. And I will say Democrats do kind of always say that, everyone says that on immigration. And so it's -- you know, we'll have to wait and see if there's actually going to be any kind of deal that addresses this issue in a long term way that feels good to everyone that actually addresses the humanitarian crisis as well. MATTINGLY: Yeah, it's a really interesting point, it's a fascinating moment in this now decades-long debate where nothing ever seems to get done. Kristen, from a political perspective, I think a lot of people have probably gotten used to talking about this as a Republican base issue or a Republican issue that doesn't necessarily move into the top two or three categories. In a general election that seems to be shifting. If you look at the numbers, President Biden's numbers right now, on immigration, 26 percent approved, 69 percent disapprove and I think perhaps more interestingly, and underscoring the fact that Hispanic voters are not a monolith. They are not a single issue voting bloc, but Biden at 47 percent in The New York Times Siena poll of the likely electorate most recently, Trump at 35 percent. Yes, that's a lead, but it's significantly less than the exits from 2020. What does this all say for the Trump campaign and what they're doing right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, you played those clips of Democratic mayors. They really played just like a Republican ad during a general, really pointing to the fact that this isn't now just a Republican focus point but it's also a Democratic focus point. You can be sure that no matter who the Republican nominee is, particularly if it's Donald Trump, there's going to be a huge focus on immigration.You talk about it being one of the top issues. Well, other than the economy and abortion for Democrats, immigration is a leading issue for so many people across the country. And again, you are seeing this uptick in rhetoric from Democrats as well, which is increasing the pressure but it's also giving Republicans and particularly in a 2024 presidential election year, a lot of ammunition to make this a top issue, to bring it to the forefront, as they have been trying to do for several years.",

But I think certainly, Donald Trump is a wildcard factor in these negotiations. Trump obviously, is someone with a lot of very incredibly hardline immigration views.So I think that's certainly an overtone of the entire conversation. I think also the way that Trump plays into this to a certain extent is Trump has always been for progressives and Democrats, the Immigration Boogeyman. And so I think there's another political concern for Biden, if he seems to go more to the right, does he not seem like an important alternative to Trump? So I think, for the Biden Administration, they've got to think about this politically, both from appeasing you know these Democratic governors you heard from but also not alienating the progressive base that really cares about this issue, and was really animated about it during the Trump Administration.",

Thanks very much to our panel.Now to another big story this morning, the Michigan Supreme Court rejecting an attempt to ban Donald Trump from the state's ballot based on the 14th amendments, Insurrectionist ban. That decision of course, coming just days after Colorado's highest court came to the exact opposite conclusion. CNN's Paula Reid joins me now from Washington. And Paula, look, this is just -- it has to be the Supreme Court's ballgame now, is that fair?",

      "sentences": "That's completely fair. And just another example of how the U.S. Supreme Court could be such an influencing factor in the 2024 election. Now the question here is ballot eligibility. And this is something that has been litigated across multiple states with varying outcomes. And here, the question is whether former President Trump can be kept off a state ballot because of the U.S. Constitution's 14th amendment, which says that officials who engage in an insurrection are barred from holding future office.Now this was something that was designed to keep former confederates out of -- out of office. It's been used twice in the past 100 years. But also note that this provision does not specifically state the presidency. The President is among those who would be barred from holding future office. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court, as you noted, it surprised a lot of people last week when they ruled that Trump can be kept off the ballot in that state. That was surprising, because lower courts in that state had held that while they do believe he engaged in in Insurrection, they held a trial, that was their finding. They said that because this provision of the Constitution didn't specifically state the president among the list of people who should be barred from holding future office, if they engaged in in insurrection, they couldn't keep them off the ballot. So when the State Supreme Court went the other way, that surprised a lot of people. And it is expected that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up this issue. Now we see here in Michigan, they went the other way, even though it was more of a procedural decision. They didn't have a trial. But while Trump is praising this, and not surprisingly, praising this decision in Michigan, and Michigan and Minnesota, they left the door open even though they said look, he can't be banned here for the primary. They left the door open in when it comes to the general election. So Phil, unless the Supreme Court weighs in and gives us some clarity about exactly what the 14th Amendment says, it's possible that this whole issue could come back up again for the general election if he's the nominee.",

Four points, essentially. First of all, the endgame of the current phase of the war to move from this intensive bombing campaign, which has led to according to the Hamas- run Health Ministry, more than 20,000 Palestinians being killed, most of them they say women and children, they don't distinguish between combatants and non- combatants.

There's no sign of that happening just yet.The U.S. seems to be more open to having the Palestinian Authority as is which of course administers parts of the West Bank taking control post Gaza, but Mahmood Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, has himself said that he would only do so if there was a clear pathway towards a two-state solution, which seems a very long way off and for now, that last point.

You're looking at it right now which Trump proudly shared on his social media platform.The biggest words revenge, dictatorship and power. Many of Trump's voters don't seem to think -- see those as bad things. Now, according to the latest Des Moines Register poll, 43 percent of likely Iowa caucus goers said statements like Trump having \"no choice\" but to lock up his political opponents didn't actually matter. 36 percent said Trump saying the 2020 election justifies terminating parts of the Constitution doesn't impact their decision of whether to support him.
