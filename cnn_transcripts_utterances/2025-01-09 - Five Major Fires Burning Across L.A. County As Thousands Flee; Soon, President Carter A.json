      "sentences": "And today should definitely be a day where they can make some progress, Brianna. Because I want to start with zero percent containment. That's the active fire fight.But where we're seeing the human loss and the amount of dollars that this will rack up to is in communities like this one. This is Altadena. This is a working-class community, but it is still very much a community in danger. And I want to explain that right now, because what you're looking at over here is a home that we were just trying to drive around, talk to people, and this home was on fire. An ember somehow sparked this. That's a belief from the firefighters here. You can see they are mopping up now. They are now just having to watch this burn. But these homes are still catching on fire here because it is still very much an active firefight, even though it looks like fire has swept through these communities. And this is, indeed, a community. These are single family homes you're looking at. Each one of these contained families. Altadena is not -- at least in the section that I'm in, it is not a rich community, predominantly three-bedroom, two- bath homes. Some of the people you were talking about, you know, the people who we're lost, there are going to be some grim discoveries because this is a mix of families and also retirees. I know of several disabled people who live here. They're confined to their wheelchairs. So there are going to be people who just simply could not have gotten out. But all of Alta -- there are whole sections of this community that it's really just unspeakable. It's hard to measure what you're looking at in terms of, not just dollars, but each life. I know teachers who live here and people who have kids. So each one of these homes was filled with those lives. But they're still dealing with this emergency. This is a 10,600 acre fire. Again, five people who have been killed. What you're seeing over here, these firefighters, there are firefighters far away from Nevada and Arizona who are now coming in. Firefighters outside of the immediate Los Angeles area because it is exhausting, difficult and dangerous work. And the more and the number of hours that these Los Angeles firefighters work, the harder it gets to stay alive. So that's -- there are a number of threats that this city and this community has to deal with as this immediate danger continues to take place. And, Brianna, again, a reminder we're beyond the -- the Whack a Mole, new firefight, new firefight, new firefight, new wildfire issue that we've seen in this last 24 hours. What's happening now is, try to assess, try to contain. But this is still very much, in Los Angeles County, a gigantic emergency -- Brianna?",

A lot of the hotel rooms, at least the affordable ones, they are all gone.People have gone into the desert, halfway to Las Vegas to try to find a place to stay, just to try to assess. And they're starting to drive back and figure out, are there Airbnbs they can rent? Where do they have family that they can go to? Most of the people I know have gone to Orange County. They've gone to San Diego, driven to family up in the north area. And they are just trying to figure out, what does my insurance look like? Do I have another car to come back to? Is my child's school open? How do I educate my child? How do I get care for my elderly parent? These are sort of the big, real problems that a lot of these families are now going to have to try to figure out what to do. And just, you know, cost. Like the -- a lady I talked to, she moved here 25 years ago. Houses in Altadena -- like, OK, so this house here, I can tell you because I -- (TECHNICAL PROBLEM) -- a million and a half dollars. It was purchased very likely for a fraction of that. So what do they do now? What's their coverage look like? And what will their House look like? Can they even afford to rebuild?",

His niece has since taken over teaching those Sunday School lessons. But his imprint can still feel -- be felt so heavily here in this community, in this church. President Carter notably resisted the Southern Baptist Convention, broke with them decades ago over this issue of women serving as pastors in the church. This church now has its first female pastor. Prior to that, it had its first black pastor in Tony Loden. And he will be offering the eulogy this afternoon. We've already seen busloads of family members and friends arrive here at the church. A different character and color for this private service. We saw a lot of dignitaries at the service in Washington but these are going to be people here remembering him who really knew him on a personal level.

And she talked about the Carters coming over to her home, having dinner. At one point, the late president seeing a broken chair, picking it up, bringing it to his home, fixing it, and bringing it back the next day. Or how they could have easily spent thousands of dollars remodeling their kitchen. But their kitchen still looks like it did decades ago.

But what we're seeing here is a large portion of these - (TECHNICAL PROBLEM. What we're telling consumers are, make sure that they get a complete copy of their insurance policy, that they take note of their additional living expenses, and that they track and get receipts for everything. We want to make sure that -- this also simplifies the claims process. And document every conversation they're having with their agent or with their adjusters. And again, not to rush into these decisions. Unfortunately, as you've been reporting, this is a time when fraud becomes prevalent. Out-of-state adjusters come into communities making false promises. And so we want to make sure that consumers know that they can call our department at 1-800-927-4357, so we can walk them through the process. But most importantly, let's make sure they're safe. They have a place to evacuate. And for those that may not have evacuated or are in in the perimeter, we're asking them to start taking pictures of their valuables, of any improvements they've made, of just of their home so we can have that documentation that helps them through the claim process, move, move -- help them move quicker through the claims process. But we're in constant communication with -- with the industry and with advocacy groups to make sure that they have these tips on hand. We don't want people signing any documents under duress. And so we're asking them to take their time, call us, and we'll walk them through the entire process.",

So, yes, they insure people, but they're also insuring themselves, right, against covering those folks, kind of spreading the risk around. Independent watchdogs have said -- and you're well aware of this -- they've said this is going to just jack up prices on homeowners, but it's not necessarily going to expand the ability to get coverage.

That is the agreement.And we have, at the department, the statutory authority to go after them if they don't do -- if they don't do as they promised. And we can remove the tools and actually reassess the rates if they don't go forward, and if they go back on their word. So -- (CROSSTALK)",

That depends on, you know, we can't -- depends on the actual company and the amount that they have. So I can't give you blanket statements around that. But we have the authority to do that, which is unprecedented. Other state's allow for just a pass-through of reinsurance with no guarantees. This is why our reforms, we feel, are going to work. We're going to start seeing insurance companies coming back into California around hopefully the end of this year. And so again, this is, of course, independent of the tragedy that we're living in. So right now, my immediate goal is to make sure that we get the claims paid, the claims paid as quick as possible, and that we get people on the road to recovery as quickly as we can.",
