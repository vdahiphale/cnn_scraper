Earlier he had met with the leader of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah in the West Bank. Mahmoud Abbas urged the U.S. to do more to stop what he called Israel's aggression against Palestinians, not just in Gaza but also the West Bank, as well as Jerusalem. They discussed Gaza's urgent need for increased humanitarian assistance. And the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has once again stressed the current level of a crossing into Gaza is dwarfed by the incredible magnitude of need. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT MARDINI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THR RED CROSS: There are two parties in this conflict with Israel and Hamas and they are bound by those obligations. Civilians are in harm's way. They are caught in the line of fire day in and day out. This conflict is a nightmare. It has been a nightmare for the families of hostages for now, more than three months. It's been a nightmare day in, day out for Palestinians being killed, being injured, the lacking food medicines, medical supplies, access to water, shelter and the freezing cold. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Another Israeli airstrike, this time hitting a market less than 200 feet from the largest hospital in central Gaza. Here even the injured must dig themselves out of the rubble. Piece by piece, bloodied and covered in dust they emerge from their brush with death. Doctors say at least 70 people were injured. Some carry to the hospital amid tense for the thousands of displaced Palestinians who have sought shelter here. At least six were killed including two men working at this falafel stand. DR. MOHAMMAD RAYYAN, AL-AQSA MARTYRS HOSPITAL (through translator): The street was full of people and many of the injured had arrived to the hospital. There were many, many injured and marches on the floor. DIAMOND (voice-over): Hours later first responders turn casualties of war. Four members of an ambulance crew dead after the Palestine Red Crescent Society says the Israeli military targeted their ambulance. Two patients were also killed. The Israeli military did not respond to CNN's requests for comments. 121 ambulances have been struck during the war, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Inside the hospital, Fuad Omani (ph), a paramedic could do nothing to save Fadi (ph), the son who followed in his footsteps can only say goodbye.

And that's as that shipping transit through the Suez Canal in Egypt.And yet, it's been weeks out since major shipping companies started using safer, but much longer and more costly routes.

It's because they've actually got to use to abstain some of those pricing from the past from COVID. They've been resilient. Also, if you pass the prices right away, John, it will cause a ripple effect through all the wholesalers and to the consumers. So obviously, they're in the middle personal supply chain, they're eating some costs hoping that it can maintain stability, otherwise, you get people of buying less of it. And that's even worse, John, there's even less, you know, more instability into it. So if you're going to ask me, when are you going to start seeing prices? It's probably, you know, I can't guess, but you know, the longer this goes over the next couple of weeks, you're going to start to see. We're already have before going this, we already have supply chain issues in general, especially in the U.S. when you think about produce. I know you and I talked with lineup of tomatoes and cucumbers and the prices that are not there available. So to me, I think the supply chain has been resilient.

I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it's taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you're dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war. And so when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right president at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I appreciated what President Trump did. But let's just be honest, he said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable. And he let her off the hook.

Well, Donald Trump wasn't on the stage with DeSantis and Haley. They did do this rapid response, and he sent out notices to whether it's the media or people that speak on this topic. He attacked Haley and DeSantis, on immigration, on China on taxes on a litany of issues.

The (INAUDIBLE) in itself is not significant. Navalny has long claimed of course, that his imprisonment is politically motivated. So these separate courts cases under conditions of his detention are really more about keeping his cause in the headlines. He will likely appear again at a separate scheduled hearing on Thursday.

      "sentences": "Donald Trump is going to be going to the courthouse on Thursday in New York for the final day of his civil fraud trial. So that's where the New York attorney general has accused him and his businesses of defrauding the state by their business practices, by over inflating their worth as they were getting bank loans.And in this final day, it is the closing arguments. Trump wanted to speak, but the judge said he is not going to be able to because he was not willing to comply with the rules of the court, the rules that the judge was trying to get him, or get at least an answer out of his attorneys on on Wednesday, it just didn't happen. So what will happen in these closing arguments is the New York attorney general is going to be telling the judge that they are seeking $370 million for the \"ill-gotten gains\", those are their words, from Donald Trump and his business empire. And also that Trump should be barred from doing business in the state of New York. Trump's side will probably very likely do much of what they did in their previous parts of this trial, and that has included attacking the judge and saying that this is unfair and this is not something that they agree with these findings. But the judge has already found that Trump and his business empire, they are liable. He's just assessing the consequences at this point, and will make that determination, announce it at a later date. But what happened in the final hours before these closing arguments, that was a bid of drama that Trump is now pointing to the judge at creating. But it was a situation where his lawyers very, very abnormally told the judge that Trump himself wanted to address the court in its closing arguments. That is not typical at all. The judge said, ok, fine, but you are going to have to follow the rules of the court. You're not going to be able to introduce more evidence, speak about things that are irrelevant to this case, or give a campaign speech, and gave them a deadline to confirm that Trump would do this and would comply with the court's rules and determinations. As of Wednesday at noon -- and Trump's team never responded. So the judge was quite clear Donald Trump will not be speaking in court on Thursday. That does not mean though he won't take the opportunity to speak to cameras as he heads into and out of that courthouse. Katelyn Polantz, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
