Campaigning in New Hampshire, the former president called the case ridiculous and an attempt to take away his right to free speech. But the U.S. District Judge overseeing the case may have different ideas.CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid, begins our coverage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SR. LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Judge Tanya Chutkin has scheduled a hearing for Friday at 10 a.m. to hear arguments from both attorneys for former President Trump and the special counsel about possible rules for exactly how evidence, especially sensitive evidence, will be handled in this case. The special counsel has been lobbying for a broad protective order to limit the ability the former president has to share sensitive information that is turned over in this case. But Trump's lawyers have argued for something more narrow, something that only covers the most sensitive information. They argued that that would be more in line with the protective orders in other January 6 cases. Now the Trump lawyers also ask that this hearing be scheduled next week as they have another hearing in the other special counsel investigation down in Florida on Thursday. But Judge Chutkin, she appears, based on her scheduling orders so far, to be keen to move this along as quickly as possible. So she has scheduled this for hearing on Friday. Both sides will have the opportunity to present arguments and this will be their first time appearing before the judge will continue to oversee this case until what is expected to be a trial. Now, former President Trump is not expected to be at Friday's hearing. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Some are for DeSantis, some are for Tim Scott, some are for the other candidates that are in the race.

Those Russian defenses that were able to be built because Ukraine had to wait through the spring and into the early summer before beginning its counter-offensive, waiting for that sort of critical mass of western weapons where it felt comfortable enough to start. That is why those Russian defenses were able to be built up. As for Russia, well it is trying to advance up in the north in the Kharkiv region, regaining territory that it lost some 11 months ago.

Her death sparked massive nationwide protests. Now many months later, women are still defying the veiling laws, even as Iran doubles down on punishments.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Iran's brave women are fighting for their freedom with everyday acts of defiance like this. Out on the streets without the mandatory hijab. This recent video appeared to show a woman harassed and called a criminal for refusing to cover up. The days of being afraid of you are over, she says. Nearly a year after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in the custody of the so-called morality police. The uprising sparked by her death may have been crushed by a bloody crackdown, but not the will of those standing up for their most basic of rights. Countless women have been defying the clerical establishment, choosing not to wear the compulsory hijab. And now the regime is lashing out with a campaign of renewed repression, announcing the return of morality police patrols. UNKNOWN (through translator): Being a woman in Iran is now harder than ever. Because of all the attention, our privacy and safety is a wish. You should always be worried and careful about police. KARADSHEH (voice over): This young woman we're not identifying for her safety spoke to us from inside Iran. UNKNOWN (through translator): The morality police are mostly in metro stations and sometimes on the streets. They warn you if you disobey they take video or photos. And normal people who are still on the government side work like paparazzi. KARADSHEH (voice over): And that's not all. Authorities are considering a draconian new bill that would make failure to abide by the strict Islamic dress code a more severe offense with unprecedentedly harsh penalties including 5 to 10-year jail sentences and fines of more than $8,000. This may be just a warning to intimidate those who dare to dissent, but an intensified crackdown has been well underway. This chilling video released by a group affiliated with the security apparatus captures some of their terrifying tactics. Facial recognition technology purportedly being used to identify and threaten unveiled women. Cameras are everywhere. Thousands that have their cars confiscated according to Amnesty International, and women without a veil are being denied access to education and public services. Perhaps even more disturbing is courts have been imposing degrading punishments on women, including counseling sessions for quote, \"anti- social behavior, cleaning government buildings and washing corpses in morgues.\" UNKNOWN (through translator): I couldn't believe the mortuary punishment until I saw some judgment papers with my own eyes, which was washing corpses for a month. KARADSHEH (on=camera): Are you and other women around you scared when you're out in public? UNKNOWN (though translator): The first days were scary, but with time, the courage inside everyone grows, and now no one is scared. People were just waiting for a spark, and that happened last year. We keep going for the kids who were murdered during the protests. KARADSHEH (voice over): Many like her say this is not just about the hijab. This is about standing up to tyranny, and they're not backing down. UNKNOWN (through translator): Most people believe in freedom now because they've tasted it. We know about the punishments, but we know everything has a cost. And if this is the cost of freedom, we're ready to pay for that. I'm sure we will see Iran breathing again one day.

Even though Smotrich says that it is, it's still possible that it could be overturned at a government level or even be taken to court. But what he wrote on Facebook yesterday is two main things.First of all, there was a program, there's a five-year program that's been in place for East Jerusalemites. And a part of that program is designed to help them to enable students to improve or learn or boost their Hebrew so that they can go on to study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. So that program as a whole, that five-year program as a whole is worth hundreds of millions of shekels and that part of the program is what Smodrich has suspended. The other thing, or is frozen, the other thing is what I suppose can best be understood as a kind of leveling up policy that Israeli governments have in order to close the gap between poorer municipalities and wealthier ones. Now, after all the calculations were done, it was decided that Arab municipalities still had quite a bit of a shortfall so there was more money allocated to them to the tune of around 200 million shekels a year, just over $50 million a year. Now that is also what Smotrich is suspending as well. So there's those two things and why he's doing that well he says there are three reasons first of all he says that it's not fair that this money was going to Arab municipalities not going to poorer Jewish ones he says that really it was only designed or put in place in order to placate Mansour Abbas who is the leader of the Islamist Ra'am Party and who was part of the previous government. And the third reason, as you mentioned in your introduction, is that he says that this money could wind up in the hands of criminal or terrorist organizations. Of course, when it comes to his political base, it probably doesn't do him any harm anyway. As far as the response, Mansour Abbas said that the real reason that Smotrich is doing this is that he's a racist minister who is aiming to take us back to point zero. This is something that Smotrich has rejected. As I say, this is not yet a done deal, but it's certainly causing controversy. And even there are fellow ministers in the government who have come out and said that this is not a wise plan, because ultimately, even just from a purely financial perspective, it's going to end up costing the Israeli government even more.
