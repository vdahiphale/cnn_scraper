      "sentences": "Thank you for joining us. I'm Jim Sciutto, live from Tel Aviv. We begin with breaking news this morning. A claim just in the last hour by Israel that it has killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike in southern Beirut.Yesterday, Israel says Nasrallah was killed but Hezbollah has not yet commented. An Israeli official told CNN earlier that Nasrallah was the target of the attack. And I was told in the last 24 hours that they had very high confidence Nasrallah was on the site when the attack took place. This comes on the heels of Israel's largest strikes on Beirut in nearly 20 years. Lebanon's news agency says Israel also launched more strikes in southern Lebanon as well as the eastern part of the country this morning. Hezbollah says it fired more rockets into northern Israel in response. We are also hearing that some hospitals in the southern part of Beirut, an area targeted by Israel yesterday, will now be evacuated. I'm joined now by CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut. And Ben, we've been speaking numerous times in the last 12-24 hours or so. I wonder what the state of affairs is in Beirut right now. I have to imagine there's a great deal of fear as airstrikes continue. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, there is. All you have to do is look at the skyline behind me and see just all the areas where smoke is rising from the southern suburbs were pummeled last night and multiple airstrikes by the Israelis. And of course, because of the warnings, Israel sent out and also simply because of the bombing, thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people streamed out of southern Beirut and are essentially sleeping rough on the streets, wherever they could. We saw, for instance, on local WhatsApp groups that people are desperately looking for somewhere to stay. And other places are offering places to stay, churches, mosques schools, even a football stadium have been opened for those seeking shelter. But there doesn't seem to be any indication how long this is going to go on. Basically people saw these Twitter announcements put out by the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military and left as quickly as they could. But keep in mind that the southern part of Beirut and particularly some of the neighborhoods like Bourj el-Barajneh are densely populated by people who don't necessarily have the means to get out quickly. We're talking about Palestinian refugees, Syrian migrant workers, workers from South Asia and Africa. Who don't have cars for instance, who, if they're lucky, have a motorcycle. So definitely this city has, in the last 24 hours, been severely jolted by events. Jim.",

The IDF has had since 2006, the last major offensive in Lebanon, to consider how it does it and how it does it differently and it is doing it differently.Last time there were big strikes in Beirut; this time, it has been targeted to disrupt the command and control. We saw that with the walkie-talkies, we saw that with the pagers, then the leadership, the leadership responsible for the southern border, the most threatening area to Israel. And then the other parts of the leadership, the ones in control of the UAVs, the ones in control of the long range rockets systematically taken down and then the leadership. And in fact, we just heard from the IDF what they called this operation to kill Hassan, Hassan Nasrallah. And I think it gives you an idea of what they think that this achieves. And they call it Operation New Order. They believe that they are inflicting a new order on Hezbollah and perhaps beyond. But to give a sense, the audience here a sense of what does 20 years of planning look like, it means 20 years of experts studying satellite imagery, studying drone imagery, developing sources, developing spies inside of Hezbollah. And all of that feeds into building a target list. And then the question becomes, how do you work through that target list? And that's what we're witnessing.",

And oftentimes there is intelligence sharing. Although the U.S. has made quite clear they were not involved in this particular strike. Should we presume that Israel has intelligence penetration of the group itself via human sources, given the accuracy of these strikes recently and even just the knowledge that Nasrallah was where he was, according to Israel, when they struck last night?",

We should assume that they have those -- developed those spies and either that's people that are disaffected with Hezbollah who want to bring it down, who can work their way into significant or useful positions inside or those that are just willing to work for money.Then there's the electronic eavesdropping as well. You think of the prevalence these days of all the CCTV cameras around that tie into -- tie into wi-fi networks. All of these things provide an opportunity for Israel to develop this level knowledge. And I compare it in many ways with what the British did in Northern Ireland. They brought the IRA to its knees, that organization was fighting for unity. They brought it to its knees and peace by infiltrating it to such a level that even the operatives these days joke about that when they got arrested, how many of them that were arrested were actually -- were actually effectively spies. So that level of intelligence is part of what Israel has had a time to develop. I think it's worth just taking a step here and saying, OK, why didn't they do that in Gaza? Why couldn't they have had this level of intelligence in Gaza? Lebanon and Gaza are two entirely different things. Gaza is very sealed and it's very hard to penetrate. Lebanon is a much more mixed open environment and then therefore, you can insert spies, you can generate that information. And that was what was lacking. That's why the IDF did not properly see what was coming in October the 7th from Hamas.",

And therefore, we cannot allow a situation, where all of these people can press a red button, fire a missile from a living room and target my family or my neighbor's family within seconds. And so therefore it may be necessary. We will take whatever directive the political leadership gives us. What I can tell you is, under no circumstances, is Israel going to stop eliminating and fighting Hezbollah until all of the residents of northern Israel can go back to their homes, whatever it takes.

There was another strike that took place two hours after this in critical infrastructure that was aimed at Israeli critical infrastructure that could have wreaked enormous havoc in Israel. And we gave warning to the civilians in that area to move hours andhours in advance, keeping in mind that, when those civilians move out of the way, those terrorists flee as well. When from an operational perspective, we can give notification to civilians, we do everything we can. But when you have pinpointed leadership and you need the element of surprise, obviously, we take that into account. But even there, as you can see in the actions of the previous weeks -- and we'll be releasing more information about what happened this morning -- we have been using whatever sources we have to try to do this when there are minimal civilian casualties. I'll just put this in perspective, that every rocket that Hezbollah is firing against Israel is in gat (ph) civilians. And so therefore, there really is an unfair playing field here. But at the end of the day, we have no choice. This will protect Israeli civilians. And long-term, Jim, this is going to be protecting Lebanese civilians, who are also under this terrorist regime, which is called Hezbollah, and has been led by Nasrallah for over 30 years.",

I wonder, does Israel have any interest in ceasefire negotiations?

There's no doubt. However I will say this. Unless you live with Hezbollah on your border and you have Hezbollah attacking you, I don't think you can imagine what it is like to have this type of enemy actively hitting and targeting your population and people fleeing from their homes. I know in the U.S. right now there's a power outage that has left millions of people without power. And that is a horrible thing. The northern part of our country, these people don't have power. It's not that they've lost power. They've lost their entire homes. And so therefore, any type of ceasefire from a military perspective that would not allow our people to go back to their homes and our country not to be under a constant barrage, including the interception that happened over our head, is -- it's untenable. And I don't think anyone in the world would even consider this. That's the position of the Israeli army and our political leadership has also reflected the will of the people, which is our people just want to go home. We want peace in our country. We didn't start this war but it has to end. And the terms have to be that Israel can live in peace throughout all of its borders.",

Or at least attempted assassination of Hassan Nasrallah. So for Lebanon and Israel, this is a whole new ballgame, a whole new era. But also for the region because Nasrallah was not only just a leader in Lebanon, obviously, his influence far -- went far beyond Lebanon. Hezbollah became Iran's primary asset outside of its border on the Mediterranean, on Israel's northern front but also its trainer for proxies in Syria fighting that war on behalf of Bashar al Assad and pretty much salvaging the regime there after the uprising in 2011 in Iraq with the militias there, with the Houthis in Yemen. So this is an assassination that is, that far, that exceeds Lebanon's border in terms of the likely implication. And if early reports are in fact true, that senior Iranian general (INAUDIBLE) at that bumper (ph) as well as headquarters and have also been killed along with Hassan Nasrallah, then we definitely have to anticipate some kind of an Iranian response or involvement in the coming reaction.",

On one hand, it wants to establish or, at this point, reestablish deterrence against Israel, given the fact that Israel has held escalation dominance all throughout.Israel has been more willing to escalate this conflict and go and cross beyond that total war threshold than Iran and Hezbollah for various reasons, including Iran's historic reference for taking the fight to Israel using proxies, all these proxies. That ring of fire, that it's established around Israel through Hezbollah being its crown jewel in Lebanon but also the Houthis in Yemen, the militias in Iraq and Syria, knowing very well that, in a direct confrontation with Israel, Israel is much more militarily superior and sophisticated to Iran. So I expect that, as the Iranian leadership contemplates this need to reestablish deterrence versus avoid an all-out direct confrontation with Israel, that there will probably be a preference for bringing in the range of Iranian proxies in the region. So attack and the responses from Syria or Iraq, Yemen but also from Lebanon. And if Hamas, I mean, Hamas is also part of that Iranian axis, has any ability to also punch, then we can also expect that to be part of this regional reaction to the assassination.",

And pretexts that come down from the tree, so to speak, because Hassan Nasrallah and Iran had very much sort of premised a ceasefire in Lebanon on the ability to get a ceasefire in Gaza. Though the administration officials were hoping that, at the U.N. speech, Benjamin Netanyahu would say something to the effect that all major operations in Gaza have been completed and maybe even declare victory, which would then allow movement toward a ceasefire in Lebanon, this 21 day reprieve.

The question is, are they going to now go in, in a ground invasion, to try to neutralize the organization militarily? As you know, Hezbollah has tens of thousands of fighters in Lebanon. They have a large military arsenal that is still intact. And so is Israel going to see this as just a prelude to a ground invasion to really finish the organization off once and for all? Or is it going to back down and say this is enough for now? And, of course, on the other end, in the short term, there's the reaction from Hezbollah and from Iran as well.

One could reasonably read this strike as the Israeli prime minister's answer to U.S. efforts to get the sides to a ceasefire.Do you see election timing as part of this, that the Israeli prime minister identifies a window here before the U.S. election, in which you have, in effect, a lame duck U.S. president and you have one of two outcomes, either a Harris victory that he might perceive restricts his options going forward, or a Trump victory? That Netanyahu might perceive gives him, would give him further carte blanche to do what he wants to do. Is Netanyahu playing the U.S. political situation right now to some degree? EL-GAMAL:  Well, I mean, Netanyahu has always played the U.S. political system and he's bragged about it openly. It's no secret that he says, that he says himself, he knows how to manipulate the Americans, that the Americans are easily manipulated. But I think more to the point, Jim, is that the -- Netanyahu basically has seen that there will be no consequences to his actions from the Biden administration. The Biden administration has been saying for months that they're very angry at Netanyahu, very frustrated with Netanyahu. But they don't really do anything about it. They sent the U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, to the region to try to get to a ceasefire. He's ignored. It's almost embarrassing really for the Americans. And so if you were in Netanyahu's shoes, you would do the same exact thing. You would see that you have carte blanche to do whatever you want in the region, that there are no real consequences from the Americans. They seem completely impotent diplomatically, while at the same time enabling the war by continuing to fund and arm Israel. So Netanyahu is doing what anyone would do in his position, which is to keep driving forward. Now the damage that that's doing, as we've said before, both in Lebanon and in Gaza, is immense. And whether a new administration, whether it's Trump or Kamala Harris, will able to roll back some of that damage and salvage any semblance of peace in the region remains to be seen. Because if you -- I mean, as we know, the U.S. president, no matter who wins in November, doesn't take office until January. So we effectively have until there -- until the end of the year. We have a Biden administration. And if we look at what it's been doing so far and what it's not been doing so far, I don't see any reason to believe that, all of a sudden, they're going to step in and stop Netanyahu in his tracks. One hopes that they will. But we haven't seen any indication that they're willing to do so. Maybe after the election. But I'm not sure.",

Israel says he was killed in yesterday's Israeli strike in Beirut. Hezbollah has not yet commented.An Israeli official told CNN earlier Nasrallah was the target. And I was told by a former senior Israeli official that they had high confidence Nasrallah was at the site at the time of the strike. This comes on the heels of Israel's worst, most massive strikes on Beirut in nearly 20 years. The Lebanese news agency says Israel has launched more strikes in the south and east of the country this morning. Hezbollah says it has fired more rockets into northern Israel. We are also hearing that some hospitals in the southern part of Beirut, an area which Israel targeted yesterday, will be evacuated. For more on the effects of this strike, what comes next, we're joined now by Fawaz Gerges. He's professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. Fawaz, thanks so much for joining us. FAWAZ GERGES, DIR. MIDDLE EAST CENTER, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS: Thanks.",

It seems to me that Israel has infiltrated the decision-making process of Hezbollah.It has inflicted major, major kills against Hezbollah leaders in a way, I would say, based on what we know, is that Hezbollah now is off balance. It's rattled. I wonder whether its command and control is still functioning. The reason why we have not really seen major strategic retaliation on the part of Hezbollah, because they're trying to put their house in order. They're trying to really find ways and means to basically put their command and control and basically management, better management. But the situation, as you know, Israel is going for the kill. Look, I think we need to connect the dots, Jim, here. This is not about killing Hassan Nasrallah and we have not heard from Hezbollah yet. This is not about assassinating individual commanders. I think the big picture is the prime minister, Israel prime minister, has declared all-out war not only against Hezbollah but against the entire axis of resistance and in particular against Iraq. Yesterday in his speech at the United Nations, he basically threatened Iran by saying there is no target in Iran that we cannot reach. So beyond, even if Hezbollah has been killed, as Israel how does, this is really a new situation. It's all-out war now, not just between Hezbollah and Israel but between Israel and the entire axis of resistance.",

Iran has repeatedly made it very clear.It does not really want all-out war either with Israel and the United States. And Iran, the Iranian leaders are very anxious that Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to drag them into all-out war with the United States. But again, I think we're missing the big picture and forgive me for saying so. This is not just about what Iran can do now. If my reading is correct, this is a long war. This is all-out war. We're talking about years, not days or weeks. So both Iran and Hezbollah and the entire axis of resistance now, they are biding their time. They are trying to position themselves for the long game. And look, I mean, again, Jim, I keep saying, look, if Israel's strategic aim, to return its displaced citizens to the north, the Lebanese-Israel borders, a long war will never basically bring this about. In fact, the Americans and the British and the French have basically pressed on Israel the need for a diplomatic solution because they realize a long war, in a long war, Israel can never have peace and security. This is -- it will -- changes the geostrategic land escape for Israel for years to come. And if and when Israel decides to launch a ground attack, this will really drag Israel and entrap Israel in a very bleeding war as Israel has discovered in Gaza in the past 12 months.",

My reading and a consensus is emerging in Iran.And the scholars that know Iran, that this, the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah and Israel's basically arrogance and Israel's decision to really kill with impunity, will and has motivated Iranian leadership to basically weaponize their nuclear program. What's happening now, this all-out war in the Middle East itself, will reinforce Iranians' perception that the only way for Iran to have deterrence is basically to have a nuclear defense (ph) because Israel has between 100 and 200 nuclear devices, according to American intelligence services. The inability of the United States to restrain Israel, the willingness of the United States to arm Israel and turn it into a military fortress, the willingness of the United States to basically protect Israel, even when Israel provokes and escalate. This war basically convinced Iranian leaders, particular the Revolutionary Guards leadership, that the only way for Iran to respond to Israel's provocation, to protect Iranian interests and Iranian security, is to really go for the tipping point. And again, this, if this is, if this really is correct, this will change the entire geopolitical landscape and will change as the relationship between the United States and Middle Eastern state for years to come.",
