Former executive editor Marty Baron called it an act of cowardice. At least one editor has resigned and some high-profile staffers have publicly condemned the decision. Others tell CNN they have no problem with the editorial board not endorsing generally, but they all said they found the timing of the announcement troubling.Meanwhile, the daughter of the Los Angeles Times owner says she and her father decided that the paper wouldn't endorse Harris. Nika Soon- Shiong told The New York Times that the decision was motivated by Harris' support for Israel in its conflict with Hamas in Gaza. But the 31-year-old activist has no official role at the paper and has been accused before of meddling in coverage. Billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong later refuted his daughter's comments, saying she wasn't involved in the decision. Three members of the editorial board have resigned, and a wave of outraged readers have cancelled their subscriptions.

And it's about whether those negotiations can resume. I mean, part of the problem, of course, is that the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, has been killed and the organization has not yet formally appointed a new leadership.

And of course, it's also not clear what the new Hamas position -- or the position rather of the new Hamas leader will be, whether it will be just as hardline as Yahya Sinwar or whether it will be more conciliatory and more willing to sort of engage in a ceasefire.

He's a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and he's the author of \"What Really Went WrongSo, when we look at the totality of the attacks, the scale, the targets, as well as Iran downplaying the impact of the strikes, is the region now on that so-called off ramp for escalation, do you think? FAWAZ GERGES, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND AUTHOR, \"WHAT REALLY WENT WRONG\":  Just a bit. I mean, I think the region has escaped the risks of all out regional conflict in the past three weeks. I think the Iranian leadership is downplaying the gravity and the extent of Israeli attacks. A statement by Iran's military stated that Iran prioritizes a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon over retaliation. Obviously, for many of us who watches the Iran scene, the Iranian leadership or Iranian leaders prefers de-escalation. They are terrified that Netanyahu is trying to drag Iran into all-out war with the United States. So, I don't really expect Iran to retaliate for Israeli attacks. Iran's National Security Council met yesterday and no decision has been taken. The dust has not settled on the battlefield in Iran yet. We have to wait and see the results of the attacks and what the decision-making process in Tehran decides to do in the next 24 hours or so.",

You mentioned the U.S. Certainly, there would have been pressure from the Biden administration on Israel to avoid attacking nuclear sites or economic infrastructure.

In fact, the United States, the Biden administration played a major role in trying to convince and to nudge and to pressure Israel not to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and oil and gas facilities. Sadly and tragically, the Biden administration has failed to use its influence and leverage with the Israeli government to basically bring about a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and now in Lebanon. And that's why the protesters in Israel, they have been calling for a ceasefire and the return of the hostages in Gaza for the past quite a few months.Without American pressure on the Netanyahu-led coalition, I doubted very much whether we're going to witness a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, let alone in Lebanon in the next few hours and next few days.",

Now, with his team leading the New York Yankees in the bottom of the 7th inning, Ohtani tried to steal second base. The slugger eventually was helped off the field by trainers. The Dodgers' manager says he hurt his shoulder and will undergo some tests, but he added that that the team is encouraged because his shoulder appears strong with a good range of motion.Now, despite Otani's exit, the Dodgers took down the Yankees 4 to 2, fending off a late comeback threat in the ninth inning. They now lead the series two games to none. All right. Now, to college football in Texas in a big primetime matchup between two highly ranked teams. Texas A&amp;M ranked 14th, beats number 8, LSU, 38 to 23 on Saturday. The Tigers were leading at halftime, 17 to 7, but the Aggies came back strong in the second half. Texas A&amp;M is the only team to be undefeated in the Southeastern Conference. All right. Well, have a look at this. More than a hundred equestrians competed at this horse-riding tournament in Hungary over the weekend, but as you can see, the horses are of the hobby variety. This fast- growing sport has fans apparently around the globe, who knew. These stick horses with stuffed heads are ridden in many different events from dressage, jumping and racing. And while obviously the riders do all the work, one competitor who's also a judge says it's just fun. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
