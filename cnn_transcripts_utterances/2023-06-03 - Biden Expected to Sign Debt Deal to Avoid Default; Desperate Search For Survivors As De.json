He was very wary of talking about specifics about the negotiations, not wanting to jeopardize anything that's happening in these highly intensive conversations behind the scenes. But even after the deal was agreed to, Rahel, we saw President Biden not really to say that it was a win, or Democrats at large, basically trying to not jeopardize Republican support that was needed to get the bill passed. Now that it's past, of course, the President Biden, yesterday in the first time Oval Office address, we saw him do a couple of things. First, we saw him talk about just how important bipartisanship was in all of this process when detailing exactly what is in the bill. But also, almost as importantly, here's what was not in the bill, the things the democratic priorities that President Biden and White House negotiators fought to keep out of it that we're on the chopping block when it comes to Republican deals, but really, he was focused quite intensely on the bipartisan -- bipartisanship of this deal.

And it's one that he has not found a solution to. There's no legislation pending, that's going to make that change. And there's a lot of reason to believe that the Congress is not going to take any action, certainly not before the presidential election. So we still got some problems there. The unemployment rate for black Americans, as we just heard is going in the wrong direction, not all of the arrows are pointing in the right direction. So you know, and then there's the Democratic base that the President has to deal with. We spent so much time talking about the Republican base, there are Democrats who were very, very unhappy about what was given away what has been compromised on, on the environmental front with some of the fossil fuel deals that are tucked into this debt ceiling deal, as well as the fact that student loans, the relief that the President wanted to provide for them is both tied up in court and politically not moving forward as quickly as he would have liked.

They are studying for the wrong test. They're not running against that -- Ron DeSantis acts as if he's running against a man, he's actually running against a movement or in some ways trying to take over that movement.

But everybody.His moment kind of came and went, things didn't work out for him. He didn't do very well in the 2016 primary. I think he's just trying to recapture some of that, you know, because anybody who looked at it objectively would say, you don't have the funding, you don't have the reach, you don't necessarily have a winning message. And the polling, in fact, has very high negatives for him, unlike all of the other candidates. So, it's really hard to see how he gets off the ground here. But you know, people are people, he, you know, he saw his moment in the sunlight. It's very hard to talk to a convention of people screaming your name, and then just go back to being some guy doing commentary on television like us.

And Bowers responded that he had had enough and that, quote, \"all Jews had to die\". CNN's Danny Freeman has more now.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This first week of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial has been intense, it's been emotional and at times it's been challenging to listen to and to watch. But it has also been the first time that survivors of that mass shooting in 2018 have had the chance to face the alleged gunman Robert Bowers in court. We've heard opening statements from both the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution hoping to prove not only that Robert Bowers killed those 11 Jewish worshippers, but also that he did so intentionally because they were Jewish. Meanwhile, the defense not disputing that Bowers killed those worshippers, but they're hoping to paint his motives as irrational. Already, we've heard from more than 12 witnesses including 9-1-1 dispatchers, police officers, survivors of the shooting and family members of the deceased. We've also seen harrowing exhibits like the moment survivors Carol Black and Barry Welber(ph) were able to escape the synagogue after seeing their friend Mel Wax killed right in front of them. And also the moment, Dan Leger, who was shot in the stomach but survived, we saw the moment he was actually rescued and carried out of the synagogue by first responders. Maggie Feinstein, she's a leader with the Jewish community out there in Pittsburgh, she's been watching alongside family members and victims throughout the duration of the trial, and she explained the reactions have truly been varied. MAGGIE FEINSTEIN, DIRECTOR, 10.27 HEALING PARTNERSHIP: One of the things about this trial is the scope of it, the number of victims, the number of people who have been impacted is so large. So people have every varying response to it. Sometimes the healing can begin once you can get through, and all the truths are known, and all of it is out there for the public to know as well. So no longer do you have to hold it on to yourself. And so, there can be something that can be healing. It also can be incredibly painful. And there is really every degree of difference.",

And I think that the play here is that, in not cross-examining the witnesses, you don't want to ever as a defense attorney re-victimize the victims.These were people who underwent a significant event in their life, a compellingly tragic event in their life. And so, cross-examining and antagonizing them with the jury listening and evaluating that is not a good play. The then issue becomes in this specific case, whether that, and not antagonizing the victims and not playing up what they really -- what your client did is going to be enough. When the shift, I'm presuming there will be a guilty finding to the penalty phase. And so, I think the play is that, to not go too hard in there, when it gets to the penalty phase to talk about other, what we call mitigating factors to try to save your client's life, redeeming qualities of your client if any, that the jury could evaluate based upon the horrific nature of the circumstance, to try to avoid the death penalty. And so, I think that's what the defense strategy is, whether that will play effectively obviously remains to be seen, Rahel.",

The bottom line is that if you are on notice with respect to the structural integrity of the building, and that you have reason to know and believe and have prior reports that indicate that this should have been addressed, that's a problem.So it goes to civil liability. The question for me now, Rahel, will be clearly, there is civil liability that relates to monetary damages which families don't care about, they want their loved ones to be safe, many are not. The issue for me is whether there will be a grand jury convened in the future, that will assess whether or not the recklessness here elevates to any criminal liability.

In this week's \"DIFFERENCE MAKER\" sat down with our Coy Wire to discuss that mission a little bit further. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) A'JA WILSON, AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER: And that's something that was very hard for me to come to grasps with as I got older. Because a lot of people saw me as this athlete, this five-star athlete that's doing everything that she's doing, but then I didn't want them to think that I had a weakness. I didn't want them to think that I was not good at something. I had days where I'm like this -- I'm over it, I'm done. It was definitely a process for me just to understand that it's OK to be different, it's OK to learn different, and we all learn different ways, we come from different paths of life, but we shouldn't be judged on that. I knew once I graduated from college, I wanted to start a foundation to help young kids like myself to understand that they're not alone in this process, and that if you had the right resources, you could be able to be very successful in your field.",
