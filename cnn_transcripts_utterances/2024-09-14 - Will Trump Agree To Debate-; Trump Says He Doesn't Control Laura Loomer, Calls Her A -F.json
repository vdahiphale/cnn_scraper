      "sentences": "So will they or won't they? I'm Michael Smerconish in New York City. Today, ballots are now being cast in Alabama. We're 52 days away from the final day of voting, but whether there will be another debate remains in doubt. Tuesday night in Philadelphia ended with a nearly unanimous decision, but no knockout blow before it began, I said Donald Trump needed to exhibit discipline and Kamala Harris needed to show depth.She met her mark, he missed his. I locked in my own assessment of the debate via X just prior to the delivery of closing statements before I might be swayed by anybody else's spin. Among my points that Trump's claims about migrants eating pets and abortions being performed at nine months would be a fact checkers dream, but not decisive. I wrote this, \"She won the debate, but that does not mean the needle moved tonight. People will see what they wanted to see.\" And polling suggests I was correct on both. According to a CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debate, 63 percent said Harris turned in a better performance. Only 37 percent said that about Trump. It's hard to imagine the debate having gone better for Harris. Unlike any prior Trump debate opponent, she surgically got under his skin, among other things, she forced a pre debate handshake and then mocked that which values he's valuing most. She said that people leave his rallies from boredom and that even his beloved business school alma mater, Wharton, was critical of his economic plan. Trump looked dour. He cited fiction, and while his campaign has rightly noted the uneven application of fact checking by the moderators, he himself failed to fact check his opponent, and he missed countless opportunities to make his best case. The very first question was a take on the old, are you better off than you were four years ago, it went to the vice president. She didn't answer it, but Trump blew his rebuttal. He failed to talk about inflation and world conflict and any number of other comparisons that would have advanced his cause. Trump knows he had a bad night. Why else would he last night have raised the ridiculous idea that she was wearing an earpiece so that she could be fed answers? But here's the thing, none of this may have mattered. The first post-debate poll of stature, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds virtually nothing has changed in the presidential race after Tuesday's debate. By their metric, Harris gained just one point nationally. Before the debate, Reuters/Ipsos said Harris led 45 percent to Trump's 41. Post- debate, they found that Harris has 47 percent of support among registered voters nationwide while Trump stands at 42. And where the Electoral College inherently helps Republicans, even after the debate, Nate Silver gives Trump a 61 percent chance of winning. His analysis shows Harris with a national lead of 2.1 percent. Remember, in 2016 a popular vote victory of 2 percent was not enough for Hillary Clinton to win the election, and this could explain why Trump appears in no hurry to commit to another debate. He initially claimed victory. He said no moss to another. And then yesterday said it depended upon his mood, which means it could be a roller coaster. I suspect he will commit, and if he doesn't, Harris has now raised enough money that she could buy 90 minutes of airtime and just air the first debate all over again. It brings me to today's poll question at smerconish.com, will there be a second Harris-Trump debate? Joining me now, two of my favorites, Bakari Sellers, a CNN political commentator and Salena Zito, a national political reporter for \"The Washington Examiner\" and a contributor for The Wall Street Journal. Bakari, to you, if that first debate didn't upend the race, it means we're going to be locked neck and neck till the end, right?",

But you know, there are still real issues that people are deeply concerned about, and I think both candidates need to talk about them in earnest, in a way that connects with the voter, sort of the way that that Bill Clinton used to say, I feel your pain, right?Voters are looking for someone to say, I see what's going on in your community.

And that's thanks to Max Boot, the historian, foreign policy analyst, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and of course, \"The Washington Post\" columnist. He spent more than a decade researching and writing all 700 plus pages of \"ReaganCongratulations on the book, Max. Read it, loved it. You traveled to places special to the Reagan story. Which of those locales put you in his shoes? MAX BOOT, AUTHOR, \"REAGAN: HIS LIFE AND LEGEND\": Well, I think it was really his ranch near Santa Barbara, Michael, that really told me more than any other location about who Ronald Reagan really was. I mean, if anybody has been there, you'll see that it's a very modest breath. You know, it has got a beautiful location, lots of land, but the house itself is very modest. I mean, it has Formica counters. It has G.E. appliances. The books are these well-thumbed volumes that Reagan actually read. It wasn't like these things that, you know, these covers that interior designers put up. The whole thing -- I mean, all the decor looks like it could have been scavenged or flea market, but this was Ronald Reagan's favorite place in the world. He said that, you know, if this wasn't heaven, at least have the same zip code. So, I think that tells you what was really important to him. And it wasn't glitz and it wasn't glamour. He really enjoyed, you know, riding horses, chopping wood, and then returning to this very modest ranch house at night. That's the real Ronald Reagan.",

And a warning that, you know, social welfare programs like Medicare and Medicaid were going to lead to a socialist or even communist takeover of the United States.But once he was in office, he pivoted to the center and turned out to be supremely pragmatic. I mean, in fact, his -- the first big bill he signed as governor of California in 1967 was a large increase in spending and taxes to deal with the looming budget deficit. I mean, he signed one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country in both Sacramento and Washington. He cut deals with Democrats. And ultimately, his crowning achievement as president was working with Mikhail Gorbachev, the world's number one communist, to peacefully end the Cold War, despite a long career as an anti-communist. So, I think that shows you why he was ultimately successful as president. He was able to pivot to the center, compromise, and get things done.",
