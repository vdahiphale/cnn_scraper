Now, the president is still going to be away for several days. He leaves tomorrow for Japan. I don't believe he is slated to return until Sunday or Monday.

In that Republican bill to pass the House, it would require about 80 hours a month for individuals to obtain benefits through the Medicaid program, which, of course, is that entitlement program for health care for low income individuals that have to work, they work related activities for 80 hours a month in order to obtain those benefits that would apply to people who are 55, age 55 and younger. People who do not have any dependents but Democrats say that they are not going to get behind any plan that could take away health care coverage. So how do they square that? That is going to be one of the big questions in the center of these negotiations. Among all those other policy disputes with just so little time, the White House has resisted these negotiations from the beginning, saying they should simply raise the national debt limit without any conditions, any cuts whatsoever.

The intruder realizes that there are someone in the house and leaves. Apparently, according to sources, enter through an open door. Now, the Secret Service detail is posted outside. They weren't aware of this until Sullivan notified them. But here's what didn't happen. Secret Service didn't reach out to the D.C. Metro Police with the description or looking for male one foot in the area. They didn't notify the Secret Service uniform division, which is often on patrol in that area looking after various embassies. So, no one went to looking for this individual. They did a video canvas. They have some grainy video of a male that they are looking. But they are behind the curve here. So what we are seeing is the U.S. Secret Service has ordered what they call a mission assurance review, meaning what happened here and where did procedure go.

They say this is an effort to move toward a Beijing mediated peace talk. And joining us for a bipartisan interview, the top members of the Select Committee on China, Republican Chairman Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Democratic ranking member, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. Chairman Gallagher, let me start with you. How realistic or unrealistic is it do you think for China to try to broker any sort of peace deal? Do they have the standing to do so? REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI), CHAIRMAN, SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHINA: They do not because, of course, China is fueling Putin's war machine. China is standing by Vladimir Putin. Xi and Putin have a no limits partnership. I think it's important for us to understand the depths and scale of this partnership, and for that to give us the energy to continue our support of the Ukrainians, to make sure that we're modernizing our defense industrial base to build the weapons that we need not only to help Ukrainians fight for themselves, but to replenish our stock piles as well provide weapons in the Indo Pacific. And so, let's not allow the Chinese communist party to perpetrate this narrative that somehow they're peacemakers when they are, in fact, supporting Putin's war machine.",

What I increasingly see is a de facto alliance against the West in terms of Xi, Putin, to a lesser extent the Iranians.So, teasing out the depths of that partnership is one part of the effort. The other thing is really understanding what the crisis in Ukraine has revealed, which is the fragility of our defense industrial base, our munitions industrial base and making sure we never put ourselves in positions again where we're struggling to manufacture things that we've neglected for years. So, we can fix that problem through things like multi-year procurement for critical long range precision fires, but that requires some action here on Capitol Hill.",

That's very dangerous, particularly if you believe as I do, thatTikTok is owned by ByteDance and ByteDance is effectively controlled by the Chinese communist party.

The latest contention, housing migrants in school gyms.CNN's Athena Jones is outside a school in Brooklyn, where migrants are currently being sheltered. Athena, what is the reaction from the community there? ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Jake. There's a lot of anger and concern. Anger and concern about the fact that the city did not notify, not just parents, but teachers, school administrators, other members of the community about the plan to house migrants here at this facility. You know, even this morning there was a lot of question about whether this was already going on or whether it was something that was still being considered listening to the language from the mayor. What we now understand from a city council members that migrants began arriving here at this location, the gym behind this school on Sunday. We went into that gymnasium, cots wall to wall, they appeared to be housing adult migrants from men and women. But there is a lot of uncertainty about who these people are, talking to the parents and they are concerned about how well they have been vetted, what their health status is, and the fact that the school is still in session. They are concerned about the atmosphere that having these migrants just steps away will help create for the children. Take a listen to what one mother who has a son in pre-K had to say. Robin Williams is her name. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBIN WILLIAMS, PARENT OF STUDENT AT PS 188: I was scared. I was nervous. I felt like it was the wrong decision that they made at the time where nobody knew anything. My concern is that I will be with children that go to school to get an education at PS 188.
