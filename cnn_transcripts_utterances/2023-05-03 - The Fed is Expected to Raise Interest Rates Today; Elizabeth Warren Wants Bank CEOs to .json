      "sentences": "Today, in fact in about 90 minutes, a big Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. And it comes in a very volatile moment for the U.S. economy. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates. If so, that would be the tenth straight rate hike. But perhaps, as smart people say, the last uptick before a pause. Inflation is the Fed's target here, but the rate hikes are also a factor in the banking sector stress and of course, the debt ceiling showdown between the White House and House Republicans also looms large over any big economic policy decisions right now.Jim Tankersley of \"The New York Times\" joins our conversation. There's been some pushback to the Fed plan, saying maybe not now because of the stress in regional stocks, because some recent reports have shown (inaudible) plan is working and the economy does seems to be cooling, yet the expectation is at least one more rate increase, right?",

But there's big pressure building from congressional Democrats, liberals like Elizabeth Warren, for the Fed to pause now because they are worried that more rate hikes could destabilize the banking system and cause a recession.  KINGbreak, at least they were up. We can show them again and see if that's still the case. Higher interest rates have been one of the pressures on these banks. I'm not excusing the management, I'm not excusing the regulators, but the higher interest rates have been one of things to put stress on the bank. And that's one of the reasons people like Mark Zandi at Moody's economics, very smart guy, says he think it's a mistake to raise them again. Why would a rate increase potentially exacerbate the banking stress?",

The things that they own aren't worth as much today as they would be if they hold them all the way to term. And so, they are basically exposed to these interest rate hikes and the more depositors get worried about that exposure, the more they could flee and that can create more stress like we saw with Silicon Valley Bank. KINGWarren is among those (inaudible) who are watching this closely, worried about the banks. She also thinks that JPMorgan comes in and buys one of the banks under stress, First Republic. She says that's a big bank, getting even bigger, and she thinks we have a lot of problems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: We cannot be a country that just time after time rolls through another banking failure and nobody gets held accountable.

There was a big focus on this after SBA's collapse. And there's another hearing coming up about this too, but it's mostly really subsided.

The question is, do politicians take any cues from that? Do they see what has happened in recent weeks and say, you know what, we should be adults here. Let's deal with the debt ceiling. The Democrats had this Plan B or Plan Z, I don't know what to call it, where they would use the discharge position, use the rules to try to sneak a clean debt ceiling limit, so you'd need a handful of Republicans though.And among the Republicans you might look to, Don Bacon in Nebraska says no way, says no appetite for my way or the highway stance of Biden-Jeffries. In a divided government, people don't want to govern, sit down and find some middle ground. So, if the Democrats will still keep that Plan Z on the table, just in case, but what now? When?

The reality is, when you talk to some economists, they think ultimately this is going to end where even if there is a single debt ceiling hike passed, ultimately with some Republican votes, it's going to be followed closely behind or tethered to some type of spending cuts and deal with Speaker McCarthy.The big thing though is whatever deal that Speaker McCarthy can get with President Biden, are there going to be enough House Republicans that are willing to vote for it and whether it's a discharge (ph) petition or not, is he going to have to turn to Democrats to help him get that passed.",

So, we're talking really early preliminary thoughts here.But, what we are hearing from sources is that he's talking about how he doesn't want to participate. And a lot of that is based on the fact that he has this enormous lead at this time, saying it would stupid for us to go up there on the stage, but he's also airing some other grievances. One is that he says he doesn't want to debate this early. He says August is too early; his advisers told me that they told the RNC this before they made the announcement. RNC officials have pushed back on that, telling me that it's not true. That they had all of these conversations beforehand. The other thing that he has talked about is the Ronald Reagan Library. He has a bone to pick with the Ronald Reagan Library because he has a lot of resent for the fact that they invited so many other Republican leaders to speak and not him.
