And I think the Middle East that the Israelis want to show they're not hiding it. They showed it on the map than that Netanyahu showed at the U.N. General Assembly, the evil and the blessing. They want a Middle East free from a Palestinian State. They want a Middle East where Israel would have the supremacy. And this is a delusional goal. I think the Middle East we want to see is a Middle East of peace, a Middle East of opportunities, a Middle East of economic growth. That's the Middle East we want to see. And unless and until there is peace and real peace, there is no way that the Middle East could be reshaped. And Israel stands today with the current government as opposite to any prospect for peace, and I think that partly explains why they're exporting the conflict towards new frontiers to distract attention of the fact that this current government in Israel is sterile, is unable to deliver any plan for peace or any strategy.

But honestly, even if they were to come down in a worst-case scenario, so much of this area is evacuated. It may not cost a lot of life.

The big difference between Helene and this storm is the massive storm surge. Think about if you're standing up in your house last week, if you were on a first story house, you would have had six feet of water up to eight feet of water coming into your house. And so, as people have ripped all that apart, now they're facing potentially 15 feet of water, and it's going to depend on exactly where the storm hits. The latest report shows that it will hit just south of Tampa Bay and Sarasota, but the storm itself covers the entire state. The difference between where the eye hits is, if you're on the northern side, you might get less of a storm surge. The National Weather Service is still predicting 12 feet in Tampa Bay, although other meteorologists in Tampa Bay say that if the eye goes further south, we may have a lot less.

And yet, the governor of your state has signed a bill earlier this year erasing most references to climate change from state laws. And his policies have made it more difficult for cleanup, energy companies to operate there -- clean energy companies rather.

So, we have the situation room, which is where they have their stands and they sit in front of the screens and watch the border of Gaza.

So, in the military, you have 8,200 unit, which does kind of more fancy technology-based signals intelligence, which is considered very valuable by the military.

We have classified stuff that will, you know, take care of what we need. And so, these women were basically alerting. And at one point, I spoke to a young woman who wasn't on the base that day, and she was a commander of the observers. So, she compiled intelligence reports at the end of each shift with what kind of was unusual. And she even called up an intelligence number that she had. She didn't know exactly who it was, but she basically asked, what's going on? And they said, oh, nothing. You have nothing to worry about. She trusted them. So, that's one thing. That's one of the failures. And the second thing, I mean, a lot of people asked me, you know, they were a woman. Was it because misogyny, you know? And I think it does play a role here, but I do want to say that Israel has a really big intelligence failure here. It's not just about -- I think men were also ignored that raised alarm, and it's more complicated.",

You could see why people are asking, is it that they didn't -- they ignored what they had to say because they didn't believe these women would know what they were talking about?

A very attention getting operation just recently involved planting these explosive devices in the pagers of that -- were handed out to, you know, certain sort of Lebanese officials and so forth. They were able to, you know, assassinate certain high-level officials in third countries with a fair degree of precision. And yet, they didn't see this massive operation being developed on their own borders. So, I'm just wondering how these recent events are landing with these families.",

So, Israel, for years, just invested most of itsresources in the -- it's -- in its northern border with Lebanon, especially Hezbollah, Iran, while Hamas was seen as deterred by the Israeli government, by the military, they thought they weren't as capable. And so, that's also another layer of this that we didn't really discuss. But we're seeing these incredible capabilities, intelligence capabilities in -- you know, in Lebanon with Hezbollah that took years and year and resources to build. So, that's part of it. And it just kind of shows the difference here. You know, we're seeing such impressive capabilities and just such a disaster in -- with Gaza. The second thing I would say is that there's still five, you know, female observers in Hamas captivity. And so, the families that I spoke to feel that they've been forgotten and abandoned by the government because the government has moved on to this new front. And, yes, it says that it will put pressure on Hamas and maybe it will help secure a deal, but I'm not sure the families buy that so much anymore. I think that they feel like, you know, the country's moving on to a new front. And Gaza has been left behind and their loved ones.",

But it's not just Hamas' capabilities, there's a huge failure here by the Israeli State, by the Israeli military, the security establishment to see this coming. As Israel keeps fighting and this war keeps expanding, we're not -- I mean, the state hasn't taken time to really reflect, and society hasn't really taken enough time to reflect on these failures. And these women represent the tragedy and the cost of what happened and they're the victims and their families, a year later, just want answers. That's all they're looking for. And they can't get that. They actually had to start investigating this on their own because they felt they were not getting answers from the military or from anyone else. And they really just interviewed anyone they could. And by the time the military came back with some of its first answers, some of the families already knew better than them what was going on because they had just done their own reporting in a sense.",
