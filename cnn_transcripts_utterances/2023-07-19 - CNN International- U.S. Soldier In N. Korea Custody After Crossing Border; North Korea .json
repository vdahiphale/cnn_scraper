      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Christina Macfarlane in London. Just ahead, we're learning more about the U.S. soldier who is being held in North Korea after he crossed into the secretive nation at the Demilitarized Zone.Also ahead, a second night of heavy bombardment in Odesa as Russia targets the Ukrainian port city with missiles and drones. And a rare speech from Britain's top spy who says Putin has been humiliated by the attempted mutiny in Russia last month. Details from Prague in just a moment. But first, we're learning new details about the American soldier in North Korean custody who ran across the military demarcation line into North Korea on Tuesday. Private Travis King had faced disciplinary action, according to an army official, and was supposed to be sent back to the United States. Court documents reveal he was brought to South Korean court on assault charges last year. The incident comes during a sensitive time, with Pyongyang ramping up its ballistic missile test. Two short range missiles were launched early Wednesday. Well, let's bring in CNN's National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand, who's live for us at the Pentagon. And Natasha, as we just said, we knew this U.S. soldier was facing disciplinary action. So what more are you learning about the potential motive for what happened here and the Pentagon's efforts to resolve this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this whole situation really has officials here scratching their heads. But essentially what we're learning is that this individual, Private Travis King, he was deployed to U.S. forces South -- U.S. forces Korea, and he was a fairly junior enlisted soldier.And what happened was he took as a tour of the DMZ, and he, all of a sudden, ran across the demarcation line into North Korea. According to U.S. officials here, he was not coerced to do so, and he appeared to do so voluntarily and, of course, without authorization. But we're learning a bit more about his backstory. He was facing assault charges in South Korea stemming from two incidents in September of 2022 and October of 2022. And he actually served 50 days in a South Korean detention facility and was set to be sent back to the United States to Fort Bliss in Texas and face disciplinary action by the U.S. military. He was actually going to be separated from the army as a result of these assault charges. So he was making his way to the airport escorted by U.S. military officials, but they couldn't accompany him all the way to the gate. And they lost track of him, essentially when he was set to board the plane. At some point after he did not make his flight, he then went to this tour of the DMZ, and that is when we're told he crossed that line into North Korea. Now, the U.S. military is working with North Korean officials, military officials, to try to resolve this situation. But as we know, the U.S. and North Korea, they really haven't had any diplomatic relations since the Biden administration came into office. So it remains to be seen just how productive those conversations have been. And importantly, we have actually heard from Travis King's mother, who spoke to ABC and said that she can't imagine her son doing something like this. She last spoke to him just a few days ago, and he told her that he was going back to Fort Bliss. But she said, of course, that all she really wants right now is for him to come home. Christina?",

The mayor saying we do not recall such a scale of attack since the beginning of the full scale invasion.So that gives you a sense of the scale here. In terms of what the targets were, what was actually happening, President Zelenskyy has come out and accused Russia of targeting infrastructure linked to the grain deal. Obviously that deal that they pulled out of on Monday, the Black Sea Grain Initiative. We had heard early in the day from Ukrainian officials in that city that a grain in an oil terminal at the port of Odesa had been hit by missiles that actually did reach their targets. Russia is saying that this the Russian MOD, the Ministry of Defense in the last hour has come out and said that it launched a group strike with high precision sea and airbase weapons on military industry facilities. They're saying fuel infrastructure and ammunition depots. They're also saying that they hit an airbase, a Ukrainian air base in Central Ukraine. So they're not admitting to hitting sort of grain-related infrastructure. They're not also, as they did on Tuesday, explicitly claiming that this is retaliation. But I think, given that we had heard from the Kremlin on Tuesday saying that they're still looking at proposals for retaliating for the attack on the Kerch Bridge, it can be viewed in that context. Although, obviously, I think it's still hard to distinguish Russian retaliation from their overall aggression here. These aerial assaults continue to be part of a pattern.",

Because of this, we don't know the cause. It's a fairly big fire. They've had to evacuate some 2,000 people from neighboring villages. They've closed a section of highway. There was a suggestion on telegram from a Wagner linked group that a storm shadow missile may have been used. That would be pretty significant to do this.

I quote Sir Richard Moore saying there.But this too Prague, a venue where he chose to also launch an appeal to Russians disaffected with how the war is being fought to essentially come and spy for the United Kingdom, promising their safety and secrecy of those secrets, but also took two king to point out how in the assessment here that China remains fully in support of Russia. Complicit was his words in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But also, too, that Iranian support for Russia's war. Remember those attacks on Odesa you were hearing about, often done by Iranian built and supplied Shahed drones? That that support has indeed caused fissures at the top of Iran's official dom.

It is part of the demilitarized zone that separates north and South Korea and is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.North Korea is a notoriously autocratic regime and has no official diplomatic relations with the U.S. Tensions between the two countries have been rising in recent years due to Pyongyang ramping up its nuclear and missile programs. But you might remember the last high-profile visit of U.S. citizen rather to enter North Korea from the demarcation line. Of course, it was 2019. Donald Trump becoming the first sitting U.S. leader to set foot in North Korea. Mr. Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un shook hands for about a minute before returning to the south to hold a short conversation.

And you can see even less than 5 miles out,you can still, there's spike strips on the road. There's obviously all of these barricades. Basically, they do not want people getting close to the Demilitarized Zone unless they are authorized to do so. Now, tour groups, they're suspended for the time being. They were allowed in, but there's a lot of protocol, a lot of security checks that you have to go through. And -- but in fact, if indeed it was at Panmunjam, where this whole incident happened, then this young U.S. army private, 23 year old Travis King, may have actually stepped across in relatively the same way that President Trump stepped across when he went with Kim Jong-un, which is just kind of, you know, we don't know if there's video that will ever be released that would show it. Obviously, it was probably caught on multiple security cameras, given the sensitivity of this location. But whether or not that will ever see the light of day, we don't know.
