You're looking at live pictures from Southern Lebanon after Hezbollah militants say they've successfully completed their retaliatory strikes on Israel for the day. So, that is what happened in Northern Israel hours ago after the group fired at least 200 rockets from Lebanon. Hezbollah called that the first phase of its retaliation for the recent killing of its top military commander. But earlier, Israel said it hit Hezbollah positions just as they were preparing to launch their strikes. The IDF says more than 100 fighter jets took part in the operation, destroying thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels. Lebanon says three people were killed. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to those strikes. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  This morning, we detected Hezbollah's preparation to attack Israel. Together with the minister of defense and the chief of staff, we instructed the IDF to act proactively to remove the threat. The IDF has since been acting vigorously to thwart the threats. It destroyed thousands of rockets aimed at the north of the country. It also thwarted many other threats and operates with great strength, both in defense and attack. I ask you, citizens of Israel, to comply to the directives of the Home Front Command. We are determined to do everything to protect our country, return the residents of the north safely to their homes, and continue to uphold a simple rule, whoever hurts us, we hurt them.

After the call, the Pentagon reaffirmed America's ironclad commitment to Israel's defense.Now, CNN has reporters on the ground across the region. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv, Israel.

      "sentences": "All right. And so, Nic, from Israel's point of view, take us through the military and political reaction there. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITORThe IDF has confirmed now somewhat the allegations that Hezbollah had made or the claims that Hezbollah had made that it was planning to strike deeper into Israel. The IDF saying that intended targets were in Central Israel. The targets listed so far, the military targets, Hezbollah says that it hit 11 military targets, the IDF has not given an assessment yet of the damage there. That's quite normal. They're normally slow to do that. In fact, sometimes they won't even offer in detail accounting of precisely what was hit at those locations. Certainly, one of the locations Hezbollah said they were aiming at was a major air defense site, sort of a principal node, if you will, in an array of infrastructure designed specifically to stop drone and missile strikes getting into Central Israel. Not crossing a red line, at least it appears, the sort of red lines or the lines that Israel and Hezbollah operate under that don't trigger a massive escalation from the other side. And I say that because Hezbollah claims only to have targeted military sites, and as far as we know so far, only one civilian in Akko in the north, a woman was injured by shrapnel. But the steps that have been taken to heighten the alert for people in Israel, the Home Front Command instructions have told people in Northern Israel, in fact, from Tel Aviv to Northern Israel to stay closer to their shelters, not to go further than they need to. And here in Tel Aviv, an indication again, perhaps of just the range or intent of Hezbollah with its missiles. The beaches here have been closed for swimming today and leisure and cultural activities also have been put on hold. Gatherings of more than 30 people have been put on hold as well. So, the level of concern stretches as far down here for the Israeli authorities as Tel Aviv and officials here say 240 shelters open in Tel Aviv, although telling people that they don't need to go to them and don't hang around in those shelters. And if things do escalate further, then more shelters will be made available. But this is an increased security preparedness footing that Israel hasn't taken until now. And that does show the level of concern. And while battle damage assessment is done by the military, you can be rest assured that preparations for a next round of strikes, should they be called upon, that those preparations will be well in hand.",

And I do think that overplays it somewhat. They're allies, of course. There's no question about that. Hezbollah is very strongly allied with Iran. You could say that it's an Iranian asset in the region, but they do operate with slightly different calculations depending on the situation that is underway.And of course, Lebanon is on the border with Israel. The threat to Hezbollah is tremendous in a way that simply isn't the same for Tehran. Having said that, I do think that on -- in this particular situation, there will be coordination. I would be very surprised if Iran hadn't been made aware of Hezbollah's retaliation this morning. But having said that, this may have taken place at extremely short notice. The Israelis have said that they engaged in a preemptive strike. Besides the Israelis, we have no way of verifying that it was actually a preemptive strike that actually took a part in a Hezbollah operation that was about to take place. We simply don't know that. And had this been a strike that Israel had undertaken independently of any new threat from Hezbollah, then Hezbollah would have probably been placed in the situation of feeling it had to respond irrespective of its plans. And we do know that everybody's been on, quote/unquote, the -- you know, the hair trigger for weeks, if not months, i.e., the preparations are ready sort of 90 percent all the way anyway and it's that last step that needs to be taken in order to move into position. So, there's going to be, I think, a bit of a war of narratives that also happens now, whether or not this truly was a preemptive strike. I'm not saying that it wasn't, but we simply don't know without further verification, and it'll be difficult to get that.",

And I suppose, you know, that they -- these talks have enough problems trying to reach an actual deal without having to worry about, you know, whether Hezbollah's strikes on Israel or Israel's preemptive strikes on Hezbollah are going to push them off course.Of course, you could also take the view, if you're of a more optimistic bent, that if things are going to heat up more so on the northern border, then Israel may be keener to wrap things up in the Gaza Strip to get a ceasefire agreement so that it can focus on the north, as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been indicating in recent days. Of course, at the same time, Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, the architect of the October the 7th terrorist attacks, may, according to some observers, have been playing a waiting game to see if Hezbollah strikes on Israel, to say nothing of Iran's planned retaliation for the assassination off of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July the 31st may actually drag Israel into a wider war. So, in that respect, any escalation in the north or with Iran could -- the reaction of Israel and Hamas are almost kind of misaligned. But if we focus back on the talks, as you say, Kim, still wide differences between them, not just between Israel and Hamas, but also between Israel and one of the key mediators, Egypt, an Egyptian official telling Israel that Israel -- after Israel's submitted a new proposal on Thursday regarding the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, the 14- kilometer strip of land that's effectively the border between Gaza and Egypt. Egypt saying the decreased Israeli presence is not the solution. Egypt would want to see Israel withdrawing its troops completely from that area. Something that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to have said is a red line effectively. He's drawn that line in a sense saying that Israel must control that border to prevent Hamas rearming. It believes Hamas gets most of its arms through tunnels between Egypt and Israel and doesn't trust the Egyptians to prevent that from happening. At the same time, Hamas, of course, has repeatedly said it wants a permanent ceasefire agreement and also full withdrawal of Israeli troops in order to proceed with this phase one of this three phased ceasefire agreement, which would also see a number of hostages released after being kidnapped on October the 7th. And at the same time, the freeing of a certain number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas also accusing Israel of changing the terms of the prisoner release and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying time and time again that Israel reserves the right to go back to fighting after the temporary six-week ceasefire in order to finish the job to prevent Hamas from threatening Israel and from maintaining its governance and military capabilities and to put pressure on the militant group, Kim, to get all the hostages home.",

Hezbollah was contained or restrained possibly by Iran and possibly by their own reading of the political developments and figured that if they strike while negotiations are going on in Doha and Qatar now in Egypt, they will be accused of undermining the talks. By escalating the conflict, they would be undermining the talk. So, they waited patiently.Once they concluded, according to them, that these talks will not produce an agreement, which I think is a realization they have reached in the last few days, they figured, all right, now's the time. Now, note one more important thing here, and that is that, you know, for a long time there was this idea that both Iran and Hezbollah would retaliate simultaneously. Then the logic said, well, Iran has to, but Hezbollah doesn't. And actually, the third possibility is -- transpired and that it is, that Hezbollah reacted rather than Iran.

The IDF says that they can confirm that the majority of the projectiles that came over the border from Hezbollah were towards the north. But they also say that Hezbollah intended to strike the Central Israel area as well.And the authorities here in Tel Aviv have put restrictions on people in Tel Aviv, reminding them that 240 bomb shelters are open, not to be used just to go and loiter in because people are afraid right now, that they can open more shelters, but telling people not to congregate in groups of more than 30, that the beaches will remain closed in Tel Aviv, that leisure and cultural events are not to be held. What the authorities here have doing is go on to a higher level of alert warning for people from Tel Aviv all the way to the north of the country, where in Akko, a lady was injured by falling shrapnel. But when it comes to that really specific and important question of what actual damage Hezbollah was able to do to Israeli military infrastructure, we don't have any details on that from Israeli authorities. And typically, in these situations, they might confirm a strike on a base, that air base or the air defense site in the north has certainly been hit before by Hezbollah with multiple rockets on occasion, and the IDF does give some clarification about that later, but rarely do they get into what was damaged and casualties or specifics on casualties at those sites. So, at the moment, the IDF and their continued strikes along the border, it seems that while the sort of proactive targeting of Hezbollah, as the IDF said, Hezbollah was preparing for this bigger wave of strikes, while that is sort of paused, it's very clear that the normal level of IDF military operations along the border with Lebanon is not on hold. It's going to continue. The security cabinet here wrapped up several hours ago. We don't know what conclusions they came to about their force posture, but I think you can be quite sure that the Israeli Air Force is ready should they get the command and the need to go on the offensive again as they did last night. So, I think the posture at the moment is caution, assessment, heightened state of alert. But at the moment, no return to the high levels of fire that we saw overnight.",

All we have is Israel's suggestion that they've destroyed thousands of launch rails. So, in other words, it probably has disrupted Hezbollah's plans for an offensive.

Iran will be making its own calculation in terms of just how much damage can it do in an attack on Israel and how much damage can Israel do in retaliation. And I think one of the big concerns that Iran would have is that in any retaliation against Iran, Israel would go after Iran's nuclear sites. In other words, Bordeaux and Natanz, and potentially retire Iran's ability to race for the bomb, you know, in a significant way.
