He and his allies will spend the night, trying to twist arms, namely, these arms, belonging to the six hard-right Republicans that you see there on your screen.It is so close that absent members, some of them came straight out of surgery, or other medical procedures, have been making their way back to the Chamber, one even flying, back to Washington, from Colorado. All of this has an extra resonance, because this is happening, on the second anniversary, of the attack, on the Capitol. CNN's Manu Raju has been working his sources, all night, and frankly, all week. He joins us. And much longer than that, frankly! Manu, so we talked to you, in the last hour. It seems to change almost by the minute. What's the latest?",

But they believe that they have gotten there, after furious negotiations, over the last several days, with some of the key holdouts.Now, the question will ultimately be on which members ultimately flipped. You showed the six that are on your screen. Some of those don't need to -- if all members come, and they vote for a specific candidate, they will need four of those six. But there are other strategies that are now being discussed, including urging some of those members, to vote \"Present.\" Doing that lowers the voting threshold. They may only need a couple of them to flip. And the question will be how many of those members ultimately decide to vote \"Present.\" All those discussions now, happening behind-the-scenes. But after this vote, tonight, the McCarthy team, are putting out word, to the members, to prepare for a very late night. There'll be a swearing in of the members. McCarthy would finally make the speech, accepting the Speaker's gavel, make a speech to the full House. And then, afterwards, that full House would vote, to adopt a rules package, governing how the House would operate. That includes some of the concessions that he has been negotiating, over the past several days, here. So, Anderson, after the furious week of negotiations, the McCarthy team believes they are finally there, on the cusp of the Speakership. And now, the question will be which of those holdouts ultimately flip.",

In fact, they have not publicly released what all the concessions are.While there is this rules package that will be adopted, later, that includes the, what is known as the motion to vacate? One member of the House can call for a vote, to oust a sitting Speaker. That has prompted some concerns within the ranks that it could create some instability among the Speaker. But that is just one of the many other concessions. The other ones are just assurances that Kevin McCarthy made, to some of these members, on the hard-right, dealing with spending cuts and domestic programs that could potentially affect some defense programs, as well, as well as giving some key committee assignments, to some of these members, including on the very powerful House Rules Committee that sets the terms, of floor debate, on legislation and amendments. And also, on some other key issues, namely the debt limit. That is going to be a huge issue, in the new Congress. What McCarthy has agreed to, with these members, is to pair raising the debt limit, to avoid a national default, with spending cuts. That is a red line, for Democrats, in the Senate, as well as in the White House, and what could set up a huge fight, and potentially the first ever national debt default. But that fight will wait for another day, as McCarthy had to make these promises, Anderson, in order to secure the Speakership, which something that he believes he'll have, in a matter of about an hour or so.",

And McCarthy's allies have been making sure every supporter is here, voting for McCarthy. But we had a couple of absences today, for various reasons. And those members have been hauled back. I mean, it just shows you how high stakes these are. Wesley Hunt, for example, he's a Republican, supporting McCarthy. He had a new baby, just days ago, who had to spend time, in the NICU. He was hoping to go home. He did. As far as we understand, he did go home, and had to come back, tonight, for the vote. Another member, Ken Buck, he had a pre-planned medical procedure. He was just texting me, actually, moments ago. And he's back. He's landed. So, he's back in the Capitol. And then, even on the Democratic side, we saw David Trone. He's a Democrat, who is voting against McCarthy. He had shoulder surgery, just this morning, and came straight to the Capitol. He was still wearing his hospital slippers. So, it just shows you the great personal sacrifices that these members are making, and the personal toll, it has come.

It doesn't seem like it's going to be possible.\" I mean, there was a lot of doom and gloom. And one day later, he's pulled it out. So, for all the carping about Kevin, and his team, and everything that's going on, I do think he deserves a lot of credit. And I think what the Congressman-elect Lawler said is true. Every day this drug on was a day they weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing, whether it was on the policy stuff, or on the oversight stuff, which I think is important, to a lot of grassroots Republicans, all across the country. So, I think Lawler was on message, there. I think you're going to hear that from a lot of Republicans, tonight. This middle-of-the-night rules package debate will be interesting. And presuming they get that done as well, then you can look for them maybe Monday, Tuesday, hitting the ground, running with the agenda they ran on. And, by the way, House Republicans did win the national popular vote, on the agenda that Lawler laid out. KAREN FINNEY, FORMER SENIOR SPOKESPERSON, CLINTON 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: They won, however, without the benefit of -- with the benefit of heavily-gerrymandered districts. And I think if you take a look at, and I think, part of what we've seen over the last few days, is a complete misreading of the results of the election, which is the American people have said, \"We want you to actually work together. It's about us. It's not about you.\" I think that was a more sober reading of the results of the election, and the \"Red wave\" that never manifested. And, regardless, I will grant you that Kevin McCarthy deserves his moment in the sun, which it sounds like from the timing, he'll get it. We don't know how long that moment is going to last!",

Today, he started making calls, I'm told, by our colleague, Kaitlan Collins, once it looked like Kevin was going to get it. I think the question, though, isn't what happened with the Speaker vote, or what is happening with the Speaker vote? It's what's going to happen in the primaries. It's who else is going to get in the race. Then, we're really going to know. Has his influence diminished somewhat? Absolutely. But will it make a difference at the polls?",

And it sometimes seems that half the country or at least half the political leadership, in this country, is on a path of looking for accountability, and the other half is still desperately trying to ignore things, like those 140 assaults, and wash their hands, of what happened, on that day, in an effort to get away from the stink that comes with being associated with an attack.

But it certainly remains down to the wire, still uncertain. Meanwhile, a source telling CNN that the former President has been making calls, today, on behalf of the man, he once called \"My Kevin.\" He reiterated his support for McCarthy, two days ago. But despite McCarthy's increase in votes, today, some debate, whether the former President, the only declared Republican candidate, for 2024, can actually move the needle. CNN Chief Correspondent, Kaitlan Collins, joins us now. Does it seem like the former President had any influence at all in the vote changes? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, CNN CO-ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING: He's certainly been involved, today, Anderson. But for, Tuesday night, someone who was wavering on Kevin McCarthy, and was declining to put out a statement, reiterating his support for him, until he did do so, on Wednesday morning, calling on all Republicans, to vote for him? It kind of speaks to the level of involvement that the former President has had here. Yesterday, and today, I am told that he's been making calls, to some of these hardliners, these are the final holdouts that you saw, starting to change, really and give Kevin McCarthy, the momentum, we saw today, that he was not experiencing, on Tuesday, or Wednesday, or on Thursday. He did not see any of that until today. And so, Trump has been making these calls. There are some Republicans, Byron Donalds, for example, who says he does believe Trump deserves credit, for helping sway the vote, here. But several of the other Republicans that I've spoken with here, those that have been supporting McCarthy, all along, say that really he didn't have any kind of large impact on this race. Yes, he made calls today. But he was the one who, on Tuesday, was talking about the reasons those who were against McCarthy, were against McCarthy, essentially saying that he found validation in that.

So, we have learned that the three names that McCarthy, his allies, are talking to are Eli Crane, Matt Rosendale and Lauren Boebert. These are crucial names. And if these three vote \"Present,\" then McCarthy will become the 55th person, to serve, as the Speaker of the House. So, as we are standing by for that vote, and Jake and I expect this to be gaveled in, momentarily, less than 10 minutes, 10 PM Eastern, we expect it to happen at that time. We're reporting the McCarthy's team believes that they have the votes, and that they're already taking steps to organize the House. Well, we'll see because, at this point, you never know until you know. But there was an incredible turnaround, earlier today, for McCarthy that gave him the momentum. 15 holdouts switching their votes, in favor of the Republican leader that have been holding out for days, in all of those ballots that Jake just talked about, giving McCarthy the momentum that he desperately needed, to turn it around.

In order for him to become a Speaker, if all members vote, for a specific candidate, he needs 218 votes. But McCarthy's team has been working behind-the-scenes, to convince some of those six holdouts, to either vote for him, or vote \"Present.\" If they vote \"Present,\" that lowers the voting threshold, and he could potentially be approved as the next Speaker, with 216 votes, or even 217 votes, depending how it all shakes out. At this moment, it's still a bit uncertain, who those holdouts, which ones will actually flip. Lauren Boebert, one of them, you mentioned before, last hour, she was asked about her vote, she would not say how she would come down. She said she was still working on some key issues. And also Matt Gaetz, who has been one of the chief opponents, of Kevin McCarthy, just said, moments ago too, he would not say one way or the other how he would vote, refusing to say, if he would vote \"Present,\" to help Kevin McCarthy. That is something also we will watch on the House floor. But this all comes, after McCarthy has negotiated a round of concessions, some of which will be adopted, in a rules package that will be approved, in the House, after the Speaker vote, if the Speakership is set. And if it is set, we will hear from Kevin McCarthy himself, giving a speech on the House floor, after the swearing in the members, as well, who've been waiting to be sworn in. Because since the Speakership has not been set, Erin?",
