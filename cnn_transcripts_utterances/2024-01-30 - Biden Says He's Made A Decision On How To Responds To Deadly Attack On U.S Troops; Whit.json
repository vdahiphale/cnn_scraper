The White House under pressure from the left and the right as they consider how to addressmultiple crises across the Middle East, and the President first runs for reelection. Plus, Donald Trump is set to meet with the influential Teamsters union. He is seeking their endorsement. But first, he has taken to social media to insult the head of the Auto Workers union after the UAW endorsed Joe Biden. And I'll speak with former Trump White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. What does he make of a potential rematch between Joe Biden and his former boss? That and more ahead. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington. It's Tuesday, January 30. There are just 25 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 279 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Presents President Biden today just moments ago, in fact, says he has made a decision about how he will respond to the deadly attack on a U.S. military base in Jordan, without sparking all-out war with Iran. The U.S. has been blaming an Iran-based militia for the deaths of these three American soldiers, and Biden said he holds Iran responsible for supplying weapons. Iran denies any role in the attack. Earlier, the President said -- the White House said the President is aware of the high stakes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATL. SECURITY COUNCIL COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: We are not looking for a war with Iran. We're not looking to escalate here. This attack over the weekend was escalatory. Make no mistake about it. And it requires a response. Make no mistake about that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said \"President Biden's fearof escalation has morphed into a doctrine of appeasement. The weakness shown by this administration emboldens our enemies.\" But, there is also pressure on the President from within his own party about going too far. Before the attack, 14 House Democrats had written to the President, urging him to \"seek authorization from Congress before involving the U.S. in another conflict in the Middle East, potentially provoking Iran-backed militias, and risking escalation of a wider regional war.\" Let's dive into all this with today's panel. CNN Political Commentator, Democratic Strategist, Maria Cardona; Lance Trover, the former Spokesman for North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign, and Gloria Borger who is a CNN Senior Political Analyst. Welcome to all of you. Thank you so much for being here. Gloria, let's start here with the dilemma that the President is facing. So, we just heard from the President on the South Lawn. I'm not sure if we have those remarks ready to play. I can show them to the panel. Let's just play them because you can kind of see that this isn't a Q&amp;A-style session. It helps kind of give a little bit of context to what he was trying to speak to. Watch. This was just moments ago from the President. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The number one reason why I think he won't be, because that crowd is invariably wrong. They said in 2016, Hillary Clinton was going to be President. No need to have an election. In 2020, they said Mr. Trump was going to win reelection. Of course, that didn't happen. And the elites have a tendency to be out of touch and they get these things wrong. And so, what the President has going for him is expanding the economy. He has got the deficit under control. He has got one big issue, which is the border issue.
