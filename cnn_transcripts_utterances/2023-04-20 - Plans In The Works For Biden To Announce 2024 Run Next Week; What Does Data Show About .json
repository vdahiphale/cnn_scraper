He's going to be -- you know, he very fond of anniversaries, fond of being sentimental, and it's going to be potentially on Tuesday, like I said, on the four-year anniversary of when he launched his 2020 campaign.So that's what we're all paying attention to. And I think it's really interesting. There's been a lot of debate behind the scenes about the timing for this. And I think one of the big questions was, does he wait to get into the race, because there is, I think, a benefit to focusing on his agenda and also staying above the fray when it comes to a lot of the Republican politics that are playing out. But at the same time, and I think the reason they're trying to announce as early as next week, is because they want to get this fundraising operation underway, and they really want to start energizing voters around him, especially those who are skeptical about his age and, and also whether he's progressive enough to continue in the White House.",

I know that the DNC is very involved in trying to make sure that his image is as great as it can be, and also to try and project to voters that Biden is still fit to serve an office, that he isn't too old, that he still is with it, which is some of the questions that I think have been plaguing his administration, so far over the last year and a half.And I do think that he's going to be leaning much harder into what we see as the traditional campaign stops, touting what he's been able to do while in office so far, and also trying to reach voters. And the same that we saw him do it on the 2020 -- 2020 campaign trail, which was the retail politicking that we know Biden is actually pretty good at the charm that he can use, I think we're going to see that be rolled out much earlier than people had anticipated.",

What I think he's looking forward to is perhaps trying to rev up more enthusiasm among the Democrats, right? It's not about the number of votes he necessarily will get in the primary. It's about the general election, and making sure that, hey, I have an 80 percent approval rating with Democrats, but they're not necessarily enthusiastic about my candidacy. When I face off against whoever the Republican nominee will be, is it just going to be enough that let's say the Republican nominee is Donald Trump, that they're going to come out because they hate Donald Trump so much?

Yet Joe Biden's approval rating is as steady as it goes in the low to mid 40s. Right where Donald Trump's approval rating was. And the difference between this campaign and that one is Joe Biden's favorable rating for much of that campaign was net positive. Now it's net negative.

Second, meet work deadlines. 56 percent, which is interesting, right? Because you might think working from home might make it more difficult to meet deadlines. But in fact, those who work from home say it makes it easier, the clear majority of them do. Of course, there is some disagreement between workers and their employer. So how many days a week should employees work at home? Well, the average among workers they say 2.2. But employers say 1.5 on average.

And there's a lot of focus on the learning loss during the Pandemic, there was an AP article today out of Georgia, talking -- focusing on that state or one school outside Atlanta that's trying to help third graders catch up. These are exactly kind of the age that lost out so much on some of the beginning fundamentals.These are children who may have missed class over zoom. I mean, try teaching a six or seven- year-old over Zoom, these -- these fundamentals, that's part of the problem. But it's bigger than that. It's something that goes way beyond that Pandemic, or stretches back, you know, a couple of decades. I'll tell you though, this is not something I was aware of until I began digging into this. There was this whole new way of teaching kids to read that I wasn't aware of. I don't know about you, but I learned to read on phonics, hooked on phonics. You know, you're -- you're learning letters you're learning with letters; combination makes -- what makes what sound. There's a whole new way that began to emerge in the 80s -- 90s, and really took hold in certain parts of the country all over the country. But not every single school, it was popular a lot of places. It's called balanced literacy. And it was this idea that kids should not be sounding out words, or they should sound out words, as a last resort. It's stunning. It's an idea that you should -- see that, see that on the left balance literacy, there's those concentric circles. Those are the cues that the children are supposed to use to try to guess the word. So, they're reading by guessing. And so, you'll have a sentence, there's some examples where they'll cover up the entire word. So, it's almost like fill in the blank, a six-year-old, a six- or seven-year- old, you're asking to fill in the blank, without even seeing the first letter of the word. They're meant to sort of deduce based on the context of the sentence what the word could be, but so many times that word could be so many things. Then maybe you see the first letter, and you began to say, OK, well, what letter, what words start with that letter. It's an odd way of teaching children how to read because so much of it relies on memorization. Of course, you memorize sight words, the kind of words that are hard to decode. Decoding is when you're spelling it out and sounding it out. But the thing is, you know, these, -- these teachers will tell you that children would read the same books over and over again. But if you gave them a new book they hadn't seen before, they would really struggle because you're not learning the actual tools to start out the word and also, you know, we were on the way to this, this shoot, we did today. We passed by a Wawa, there was a snickerdoodle. No one's going to ever guessed that. No one's ever going to guess it.

And the latest news is that Republicans are planning to put a bill on the floor to raise the debt limit for a year, or $1.5 trillion, whichever comes first next week.It's not a bill that will ever pass the Senate. But the whole point is to try to force the President to the negotiating table and try to figure out how they can come to an agreement before we reach that X date, when markets will freak out and the economy. You know, everyone, the uncertainty around the economy will send markets into a tizzy. And so, it's really fascinating to me that we're so close now, we're two months away, and that the bill that they're even putting on the on the floor next week isn't something that would ever pass into law.",

And, you know, the prosecutors say that they're looking into more charges because let's remember, there wasn't just her and her boyfriend.
