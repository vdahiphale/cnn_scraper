This is where he is going to enter his not guilty plea. That's what we expect him to do. He's going to go down and get processed by the U.S. Marshals and then we expect that he'll leave.Now, of course, we don't know how this will go down because the last time he was here a couple of months ago, it was also supposed to be a very brief hearing. It was his plea agreement and everything had been set up ahead of time and then, of course, it all fell apart spectacularly after the judge began asking questions about exactly what the terms of that deal were. Now, part of that deal was for a diversion agreement, whereby Hunter Biden would basically stay away from drugs, make sure he didn't buy any guns for two years, and then this gun charge would have gone away. That is no longer the case. He's facing three counts for purchasing a handgun back in 2018. Now, he owned this gun for only 11 days, but under federal law, it was a violation of federal law for him to possess that firearm because Hunter Biden has said that he was under the influence of drugs during that period. He was using drugs during that period, and so therefore it was technically a felony for him to buy that firearm. Now, we expect that Hunter Biden's attorneys are going to make the case that that diversion agreement should continue to stand. They're going to make the argument to the judge that this charge should not go forward. But, obviously, this is only the beginning for Hunter Biden because we expect that the special counsel, David Weiss, is also looking to bring charges against Hunter Biden for his tax, for failing to pay his taxes on time for a number of years. That could happen in the next couple of weeks, probably in Los Angeles or Washington, D.C. John?",

One thing that I had talked to advisers about was how they could actually work with the legal coverage and turn it into campaign coverage.If you'll remember his arrest in Georgia came the day after that Republican debate, the first Republican debate and immediately coverage started shifting to Trump's arrest in Georgia. And that was something that they noticed, took notice of and they realized that the legal stuff might play into the campaign stuff when it comes to actually publicizing these events. So, that is definitely a part of it. Now, I am told that Trump had fun yesterday, a source telling me that he had a good time in court, that he was happy with the end of the day when the judge said that some of the testimony from 2011 was a waste of his time. His legal advisers were also very happy with that. But also he is invested in this case. We can't take that away from the fact that, yes, he is using this for publicity. He did speak to the cameras multiple times. But he is also very invested in the fact that this is attacking his brand. Trump built an entire life, an entire brand, even before politics, on being a rich, successful businessman in New York. And part of his fame came from The Apprentice, which, again, was based on being a rich, successful businessman. So, to take this away in this case essentially is attacking the very person that Trump has built. It also attacks his political brand because this is how he has sold himself to voters across the country, both in 2016 and again this time, which essentially saying that I am so successful and I am so rich and I can do the same for you. And I hear that from voters saying that they believe that he can make the best deals because Donald Trump is the author of The Art of the Deal. This goes to that. That hits that very core of who Donald Trump is. So, he is in fact invested in this case and how it's going to play out.",

He said, if five Republicans join all the Democrats in this, then I'm out, right? And, yes, he's confident that he will be able to hang on, but he is keenly aware of where the numbers are at the moment on this. So, we await a word from the Democratic caucus as to how they are going to position themselves on this. But it certainly sounded to my ear, after hearing that there was, and Manu reported earlier, a conversation between Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, and the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, tell me if you guys disagree, but to my ear, Kevin McCarthy did not seem to think out of that conversation that he had a deal that the Democrats were going to save him.

He ruled that out. He said there's no surrender to liberals. I don't see how that could really work. So, what can he actually give Democrats? That is uncertain at this moment. And he's suggesting that perhaps there's not a whole lot he can give them. He's trying to make an institutional argument to Democrats saying that this is not good for the House for have this sort of instability. But a lot of Democrats don't simply trust Kevin McCarthy. He could simply vote for him to stay in power simply because of that argument and suggesting that he could also lose his job. He thinks he could stay in the job but he also said he might not be in the job anymore. So, he was really uncertain about whether he can actually stay there and what he can give Democrats to come along. Now, I can tell you, though, I've been spending all morning talking to Republicans coming in and out of this conference meeting. They are furious at Matt Gaetz because, virtually, all of them are in line with Kevin McCarthy, even though he has lost more than five Republican votes, enough to push him out of the speakership if all Democrats agree too also. And they're also bluntly concerned that this dysfunction and this chaos and this back and forth could cost them the Republican majority. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

He always looks to bring everyone together and realize that it's not about us, it's actually about governing for the American people, making sure that we're delivering on our promises. Look, we've said we want to secure the border. We said we want to bring fiscal responsibility. We said we wanted to bring good government reforms to the way this body runs. And he's doing those things. And the fact that one individual wants to do this motion to vacate, why, because we actually prevented a shutdown the other day because we averted a debt default a few months ago? I mean, he's fulfilling his promises to make sure we do this appropriations process the right way with 12 individual subject bills. We've done 4 out of the 12. The Senate have done none of those. But we need to move forward with this process, do the remaining eight. And this motion is certainly just a distraction.
