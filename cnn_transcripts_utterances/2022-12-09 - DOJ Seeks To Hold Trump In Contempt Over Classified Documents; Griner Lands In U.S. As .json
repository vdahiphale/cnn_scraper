A significant compromise here -- an athlete who was convicted for having less than a gram of hash oil in exchange for a notorious arms dealer who was convicted of conspiracy to kill Americans. Paul Whelan, a former Marine who has been in Russian custody for four years, was left out of the deal entirely. He remains in Russia, something he says he doesn't understand. We'll talk about whether or not Russia got the better end of the deal here with Mark Esper, the Defense secretary under President Trump. And that's really been a big question here -- is just how big of a compromise the U.S. was willing to make to get Brittney Griner back home. What is your sense of it? MARK ESPER, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AUTHOR, \"A SACRED OATH: MEMOIRS OF A SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DURING EXTRAORDINARY TIMES\":  Right. Well, first of all, Kaitlan, it's great that she's home. I'm happy for her and her family. But you can't help but be disappointed and sad for Paul Whelan and his family. And when you -- when you lay out, as you did in the lead-up here, Bout versus Griner, it just seems like a lopsided deal and it doesn't feel good. It feels -- the win feels a little hollow here.
