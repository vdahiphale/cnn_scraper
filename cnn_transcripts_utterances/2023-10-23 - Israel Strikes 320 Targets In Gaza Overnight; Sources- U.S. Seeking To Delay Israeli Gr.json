      "sentences": "Today on INSIDE POLITICS, panic, pain and fear of what's next. Israeli forces are ramping up airstrikes in response to Hamas terrorist attack, the barbaric attack in Israel just over two weeks ago. The IDF says, 320 quote terror targets were struck in Gaza overnight, including tunnels and operational command centers used by Hamas.New video from Gaza city shows the aftermath of those strikes this morning, whole streets reduced to rubble. As the humanitarian crisis deepens, sources tell CNN the White House is pushing for a pause on any ground incursion into Gaza. A move they hope will allow time to get much needed aid to Gaza and more hostages freed. Since Hamas released two American hostages on Friday, there is still hope that the 222 others kidnapped during the October 7 attack at Israel could go home too. The Biden administration is sidestepping questions about Israel's plans for the next phase against their war on Hamas. But they're working vigorously to try to stop it from spreading across the region. I want to bring in my colleague Jake Tapper, who is now in Tel Aviv. Jake, I know you just arrived, but what is the feeling right now on the ground?",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm in Tel Aviv, and it's just after 7 pm here, and I have to say it's very quiet. One of the reasons of course, is that fighting age men have been mobilized and are in the reserves and are around Gaza ready to invade, ready for that ground encouraging but encouraging.But also, of course, there is still -- it's only been two weeks in change since that horrific terrorist attack of October 7. There is still a sense of mourning, a sense of sadness in Israel. And beyond that, of course, a sense of anxiety be about what is going to happen next. How long is this ground incursion going to last? Will it be a matter of months? Will it be a matter of years? What will happen after that? Does this current government, the Netanyahu government that was in charge, of course on October 7. Do they have a strategy for the ground incursion and for what happens next? So, I would say it's quiet, it's more in full and a lot of anxiety. Dana?",

We know also that Hamas is clearly trying to delay a ground invasion by dangling that very possibility.I think what's clear is that while the Israelis are certainly willing to wait a few more days, perhaps, to launch this ground invasion. They are not going to delay it inevitably. Whether you look at the comments of the defense minister Gallant, or those of the IDF chief of staff. What is clear is that they will be going into Gaza. It is simply a matter of when at this point.",

      "sentences": "No. I mean, it couldn't be worse at this point. Although, there is a very small trickle of aid that is coming in. It's less than 4 percent of what normally comes into Gaza on a regular day when there is no official war that has been declared. So, it gives you some sense of what we would normally see.We've seen a somewhere in the number of 40 to 50 trucks that have been let in over the past few days. I do want to talk to you, though, about something that I think is a bit underreported. We talk a lot, of course about those who have been killed more than 5,000 according to the Palestinian health ministry there in Gaza, and the injured. We're talking about thousands injured, more than 10,000. But what we rarely hear from and talk about is the people who are caring from them, the doctors, the nurses. The doctors and nurses, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, who I spoke with overnight, told us that they are literally hungry that they don't have food. And so, they had to take a very dangerous trip, sending people from the south to the north, to try and give them some bread and something to drink as they are trying to care for these patients. They are in the north in those hospitals where about 60 percent of the hospitals are because the patients cannot be evacuated, and the doctors are refusing to leave even though Israel has said that the north needs to be evacuated. Now, I also talked to an Israeli spokesperson and ambassador who told me that Mark Regev, who told me that Israel would do its best to try not to impact, of course, the hospitals there. But there is a great amount of fear and exhaustion on the part of the doctors and nurses trying to care for so many people with some of the worst kinds of injuries from the airstrikes. We also should note that there is so much going on both in the north and the south here, that there is a real fear that this is going to turn into a regional complication. But the prime minister of Israel warning Lebanon, that if it does strike Israel, it will be hit very, very hard. Jake?",

And of course, we should always remind our viewers that the Palestinian Ministry of Health is controlled by Hamas, and anything they say Hamas is responsible and they were lying. Last Tuesday, when it came to their blaming of the hospital strike on the Israelis when it turned out, it was almost certainly caused by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Dana, back to you. BASHAs sources do tell CNN, his administration is working behind the scenes to delay a possible ground incursion in Gaza. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House.

What we've been hearing across this administration that there's a very real possibility that this war could expand beyond just Israel and Gaza, that other groups could get involved in or that other fronts could be opened up.And it's not just -- that concern doesn't just come from the potential for Iran to essentially order its proxies across the region, to start carrying out strikes against U.S. and Israeli targets, but really a reflection of the string of strikes that we've already seen over the course of the past week. In Iraq, in Syria, there was a missile attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility on Friday, that followed missiles and drones being launched by the Iranian backed Houthis in Yemen. Those were launched north in the direction of Israel. They had to be taken down by a U.S. destroyer. So, this is a very real fear at this point. This is what Secretary Austin had to say on Sunday.

But also, that they would be very well equipped to respond if need be. So, we now have these two carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean.But what we also heard from the secretary there, was that they're sending more air defense batteries, including patriot missile batteries, to the region to help with air defense to help protect U.S. positions, U.S. troops in the region. And Secretary Austin also said that more troops are being put on, what are called prepared to deploy orders. So, these are very significant moves by the Pentagon, as we wait for this imminent Israeli incursion, which could prompt a wider conflict, Dana?",

You've heard Alex Marquardt talking about U.S. resources, additional resources moving to the region.Based on your experience, how much of a deterrent do you think that the mere presence of more U.S. military troops and so forth in the region will be for Hezbollah, and even for Iran which backs Hezbollah?",

I think the fact that there are two U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups, one with the USS Ford, the other one with the USS Eisenhower, those two groups do send a significant message. And that is probably the principal power projection arm of the United States in this conflict, because it's something new that's been added to the dynamic of the force postures of the various nations that have bases in and around the middle east.The other thing, of course, is the aerial component to the fact that we've got several more aircraft, fighter aircraft going in over the last few weeks, F-15, F-16, A-10s, being redeployed into the middle eastern region. And so that means that the combat power that is at our disposal has gone up considerably. And it should be a deterrent to anyone who's been at the receiving end of U.S. military power. The other part, of course, Dana, is the air defense component. The fact that we've got two (Inaudible) patriots coming in, but also the high-altitude capability known as that, that is actually being deployed to various locations throughout the middle east. So that gives protection to U.S. forces as well as to Israel. And that is a key component, i.e., include limit the responses from Iran and Hezbollah.",
