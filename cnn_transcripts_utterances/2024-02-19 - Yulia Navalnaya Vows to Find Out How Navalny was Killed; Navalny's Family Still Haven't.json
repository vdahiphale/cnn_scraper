Yulia Navalnaya met with E.U. foreign ministers this morning. She also posted a new video online promising to find out who carried out the alleged crime.A spokesperson says Navalny's mother and lawyer were denied access to this morgue where his body is allegedly being held. Officials say Navalny died Friday after losing consciousness after a walk. But his cause of death and exact location of his body remain a mystery at this hour. CNN's Matthew Chance is joining us now from Moscow. Matthew, the Kremlin has said that an investigation is underway.

But first, let me show you these scenes that have been unfolding throughout the course of the past several days here in Moscow and in other towns and cities across the country. It's not massive crowds, but we're seeing a steady stream of Russians come to one of these makeshift memorials for Alexei Navalny to lay flowers to pay their respects.You see some people putting the flowers down now. There's a photograph there of Alexei Navalny. This lady has just lit that candle. And all of these people that have laid one or two roses here, that's a sign. That's a sign of just how much grief and anger there is in this country about the death of the country's most prominent opposition leader. Remember, even making a protest like this, or showing sympathy like this in this country, is basically against the regulations and people run a risk. And hundreds of people, according to rights monitoring groups in this country, about 400 people in fact, have been detained for doing just this. There are pictures of people being dragged through these snowy parks from monuments up and down the country trying to lay flowers but they've been taken away by the authorities. Now, you mentioned about the whereabouts of the body. It's still a big question mark hanging over this latest scandal to befall Russia. And we just don't know where it is. Look, the mother of Alexei Navalny, Lyudmila, she's traveled to thousands of miles to the far north inside the Arctic Circle to the area of his penal colony where he died, to the local town to go to the morgue there to try and recover the remains of her son. But first of all, she was told that the body wasn't there. Now, she's been told that the authorities are going to keep the body for an indefinite period to carry out more tests, to do more postmortems, to try and establish what was the cause of death on Friday at that penal colony of Alexei Navalny. Now, Alexei Navalny's supporters, these anti-corruption teams, saying that's just a ruse. That's an attempt by the Kremlin to hide the body of Alexei Navalny and to hide the cause of, you know, what caused him to suddenly die in that way. And so, there's a great deal of suspicion amongst everybody here, as well as grief and anger across the whole country as people mourn the death of Alexei Navalny. Sara.",

Where Russia just made its most significant advance in nearly a year.Russian soldiers raising their flag over a key town in the eastern front. You see video of it right here. Ukrainian troops forced to retreat from the town of Avdiivka this weekend. A place that they've been fighting to hold from Russia's grip for a decade now. President Biden blaming congressional inaction on this major setback for Ukraine and also warning that this may not be the last. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Ukraine right now for us.

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, ultimately, I think it is potentially a symbol of a wider problem Ukraine may face across its front lines because of the fact that they're still waiting for that $60 billion and Congress has taken two weeks off, is unlikely to get to them anytime soon. And we've already seen an impact in terms of ammunition, stocks and morale.And it may be that Avdiivka, strategically quite important as it is, it is part of a railway hub, and that's always something the Russians want to get their hands on. And it's also been something that Ukraine's held on to for a decade, as you said, since the first invasion back in 2014. Really, though, I think the pain being felt by Ukrainians over having to withdraw or announce their withdrawal on Saturday is that it may herald a starker change in their fortunes on the battlefield. Avdiivka itself heavily fought over, over the past months. Russia quite clear was willing to throw almost anything at it. And indeed, President Zelenskyy at the Munich Security Conference at the weekend suggested that for every dead Ukrainian, there were seven dead Russians. We can't substantiate that ourselves, but it's a sign, potentially, of the tactics Russia have been using and may continue to use as well. Because the news is frankly bad at multiple points across the frontline, not just Avdiivka, which is already lost. There may be villages around that, which potentially Russia pushes towards. There's bad news from Zaporizhzhia region, Robotyne, which was one of the key villages taken in part of the counteroffensive in the summer. That's under Russian assault, it seems Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself traveled to Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region. That's also under Russian pressure. There are concerns around Bakhmut, which was another key place the Russians fought tooth and nail for back in last year. The last major significant gain they had was taking that town back in May. And other concerns to the south of Avdiivka as well that the Russians may push forward there too because Ukraine is running out of ammunition. They're struggling to replenish their ranks too, and I think there is a feeling as well that while Western support was so solid for the first two years of this war, as we enter into the third year, coming up at the end of this week, we may be seeing the billions simply drying up and Ukraine losing people and ground because of it.

If the money if -- well, if the supplies aren't delivered and if they aren't delivered quickly, there is no debating the fact that there will be continued withdrawals from the front line. There will be continued losses, there will be continued Ukrainian deaths. That is a given. You can't debate that because that's what happens on the battlefield when you don't get supplied with ammunition.And Russia is smelling this. They have learned much over the last two years and they are now starting to attack these locations to spread Ukraine thin, to continue to conduct these air attacks against Ukrainian cities to not just kill Ukrainian soldiers, but to attack the Ukrainian population. And remember, you know, we're talking about hostages in Israel right now. Russia has thousands of hostages of Ukraine -- Ukrainian hostages inside of Russia that they've kidnapped, too. So, these kinds of war crimes that Russia continues to produce are all based on the fact that Ukraine has not been able to counter their punches recently, for the last four months or so, while we've delayed on this additional funding for Ukrainian aid. And truthfully, it's not just Ukraine. As everyone has been saying, it will affect more and more within NATO, within the European alliance, and it will affect the security of the United States if this continues to be delayed.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, for the U.S. military confirming that it did conduct five strikes against targets in Houthi held territory inside Yemen, three anti-ship cruise missiles, one surface drone boat and one underwater drone, something that the U.S. military says this is the first time they have seen the Houthis use this kind of essentially submarine drone since the group started ramping up its attacks on commercial shipping and U.S. naval vessels in the fall.That said, we haven't been given a lot of details about this system yet, so we don't, at this point, have a great sense of how the U.S. military identified this target, how many of these systems the Houthi militants might have, how they acquired them, who might have provided them, whether this was something that Iran provided or whether this is an indigenous technology, and what the specific threat could be to both commercial shipping and American naval vessels. Certainly, one would presume that an underwater vessel would be more difficult to detect and destroy. So, this could be a shift in strategy by the Houthis because they haven't yet been successful in actually striking a U.S. naval vessel, although they have had some near misses. But overall, the strikes that the U.S. military has carried out over on Saturday and also on Friday, part of a broader series of retaliatory strikes that the U.S. military has been conducting in response to these Houthi attacks. The question is, does it have the impact that they are looking for in deterring further strikes on shipping? So far, it doesn't look like it.",

It's embarrassing to me that the singer, the lead singer of U2, Bono, has had more to say about the death of Alexei Navalny than the leading presumptive Republican nominee and many of the Republican elected officials.It's embarrassing that one of the leading journalists of -- you know, for the right, Tucker Carlson, has been in Russia in recent weeks, kowtowing to Vladimir Putin, sucking up to him. And when asked last week, before the death of Alexei Navalny, why he hadn't asked Vladimir Putin about assassinations, why he hadn't asked about Alexei Navalny, what was Tucker Carlson's response? Every leader kills people. Some kill more than others. Leadership requires killing people. No. Leadership requires condemning the death of Alexei Navalny. Courage requires condemning the death of Alexei Navalny. It requires saying his name. It requires bringing up Ukraine aid for a vote.

He tweeted in 2023, Joe Biden, visiting Ukraine is a slap in the face to every American, especially the people of East Palestine and Ohio. You remember there was a train wreck there. Ukraine is not our friend. And Russia is not our enemy. And then you, of course, have Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's made no bones about saying all manner of things when it comes to Russia. She said, Democrats have been calling Republican President Trump and his supporters Nazis since 2015. But the Dems have been funding actual Nazis since the Obama-Biden administration, funding the neo-Nazis in Ukraine only stopped under President Trump.These are just a couple of people who have lots of negative things to say about Ukraine and lots of positive things to say about Putin. What's happened to the Republican Party here, in this particular wing that you hear both Ana Navarro and Liz Cheney talking about? KEITH BOYKIN, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE AID, AUTHOR, \"WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT RACE?\" AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Yes, I think that Liz Cheney is exactly right. We now have a Vladimir Putin- wing of the Republican Party. And that's happened because of Donald Trump, because of his complicity with Vladimir Putin, and also because Republicans who are in positions of leadership have failed to exercise any sort of real courage in standing up to Donald Trump. I'm glad that Nikki Haley is belatedly starting to make her case, but she spent months really tiptoeing around Donald Trump as well. And that's been part of -- you have a group of people who are part of this right-wing, super right-wing MAGA base who never really represented the Republican values of Ronald Reagan even, as Ana Navarro mentioned. I think what's happening ultimately, Sara, is that the embrace of Trump reflects the collapse of I called -- what used to be called the so-called three-legged stool in the Republican Party. It used to be the national security conservatives who wanted a strong defense, the social conservatives who wanted traditional family values and morality, and the economic conservatives who wanted fiscal responsibility. But Trump has undermined all three of those three -- all three of those things. He's undermined national security by supporting Vladimir Putin and defending the insurrections in this country, undermining the party's traditional family values as a serial liar and playboy billionaire who's been adjudicated a sexual assaulter, and undermine the idea of fiscal responsibility by coming in with six bankruptcies and adding $8 trillion of debt to the federal government. So, the idea that Donald Trump represents traditional American values or traditional family values or even traditional Republican values is contradictory to even what the Republican Party had once said that it believed in. If Barack Obama or a Democrat or a black candidate had the same record as Donald Trump, they would never be taken seriously. They'd be laughed out of the -- of any sort of national discourse. And they would never be able to -- never be allowed to say inflammatory comments, condemning the United States and praising a foreign dictator. That's how far the Republican Party is falling.",
