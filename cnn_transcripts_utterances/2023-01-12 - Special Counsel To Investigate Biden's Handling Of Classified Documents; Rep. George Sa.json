Just a few days after that, he tapped Jack Smith to handle the Trump investigation, so it clearly had special counsels on the brain. On January 5th, it is recommended to him by the U.S. attorney that he should indeed appoint a special counsel and within a week he found someone. It's a very short list of people who are qualified, never mind willing to do this. He found Robert Hur and he appears to be from central casting. I spoke with Rod Rosenstein, his former boss, obviously the former deputy attorney general.

I mean, the existence of a special counsel for Trump necessitated that one would need to be in place here because of the perception problems. And I think that there's probably a special counsel for Trump perhaps only because Trump is already a candidate for the next election and could face Biden again. So, that political layer is never going to go away. I do think right now there are some real questions about this timeline that was laid out by the attorney general and why, in my mind -- I don't understand why the Biden camp didn't do the searches earlier. Why did it take even until December 20th to find that second batch of documents? Why were they finding documents today? There's a limited universe of places where these documents could be and one could imagine that those searches could have been executed pretty much immediately after the first set of documents were found. So, it's just some of the unanswered questions. You saw the press secretary today basically cueing to this statement that she had written on a piece of paper and saying that they were following the book.

They're giving the documents back. They're not trying to hold on to them. That is a key fact.

So, they have an enormous amount of evidence that they're going through as they decide whether or not to bring charges.This is a much more complicated investigation now. Not only are they dealing with January 6th, looking into that, they're also looking into Mar-a-Lago, not only the potential mishandling of classified information but also this question of cooperation and potential obstruction. It is a very complicated investigation. And as we know, Jack Smith was abroad for most of the past two months. He's back in the U.S. getting his office set up. But time is of the essence.

NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes. I mean, he can say that because he is someone who fabricates complete identities. So, he's fabricated an identity of somebody who lived an honest life and we know that that is not true. He has fabricated a whole different scenarios and college degrees and jobs as well. And so I think this is going to be a continuing problem for Republicans. They're going to continue to get questions about him. But if you're George Santos, you have every reason to hold on to this job. He stands to make something like $400,000 over the next two years as a member of Congress, that's a prestigious job.

The Kremlin spokesman hailed the enormous effort in Soledar but says the main work is still ahead.It will only get tougher. For the first time since the war began, Ukraine will soon have tanks, after Poland agreed to send the German- made leopards. Germany and the U.K. are mulling the same decision. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on camera):  And, Wolf, this is pretty remarkable. The Russian mercenary group, Wagner, says not only did they capture all of Soledar, they did it without any help at all from regular Russian troops. Now, the reality is that the battle may still be raging but, frankly, it is not looking good for the Ukrainians. We've been in touch with one soldier who was in Soledar, who says that his unit feels abandoned. They are pinned down. They have no food. They are running out of water and their window to actually evacuate or withdraw is closing very fast. In fact, it may have closed already. And, Wolf, this is the very same soldier who just two days ago said that Ukrainian withdrawal was only a matter of time.",

He views it as a mortal threat to Russia.Now, we in the United States, we may prefer to look at China, we're forming special committee in Congress to look at China but this is the war that's going on right now. And if Gerasimov comes in, pulls things together, maybe uses nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons to get a breakthrough in Luhansk, believe me, all eyes are going to be back on Ukraine. And at that point, it's too late to do the big surge of equipment in there to help the Ukrainians. We need to be really looking at this closely right now.

It's really important that whatever has occurred here with the presence of classified documents in President Biden's possession that it be investigated impartially and fully so that we understand what happened.

And it doesn't really matter how classified it is. If it's classified, it means that its disclosure could classify the national security of the United States. So, whether it's in Mar-a- Lago or in Wilmington, Delaware, we've had cases obviously where formerly CIA directors have been found to be mishandling classifies information, that needs to stop. That's not a partisan statement. It needs to stop.Now, that's -- of course, there's pretty important distinctions between what the White House is dealing with and what the previous president dealt with. You know, the White House, upon the discovery of the documents apparently in the two locations, has handled this precisely right, by disclosing the fact, by saying, we've got this stuff at Mar-a-Lago, not only did they not disclose, but they so resisted the Department of Justice in their attempts to recover that information that ultimately agents had to basically knock down the door to get the stuff. So, there are some pretty substantial differences between the two cases. But the bottom line is classified information should not be outside of secure spaces.",

This tornado watch you can see shaded in red goes for the next hour or two across the Southeast. You can see right around Charlotte, we did have a tornado warning just on the north side of Charlotte, a few moments ago. That has expired. Now we have another one basically in Columbia.So, anyone basically in the Southeast, on the eastern side of these storms, if you see one of these tornado warnings in your area, you've got to get to your safe place. These storms are moving incredibly fast, about 55 miles per hour, so you'll have very little warning. So consider this your warning there are some very dangerous storms across the Southeast. You can see these severe thunderstorm warnings. You can see all the way across southern portions of Alabama and Georgia. Here's your severe weather risk -- the area shaded in orange, that's going to be your highest risk for tornados, damaging winds, large hail. But we really could see showers and storms anywhere in these areas, and they even extend all the way up to the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. So the rain is going to be far reaching. As we go into the overnight hours the storms should weaken and start to clear out tomorrow. Some very cold air on the backside of this, Wolf. You can see some snow flurries there, but we're also going to see rain accumulations of anywhere from 1 to 2 inches, inside of those individual thunderstorms you can get some higher rates.
