And there is no sign that Republicans are going to be able to settle on one anytime soon.Kevin McCarthy is going to come up short a fourth time. That's the vote we're watching right now. The hardline opposition of about 20 rebels backing Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida this go-around. This vote is playing out as we're seeing quite an interesting split screen moment. On the left side of your screen, you see, Senator -- Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who is at an event in Kentucky with President Biden. They are talking about the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was only passed because of Democrats and Republicans working together. And now you see on the screen, a place where bipartisanship is not happening, in fact, barely partisanship when it comes to Republicans. CNN is tracking everything as it happens vote by vote. Let's start with CNN's Lauren Fox. Lauren, Kevin McCarthy's allies are frustrated. Are they suggesting that they know of any path out of this, any way to pick off 15 of these 30 -- 20 rebels?",

He probably has another 24 hours to get an agreement. If he can't negotiate to get an agreement on speaker, it means he won't be able to negotiate and get to 218 on anything controversial. Maybe nobody else can either, but he certainly can't. This person said he hopes that McCarthy can get there. But just to remind people back home, there is so much left to do for Republicans, if they're going to have this majority. If they're going to actually be able to govern, they're going to have to pass a debt ceiling at some point. They're going to have to pass other controversial bills. When it comes to any disaster aid, a spending bill, a farm bill, all of those issues have really bedeviled Republicans in the past, Jake. It just shows that even if McCarthy can emerge, he may not have much support left.",

The House is completely paralyzed right now because they cannot conduct any other business until they elect a speaker. So what that means is committees can't hire new staff, let alone start watching investigations or writing bills or passing bills. We don't even know who some of the chairs are going to be of these committees.And meanwhile, I'm told that some of these new member offices, the staffers can't even log into their computers yet. Of course, you have the new members who haven't been sworn in yet. No members have been sworn in yet. And these poor families have been dragged to Washington, you have kids that were pulled out of school. And they're just sort of stuck in this wait and see moment. And then perhaps most problematic, if by January 13, this not -- is not resolved, the committee's can't continue to pay their staff or pay out student loan payments. So there are real practical implications here. And as Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican told CNN a little bit ago, he said, we have one of our three branches of government offline right now. That is a very dangerous thing for our country. So just a reminder about the practical implications of retracted fight, Jake.",

As one of your -- one of your panelists said earlier, this is a -- this is really showing the weakness of a president Trump endorsement right now.

And you see next to Congressman Gallagher, I believe that's Scott Perry from Pennsylvania, and there are other members. That seems to be a mix of pro-McCarthy and anti-McCarthy votes. Owe to have a microphone in there. But once again, the reason that we're seeing some of these incredible shots, I believe, is because there are no rules because there is not a Speaker of the House.

Other lawmakers are watching her very closely heading into this vote. She ended up not voting at all initially when the roll call went through her name. And then you saw in the end, she ended up voting present after some of McCarthy's top allies had been talking to her seemingly, trying to work her on the floor.Now, this present vote, it doesn't really do much to change things for McCarthy. It doesn't alter the threshold as of right now, but it is not a good sign for McCarthy. It's moving away from him. She went from a previous vote of supporting McCarthy now into the present camp, which suggests she is still very much on the fence. And something to know about Victoria Spartz, is that she is weighing a Senate bid in Indiana. If she does launch a bid in Indiana, she's likely going to have to fight through a tough Republican primary in a red state. She could be up against Jim Banks who's also weighing a bid. He's got the backing of Donald Trump. So that could be part of her calculation here. And also something else notable is that she was at one of these forums in November about rules changes that Andy Biggs, one of the McCarthy critics, was holding when he was trying to get a number of these concessions and laying out what the Freedom Caucus wants. So even though she's not a member of the Freedom Caucus, there are signs that she had been thinking about the McCarthy vote very, very hard. Victoria Spartz, Congresswoman Republican from Indiana, who also is the only Ukrainian born member of the U.S. Congress. Kevin McCarthy put her out there front and center back when he was supporting or more supportive, more strongly supportive of the American efforts to help Ukrainian government.

There -- if you want to know a closed process, all you had to do is work under the rules of Speaker Pelosi over the last -- over the last couple of years. We saw a very top-down approach.

DAVE JOYCE (R-OH): They're up to 20 and a half, I guess, with a present vote. It's amazing what primaries do for folks and their voting records here. But the shame of it is that nothing's changed. And the positions that were just being laid out by Congressman Davis are absolutely correct. This is going be the most open Congress ever. These rules are all agreed to. And the ultimatums that were delivered again yesterday at the last minute, those are things that the speaker doesn't even have the ability to deliver. That's a steering committee assignments that have to take place. And so there's been discussions but no real movement. And so, you know, I haven't been involved in this for the month and a half before we got back here on January 2nd. I can tell you that this group does not want to get to Kevin.
