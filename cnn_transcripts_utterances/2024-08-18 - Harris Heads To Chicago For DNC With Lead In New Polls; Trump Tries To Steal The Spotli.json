He has struggled to land an effective attack against Harris, tried different nicknames, his latest one is trying to paint her as a communist. And he wrote this today, she's a communist, has always been a communist, and will always be a communist, after posting what appears to be an A.I. generated image of a woman standing at a podium during a communist rally.

What really matters is what's happening in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Nevada, and some of the other swing states.And there, she actually is reversing what had been losses, what had been serious losses, and it's those losses in those key swing states, seven or eight swing states, that had sparked panic within the Democratic Party where the strategies were saying, we can't turn this around and we've been outspending Republicans five to one, 10 to one in some cases in some of the swing states, and we're just barely staying even.

When asked that question, Donald Trump said he'll be my personal envoy. But no one has ever been able to really define that since.The best available evidence is that now that the campaign is starting to really grow and turn into a general election posture, they transferred a bunch of staffers from the Republican National Committee down to Palm Beach County. They need to just start executing, not planning anew, bot executing on their plans that they've already made. And Lewandowski will help with that as sort of an office linebacker. The real hire that the campaign made that should be paid more attention to was Taylor Budowich, who's an adviser of Trump's for a long time, has very good relationships with him, with the campaign, and with J.D. Vance. And Budowich is really going to be playing a large role that a lot of attention hasn't been paid to.

I've seen individual data that says it's crested in these swing states. We'll see where this ends up. But I think from our standpoint survive is probably the best word. You've never seen this much media coverage. Somebody in politics getting nearly five weeks of positive media coverage because I will point out, remember at the start of this, Kamala Harris was the most unpopular VP in American history. And all she did in that time is make 1800 phone calls to Dem insiders to get the nomination, and that's what changed it? No, it's the media sort of pushing the reset.

And so, no, this happens and folks will remember that and keep moving.I think what's more important here is the macro economy. You can keep talking about policies, have a little reset. The macro economy under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in pretty good shape. You got prices, inflation that's coming down, you have wages that are going up faster than inflation. You've got job growth, you've got unemployment down. You got all these things and the Trump plan is tariffs, universal tariffs.

He's the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri and is also a DNC delegate. He is not uncommitted. He does support Kamala Harris. Mayor, I appreciate your time, though, and I am curious when you hear some of these uncommitted delegates and people may remember obviously in the primaries it was the ability to vote uncommitted, which many people did to register their frustration with the Biden administration's policy on the Israel-Gaza War. But now you hear these delegates saying, look, we represent 740,000 voters and we are still not sold. What do you say to them now? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D), KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: I think what you just heard is one step that the vice president is communicating that she is sympathetic, that she's looking to get to a solution. This is not some rigid resistance to making sure that there is humanitarian relief for everyone involved in the situation, but it is saying that she is going to take the time, to make sure that everyone feels heard.

And somebody else were going to be hearing from tomorrow is Hillary Clinton. She of course, eight years ago accepted the Party's nomination for the presidency in Philadelphia before month later, losing the election to Donald Trump. I spoke with somebody who is familiar with her thinking and they told me that tomorrow night she is going to be talking about the proverbial glass ceiling that she couldn't fully shatter eight years ago and what she believes is possible, once Kamala Harris does. Now, those two women have actually been in touch regularly, I am told since President Biden dropped out and actually, Hillary Clinton was one of the first phone calls that the vice president made that Sunday that the president dropped out but, Erin, it's really interesting talking to some of the convention planners. They basically have told me that that change at the top of the ticket from President Biden to Vice President Harris, basically happened just in the nick of time.   A lot of the sort of infrastructure, it was already fully baked in , including the set design that you see behind me. But some of those final details that you see executed just in the final weeks heading into a convention, they hadn't actually happened yet, for example, just even the printing of the Biden-Harris signs, I should say, and some of the videos that were going to see this week, most of them had not been recorded yet is what I'm being told by convention planners.
