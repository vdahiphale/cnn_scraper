The much anticipated truce between Israel and Hamas is now set to being on Friday at 7 a.m. Israel Standard Time. That's also the same time in Gaza, which computes to midnight Eastern Time in the United States. The first hostages, 13 women and children, will be released tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock Israel Standard Time. That's 9 a.m. in Eastern Time. The announcement was made by Qatar's Foreign Ministry a short time ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We are hopeful. I don't know if I should say confident, but we are very hopeful. And as I said, the commitment we have seen from both sides leads us to be very positive, to deal with this very positively. We are seeing a good level of commitment over the agreement itself, the details hashed out with you. It's the first glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel of this crisis. And this is why we needed to succeed and we are hoping and working towards it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The other issue, of course, with the truce is the aid that is going to go in. At least 200 trucks, lorries will be admitted per day. And a large convoy of those -- of that aid is now on standby. It's at the Rafah, Egypt-Gaza border crossing. As the truce begins, then they will move in.CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv. Lots to get through. We'll take it at a fair clip, Oren. The first thing, this -- the continuation of military activity, I'm being deliberately precise here, that can continue for another 13 hours. And by all accounts, Israel and Hamas are going to go the bejeebers (ph) until the last possible minutes. OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And Richard, that's frankly what happens here before a cessation of hostilities, and that's not just this round of fighting. We've seen it before in previous rounds. Even the shorter ones, there is fighting up until the last moment, and that's very much what we're seeing. The IDF even said, we are continuing until we receive an order to stop.

It's mediated the release of the Iranian hostage -- the American hostages in Iran recently, Afghanistan, Sudan. He said, of all the mediation they've done, this has been really very hard, because there is no trust at all between the two parties. So, they got it to this point.

So, in other words, what I'm saying is, for Hamas, this is a time where they can work with the other hostage takers because we know that in addition to Hamas groups like the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, they have also some of the hostages and there are other groups as well, potentially even criminal gangs that have some of them. So, Hamas, at least after this first group of hostages, is going to have to work with these other groups in order to actually have hostages to release.
