These are life changing allegations. Every indictment is. But there's also a forfeiture provision in here. So irrespective of whether he's detained or he's out, if he's convicted on this -- and it's an indictment, which is a mere allegation, this has to be proven in court to be clear.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the fruit display. At the checkout. In the street. Hard to overstate the psychological impact of hundreds of blasts across Lebanon. Mostly in Hezbollah areas. Pagers exploding at about 3:30 according to the group. Security forces asking Lebanese to stay off the road so the sheer volume of emergency vehicles could get to hospital. Nearly 3,000 patients. At least 170 critical. Easily the most widespread moment of violence to hit across Lebanon since the 2006 war with Israel, who Hezbollah is now firmly blaming for these new attacks on their TV channel. We blame the Israeli enemy with full responsibility, the TV anchor said, for this criminal attack that also harms civilians. Israel themselves declined to claim the attack. To blame? Perhaps these tiny devices, according to posts on social media CNN can't verify. The race now to work out how. Was it just one type of device? A cyber attack? A battery bomb? Did they just hit Hezbollah areas? It comes at yet another critical time. Monday, Israel's defense minister hinted, meeting the U.S. envoy, that the time for a diplomatic solution of how to get tens of thousands of Israelis home to the war-plagued north, but mostly past, than a military option is all that remains. The hope had been for calm after the death of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, also killed in a violation of Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut, led to great fury but minimal fire. With Hezbollah's retaliation restrained, perhaps by pre-emptive Israeli strikes, many felt the moment of conflagration had passed. Now it seems back again, with Hezbollah once more under pressure to hit back hard. But only because another sophisticated attack has made them look weak. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London.

So they kind of went more analogue using these pagers thinking that that way they would be harder to hack which may well be the case, but the Israelis seem to have found a way, a workaround to get to them anyway. So yes, it will disrupt the communications, you've probably got a large number of fighters.They were estimated to have about 100,000 fighters so even if all, you know, 2,800 or so of those injured or the majority were fighters, that's still, you know, a relatively small percentage of Hezbollah's overall military strength. But no doubt this will have disrupted their communications, it will have sown chaos, it will have injured many fighters as well. And as you say, they are talking about retaliation. Indeed, we've heard from Hezbollah in a statement on Tuesday evening saying that the criminal and treacherous enemy -- that's Israel from their perspective -- will definitely receive a fair punishment for this sinful assault both in ways that are expected and unexpected. Now what could that retaliation entail? Well, it could include barrages of rockets, missiles and drones being fired at Israel en masse, perhaps together with other Iranian proxies, or perhaps they would go down the route that they did in the 90s. And I recall the bombing of the Jewish Cultural Center in Argentina in 1994, the AMIA, and also the Israeli Embassy in that same city, Buenos Aires, two years earlier.
