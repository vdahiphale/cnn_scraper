Several members of Congress and their families have been on the receiving end of dangerous rhetoric. And in some cases, we know that it's led to physical violence -- of course, look no further than the assault of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GINGRAS (voice-over):  Prosecutors are accusing a Michigan man of threatening to kill a California congressman and FBI Dir. Christopher Wray. According to an indictment on November 5, Capitol Police were made aware of threatening voicemails left for Democratic Congressman John Garamendi. The accused, Neil Matthew Walter, allegedly said in the message, \"John -- hey, John. You're gonna die, John. You're gonna die.\" REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA):  It's just all of the hate talk that's readily available on all of the social media platforms. It incites people to these kinds of violent threats and violent action. GINGRAS (voice-over):  In comments posted on the live stream of Wray's testimony before Congress last week, Walter allegedly wrote, \"I will kill you, Director Wray. You will die. I will kill you in self- defense.\" Court documents allege Walter's Facebook posts had numerous comments stating beliefs about a conspiracy theory that elected politicians and government officials, Tom Cruise, and Elon Musk are involved in a child slave rape ring. One location for where this ring purportedly took place, the U.S. Capitol. On November 8, federal authorities reached out to Michigan police to perform a welfare check. According to court documents, during the encounter, Walter refused to put down his handgun and said \"...he would defend himself against the U.S. government.\" Last week, the Democratic-led Senate Homeland Security Committee released a report finding that the department and FBI are not adequately addressing domestic terrorism. Wray testified to the threat before the committee last year.",

And I think you've seen other lawyers say that they are going to chase Jones to the end of the Earth to get him to pay up this money. They've been waiting a long time. These cases have been years in the making. And so, they will battle him in court for a few more years probably because he's going to do everything he can to delay this.
