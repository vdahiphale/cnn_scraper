Stop the legislative process for a few weeks. Let the talks at the Israeli president's house commence. But so far we have not yet heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There were reports - he was supposed to give a speech a few hours ago announcing that he's going to freeze the legislation, but yet it's been hours since those reports come out.

The vast majority of Apple products that you and I used today are manufactured there. So, China's a critical, critical market for Apple.But, you're right, there's a huge, you know, shift right now happening between the us and China on the software side because of the Chinese expectations around content moderation, censorship, propaganda. We're running into real tensions around apps that, you know, leverage content. Things like TikTok. That does not seem to hold as well when it comes to the argument around labor and manufacturing.

Police say the victim had minor injuries to her head and neck. In a statement, Majors' attorney is saying this, Jonathan Majors is completely innocent and is probably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows. All the evidence proves that Mr. Majors is entirely innocent and did not assault her whatsoever. Unfortunately, this incident came about because this woman was having an emotional crisis for which she was taken to the hospital yesterday. We expect these charges to be dropped soon. The U.S. Army is even pulling its ads featuring Majors. It's pulling them off of the air. So, joining us now, the host of \"Boston Globe Today,\" Segun Oduolowu. Good morning to you, Segun. So, you point out that this will matter most in the court of public opinion. What does this do to his career? He's now -- you know, he's in major movies. They're now pulling ads. At least one ad, the U.S. Army, off of the air. Regardless of the legal outcome, what does this mean? SEGUN ODUOLOWU, HOST, \"BOSTON GLOBE TODAY\": Well, Don, first, thank you for having me. Unfortunately, it's under these types of circumstances. You know, for too long women weren't heard, let alone believed. And so when an allegation like this comes in, our reaction now is to listen and try as much as possible to distance ourselves from the entity. And in this case, Jonathan Majors. We don't have all of the facts in, right, but you see what the advertisers, the Army, are doing because the allegations are so serious. And I think that because of where we were before, and where we currently are now, where any story, credible or until proven otherwise, we have to give it the, you know, the weight that it deserves. So the Army has pulled ads. Remember, Jonathan Majors is in two of the highest grossing films of this year, \"Creed Three\" and \"Antman and the Wasp.\" So, his career was on a tremendous upswing. And for this to come and potentially derail it, we -- you know, it's going to be a fight, you know, no pun intended, because he was in \"Creed,\" but it's going to be a fight to get it back on track. I am asking and hoping that we will be patient. Let all of the facts come in. Because the court of public opinion is very different than the court of law. And if you go online, you are already hearing all types of stories, you know, that described him as an angel and stories that describe ride him as the devil. So, we need to be patient. We need to let all of the facts come in as best they can. But, a tragedy has happened. A woman was either assaulted for whatever reason. She was hospitalized. An accusation was made. He was arrested. He was released. His lawyer is claiming that they have evidence that will prove his innocence. And we should let all of that come in. We were too quick with knee jerk reactions when it was Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and Johnny Depp was pulled from movie franchises until the court trial and tapes came in. So, if there is evidence that proves Jonathan Majors did not do this, then let it come out and let his name be clean. But I still say this court of public opinion, they don't play by any rules. Stay off Twitter, stay off Instagram, because what you're going to get is conjecture.",
