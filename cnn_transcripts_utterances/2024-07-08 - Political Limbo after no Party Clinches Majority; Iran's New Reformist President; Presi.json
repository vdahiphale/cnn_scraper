And of course, they've in the past been famously competitive and fractured, and unable to come together so significant that they did, but what has been their strength in these elections now is going to be their weakness. It's going to be very difficult for them, Isa, to figure out which of them gets to choose the Prime Minister, because the balance of power is such that it's not immediately obvious. The Socialist were you hoping it's there, man, the far left while you're being assaulted men are shown. And to each of them, the suggestions of the other are likely to prove unacceptable or certainly difficult. So, extremely difficult negotiations that are taking place behind the scenes.

So this was a widespread attack, mainly targeting cities, extremely deadly. And according to several officials, including the defense minister was targeting people during the morning rush hour. So as you said, we're used to seeing these overnight missile barrage is this, was in broad daylight. And the most shocking images we're getting are, of course, from the children's hospital in the Center of Kyiv, the most important children's hospital not only for that city, but for all of Ukraine, a very well-known place where people come to get the very specialist treatment that they need for some of the country's sickest children. Russia has come out and said that it was targeting defense industrial installations and air bases. And it has refuted claims that it targeted this children's hospital by saying that it believes that the video is coming out of Kyiv that are consistent with the Ukrainian air defense missile. Take a look at this video that shows that CNN is geo located and it shows the moment that the missile struck -- you listen to that. See I had the boom there and CNN has showed that video to several weapons experts who say that it is consistent they believe on the face of it with a cruise missile rather than an air defense missile. And now President Zelenskyy, as you say, has come out today and said he expects to see at the NATO summit that starts on Tuesday in Washington, concrete action from Ukraine's allies. He says Ukraine will of course, respond to this. The question here is whether our partners can respond as well.

They did have a partial loss, withdrawal from part of the key town of Chasiv Yar on the Eastern Front in the past week, which does put them in a more vulnerable position, even though they are presenting that as a strategic withdrawal.

Of course, one of the things that the U.S. was saying when they say that they don't expect much for the new Iranian President, it certainly will be an uphill battle for him if he wants to improve relations with the U.S. and also improve relations, of course, with countries, for instance, from Europe and inside the region as well, because not only of course, right now, there are the relations very difficult between Iran and the United States. But everything that the Iranian President does, Becky, has to be done in conjunction and with the blessing of Iran Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and then of course, you also have Iran's very powerful military complex, specifically, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who also of course, have a very strong voice, especially as far as regional foreign policy is concerned. Nevertheless, Iranian presence can of course, take the initiative and drive change not just within Iran, but also in Iranian foreign relations. We know, of course, that President Hassan Rouhani, when he was in power, his administration managed to negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement. And of course, it took U.S. President Trump to actually get to the U.S. to get out of that agreement to essentially kill that agreement, even though those countries are trying to bring that back. So will Pezeshkian be able to revive that agreement. I think right now, that's pretty difficult because both the United States and Iran are quite skeptical of being able to do that. However, as far as improving relations, certainly there is a possibility to do that if you can get the supreme leader on board.

But that being said, it's also clear that there is much ground to make up in order for these two parties to actually be able to get to a deal. And once we now get to this phase of the detailed negotiations, this is where there are a number of thorny and very, very prickly issues for these two parties to try and reach a deal on in order to reach a deal on everything. And as you know, Becky, none of this will be agreed to until every single element is indeed agreed to. We know, however, that one of the key areas of progress that appears to have been made over the course of the last week or so is Hamas appears to be willing now to drop its demand for Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire for the war upfront before even entering phase one of this three phase deal that is very significant. But at the same time, we're also now hearing the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend, his office issuing a statement reiterating that this deal, any deal that he would agree to would have to allow Israel to effectively quote resumed fighting until all of the objectives of the war have been reached. And the reason Netanyahu is doing that, of course, is for purely domestic political reasons, because he wants to hold on to his right wing governing coalition to ensure that those right wing allies who are keeping him in power do not bolt in the face of this deal. But as he is doing so, as we've seen so many times before, he is once again, perhaps putting at risk, the very fabric, the very foundation of a potential hostage and ceasefire deal, the one that is being put together as we speak. So we will have to see to the extent to which it actually undermines these negotiations. But we do know that those negotiations will continue this week, the CIA Director was set to head to Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials today. And later this week, Israeli officials as well as others are heading to Doha, Qatar to pursue those detailed negotiations. We will see whether or not they can reach an agreement.
