They'd like to have jury selection in December and then the case kickoff with evidence being presented beginning on January 2nd of 2024.Now, that is the date that Donald Trump and his lawyers are almost certainly going to be pushing back on quite harshly. They are not going to have to respond in court to it, to this, until next week. But when they do, they've already signaled that they're very likely going to want to claim that they have a lot of legal arguments to make that are not going to allow for a trial that quickly in four to five months from now, things about presidential immunity, things about the First Amendment. Also, they've argued in other cases and here, that Donald Trump is quite a busy individual right now who's running for president. Not only is January and February going to bring about the beginning of voting in the 2024 primaries for president, he's going to be running there. Iowa caucuses will be on the calendar. But also, there are other things he needs to do at the beginning of the year, including prepare for other trials, both lawsuits that are taking him to trial -- there's already one scheduled in mid-January. E. Jean Carroll, the columnist in New York, taking him to trial on a defamation case for the second time, and then other criminal trials that he's preparing for, now that he has been indicted multiple times in multiple courts. So, that is going to get hashed out. It's not going to get hashed out right away, though. On Friday morning, there will be a court hearing in this case, the federal criminal case against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election. And in that hearing, it's going to be the first before federal judge Tanya Chutkin in the D.C. District Court. She's going to be talking to the lawyers about how evidence should be handled in this case. There has been some dispute over that, how much Donald Trump actually will be able to share publicly as he learns information that the Justice Department gathered and they hand it over to him, so his team can prepare for trial. She's going to be determining that. And she also may be responding to some of the things both Trump's lawyers and the Justice Department has said in court filings so far about his social media posts, that he has been quite aggressive on social media, talking about Mike Pence, talking about the judge, talking about the prosecutors, and so a lot to watch out for, exactly how the judge responds and what the tone will be in this very first hearing before the federal judge, who will oversee the trial of Donald Trump related to the 2020 election.

People might remember that back in, right before the 2016 caucus in Iowa, he skipped a Fox debate in Iowa and held a counter-programming event. He said he was raising money for veterans that never seemed to pan out. But he ended up losing the caucus somewhat surprisingly. I think he will feel more pressure to participate in the debates in those early states for which absence could be seen as a slight not only to the sponsors but to the voters.

That strategy didn't work in 2016. It's not working now. They ultimately have to give voters a better reason than they have done, so far, to bypass Trump.

Necessary for one of them to beat Trump or post a very strong second, because if Trump wins that convincingly, it's very likely. I think people in the other campaigns even agree, to steamroll to the nomination. He's traditionally been stronger in New Hampshire than in Iowa, and if he wins Iowa and New Hampshire, he would likely win South Carolina, and, you know, someone who wins all three of those contests is not going to be beaten.Not sufficient, however, because the last three winners of the Iowa caucus, Mike Huckabee in '08, Rick Santorum in '12, and Ted Cruz in 2016, did not win the Republican nomination. All of them failed to build a broad enough coalition. You can win Iowa by really digging in deep among the state's evangelical Christians, who are a significant majority of the Republican electorate there, but if you can't appeal beyond that, it's very hard to win the nomination. So, I'll be looking for two things in Iowa, whether anyone can put a dent in Trump or beat him, which still seems possible in Iowa to me.

Three of them, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi have been held by Iran for years. Sources telling CNN, their full freedom is part of an elaborate multi national effort involving billions of dollars and a potential prisoner swap. Among those potential plans, giving Tehran easier access to $6 billion in Iranian funds, currently held in South Korea. A source familiar with the negotiations saying there would still be strict limitations on how that money could be used. For their part, Iran also said that 5 Iranian prisoners in the U.S. would be released as part of the deal.

The fatal FBI shooting of a Utah man on Wednesday is unsettling in its own right, but people in law enforcement say it is not an isolated case. Plots against political figures are up sharply in recent years. Some experts say the current political climate is making it worse. CNN's Brian Todd has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Law enforcement officials are now conducting a post incident review of a deadly confrontation in Utah. An FBI shooting response team launch from the agency's headquarters in Washington to the scene. On Wednesday, just hours before President Biden's visit to Utah, FBI agents approached a man named Craig Robertson at his home at the state. Robertson, court documents say, had made violent threats against the president and other democratic politicians. A law enforcement source tells CNN when FBI SWAT agents gave commands to Robertson, he pointed a gun at them and he was then shot and killed. In court documents, prosecutors say in one social media post, Robertson said, quote, \"I hear Biden's coming to Utah. Digging out my old ghillie suit\", which is a camouflage suit for snipers. And, quote, \"Cleaning the dust off the M24 sniper rifle\". But if Robertson was just spouting off and he hadn't acted on any threats, why go in with force?",
