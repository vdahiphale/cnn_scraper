Brand new video into CNN this morning appears to show hand-to-hand combat and around that city. Ukraine's deputy defense minister says, his troops have pushed the Russians back at least two kilometers there.And right now, a crucial moment at the southern border. Overnight, a COVID immigration policy known as Title 42 expired. And this morning a federal judge has temporarily blocked a migrant release policy which could have helped with the overcrowding at holding facilities. The Biden administration warns the situation at the border could get worse. Kate.",

According to a new report, there is currently an active shortage of about two dozen chemotherapy drugs, and nine out of 10 oncologists say drug shortages have led to patient harm, even death.CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is joining us now.

I have spoken with cancer patients, I spoke with a woman whose child had cancer and the doctor just said we'll get that chemotherapy we were supposed to give your child, we can't give it to her. I spoke with a man who have prostate cancer and he was told we know that this drug would extend your life. We know that from studies and we can't give it to you.So, it is so devastating and doctors are really working so hard to come up with the plan Bs and Cs and Ds to try to make this work. But it's tough, sometimes there's no substitute for these. Let's take a look at drugs in general, so this report from the University of Utah says there have been more than 300 drugs in shortage this year. The last time we had this many, it was 2014. The big question, of course, is why? So, according to the study, what they say is the number -- the top three reasons in this order are unknown shortages, and -- supply and demand, rather, and manufacturing. I want to focus on that first one. More than half of the reasons that drugmakers gave for these shortages were unknown. And that's really a problem. When you speak to the experts on this, they say we can't solve this until drug companies open up about why they are experiencing these shortages. Kate.",

They're telling men and women, if you have multiple partners, if you have new partners and you're having anal sex, then we want you to wait three months before we take your blood.

So, the first thing he did was he dissolved the board of directors over at Twitter. He laid off most of the staff, other staffs quit in protest.And since then, he has done a number of things, like, attacking news organizations resulting in companies like NPR stopping the use of the app on Twitter. He's alienated advertisers by spreading conspiracy theories or -- you remember what posted about Paul Pelosi before having to walk that back. He has done so much in the last several months that has really thrown this company to turmoil. She's is going to have to pick it up. There's failing, really -- the subscription business that he's tried to launch has not really done well. So, she's going to have to inherit that mess, and she's got her work cut out for her, John.",

Both sides also warn, however, this is not a ceasefire to end the fighting.Overnight, a tense quiet was shattered when Islamic militants in Gaza fired rockets toward Israeli cities, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The Israeli military responded by launching airstrikes into heavily populated areas of Gaza. Egyptian and Qatari officials have been trying to broker a ceasefire to no avail. And Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, he will not be speaking during the Eurovision song competition this week. And announcing its decision, the European Broadcasting Union stressed that the contest finale to be held in Liverpool, England on Saturday is strictly a nonpolitical event. Zelenskyy's office, though, denies ever even asking for a chance to speak during the show. For context, Zelenskyy has spoken at other major entertainment events. He spoke at the 2022 Grammy Awards.

San Francisco, the retail rents are double the national average, also much higher in New York, Washington, D.C.And then over the past several years, these stores have overexpanded.

Maybe we start closing some of the streets down to cars on weekends or other hours.And then we also really want to see different types of stores come in, pop-up stores, temporary stores, really try to create some more energy in cities.

We're talking about spaghetti, penne, rigatoni past that you find in the supermarket.But in some cities and in some regions, the prices gone up 25 to 28 percent. Now, that really has an effect on Italian families. This crisis meeting in Rome was held to try to understand why the prices are so high. One of the theories is, of course, that these boxes of pasta on the supermarket shelves right now were produces last year when there was a rise in the cost of wheat because of the war in Ukraine. But they're trying to determine if the prices are just staying high. If they should be -- if that's because of the supermarkets, if that's because of the producers, or if there's something else in the works. John.",
