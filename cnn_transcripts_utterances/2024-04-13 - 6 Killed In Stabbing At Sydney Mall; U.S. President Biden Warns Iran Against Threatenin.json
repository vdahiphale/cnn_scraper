I mean, Iran cannot afford and won't let this go unanswered, really. But the question has been how will Iran respond? What sort of a response will we be seeing from the Iranians to this? Israel has said that it's ready for all possibilities here. We heard yesterday from the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant who was speaking while he met with the U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM commander, General Erik Kurilla, who is in Israel, for meetings about this potential attack. The defense minister saying that Israel is ready, saying that ready to defend itself, both on the ground and in the air and would respond in close cooperation with our partners. We also heard from the Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari yesterday during a briefing saying that Israeli commanders have presented their leadership with their plans, both defensive and offensive and repeating again, that they are on alert and they are ready. Now while the Iranians, Amara, have said that they are going to respond. And the question has been, of course, or is this going to be Iran directly responding targeting Israel itself? What sort of -- what is the scale of this response that we are going to see? Or is Iran going to be using its proxies to respond at the same time, we have been hearing from CNN sources over the past week saying that Iran is indicating that while -- will respond that it still wants to keep this as a calculated and measured response. Because it does not want this to escalate into a war, something that the United States also wants to try and avoid. So the big question right now, while the region is on edge, is not only what sort of a response are we going to be seeing from the Iranians? The question is, how will Israel respond to that as well, because we've heard from Israeli officials in recent days saying that if Iran were to attack Israel, that they will respond with an attack inside Iran, as well. So right now you have the region, really on edge, a lot of concern about this escalating. And, you know, the fears of this escalating into a war are very real right now.",

Colonel, good morning to you.Let's start with the significance if this is what is going to happen that Iran will directly attack Israel inside its borders. There's no shortage of Iranian proxies in the region, the Houthis, Hezbollah, we've discussed them over the last several months especially why do it themselves? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Victor, there could be several reasons. And good morning to you, one of the things that the Iranians may want to do is show that they are the ones that are directly responding to an attack on their consulate. And they look at it from the diplomatic point of view that that was sovereign Iranian territory, even though it wasn't Damascus, Syria, but legally, they are technically right, in that sense. So this is one of the ways in which they could do this. They would do, you know, potentially launch some of their long range missiles into Israeli airspace and to potentially with the intent of striking a specific Israeli target. That is one possibility. Other possibilities include such things as cyber attacks, and you know, also drone swarms. So I think what we might see is a combination of attacks from Iran itself and from the proxies. But it really remains to be seen if they want to wrap things up that much. And if they also want to, in essence, make it possible for a wider war to occur. And I don't think that's really an Iranian interest at this point. But Iran's calculations are going to be different from what we would do calculated in a similar situation.",

What we really need to understand is Iran's intentions, it wouldn't be logical for them to mount these movements as a distraction. But it is a large number of cruise missiles that we're talking about here. Hundred cruise missiles is no mean feat from a logistical standpoint to move them into position or will move them around.So what they may be doing is either distraction or getting them ready. Or they may be trying to protect them and move them into areas in which they feel that they are less vulnerable to an Israeli counter attack.",

There were attacks from Hezbollah into Israeli resources, and then retaliatory attacks from Israel. There have been those skirmishes back and forth across the border since the fall, since October 7. Should we see what's happened over the last 24 hours between Hezbollah and the IDF in the context of this Iranian retaliation? Or is this independent of that, do you think?",

What they might be doing in conjunction with Hezbollah, is testing Israeli defenses, seeing if the Iron Dome system works as advertised or continues to work as it has in the past. So they may be assessing Israeli vulnerabilities as part of their usual attacks against Israel.And so that's one of the key areas where they are looking at, I think, different areas, working with their proxies to determine Israeli vulnerabilities, especially in the defense sector. BLACKWELL: If Iran strikes inside of Israel, is there any scenario in which U.S. forces would not be committed, would not play a larger role in the defense of Israel? I mean, do you think that this then brings the U.S. and a large -- more significant way into this fight in the region?",

You still have some lingering rain and snow showers across much of this area, but it's the next system that's going to be coming in, basically from Canada, sliding down tomorrow morning and continuing through the afternoon.That's where the concern is. It's not going to bring just severe weather, but also the potential for very heavy rainfall. And trust me, rainfall is the last thing a city like Pittsburgh needs. They're already sitting at their third wettest April, even if they only get an inch out of this next system, they will likely top out at the wettest April on record. And Pittsburgh is not the only one, we're still looking at the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms in addition to that heavy rainfall, but also for Philadelphia, places like Columbus and Cincinnati. Then, an entirely different system also sets up for Monday, and this ends up being a little bit more of an enhanced severe weather threat as we go into the southern plains and central plains. And that's all from this low pressure system that will begin in the Rockies and then eventually make its way eastward. And as it does, it's also going to spread some pretty heavy rain. So, you have the main threats, of course, for the severe weather. We were talking about damaging winds, large to even very large hail, talking tennis ball size or even larger, and then yes, the potential for tornadoes. Obviously, the focus point is going to be that orange area. They're stretching from Wichita down through Oklahoma City and into northern Texas.   But essentially, any of these areas have the potential for that severe weather. And there's also the potential for some flooding across portions of the upper Midwest, including cities like Minneapolis.",
