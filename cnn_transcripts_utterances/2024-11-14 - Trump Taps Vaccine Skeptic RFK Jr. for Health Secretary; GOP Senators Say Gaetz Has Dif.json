I disagree.The other thing I wanted to refer to is the discussion about the NIH and the CDC. These agencies are jewels. They're considered as such by the rest of the world. The National Institutes of Health has given drugs that I would venture to say everybody in this room has taken, and the FDA has approved those. So, if we lose those agencies, we're going to have unproven drugs, we're going to have a whole series of problems. You were talking about COVID. I was in China in January of 2020. I saw what it did to that country. I was in China in 2003 for SARS. I've seen outbreaks. I've seen thousands of people die. When we had a vaccine for COVID, the major advantage we hoped initially was that it was going to prevent transmission as long as well as reduce disease and morbidity, mortality. We found out that it wasn't as effective in reducing transmission as we had hoped, but it definitely reduced morbidity and mortality. And let me just finish one last thing.

Even The Wall Street Journal is getting the heebie-jeebies about the Matt Gaetz situation. They say, Matt Gaetz is a bad choice for attorney general. He's a nominee for those who want the law used for political revenge, and it won't end well. Those is doing a lot of work here. Those is Donald Trump. He said he wants the law used for political revenge, and now he's doing it. Denver?FMR. REP. DENVER RIGGLEMAN (R-VA):  Yes. I mean, you know, I find it amazing. I had the good fortune of saying that January 6th text messages, you know, and I was actually the senior technical advisor, and I remember saying Jason Miller, Marjorie Taylor Greene, starting with, you know, Antifa did it. Then you see Matt Gaetz come out with this incredible thing where facial recognition was actually part of seeing Antifa in the crowd on January 6th. And when I look at Matt Gaetz since then, and since I served with Matt Gaetz, and seeing now, I mean, this is just a loyalist who has no reason to be in any position of power, as appointee, or anything like that, based on the fact that there's a cascading effect of bad judgment from this guy who can't tell truth from fiction. And I think that's what I've seen since that time is that you have a bunch of individuals, whether you're talking about him or Tulsi Gabbard or Hegseth, or if you go down the line, you have a bunch of J6 apologists and individuals, again, you can't tell fact from fiction. They have this inability to know what truth actually is on a baseline type of way. So, you have a bunch of loyalists who've been following down this line of sort of insanity, and they're the ones that are actually putting up being put up for appointments. And I think that scares people who've been in the intelligence business, like I have for a long time, somebody who's been in Congress, that when you have unserious picks like that, there is a way that, right now, when you see foreign adversaries, or even inside our country itself, when you're looking at people who might want to go after individuals, you're seeing that they're -- we're going to become a laughingstock pretty quickly if you have appointees like this.",

Personnel is policy, and that's what you're seeing today with these appointments, whether it's Tulsi Gabbard or Matt Gaetz or RFK Jr. This is what you get.

The thing that shocked me was that Donald Trump actually won by the margin that he did.I'll be honest. The reason I didn't vote for him is because he did have Tulsi Gabbard and R.F.K. Jr. and Matt Gaetz with him. Because literally, if you go back and look at what they've done and look at what they've said, there's -- there are some cases that they need mental health. And I think that's what I -- you know, when you talk about 5G causing leaky brain that's RFK Jr. That's insane. That doesn't make sense, right? When you have a guy sticking his hands in the finger of a bear. When you have somebody who has this type of ridiculousness, the sort of charade where he's out there trying to make money in grift, off crap -- off health crap, stuff he doesn't understand. As Americans, as individuals, we're allowed to have this debate because for me, since I know these facts, I know this date and I'm actually a free-thinking individual, is that bad people have been elected before in the majority. And what we have right now is we do have a country, I think, that does want things to change. But I think the disinformation ecosystem was so powerful that people don't even know what they want to change. Because I promise you right now, if you don't ask people what the economic plan like Scott can do it. Scott studied, Scott knows. Scott worked in the Bush administration. Everybody here has to has this sort of knowledge base. But an American out there who's getting fed the same bunch of crap about R.F.K. Jr. and he comes up looking all nice, make American healthy again. But also, I think 5G calls leaky brain. There's a cascading effect to judgment that's going to destroy the United States in a real crisis. And that's why people like me are speaking out because there's no data or facts based way we could be choosing these type of people.",

Same thing with addiction. We've even been able to identify, here's a brain model, of sort of where these areas are in the brain that are responsible for your feelings of fullness. You eat food and then you should feel full. That's what happens normally. But for some people with obesity, that feeling of fullness just never comes. And it's really interesting.

The thermostat is just set a little differently as Dr. Jens Juul Holst, you just heard from. That's what he sort of describes. So, for those people, it's not a shortcut. What I would say is there are a lot of people who are also taking this for not medically necessary reasons. And you got to be careful, because there's not a lot of long-term data on those folks.
