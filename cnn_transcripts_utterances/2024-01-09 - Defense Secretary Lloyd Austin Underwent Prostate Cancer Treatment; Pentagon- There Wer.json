      "sentences": "The other, as you point out, was on the notification problems here and the fact that President Joe Biden didn't know his defense secretary was in the hospital.On the medical side, we talked about all the medical procedures here, the diagnosis of prostate cancer in early December, the minimally invasive procedure where he was under general anesthesia. We learned and we have known that neither Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks nor President Joe Biden were notified that he was overnight in the hospital from December 22nd to 23rd. We now know he was under general anesthesia. And then we learn more about a week later on January 1st, the discomfort he was feeling, the source of that discomfort, a urinary tract infection and more. So we've learned on that part of it. In terms of his returning to duty, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder didn't detail whether he's on medication, but he said the decision to return and resume his duties, even as he remains in the hospital, was done in full consultation with his doctors, with the medical staff there. And there was also a question of why this was called an elective medical procedure. I won't speculate there. Certainly Dr. Reiner would have a better sense of why it's called an elective medical procedure, if that was appropriate or if some aspect of this was elective, because the Pentagon didn't have an answer on that question. And then there were all the questions, Brianna, as you pointed out on notification and this is where the process broke down and failed. Essentially, Ryder kept kicking to this 30-day review. My colleague, Natasha Bertrand, asked, the review starts looking at the timeline on January 1st, why doesn't it start at December 22nd when he first went to the hospital, why isn't that being looked at. Ryder's answer to that was that the lessons learned from January 1st on will sort of be applicable in reverse. They will still apply on notification procedures. It's also unclear why, when his chief of staff and his senior military advisor knew on January 2nd, within 24 hours, why didn't one of them pass this on or know how to pass it on. To this point, the Pentagon has said that his chief of staff had the flu and for some reason, therefore, wasn't able to make notification or pass on the responsibility of notifying the president and others. So there are still serious questions there about this notification process. Also worth pointing out that the person ordering the review, Chief of Staff, Kelly Magsamen, is the person that Ryder said yesterday had the responsibility to do it. So the person at fault here initiated the review. We'll, of course, have to see what comes as a result of this review. He also said the secretary has no intention of resigning. The chief of staff has no intention of resigning nor will President Joe Biden ask the Defense Secretary to resign. In terms of travel, in terms of meetings, in terms of upcoming events, that, Ryder says, will be taken as they come, as they look at his schedule, and as they see his recovery. The statement from Walter Reed says his recovery is going well, but it is a slow process. There is a good prognosis because the prostate cancer itself was diagnosed early. So as much as we have the answers on the medical side of this, we now wait to learn more about the notification side and the failures to notify the president and other senior administration officials.",

      "sentences": "Oren, please stand by. I want to go to Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling. He's a CNN Military Analyst. He's been waiting patiently and listening to this Pentagon briefing.General, we understand that you have a personal relationship with the Secretary of Defense. I believe that you described him to one of our colleagues as a friend. First, I want to get your reaction to the news that he dealt with prostate cancer, and then also get your perspective on the issue of transparency and why perhaps the Pentagon - he perhaps was not more forthcoming with the infection after the elective procedure. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Sure, Boris, and thanks. And yes, I do have to state that we do have a - Secretary Austin and I do have a personal relationship. We're West Point classmates. He was my commander in Iraq. He is a good friend and I think very highly of him. Having said that, I think some of the things that were pointed out are all contributing factors to what happened, the lack of transparency. The first thing is, you need to know that every general officer and senior military official goes through a yearly physical by mandate. So every year, you're updated on your PSAs and all other factors of your health. The military does that to make sure they're not embarrassed by someone either dying or being injured on active duty. That's embarrassing. So Secretary Austin is used to doing that, number one. Number two, there's the privacy requirements. As Dr. Reinhardt (ph) mentioned before, this is a tough kind of injury or illness to open up about for most males. It was very good that Secretary Austin got these tests on a yearly basis and something evidently changed. And he said, hey, let's take care of it, which brings me to my third point. [15:05:00] Secretary Austin is - I'll put it in the military psyche approach - when a military officer is injured or hurt, the first reaction is, hey, ruck up, continue on, drive on. That's kind of the military approach to all injuries and illnesses, even when you're sick. The fourth thing is, that contributes to this, is Austin - Secretary Austin's personality. I know him well. He's very much of an introvert. He's very much of a private person, almost to the nth degree. He keeps his cards close to his vest, and he works his butt off. So I think that contributed as well. He thought he could go in and out of Walter Reed on a day during his leave period, get this operation that the doctors were recommending, probably a non-invasive surgery, and get back to work immediately. That was probably his plan until he started suffering a couple of days later. Does any of that excuse the action of him not notifying or his staff not notifying his bosses? Absolutely not. But the key is, this press conference today, giving all the special details of his illness, that's not something that usually happens. So I'm sure to try and tamp down some of the lack of transparency comments or are you going to resign comments. Secretary Austin had to be asked and gave permission to let it all loose, tell everybody what happened. So they have a better detail. The last thing I'll point out and I'm sorry for going on so long, is the review process that's been talked about that Oren just mentioned. The military is famous for their after action reviews, where they say what happened, why did it happen, what do we do to make a difference and change it for the better, who was responsible. And it's sort of a scab picking, if you will, of things that go wrong. I know Kelly Magsamen, too. Secretary Austin's chief of staff. She will conduct a good review, and she will take responsibility for anything that went wrong, too, as the Secretary has already done.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And to your point, listen, he's very private, clearly someone who schedules their prostatectomy, the Friday before Christmas Monday does not want that to be the topic of the Pentagon briefing. Of course, this then turned into complications.And Dr. Reiner, back to you on that, because I think people look at these complications and they say, oh, he was in the hospital for many, many days. However, he apparently and we were hearing questions about this during the briefing, did not lose consciousness during that time. He actually had a tube put in through his nose going into his stomach. But it seems like it's actually not unusual for a nasogastric tube to be placed without general anesthesia. It's just sort of a numbing spray, is that correct?",

      "sentences": "Well, first and foremost, Boris, White House officials have consistently said that their number one concern here is Secretary Austin's well-being and his health. So we certainly expect that White House officials, including at a White House briefing that is set to begin any moment now to emphasize that point and wish him speedy and successful recovery as he continues his treatment.But what is clear is that this whole issue has prompted this government-wide review of what should happen in this kind of situation. And all of this had created a lot of confusion even inside the White House with senior most national security advisors, including the senior most person at the White House here, of course, President Biden, having been in the dark about the fact that Secretary Austin had been hospitalized for days. And the discussion that was just being had about the ability for somebody in his position when he's going through these kinds of health issues, are they sort of capable of advising the president on sensitive matters. Just to point you to our earlier reporting that I think really underscores how unusual, this situation was. Just as an example, on New Year's Day, this was the day that Secretary Austin was hospitalized, he participated, as CNN reported a few days ago, in a meeting with the President and other National Security officials in the Biden administration to discuss, among other things, the escalating situation in the Red Sea. So these are very sensitive national security matters that we're talking about that the secretary presumably would have waited on, on the day that he was hospitalized. Now, as for that review that we heard mentioned at the Pentagon press briefing, this is a government-wide review that White House Chief of Staff, Jeff Zients, actually circulated a memo about to all of the different cabinet secretaries and all of the agencies. They now have just a matter of days to submit to him the protocols that they would - yes, each of the agencies would follow when there is a delegation of authority situation that comes up. And they make clear, in a situation like this, when a cabinet secretary is hospitalized, when they travel to a place, for example, where there's no communication, that these protocols need to be followed. I do think the other thing we will hear emphasized is something we've heard before from the White House in recent days that the president does continue to have full confidence in Secretary Austin.",

There is no absolute immunity for presidents for precisely that reason we heard in the sound clip. You can't have presidents going out and ordering assassinations and not being held accountable. Why is it, then, that these issues with Bush or Obama or Biden are not real issues? Because we have checks and balances, matters never in American history have reached that impasse.

Chris Christie sort of is in a place where he can't justify his own existence much longer with his numbers. Vivek Ramaswamy doesn't exist, essentially, in the primary at this point.
