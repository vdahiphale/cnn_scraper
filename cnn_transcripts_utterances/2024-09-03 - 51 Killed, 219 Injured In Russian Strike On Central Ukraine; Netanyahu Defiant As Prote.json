The Israeli Prime Minister doubles down on war, as protesters and his nation scream for peace and the return of hostages. And later, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Well, you know the rest. Our conversation with the stars of the classic making a big comeback. Hello everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. And we begin this hour in Ukraine and what's being called one of the single deadliest attacks since Russia's full-scale invasion two and a half years ago. At least 49 people were killed and more than 200 wounded in a Russian missile strike on the central city of Poltava. The Ukrainian president said two ballistic missiles hit a military training institute and a nearby hospital today, trapping many people underneath the rubble. Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at Moscow and vowed that, quote, Russian scum will be held accountable. And he once again made an urgent plea for Western air defenses. It's a message that was reiterated by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister when he spoke to our Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And they feel connected to their dreams and their stories and to their families. And it's like the loss of a family member. And when we are on this vicious wheel of the deal that's getting closer and further back, closer and further back so many times, it's very clear right now that these lives could have been spared.

I think all of Israeli society is out there protesting with us because it's not a personal thing. This really threatens the loss of the deal and the fact that Netanyahu would not sign a deal, would not bring this crisis to an end. This actually ruins the social fabric of our society. Israelis are taught and are educated on the fact that you don't leave anyone behind and that we're all part of the same thing.

That what Democrats call anti-MAGA coalition was suppressed by the doubts about Biden. It is now reasserting itself in all sorts of ways, not only in polls, but in contributions and volunteer shifts and so forth.

There wasenormous concern among Democrats about enthusiasm and losing, in effect, the referendum with the couch, when Biden was the nominee. Now we see equal, if not more enthusiasm among Democrats. But again, you know, we're talking about really seven states that are fully in play that are all decided by extremely narrow margin. The three former Blue Wall states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which is still the clearest path to 270 for Kamala Harris. Plus, as you know, the four Sunbelt states that she's put back into play. Everything matters when you're talking about margins. You know, Biden won the three Blue Wall states by 260,000 votes in 2020. Hillary Clinton had lost them by only 80,000 votes in 2016. That was the difference, essentially, between a Trump presidency and a Biden presidency. It is likely it is going to be somewhere roughly that close again. And the Sunbelt states are equally narrow. So, yes, I think it is primarily a turnout issue. But when you're talking about margins of that, you know, slim magnitude, everything matter.",

This time his attorneys are facing off against the estate of Isaac Hayes andfederal court over the campaign's use of the song \"Hold on I'm coming\" at rallies which Hayes co-wrote. The estate's attorneys say the Trump campaign did not receive permission to use the license material and they're seeking compensatory damages for the unauthorized use of Hayes' music. CNN's Ryan Young joins us live from Atlanta. So we've seen this time and time again where artists object to a candidate using their music, but it's not often that it ends up going all the way to court. What is the latest on this specific case, Ryan?",

So you do have this whole issue of branding, you know, in this world that welive in now branding and who your music is associated with and so much are part of what the artists and the family might think about in the future. So Isaac Hayes, Jr., or the third, basically says they got notified that Donald Trump was using this song over and over. And since 2022, they've been asking the campaign to stop playing the music. There were some back and forth about who actually owned the copyright of the song. The song being very popular and just hearing it before now. But what didn't happen is Donald Trump's campaign never stopped using it. We just have a temporary injunction that was the federal court judge basically said that Donald Trump campaign has to stop using this music going forward. The family's very happy about that. The family also asked for Donald Trump Jr. or Donald Trump to take down all the videos from the campaign videos where the song is used. The judge denied that part. Now this is not all over at all. In fact, there's probably going to be a court case that's going to be attached to this because the family wants to move ahead with damages. They want to seek payment for this because when you use an artist's song, of course, usually you have to license it. You have to get paid for the music that's being played and they feel like the Donald Trump organization, they know it for a fact, did not pay them for use of the music. So that back and forth is not over just yet, but \"Hold On\" will no longer be played at any Donald Trump events based upon the ruling today. There were other people who were there involved in this case, they all stepped back. That was the NRA, the Republican National Committee. They also, look, we'll stop playing it as well because the family has asked for them to stop playing it. So this -- as this case continues to go forward, there was a small victory for the Isaac Hayes family and then also for Donald Trump, because they don't have to take down the 50 or so videos that's on the website that you can hear the music in the background of. But again, this is not the first artist. You have Bruce Springsteen, you have Beyonce. You even had the Prince estate ask Donald Trump to stop playing music at campaign events. This is all about signaling to the public that none of these music greats are attached to the campaign. Bianna.",
