For weeks, the U.S. has been trying to avoid direct strikes because of the risk of escalation in the region. Obviously, there's already so much tension.

We don't know in what kind of form that would be at this point because what we don't know at this point is whether or not the U.S. and U.K. militaries was successful in taking out all of the targets that they wanted to destroy. The U.S. military, saying that the intention of this was to degrade the Houthis' ability to be able to target commercial vessels in the Red Sea.Now, the U.S. has opened the door, left the door open to make sure that they can carry on on more attacks. So, this may not just be an isolated target, targeted strike at from the U.S. Now, the U.K. junior defense minister has said that at this point, there's no imminent plans for further strikes, but of course, they will want to see how successful those overnight strikes were. Now, of course, the concerns are, what will this do to the rest of the region? Will some of the other Iranian-backed, Iranian-funded and Iranian- equipped groups decide that they want to carry out so-called sympathetic strikes in support of the Houthis, or will this be an isolated event? Now, we have seen that this is an international effort. It is not just the U.S. and U.K. militaries. They have support, they said from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, the Netherlands. They had also a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the Houthis and asking them to stop. And we have heard from countless U.S. officials, including the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was just here in the region that if the Houthis didn't stop trying to target commercial vessels in the Red Sea, then there would be consequences. Now, we know that these plans have been in place by the U.S. military for some time. And it was just waiting for the political go ahead to carry it out. The U.S. President Joe Biden deciding that the time had come that this was necessary after a significant attack by the Houthi rebels against what they said was a U.S. commercial vessel, according to one U.S. official, back on Tuesday. Twenty-one drones and missiles were shot down by the U.S. and U.K. navies -- Kasie.",

Now, they've been waging war for a long time, a civil war, and they still have stockpiles that can go and move into position and drones, for instance, are fairly quick to replace. But still, it should delay them for a couple of weeks or so. I'm sure that's what military planners are hoping that this strike caused.But in terms of a wider war, Iran probably is going to shrewdly stay silent right now. It will condemn this, but it's getting what it wants. It's getting the frustration of shipping. It is creating this low-grade intensity of instability in that area that is costly for the U.S. and the U.K. And anyone who's supporting the Palestinians -- who is supporting the Israeli effort against the Palestinian militant group Hamas.",

Their leader put this statement out on social media a short time ago saying, quote, the American British strikes are barbaric terrorist and are a deliberate and unjustified aggression that reflects a brutal psychology.Iran condemned the strikes this morning. You suggested this is what was going to happen. They called it, quote, a violation of international law. Do you expect that that's going to be the extent of the response from Iran? And what do you think the possibilities are in terms of these Houthi threats to retaliate? I think when the Houthis get the equipment that they need into position, that they will attempt to retaliate? And what you're going to likely see is a back-and-forth between the Houthi militants attacking the shipping, the warships, when they can. But some of this equipment will be expensive to replace. Iran has supplied a lot of this through its own shipping in the region. Of course, this will probably lead to confrontations where U.S., U.K., other vessels try to stop Iranian resupply. So I think were seeing the opening salvo in the U.S. and U.K. and western response, but certainly not an end to this conflict.",

But that adds about ten days onto the trip and so its going to hit people's pocketbooks.Also, I've been hearing rumbles in the military community and the diplomatic community that the Houthis keep getting away with this. Something's got to be done to stop them. You know, the GOP rallying cry is that Joe Biden is weak.

This is a very broad stroke view of what's happening, but I want but get down to the nitty-gritty. This is the details. This is what you need to know. This is a latest tornado watch that's issued through 11:00 a.m. Central Standard Time, really heavy weather moving through Little Rock and Shreveport right now. No severe weather at the moment. There are no warnings that I have seen. However, you need to be weather aware. It's early. In fact, it's overnight for those periods, for these regions of the country. So significant storm system moving through. There is a low pressure system that is moving across Missouri and well bomb out or at least potentially bomb out, meaning that it drops in pressure by potentially close to 24 millibars in 24 hours. So that would be a significant event. It will strengthen and create windy conditions around it. The backside, of course, being very cold. And that is why we have blizzard conditions across much of the state of Iowa right now. And we all know what's happening in Iowa next week. This is going to draw in significantly colder air.

We focus our attention on the Southeast, particularly through Mississippi and into Alabama damaging wind gusts, a few tornadoes cannot be ruled out. Heads-up Atlanta, even some of my children's school districts actually been canceled in the course or in the preventative measure that severe weather moves through. So lots of snowfall for the Midwest, blizzard conditions as that's picked up behind the storm.
