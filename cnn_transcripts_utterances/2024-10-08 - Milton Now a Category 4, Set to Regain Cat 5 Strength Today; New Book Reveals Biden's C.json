      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We are following breaking news. Hurricane Milton is quickly getting more intense, even more intense in the Gulf of Mexico at this hour and taking aim directly at Central Florida. It's at Category 4 strength right now, but is expected to be a Cat 5 again later today. We're also getting this new exclusive video from Madeira Beach, Florida, a town standing right in Milton's path. This is debris piled up from the Hurricane Helene cleanup, still posing a danger as Milton's winds could pick all of this up and shoot it in all sorts of directions as the storm pummels this area, something to be on the lookout for. If you live in that area, you've got to clean that up. Let's begin our coverage in Fort Myers, Florida. Floodwaters there could reach ten feet in some areas. That's where we find CNN's Carlos Suarez. And, Carlos, that's a big part of this story right the storm surge. And it could just really come up throughout that area you're standing in right now.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Jim. Good morning. So, the folks here in Fort Myers, Florida, have been preparing for this storm for the better part of the last couple of days. One reason that they're taking this storm so serious is because of Hurricane Ian, which hit this part of Lee County, a good part of Lee County, really, two years ago.And so the folks out here are well aware of what these powerful storms can do. You can see this sheet of plywood that's gone up this morning. What they're concerned about is what you said, the storm surge anywhere between six to ten feet of it. And so when Ian hit, we're told about four feet of water flooded a lot of these businesses. And so what you're looking at is more or less where these folks believe the water will most likely come in from one of the main rivers out here just to the other side of where this business is at. The folks have been preparing for this again for the better part of the last couple of days. They have been trying to figure out whether they were going to stay put. We know that evacuation orders went out for Fort Myers Beach to the south of us here. They also went out for Sanibel. Those are two parts of Lee County that were really destroyed by Hurricane Ian. And, in fact, if we can take a live look at interstate -- I-75, you're taking a look at Alligator Alley or at least you should be. And you can see the traffic that's been building there for the last day or so. Interstate 75 connects Southwest Florida to South Florida. And so on our drive last night, we ran into what you're taking a look at there, which is folks from this part of the state of Florida deciding to go ahead and make the drive across the Everglades into Broward County. If you live in southwest Florida, that's probably the easiest drive for you to make to get away from the storm. But then, of course, the further north you are, chances are folks there are trying to make their way a little bit more north in Florida. And then some folks are just trying to cross over into Central Florida because they're trying to get away from the storm. One final note from me out here, there are some concerns about the gas supply, gas stations across the state of Florida. The governor already said that the state of Florida recognizes this is becoming an issue and they've tapped into some of the state reserves to try to get some of these gas stations back with a supply of gas as we move forward and the storm inches closer.

So, that's about two days ago, we were to get the majority up. We do it still a little bit left. But our big concern now is Ian took away a lot of our structures along the Gulf Coast.We're only a seven-mile island, so a lot of those structures are still not built back. So, as this surge comes in, if it makes any turn towards the south, it's going to be even worse. You know, we're expecting six to ten here with nothing to block it on the gulf side, so it's going to come inland and it's going to hit the houses down some of these side streets pretty hard. So, it could be as significant as Ian. We're hoping certainly that it doesn't. But we know what's coming. We feel for the people that are in that 12 to 15-foot storm surge, which is what we got during Ian. And as you said, if you were here, you saw the damage. It is nothing to joke about.

She's out there a lot this week talking about issues that are facing Americans. And you still have some undecided voters out there that are trying to decide who's in it for them.

Donald Trump is talking to a fly at a rally. Donald Trump is talking about Hannibal Lecter. Donald Trump is talking about windmills causing cancer, electrocution, and sharks. And so what I really would encourage listeners out there to do is go watch Donald Trump. He's unhinged. He's all over the place. He's unwell and he's talking about himself over and over again.

I've worked under Republican governors while I was in the state legislature. I worked with a Republican president while I was in Congress. This is dangerous.
