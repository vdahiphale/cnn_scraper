They walk the direction they think they're supposed to head. CULVER (on camera):  You can tell they're basically just trying to figure out their way as they go. They have no real guide. They were told some general instructions and now they're just trying to figure it out. CULVER (voice-over):  Wading through brush and high grass, up and down hills, they skirt around the first migration checkpoint.

It looks like for now they're just going to keep walking. CULVER (voice-over):  A few minutes pass and another van pulls up. Fifteen minutes later another stop. Another checkpoint walk-around.

The fact that Hunter Biden used his father's address as his own permanent address as he was getting divorced and I think moving out of his own home in a bad state of affairs, and had it on his driver's license, had it on many other accounts, shows nothing -- nothing at all about Joe Biden's involvement.And it's just another effort to gaslight the American public into thinking that Joe Biden had something to do with Hunter Biden's business interests. There is no evidence Joe Biden was involved whatsoever in that, that he knew about it. That he received anything of it. The fact of his address being used is not evidence of anything and it's just another example of them misusing information and try to turn it into something that it's not. Another example is all these emails and texts that we -- that they show from 2017, which don't indicate any involvement of Joe Biden. But it's also when Joe Biden was not a president or vice president, or a Department of Justice email from 2020. That was the Trump Justice Department. So all of these allegations just don't make any sense. The timeline makes no sense and just the facts makes no sense. And I think what really came out yesterday when the rubber had to meet the road when the facts and the evidence were needed is it's just not there. And I'm very proud of the Democrats that we have on that committee because we made that very clear over and over and especially, how preposterous it is as they are barreling us headlong into a shutdown that is of their own making by themselves.",
