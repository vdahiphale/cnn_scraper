Retired Brigadier General Steve Anderson will join us next on CNN THIS MORNING. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:35:32] COLLINS: All right, welcome back. President Biden has just departed Kyiv after he made a dangerous surprise visit to the war zone for the first time since Russia invaded. The president walked the streets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as you heard air raids blaring across the city. And we are now learning that President Biden decided only on Friday to make that final call that, yes, he was going to be going to Ukraine. He had been huddling with aides in the Oval Office, talking about the security precautions they would, obviously, have to take. We've also just learned that the U.S. did notify the Kremlin in the hours before President Biden arrived in Kyiv so there would be no miscalculation. Obviously, that is a notable development coming from the president's team. A key calculus that they had to weigh as they were making this decision. The president said it was important for him to be in Ukraine on and around the one-year anniversary of Putin's invasion to pledge U.S. support for Ukraine, saying that it will go on as long as it takes, Poppy.",

What the White House says, Sara and Poppy, is that they decided it was a manageable risk that they could take here, that they felt that it was something where he could go into Ukraine at a point where they believed it was safe enough. He only went with so few people, though. And that is, as you know, very rare for a presidential visit. SIDNER: He is the commander in chief. And, ultimately, gets to be the decider of what happens.

And, I mean, this is significant.But the United States needs to make a decision, are we in it to ensure that the Ukrainians simply not lose, or are we in it so they can actually win? In order to do that, we've got to be able to surge a lot of equipment forward. They need more aircraft. They need more drones. They need more long-range artillery. And something that hasn't really been discussed much, they need logistics. We've given them a lot of great equipment, billions of dollars of equipment that they can't maintain. I've heard anecdotal reports from the theater that perhaps only half of the equipment that we've given them is fully mission capable now. They don't have the maintenance training. They don't have the repair parts. And so we've got to be able to surge that forward, particularly if we want them to actually win.",

They've got to have the repair parts.Now, we've got 800 contractors supporting the State Department running all over Ukraine, which is great. Why can't the Department of Defense do the same thing?

And I know that when President Biden already was, you know, coming into power, like President Zelenskyy was mentioning when I was working there and after that he wanted President Biden to visit Ukraine really a lot. Like, that was his personal desire. And president Biden selected such a significant moment. This is the moment before the first year of the war, Russian war against Ukraine. But also it's -- the President's Day, right, in the United States. And here in Ukraine, we have even a jog (ph) that probably there is no better place to celebrate the President's Day than in Ukraine and there is no better company than with President Zelenskyy. And let me mention that every Ukrainian is almost celebrating this visit for the reason that the last American president who was coming to Ukraine was President Bush in 2008 and that was a completely different country. That was the country before all those critical reforms that we have done to join the European Union. But also it was the country before the war.
