He said there I believe he thought he was in a safe space. He said he was also using a burner phone.

And then somehow, he makes the leap from those woods to more than 10 miles away to the home of a relative.They're looking at OK, the house he was in. There was nobody on the planet Earth who didn't know that the police were looking for him, so that's a potential harboring a fugitive charge. Then there's how did he get to that house? Did he call a friend? Did somebody give him a ride? Did he go anywhere else? So anybody who touched his travels or movements after that shooting who knew they were assisting a fugitive is in the mix for someone who could be charged. One other thing that's notable. They get this tip that he's in this house at 5:15. They hit the house by 6:30. In the fugitive hunt to execute a dynamic entry on a house, that is lightning speed. That means that the quality of that tip has to be more than an anonymous call saying check this address. It had to be highly specific. The caller had to have specific information not just that he was there but how the caller knew he was there. So right now, we're in kind of a period of trying to sort out is that call from a family member -- that's a possibility -- saying he's in this house and that's creating a danger for the family. Is it from an associate who passed through that house and was told not to say anything? But it was going to be highly specific.",

But across Ukraine, it's not been such a good story at all. In Kherson, recently liberated from Russia, at least three killed in a strike on a supermarket there -- a hypermarket in mid-morning. A small piece of good news behind me here, though. Incredible work by volunteers that literally since being here the last three or four hours -- they've rebuilt the roof of the neighboring house and salvaged the bricks from the rubble here for rebuilding. A real sense of extraordinary community and also, too, of civilians in Ukraine every night increasingly terrified, frankly, by Russia's often inaccurate and possibly deliberately callous disregard for human life. At the same time, Ukraine hitting targets inside Russia's borders. They're not saying it publicly but it's pretty clear the acts of sabotage on railways, on the fuel depots probably have Kyiv behind them. And this, a real sense of escalation between both sides now. We've been seeing the signals potentially of a counteroffensive getting underway over the last weeks, but now these night-by-night strikes, each side on the other trying to weaken the infrastructure -- the ability to resupply suggesting possibly we may be into a new phase in this war, certainly. And in the east, areas where Russia felt safe to occupy certain areas, pressure in Bakhmut, pressure in other areas. A curfew called all the way to the east -- or the far west of areas held by Russia in Kherson. Citizens being told to stay indoors from the evening of May the fifth for nearly three whole days. That's under the premise of Ukrainian law enforcement operations. But it's just raising the sense right now that we are potentially going to see if this hot weather removes the bad weather promise issue that certainly Ukrainian officials have been saying in rare comments have slowed any moves by them down.

Ron DeSantis is gearing up for a potential, likely, White House run, several recent bills suggest that he is changing the rules in his state in his favor.One bill passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature would allow him to run for president without resigning from his job as governor. Another bill advancing to the chamber would conceal information about his travel and who he's met with at the governor's mansion, which I should note he says is a safety precaution when it comes to travel. Another bill would allow state political committees like the ones DeSantis has -- $85 million or so for his future political donations -- to then report fundraising less frequently than they have previously.
