      "sentences": "I will also revisit County Mayo and remember the history and hope and the heartbreak my Blewitt ancestors must have felt leaving their beloved homeland to begin to their new lives in America.I say all this not to wax poetic about bygone days, but because of the story of my family's journey and those who left and those who stayed is emblematic of the stories of so many Irish and American families, not just Irish-American families. And these stories are the very heart of what binds Ireland and America together. They speak to a history defined by our dreams. They speak to a present written by our shared responsibility, and they speak to a future poised for unlimited shared possibilities. So, today, I'd like to reflect on the enduring strength of the connections between Ireland and the United States, a partnership for the ages. It begins in our shared history, dating back to the very founding of the United States, the Irish hearts that helped kindle the torch of liberty in my country and fire its revolutionary spirit, the Irish blood from across this island that was willingly given for my country's independence, the Irish hands that laid the foundation of a new kind of future, one from the bottom up and the middle out, one built on freedom. You know, the great waves of immigration that brought our ancestors to the United States in succeeding decades carried millions more Irishmen across the sea. Most of them arrived little more than with hope in their hearts and strength in their dreams and beautiful memories of an emerald green isle, a home they would never fully leave behind. I have never met an Irishman in America who doesn't think or hope he will see Ireland today. Their sweet -- or -- excuse me -- their sweat is soaked with the foundations of communities across the nation. All across America, you can't go anywhere and not find it. By the way, Tip O'Neill, the former speaker of the House, used to say that he'd have a reception for all the Irish in the Congress, the House and the Senate, and all those who wish they were Irish.

      "sentences": "Look, the journeys of our ancestors expanded our horizons and really excited our imaginations. They became the untiring backbone of America's progress as a nation, even as they endured discrimination and were denied opportunityI will tell you a story. I was campaigning for president, and I was out in Colorado, and I was with a man whose family had been -- he was a former senator -- a man whose family had been in the United States since the conquistadors for generations. And he kept -- and there were a whole lot of people standing across a refurbished rail station in Western -- in -- excuse me -- in Eastern Colorado. And there was literally 10,000 people on the other side of the track waiting to hear me speak, and he kept saying: \"Now, Joe, remember, remember, these people are not -- these are my people. They're Hispanic. They're not used to be taking -- you got to show respect and serious\" -- I said: \"I understand,\" and kept, kept it up. Finally, I turned to him. It's the God's truth, this refurbished train station, OK? It had like lemon kind of wall paper on it, and about every 20 feet, there was a brass plaque that is saying \"No Irish allowed.\" I said: \"I get it. I get it.\" But it's history that speaks, above all, to the values that sustained these people throughout their hardships in their lives, freedom, equality, dignity, family, courage. My mom used to have an expression, said: \"Joey, courage is the greatest virtue of all, for, without courage, you can't love with abandon. Without courage, you cannot love with abandon.\" These are the values that were handed down generation to generation in my family, grafted on to the American character, tended as they transformed an entire nation. Like so many countries around the world, though perhaps more than most, the United States was shaped by Ireland. And that's not hyperbole. That's a fact. And the values we share remain to this day the core of our historic partnership between our people and our governments. [13:05:05] As nations, we have known hardships and division. But we have also found solace and sympathy in one another. In just four years, before we issued our Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin came to the Irish Parliament and declared and described it as -- I quote -- \"disposed to be friends of America\" -- end of quote. In turn, the next Ireland -- turn, the text of Ireland's 1960 proclamation displayed mainly in the main foyer of this building, draws on the support of Ireland Ireland's exiled children in America, the quote, draws on the support of Ireland Ireland's exiled children in America. We're nations that know what it means to persevere for freedom, to brave a civil war, to toil in the vineyards of democracy. That's again not hyperbole. It's a fact. It's a fact. It's not just the hope, but the conviction that better days lie ahead that have brought us along. We have the power to build a better future; 60 years ago, it was referenced, the first Irish Catholic president of the United States made a historic trip here, speaking to this Assembly and capturing the imaginations of Irish and Irish-American families alike. When John Kennedy addressed Parliament, he honored the more than 150,000 Irish immigrants who joined the Army of the North during America's civil war, and among them, one or two of them were my relatives as well. They signed up in a new land to stand for old values, to defend freedom and the dignity of all people. Think about this. Name another country, in whatever their language is, that use the word dignity as much as the Irish use the word dignity. It matters. My dad used to say: \"Everybody, Joey, everybody\" -- and he meant it -- \"is entitled to be treated with dignity, no matter who they are.\" President Kennedy honored their courage and sacrifice by presenting to this body the flag of the Irish Brigade, which hangs out here to this very day. Likewise, I was honored to receive an Irish flag from the taoiseach during the recent St. Patrick's Day celebration in Washington. It was flown to commemorate the Irish and who first raised the tricolor in Ireland 175 years ago and who supposed -- subsequently made his way to America, where he led the Irish Brigade in that Civil War, the Civil War battle. These like symbols holding a place of honor in Leinster House and White House embody a century of history between our countries, connections that irrevocably have shaped the understanding of the world and our hope that we put in it. Our history reminds us, our history, ours, yours and mine, reminds us of the responsibilities we have in the president -- excuse me -- the present, to the hopes of our ancestors, to the expectation of future generations, because you know what it means to fight for democracy. Today, Ireland and the United States are standing together to oppose Russia's brutal aggression and support the brave people of Ukraine. I spent many days in Ukraine. (APPLAUSE)",

Security Council.Working together, Ireland and the United States helped change the way the U.N. sanctions were implemented to ensure they do not hamper humanitarian efforts. The new humanitarian carve-out will make sanctions more effective and save lives. Ireland's support for Ukraine is especially meaningful, because you carry the moral authority with nations around the world. Ireland's always been a voice for liberty, global cooperation and equality of all mankind, because Ireland remembers the terrible cost of war. You have built an international credibility as peacekeepers, stepping up continuously to serve in the U.N. peacekeeping missions since Ireland's first development -- since Ireland's first deployment in 1958. Because Ireland remembers what it means to have to flee home, leaving everything behind and begin again on foreign shores, the Irish people have generously opened their hearts, their homes, and you have welcomed, as you have said, nearly 80,000, nearly 80,000 Ukrainian refugees. I would argue the rest of the world has an obligation to help you maintain that as well, because Ireland remembers the painful hollows of the great hunger. And you're today a global leader in food security as well. Ireland's committed fully 20 percent of your aid budget to fighting global hunger. And in a moment where people around the world are struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic, Russia's war in Ukraine, Ireland is growing its aid budget and expanding its commitment to help vulnerable people, especially partner nations across Africa. I particularly want to thank you for stepping up alongside the United States to help UNICEF and the World Health Organization fight malnutrition and child wasting. Ireland's contribution of 50 million euros is helping prevent to -- the -- and treat wasting, child wasting, and supply ready-to-use therapeutic foods and reach a half-a- million children in Africa, a half-a-million children. You're changing lives. Ireland also remembers, as I do, that peace is indispensable. Peace is the necessary foundation for progress, for growth, for unlocking the enormous potential that exists in every part of this island. This week marks a vital milestone for peace, 25 years ago, the Belfast Good Friday Agreement; 25 years ago, one of my best friends in the Senate, a great, great friend to this day, who is George Mitchell, as he said, there were 300 days of failure -- or 700 days of failure and one day of success, but it was a success that one day. But more is to be done. Yesterday, I was in Belfast to honor those who commit themselves to peace to reiterate the enduring support of the United States for the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland's democratic institutions, and help accelerate the enormous economic growth that is opening new futures for young people in Northern Ireland. As I pointed out, there are literally hundreds of American corporations ready to come in and invest, invest, but they're cautious, because the institutions are not in place. We must never forget that peace, even as it become and -- lived reality for an entire generation of young people, peace is precious. It still needs its champions, still needs to be nurtured. The Good Friday didn't change -- it just changed lives for the better in Northern Ireland. It has significant positive exact across the Republic of Ireland as well. As the taoiseach and I have discussed, including last month in Washington and again today, how Ireland and the United States can work together with the United Kingdom and the European Union to support the people of Northern Ireland, I think -- I think that the United Kingdom should be working closer with Ireland in this effort and in this endeavor. Political violence must never again be allowed to take hold in this island. (APPLAUSE)",

My greatest regret is my grandfather Finnegan, who was an Irish-American whose grandfather was Owen Finnegan, who made the effort. And he was a great athlete, went to Santa Clara University, and he was a newspaper guy on the business side. And I never understood what he meant when he said: \"Joey, I worry about you.\" He'd lean over. I'd say: \"Pop, what do you worry about?\" He said: \"You're too much -- you're too much like that guy who led the revolution,\" he said of the guy who was the prime minister.

Now, just in to CNN, a law enforcement source has confirmed that an arrest is soon -- is expected soon of a 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman.

But \"The New York Times\" is reporting his name. And according to \"The Times,\" this is 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, who was the leader of this group chat that had been -- he had been posting these classified documents over the course of several months as part of a chat that was filled with teenagers and young men. And what \"The Washington Post\" has reported in the last several hours is that this is someone who started this chat during the pandemic. He wanted to show off to younger -- younger members of that community. He wanted to show that he had access to these kinds of highly classified documents. And, importantly, there were, according to \"The Washington Post,\" foreign nationals in this group chat, which we should note appeared on the social media platform Discord, which is now itself cooperating with law enforcement. So we are learning a little bit more here about who could have been behind this leak. We had heard earlier that law enforcement wanted to speak to this 21-year-old Air National Guardsman. Now we are learning that an arrest is expected pretty imminently -- Abby.",
