Some people who we have met they have told us that this is a profoundly emotional juncture for them as they move from this lush landscape to try to move and see it through this area and see what has survived. We met a woman, Susan, who told us exactly that. Listen to what she said. SUSAN SLOBDNJAK, 31-YEAR MAUI RESIDENT: Well, I drove through Lahaina for the first time on Friday. Okay I again live up north, you know, seven miles out of Lahaina and that night of the fires. We were watching the sunset on one side, and it seemed like the sunset on the other side from the flame. And we did not know how serious it was. And when I drove through on Friday, I had no clue what I was going through. Everything's gone. I worked at the Chart House in 1991. It is flat to the ground. There's houses that I used to live in Lahaina that I don't even know where they were. And you know, I lost friends in there, you know, they were going back to get their animals, you know, and she died. So I mean, you know, it's really sad because people come over here, you know, I heard there was a snorkeling boat looking at Lahaina Town. Give them respect, you know, it's so bad.

He's the Lieutenant Governor in Georgia, but with that comes real power because he also is President of the State Senate. And so what happened was, Jeff Duncan parted not just with President Trump, but other conservative members of the General Assembly that were pushing the stop-the-steal effort. He can talk about those discussions among Republican elected officials in the General Assembly, those decisions, he can talk about the pushback and why he and other Republicans or Democrats felt that it was improper, for example, to give Rudy Giuliani the platform that he was afforded by some members of the General Assembly to spread election misinformation and disinformation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says at least 17 shelling attacks were reported in Kherson on Sunday. Ukraine is calling Russia's boarding of a cargo vessel in the Black Sea a deliberate attack and act of piracy. And it wants the international community to recognize it as a crime. Those comments coming after Russia's defense ministry said one of its warships fired warning shots and servicemen boarded a cargo ship sailing under the flag of Palau that it claims was headed to Ukraine.

Russia had already said after pulling out of that Black Sea grain deal that it would consider any ship heading to Ukraine as potentially carrying weapons.It's making it clear did it plans to enforce this. I think, look, this is also coming after Ukraine said last week it was planning to open up temporary humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea for merchant ships, including those still trapped in Ukrainian ports. So what exactly happened? Well, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, this ship, this Palau flagged cargo vessel, we don't exactly know what the cargo was at this point or whether it was carrying any, but it apparently, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to requests to stop for an inspection so they fired those warning shots and then a helicopter load of Russian servicemen landed on this ship apparently carried out the inspection and then let the ship go on its way. Now according to its tracking data it's now just over an hour and a half away from the Romanian port of Sulina which is in the mouth of the Danube River and the Black Sea and on the way to the Ukrainian Danube River port of Ismail which is where the Russian Ministry of Defense said the ship was heading in the first place. So it's being allowed, it seems, to carry on its way. But again, as I say, clearly this was a warning by Russia and Ukraine's foreign ministry condemning this again this morning, saying these actions exemplified Russia's deliberate policy of endangering the freedom of navigation and safety of commercial shipping in the Black Sea.
