Also ahead, stunning aerials give us a glimpse into the bombardment of Bakhmut. More details about the fighting in the embattled Ukrainian city. And heavy-handed punishment for comedian's joke that made reference to China's Military. And now measures against the Chinese women who defended him. The projection of unity and strength in a city with international and historical significance, U.S. President Joe Biden is in Hiroshima, Japan, the site of the world's first ever nuclear attack for the G7 summit, which is set to begin on Friday. Earlier, the President met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, he emphasized close relations between Tokyo and Washington amid China's growing military and economic threat, and he acknowledged the challenges that global leaders now face.

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, I think, on both fronts, there will be as they call it, in the diplomatic speak some deliverables that come it's been a major focus of President Biden's advisors, top advisors to G7 leaders in the lead up to this meeting behind the scenes Finance Ministers meeting as well.And I think it underscores the reality of this moment certainly set to an almost visceral backdrop here, given the tenuous nature of the geopolitical scene at this moment in time when it comes to the war. And Ukraine, the G7 economies, nearly 50 percent of the global economy has been absolutely critical to the Western alliance and the Western unity behind the support for Ukraine over the course of this year plus war. And you will see more of that both on the economic sanctions front and also on lethal assistance at coming out of this meeting. There are some disputes still, the U.S. is still holding back on pursuing F-16 fighter jet capability for the Ukrainians. That has been something that has been simmering for several months that is unlikely to change in terms of the U.S. position. But the primary goal will be to continue to maintain that public show of unity that's been so critical. And I when it comes to China, the U.S. actually much further along than perhaps some of their allies here at the G7 on the economic side, as well as trying to build up defense capabilities in this region. And I think there's probably no better place a no better leader than Prime Minister Kishida a demonstrate just how dramatically, things have shifted here in this region over the course of the last year and a half the kind of connective thread between what has happened in Ukraine. And what allies in this region view as a distinct possibility as it comes to Taiwan amidst China's rise is certainly a driving force behind dramatic domestic shifts here in Japan but also regionally, something the U.S. has certainly supported been behind and trying to kind of push more towards. And I think both of those issues will certainly be something that President Biden has focused on. But you can't forget that what's happening back home in the U.S. is certainly going to be hanging over all of this. There is still a debt ceiling deadline just two weeks away, Bianca, the President's negotiating team is still back in the U.S. working on that for leaders used to this at this point. The U.S. does this a lot when it comes to these deadlines, but certainly, given the scale of the global economy or economic power that's here. They would like to see some kind of resolution on that front.",

Phil Mattingly, thank you so much for being with us. To Ukraine now where in the past few hours the army has declared new gains around the embattled City of Bakhmut.A military spokesman says units are advancing despite a shortfall in ammunition and personnel. You're looking at some of the very latest images to come out of Bakhmut. Russia's Wagner mercenary fighters say that they're making progress there too. Elsewhere, at least one person was killed in a missile strike in the Southern Port City of Odessa. It came amid a large wave of new strikes. Ukraine says it shut down 29 out of 30 missiles launched by Russia overnight. While in Crimea, a freight train has derailed. For more on that let's go to our Sam Kiley, who's in Southeastern Ukraine. Sam, Crimean railways have said that this train derailment has happened because of outside interference. But a Ukrainian official had said that the railway simply got tired.

Now that joke, it went online, it went viral. And then on Wednesday, Beijing police launched an investigation into Li and authorities also find the company that represents him nearly 2 million U.S. dollars. Now, we heard this from the Beijing Municipal bureau of Culture and Tourism. They said this we have the statement for you, \"We will never allow any company or individual to wantonly slander the glorious image of the People's Liberation Army on this stage in the Chinese capital.\" Now the bureau added that the company would never be allowed to stage any future shows in Beijing. The company which had earlier already issued an apology has fired the comedian. The comedian pictured on your screen the harsher he has apologized profusely online. Now, some context here and China, insults slander against the military are illegal. In fact, in 2021, that was trying to pass a law banning insults against military personnel and the Chinese public. If you look at social media posts a peer to be divided over this, you know, some people online, they're praising the government's decision saying that joke was insulting but others are, fearing a wider crackdown on comedy and it's very easy to see why?

And that set people off saying, well, you know, of course they couldn't be and where are the pictures? To be fair to the Sussexes and they never said it was a high speed chase, when I spoke to someone in their entourage. They made it very clear there were sticking to the speed limits and the rules of the road. They never felt under threat. But they did feel the lives of other people were under threat by the paparazzi going up onto the sidewalk crossing the road going through red lights, and then potentially harming other people. Playing into this, of course, is Harry's perception of all of this. He very much blames the paparazzi for the death of his mother. He's talked about how he gets triggered by the sound of flashbulbs It was late at night, it is a scary situation. And he would feel certain vulnerability in that situation, tied with the fact that he committed to protect his wife from that. So I think there's a lot that goes on in here.
