Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade filling in for Becky Anderson. Welcome back to \"Connect the World\"! Well, we begin with a high stakes meeting and its global impact. U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting earlier today in person for the first time since Mr. Biden took office. The U.S. President called the meeting open and candid as the leaders of the world's largest economies discussed Ukraine and North Korea, along with trade, climate change human rights and much more in three hours of discussions. One of the most important topics was Taiwan. President Xi stated that the self-governing Island is at the core of his nation's interests and a red line that can't be crossed. President Biden said he doesn't see China invading Taiwan anytime soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This turned out better than expectations. They agreed on more than one point. But the key takeaway from this meeting, Lynda, is that they both want to stop this relationship from getting worse. In the opening statements they both address the idea that they've got a responsibility to the international community to stabilize this relationship for the better of the world for the better of global peace. So they decided to restore communications at the high level and at the working level and signaled a restart in communications around climate changes, around global food and health security issues. So that is a major improvement because talks between these two nations had reached a new low after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan back in August. In retaliation to her visit to the island, China cut off a whole range of communications with the United States. So it's a big deal that they're agreeing to restart communications on so many areas and the White House readout afterwards, the White House had actually said that they want to send Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing at some point in the near future. But underlying all of the handshakes and smiles that we saw at this in person meeting, there are still major fundamental differences between these two countries. There are still a lot of mutual distrust and hostility. Beijing views America increasingly as a hostile force that is trying to contain and suppress its rise. They point to the recent sweeping export restrictions from the Biden Administration that chokes off China's access to these critical advanced semiconductor chips whereas Washington has recently labeled Beijing as America's most consequential geopolitical challenge. Washington often painting China as a force that wants to supplant America's dominance in the world so these fundamental changes not going to be resolved from one person to person meeting however, this is a start.",

It's impossible to overstate just howcore the Taiwan issue is to the very legitimacy and DNA of the Communist Party? Now in the readout, I just want to show you what Xi Jinping has said according to the Chinese side, \"The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of U.S./China relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed and China/U.S. relations, resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and China's internal affairs\". Now we know that tensions were ratcheting rapidly following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan we saw China increase the military drills even encircling the island in a practice blockade - up the military pressure. We did not expect this meeting to resolve this fundamental difference on Taiwan. However, it is simmering it is lowering those tensions because they've now agreed to restart all of these communications. Global peace really hinges on these two leaders finding the time finding open lines to talk to each other. That is what reduces the risk of miscalculation that could spiral into conflict.

It was a different kind of hardship here in Kherson, but the city was functioning albeit with the uncertainty and the terror of having Russian troops in control. There was food more or less, there was water more or less, and there was electricity, more or less, all of that stopped five days ago. And it is a very cold place right now. Winter is coming and this is a desperate situation for people. But the government stepping up today, they put up a temporary cellphone tower in the center of the city giving some people connectivity back to friends and relatives and the rest of the country.

And this has really come as a huge shock to many in Istanbul despite the fact that Turkey is of course no stranger to such attacks. We have seen video today of many gathering at the scene to leave flowers and to pay their respects for those who lost their lives or were injured in the incident. But we are of course also learning more details around the primary suspect behind this attack as identified by the Turkish authorities. We've seen now video being released by the Turkish authorities of what appears to have been a raid at an apartment in western Istanbul showing the authorities they're arresting a Syria national a woman believed to be behind this attack at gunpoint following this incident. They say they tracked her down after analyzing CCTV footage from across the city including one video which appears to show this individual according to the authorities leaving a bag in the center of this busy High Street shortly after she leaves this bag the explosion takes place. So there is of course a void. There are questions around the motive behind this incident. The Turkish authorities have said that they believe this was a terrorist incident. They have identified her as a Syrian national and say that she had links connections and was trained by Kurdish separatist groups, namely the Kurdistan Workers Party or the PKK, which is designated by Turkey, the United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization. We have heard condemnation from Turkey's international partners including the United States, the White House Press Secretary saying that the United States and the Biden Administration stands shoulder to shoulder with Turkey in its fight against terrorism. But this hasn't been received as well as perhaps the U.S. might have anticipated by the Turkish authorities.

From this standpoint, us targeting the civilian population in any way is definitely out of the question. Turkish authorities have an interior minister has said that Turkey will respond firmly in the future once responsibility for this attack is understood and confirmed. There is of course concern around the wider context here, Turkey and Kurdish separatist groups have been in conflict for decades now a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. And of course, we have seen Turkey launching its own incursion in the past in northern Syria, in its attempt to target what it has described as terrorist groups linked as Kurdish separatist movements in the region.

The campus was locked down overnight while police searched for the suspected gun man. Well, it's been almost one week since the U.S. midterm elections and Republicans appear to be inching closer to controlling the U.S. House of Representatives. CNN projects that the Republicans have won 212 seats and just needed six more to get the house, 19 races remain uncalled mostly in western states and it could take weeks to know all the results. Democrats celebrated over the weekend when Catherine Cortez Masto was declared the winner in the divider senate race, giving them control of the senate. There is still one senate seat still undecided, the race in Georgia between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Warnock - Herschel Walker, rather will head to a run-off in early December. Our Dianne Gallagher is in Georgia tracking that runoff, Diane, good to see you. So just how important is this run-off? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, Lynda, this is important not just for 2022, but also looking ahead for 2024 Democrats, especially making sure that they work to try and keep enthusiasm with voters here in Georgia up because many people just like you said heard that Democrats are maintaining control of the senate. Once CNN projected that Catherine Cortez Masto would keep her seat there in Nevada, they don't want the voters to think that that means that the seat doesn't matter anymore. Democrats have a very difficult road ahead in 2024, with the seats that come up in states that have trended more towards Republicans in the past year, including Montana, Ohio, West Virginia. And so essentially, they want to be able to net as many seats as they can this time around to brace for any kind of issues. They may have an election in 2024. Meanwhile, Republicans are essentially looking to do the same. They also don't want to deal with the fact that they potentially may have less clout than they currently have now with that evenly split 50,50 senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris being that deciding vote to break a tie. They've relied on some of those more conservative Republicans like Senator Joe Manchin or Senator Kyrsten Sinema to be able to sort of lobby against their own party in some ways to bring some of those bills away from more progressive matters. If Senator Raphael Warnock is able to pull out this run-off election Lynda, they may not have to be beholden to Manchin or Sinema so much to Democrats and the Senate. So there is that aspect. There was an education campaign going as well, though, because of course, even though they voted here in Georgia last year in a run-off election, so much has changed because of this controversial new election law here in the state of Georgia, that voters are up against a very different set of rules this time. And for both Republicans and Democrats it's important to make sure those voters understand that this time around.",

If he was running for another term, if he won the Republican nomination, and if he was still pursuing this idea that he was forced out of power unfairly, two years ago. The problem with that is, you know, Trump is not a logical choice for a lot of Republican voters. He's an emotional one; he has a real bond with the grassroots of the party that will decide who the Republican nominee is in 2024. It may need an alternative candidate, someone like Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida to actively try to push Trump out of the nomination race and that is something that would not just be a high risk to him, it would really threaten to pull the party apart. So it doesn't look like Trump is going to conclude that he was at fault and he should go away. Someone may have to make it happen. And that's very problematic, I think inside the Republican Party.",

The candidate for the Republicans in Georgia, Herschel Walker is basically a creation of Donald Trump.

He also lashed out at a former teammate, Wayne Rooney. The 37 year old suggested that Rooney was jealous that he looks better than him. And he's still playing at a high level while Rooney is retired. That was after the ex-England captain was critical of Ronaldo's behavior this season. Well, my colleague Becky Anderson sat down with Rooney in Dubai recently and got his thoughts on Manchester United season. Ronaldo's antics and what he would do if you were coach, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD (voice over): Wayne Rooney is a household name, one of the best football players of his generation. He did it all in a beautiful game from playing in World Cups to Champions League finals, ultimately becoming England and Manchester United's all-time top goal scorer, he's in Dubai ahead of the globe soccer awards. Now in its 13th edition, the ceremony this year will be acknowledging the careers of some past icons of the sport. Rooney is of course nominated his 20 year roller coaster ride at the top, undoubtedly something special to witness. Let's talk about the career. Take me back. What are you most proud of? WAYNE ROONEY, FORMER ENGLAND &amp; MANCHESTER UNITED FOOTBALLER: As it's so many different things which you can look at, whether that's winning Premier League titles, Champions League gold records, the moments you have with your team when you win a trophy and you lift that trophy and the celebrations you have initially after that, that game. And that's what your works well for. A real problem for me was when we won the FA Cup and lost a few finals. And then I was captain obviously, it was me and my --for the last two players from our time early in. Michael was vice captain. So we lifted the trophy together and the two of us. But then after the game, the commercial team wanted to take the trophy. There's two different parties one of the players and families wants the commercial teams, sponsors so they want to take the trophies, so there's no house left to take it so I had the trophy all night, took it back to bed. So then me two hours boys are in bed, so then to slept with the FA Cup in between. ANDERSON (voice over): Now 37, Rooney is turned his attention to coaching. He relocated to Washington to coach DC United and before. That had a tumultuous rain at Darby County in England. While there debt spirals and the club failed to pay players deducted points for financial mismanagement, Derby are eventually relegated. ANDERSON (on camera): What tough was that time?",

And we gave him just players who maybe didn't even have a career in football, which now have the EFL stopped us from doing various things. We cut down players to play for the academy, but not for the first team. There were so many difficulties in what we're facing in obstacles just to try and get over. ANDERSON (on camera): You were part of what is known as the golden generation with Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, those two are managing now as you are. Frank Lampard, managing editor in Euro club, Steven Gerrard was managing Aston Villa, how tough is it as one of the youngster particularly one of that golden generation English players who did so well on the pitch to get in there and become successful as a coach?",

Then if you understand you read all different stories like off the outside of the game,he was really laid back and you could joke around him and he might banter with him and stuff. But then obviously when match day comes that's when you can see get serious and yes, - for the players. You have to beat in disagreements and I think that's good. I encourage that now with my players to have debate and speak up because normally when you're debating you get an answer, you come to a conclusion, whether it's the right one or wrong one, you know, we got to a conclusion on it. So what not he was great to play for is the reason I signed much nicer to play for him, so I really enjoyed the time on them.

And naturally that's kind of dropped off at some point and as you see probably for the two of them, it has done nothing. All he has to do is just keep working out and waiting for his opportunity to come in I'm sure when - like he deserved it and you'll take it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
