The Supreme Court making a major ruling tonight, one that many across the United States were waiting anxiously to hear. The court ruling just hours before a midnight deadline, right? So we're on a Friday night here, 7:00 Eastern, just this ruling coming out. They're ruling that a widely used abortion drug mifepristone will remain available for now. Okay. So here's the crucial context here. It was just two weeks ago that a Trump appointed federal judge suspended the medications approval by the FDA. So an appeals court then decided to impose restrictions on the drug that included blocking mail delivery requiring a doctor visit to get it determining what point during a pregnancy. The drug could be used all of this. So, it goes to the Supreme Court, which is now weighed in which is stopping those lower court rulings from taking place. Now, here's the key, at least until the appeals process plays out, which could take months, so they're going to allow it to be sold while the appeals process works its way through the system. We have a team of reporters standing by. Paula Reid live in Washington, Phil Mattingly at the White House. So, Paula, let me start with you. What more can you tell us about this ruling, which literally is coming in the hours before the midnight deadline.",

Lawsuits about this medication worked their way through the appeals system.And you touched on this, but mifepristone, along with one other drugs, they are used in a process called medication abortion that accounts for over half of all abortions in the United States. And last year, after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, a lot of attention turned towards medication abortion not only in conservative state legislatures but also in litigation. And as you noted just a few weeks ago, a judge who was specifically targeted in Texas invalidated the FDA's longstanding approval of mifepristone, and the question before the Supreme Court over the past few days as well, all right, what happens with that decision, while that case works its way through the appeals process? They had a lot of options. We weren't quite sure exactly what they were going to do, but they have decided to put that decision on hold, to allow this drug to remain widely available, while this case makes its way made through the appeals court. But, Erin, this is not likely going to be the last time the Supreme Court weighs in on this because this case is going to be heard at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. They have said it on an expedited schedule. Oral arguments are scheduled for May 17th and whatever happens there will be appealed. So, the Supreme Court will likely have to weigh in first to decide if they want to hear the case and if they do hear the case to make an ultimate decision on the merits here. Now, we'll note, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both dissented publicly, but this is a big win for the Biden White House.",

That's what they said. Let the states decide. There's no federal constitutional right to an abortion.And so this one judge in Texas that was clearly forum-shopped and picked by the people who are antiabortion. They went to a place in Texas, where they knew there was a judge that was 100 percent pro- life, anti-abortion and he's the only judge who sits there, Judge Kacsmaryk. They went there specifically knowing he would rule this way. There's many people around the country scratching their heads, saying, how can one judge in Texas outlaw this medication for everybody, including in places where abortion is legal. So, I'm very delighted and happy that the Supreme Court has pressed pause. It is not a complete victory because it's just a pause, while this winds its way through the appellate system.",

RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL AT DEPT. OF DEFENSE:  So there's a good chance that this will thrust the decision back to the Supreme Court in the summer of 2024. The reason is, let's say that there are all argument does take place on May 17th and they take a couple of months before they issue an opinion at the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit.

It's a radical position that's been taken by the courts below.So, would they really want to flip back a bunch of other Supreme Court precedents to try to take that claim? They've sent a signal the fact. That they only had two justices in dissent, Alito and Thomas, which were expected, is a signal to the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit is a very conservative court, but now they might be thinking, okay, if we go in a certain direction of overturning the FDA, we're going to be overturned by the Supreme Court.

The deadline is midnight. That abortion pill will now be allowed to be sold as this works its way through the appeals process. Your reaction? REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA):  Well, thanks for having me this afternoon. But let me just tell you we can definitely breathe a sigh of relief. The status quo exists. But we have to be concerned, though about the future in terms of the attempts by the far right to try to enact a national abortion ban, and I believe that they are going to continue, and that's why as Pro- Choice Caucus co-chair we have to make sure that we fight to get the Women's Health Protection Act passed, and that we codified put into law the right to an abortion.

He's clearly close to the Kremlin, and there have been questions about what's going to happen with his son who is of, you know, fighting age in Russia, and he's been somewhat defensive about this.So, now, there's this Prigozhin comment that, oh, yeah, he served in the Wagner Group. It's unclear as to whether or not Prigozhin continues to see a political future for himself, you know, ascending inside of the criminal, perhaps even replacing some of the leaders there with Putin and is that why he's -- why he's trying to gain friends, like Peskov. If so, I mean, it's an amazing breaking of the Kremlin rules about how you how you play politics in that country. It's very dangerous thing, but it's so much of this is business meaning behind the scenes, it's difficult to see what Prigozhin is up to with Peskov on this particular story.",

Now there are 10.Congresswoman Laura Lee is still the sole endorsement for DeSantis before his expected campaign launch. This is on the same day a new poll from \"The Wall Street Journal\" shows Trump with twice the support against DeSantis among GOP voters for 2024, look at that, 48 versus 24. Some Republican donors have now been taking notice. Thomas Peterffy, who is a major GOP donor, told \"The Financial Times\" and I quote him, because of his stance on abortion and book banning myself and a bunch of friends are holding our powder dry. OUTFRONT now, another longtime Republican donor, Dan Eberhart. And, Dan, I really appreciate your time. You know what's amazing about this is a few months ago, every Republican donor was interested in DeSantis. A lot of them were doing anything you know, give as much money given to DeSantis, right?
