Freezing rain and sleet making even for more for -- even more dangerous roads and road conditions across southern portions of the United States. A state trooper in Oklahoma caught this scary moment on camera, a semi losing control on the icy roads. You can see it there. In Texas, more than 200,000 people are without power right now. And the storm system is, of course, racking up some major flight cancellations and delays.Ed Lavandera is at Dallas Fort Worth airport for us at this hour. Ed, it was rough going yesterday.

And we're seeing the same thing again today and expecting that situation to worsen. The flights that are getting out are coming down here to the south end of the runway at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and getting de-iced before they take off.And we have seen throughout the morning hours a number of flights taking off. They spent a great deal of time here. As you see their three teams of -- spraying this particular American airplane -- American Airlines flight. And hopefully, these fine people are going off to somewhere warmer. But that is what's going on here at the airport where cancellations are expected to worsen. And right now, the Dallas Fort Worth area has been kind of in this pocket of dryness as much of the state has been hit hard by sleet and freezing rain from far West Texas all the way to East Texas as well. So, that continues. But the conditions are supposed to deteriorate here later today. It's essentially a third round of this wintry mix expected to hit the Dallas Fort Worth area later today, Kate.",

So, a lot of people asking the question, is this really it for Tom Brady?If you watch him deliver that message there, you got to think it certainly is. He's 45 years old now. And it's just been a pleasure watching him for the past 23 years, Kate. And you got to think about this 23 years, Tom Brady went to 10 Super Bowls.

You know, watching him win Super Bowls in his 40s was just amazing.I always liked and appreciated watching Tom Brady, especially, Kate, because he was one of the few great athletes that were still older than me.

Well, we are working on getting more details from the U.S. military but the U.S. Naval Fifth Fleet, which works in the region did confirm to our colleague, Haley Britzky, that they were involved in this operation with what they call a partner force. They say in the statement to CNN that they were involved by sharing information and helping coordinate the overall effort. We also ultimately took custody of the confiscated weapons through a ship-to-ship transfer with partner forces.Now, the Wall Street Journal, as you noted, is reporting that those partners were the French, so this was an elite French team that boarded this suspected smuggling ship from a French warship. It is -- it is believed that these Iranian-made weapons were destined for Yemen. Of course, for years, Kate, the Iranians have been supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen. They control much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. There is an arms embargo against sending weapons to the Houthis. There has been a fragile ceasefire in Yemen for the past nine months. But this would be an indication that Iran does continue to support these Houthi rebels, which have used some of these weapons to fire against neighboring Saudi Arabia. We also heard some details from a U.S. official about what was seized, Kate. It was more than 3000 assault rifles, more than half a million rounds of ammunition, and some 23 anti-tank guided missiles. So, that's quite a haul. Again, the U.S. took custody of those weapons that they -- working alongside that partner force the French. We have reached out to the French government and to the French Embassy here in Washington, we're waiting more details from them as well, Kate.",

That is a -- more than a billion dollars worth of alleged corrupt deals with -- these two major companies were actually nationalized as part of the war effort late last year. Now, the -- some of the leadership in that organization is under suspicion or indeed, has been detained or arrest warrant has been issued for them.On top of that, a $1.2 billion equivalent tax scam allegedly involving very senior leadership indeed, in Kyiv. With a raid on one leader's house, they're revealing a large amount of U.S. dollars in cash, luxury vehicles, expensive watches, stuff that an ordinary tax official even at the top of his game would not be able to afford. And on top, of that the arrest of a defense official over the purchase of defective bulletproof vests. And that is going to be extremely difficult for him come a prosecution, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the Feds warned, inflation isn't over but the strategy is shifting. So, for much of last year, the Fed was spiking interest rates at almost an unprecedented pace trying desperately to get inflation under control. But then in December, they dialed it back a notch. Instead of 75 basis points, they raised interest rates by 50 basis points. And today, they're supposed to -- they're expected to dial it back even further, going down to 25 basis points.Now, this would be an acknowledgment that the Fed's tough medicine appears to be working. Inflation is still hot, but it is cooling off. Things are getting better. So, what does all this mean for everyday people? Well, borrowing costs, they're still going higher, right? Mortgage rates, credit cards, car loans, but they may not be going dramatically higher. And the Fed -- the Fed is still trying to slow this economy down. But they've gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to just tapping the brakes. And that is an important shift. Because all along, Kate, the fear has been that the Fed would go too far and end up slowing this economy right into a recession. If they're able to slow the pace of rate hikes and maybe even pause altogether, that will raise hopes that they can achieve a soft landing.",
