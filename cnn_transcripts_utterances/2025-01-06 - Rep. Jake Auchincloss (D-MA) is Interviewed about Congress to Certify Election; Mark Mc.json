The Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigning from \"The Washington Post\" after the newspaper refused to publish this satirical cartoon depicting \"Post\" owner Jeff Bezos on bended knee in front of President-elect Trump, handing over bags of cash. Meta founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and OpenAI chief Sam Altman also in the cartoon, with a lipstick-holding \"Los Angeles Times\" owner Patrick Soon-Shiong and a bowing Mickey Mouse. Of course, Disney. Talnaes had been with the paper since 2008. In a post announcing her resignation she wrote this, quote, \"I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations - and some differences - about cartoons that I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I've never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at. Until now.\" Last month Bezos dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida after Amazon announced they'd donate $1 million to his inauguration. He also personally made the decision to kill an indorsement for Vice President Harris for president that the newspaper's editorial board had drafted. The CEOs of Google, Apple, TikTok, and Meta have also made the trek to Mar-a-Lago, which has prompted this election from the president-elect.

My personality changed or something. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
