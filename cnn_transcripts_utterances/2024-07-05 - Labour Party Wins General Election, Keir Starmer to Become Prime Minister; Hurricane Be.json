We just saw Jeremy Hunt, the outgoing Chancellor of Exchequer, enter Number 11 behind me just a few minutes ago, who is obviously packing and will be leaving in fairly short order. He was also a Minister that there was much debate about whether he would lose.So, you've seen conservative ministers and former Prime Minister who are on the right of the party do badly. You've seen those in the center of the Conservative Party, like Penny Mordaunt who was former Defense Secretary, who was somebody that was seen could be a potential new leader for a more centrified, if you will, Conservative Party. You see Suella Braverman, the former Home Secretary, who's on the right flank of the party, who's also perhaps got a leadership challenge for the Conservative Party coming up. She survived in the election. So, the real tussle perhaps for the Conservative Party trying to read the room and read what Nigel Farage is doing, which is pulling away voters from the Conservative Party who don't think that the party's been tough enough on what it's demanded in terms of Brexit, but definitely on what it's achieved so far in terms of combating immigration. That tussle for what becomes the Conservative Party, but of course that tussle is what we've seen play out over the past 14 years, and it's really what has undermined in the big picture the Conservative Party in that time. Now of course they won't be trying to govern the country as they work out their future, but that is their way back to power. But Nigel Farage, as you say, won a significant percentage, or his party expected to win a significant percentage of the votes, talking about the U.K.'s first-past-the-post system where, you know, in one constituency, whichever person gets the most votes in that constituency wins the seat, talking about proportional representation, which is something groups like Clyde Cymru, the Nationalist Party in Wales, the SNP in Scotland and others will be wanting to voice, and Liberal Democrats as well, wanting to add their voices too undoubtedly.",

What does it mean for our relationship with the United States? If Donald Trump was to win in November, that relationship will probably be a bit more complicated, but I think both governments will be determined to make it work. I'm not too bothered about that. It is the case that Donald Trump has been supportive of Brexit and Nigel Farage and the hard-right parties in the United Kingdom, but I think if there's a very large majority for an incoming British government, and they've already said nice things about working with the Labour Party, even if it is a Trump administration, I think they will make this work. There are so many important issues that they've got to work together on, and so I think they'll make it work. I don't think it'll be too problematic.",

Farage had said, I'm not running, and a few days after that, Rishi Sunak said, okay, we're going to have a general election on the 4th of July. And then Farage changed his mind, and even though his party will not win more than, I don't know, 11 or 12 seats, it seems, he will have scooped up an awful lot of the traditional Conservative voters in a way that has destroyed the Conservative majority, but has not translated into very many seats for the Farage party. But it does mean that public opinion, especially in the center and the center-right, has moved a bit further right, and I think that what Sunak was trying to do was to capture some of those voters before it was too late, before they went off to Farage, but it obviously didn't work.",

So the floor is not going to fall out for Joe Biden.But the question going into the debate was where could he make up the votes to overcome what has become a deficit, right? I mean, where he was trailing in national polling. And as I said, we're probably behind today in all seven of the swing states and within range only in three of them. He was the one who needed to add to his pile of chips. And when you have these kinds of doubts, it just makes it very hard to see where you go to get over the top. And it's also reflective of kind of the dynamic here, where once this idea really has been imprinted so strongly on Americans from this debate, sharpening the questions that already existed about whether he was physically and mentally up to doing the job for another four and a half years, pretty much anything that can, you know -- the points in that direction is going to resonate more powerfully than it did before the debate. So, this kind of comment, I think it's just an early preview of the challenge the White House will face and the Democrats will face if he stays in the race, because there are going to be many things that kind of add to the concern of voters who are already anxious about this.",

Look, you know, Marine Le Pen's party has watered down some of its more extreme policies, I think realizing that there are these fiscal constraints, but we did see when Macron called that snap election, we saw French bond yields soar out of this expectation that were going to get the right leaning government in France, that's going to turn away from fiscal prudence if you will.We saw Le Pen not necessarily winning as many seats as some I thought she might. On Monday this week, we saw kind of the relief rarely in markets perhaps the worst-case scenario not materializing. But in France, you kind of have a situation where both the far left and the far right are making quite big promises on tax and spending and that is making markets nervous.",

      "sentences": "For a month, Israel and Hamas have been engaged in start and stop negotiations to try and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal. And now, there appears to be major progress in those negotiations, and that's because those negotiations for months now have focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, the broad strokes of how this deal would work.But they have been leaving the details, the implementation, the identity of Palestinian prisoners who would be released, for example, leaving all of that to the side while they try and reach a framework. But on Thursday, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, agreeing to enter that more detailed stage of negotiations, sending his Mossad director, David Barnea, to Doha, Qatar, to begin that next phase of negotiations. And that indicates for all intents and purposes, including according to a senior administration official, that Israel and Hamas effectively have an agreement on a framework for this deal. Now, what remains ahead is still a lot of difficult and complex work about two to three weeks according to one source I spoke to, of detailed negotiations over the implementation of this agreement. And at the end of those two to three weeks, there's still no guarantee that these two sides will actually be able well, to broker a ceasefire deal. But nonetheless, this appears to be the furthest that Israel and Hamas have gotten in these negotiations since the last truce between these two sides fell apart after just a week at the very beginning of December. And so, there's certainly a lot of cautious optimism in the air from folks that I have been speaking with. And President Biden speaking with the Israeli prime minister on Thursday, emphasizing that this is an opportunity for the Israeli prime minister to, quote/unquote, close out the deal. And so, that is effectively the stage that we're at, which not only has enormous implications for the families of those hostages. For the hostages themselves, for the people of Gaza who have endured nine months of suffering, but also for the region at large, particularly at a time when tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have really been rising in recent weeks, particularly over the last 48 hours, we saw Israel taking out a senior Hezbollah commander in a drone strike in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah retaliating with more than 200 rockets and missiles fired towards the Golan Heights. And Israel striking in southern Lebanon with a series of airstrikes, certainly a ceasefire in Gaza could provide an opening that diplomatic opening that diplomats have been waiting for, looking for between Israel and Hezbollah to resolve those tensions as well.
