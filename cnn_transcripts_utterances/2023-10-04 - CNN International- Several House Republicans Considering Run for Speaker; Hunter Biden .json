      "sentences": "With all this palace intrigue among House Republicans, there is no clear frontrunner for the job of Speaker of the House. But four people do tend to emerge, tend to rise above the others in the consideration of who's going to be the next Speaker of the House. Congressman Patrick McHenry from North Carolina, Steve Scalise from Louisiana, Tom Emmer from Minnesota and Tom Cole from Oklahoma.Let's tick through their credentials for the job of House Speaker. Patrick McHenry has just been named as Interim Speaker, but that's not the only reason that he's considered a top candidate to be House Speaker. He currently serves as House Financial Services Committee chairman, an enormously important position in the House because it deals with issues like international finance, banking and housing. His profile and influence grew earlier this year when Kevin McCarthy tapped him to negotiate with the White House to raise the debt ceiling. He's one of two top candidates for the speakership who actually voted to certify Joe Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election. Let's talk about Steve Scalise from Louisiana. Currently the number two leader in the House, the House Majority Leader. He's the former Republican whip and his credentials as kind of a vote getter, a vote counter in that job, also speak to his credentials for the speakership. He survived a mass shooting at the Congressional baseball practice in 2017. He was also recently diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is cancer of the blood cells. And because of that cancer diagnosis, a lot of questions have emerged as to whether Scalise has the physical stamina and the energy to become House Speaker. Especially if there's going to be another possible shutdown showdown. The government shutdown could emerge again, possibly next month. Is he going to have the capability to handle all of that physically? He says he does. He says he feels good and that his long-term prognosis is very good. Congressman Tom Emmer from Minnesota, currently the House Majority Whip, a very important position. That's the number three position overall in the House. He's a key ally of Kevin McCarthy's, also seen, though as very close to Congressman Matt Gaetz. He led the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2020 in the 2022 election cycles. He was able to win an election for Majority Whip, that number three position, despite the fact that in those two election cycles, the Republicans did not do as well as many thought they would. He is also one of those who voted to certify Joe Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election. Then you've got Congressman Tom Cole from Oklahoma. Currently, the House Rules Committee chairman. Another very influential position in the House. He's considered the elder statesman in GOP circles, often helps settle internal battles within the party, but even he couldn't settle this one that just concluded there. He might be considered more of a caretaker for the job of speaker because he is 74 years old. Those are just four of the top candidates who are emerging as maybe the leaders to become House Speaker, but others could also emerge in the days ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

JEFFREY DELAURENTIS, U.S. ACTING DEPUTY REP. TO THE UN: The resolution makes clear the MSS mission will operate in strict compliance with international law, and include dedicated expertise in anti-gang operations, community-oriented policing, children and women's protection, and preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence. OPPMANN (voice-over): Kenyan troops are expected to lead the force with one thousand police officers on the ground for a mission that the UN authorized to last for 12 months. Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, and the Bahamas are also expected to provide personnel. The U.S. state department has promised over $100 million in aid for the effort. But foreign interventions and U.S. peacekeeping missions to Haiti have a troubled past. In 2010, UN peacekeepers working in Haiti accidentally reintroduced cholera, killing nearly 10 thousand Haitians and infecting an additional eight hundred thousand people. And a report found that UN peacekeepers fathered hundreds of children with Haitian women, and then abandoned them. The UN Secretary General told CNN it was up to the peacekeepers' home countries to make them provide for their children. ANTONIO GUTERRES, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL: But it has been very tough to make things move, very tough. There's a lot of reluctance. And my appeal to member states is to really make sure that those that have children recognize them and do the best they can to assume their responsibility as fathers. OPPMANN (voice-over): In the aftermath of natural disasters, the assassination in 2021 of the Haitian president and now out of control gang warfare, Haiti's barely functioning government was forced to plea for the return of a UN led armed force. JEAN VICTOR GENEUS, HAITIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Deploying the force as a first stage is essential to create a security environment that is conducive to the normal functioning of institutions. But it's not enough. Socioeconomic development must also be taken into account to once and for all address extreme poverty, which is the source of all of our problems. OPPMANN (voice-over): Any international police force that arrives in Haiti will likely find well armed gangs prepared to fight back, widespread official corruption and a local population that is skeptical of their mission. Help may finally be arriving for Haiti, but it remains unclear if it has come in time. Patrick Oppmann, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
