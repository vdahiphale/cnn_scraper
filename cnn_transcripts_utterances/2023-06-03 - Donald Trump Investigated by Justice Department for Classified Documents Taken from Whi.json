But this case, if they move forward will come down to this issue of whether or not a President can declassify documents.Now, I'm talking about a sitting President, not a former President. But ultimately, the entire authority to declassify rests with the Commander-in-Chief and those who classify, you know, the agencies who classify documents are doing so at his or her bidding, really, and doing -- doing his or her function. So there's an actually an executive order that President Obama signed that sort of lays out the President, the Vice President have these authorities. There are no longer going to be perpetual classifications, that they're automatic time limits and things for documents to become declassified and there's a way to declassify. And in an original classifier, which in this case, could be the President has the authority to declassify documents. So we're -- we're -- we are in uncharted waters. I know it sounds a little crazy to think that somebody could just declassify but if you think about it, we're talking about information. Imagine a President meeting in the Oval Office with somebody who was not ready and or had a need-to-know basis about information. But he wanted to ask those questions and say, look, what do I -- what do I -- what you know about this. He can immediately declassify that information to -- to dig into the information. So we're just now shifting that to documents. And so can a President declassify that? I don't think it's the sort of the magic it just happens because I'm so and so. But I do think that a President -- and I think the Court will ultimately come down and say, a President could declassify. George Bush did it about a memorandum in 2000 -- I think it was 2001 and it was a 2004 declassification. He just declassified something to move forward.",

Do you think it was the right call? MOOREI do think in the Trump case, that's probably the biggest threat to him is this idea of obstruction. And you find that more people get caught by the cover-up than they do by the actual offense because they -- they may have some legal ways around it. There's no really legal way to say I didn't tell the truth and I lied on a forum. I submitted false information to a Court or whatever. But that's going to be a bit bigger problem.

For the last few weeks and days, we haven't really seen him being very loquacious really about how these negotiations have gone. He's been wary about talking about the negotiations, when it comes to those intense background conversations not to jeopardize Republican support. And even after the bill was agreed upon on Sunday, he was weary about claiming it as a victory with a capital V because of the fact that he didn't want to jeopardize Republican support which was needed to pass the bill in a bipartisan manner. Of course, now the bill is passed and it's making his way to his desk. We expect him to sign it today. Now yesterday in that Oval Office address the first time that he's made one as president, he really talks about a couple of things. First of all, he talks about not only what's in the bill, but what is not in the bill, how his Democratic negotiators kept key Democratic priorities out of the bill, not on the chopping block, something that Republicans wanted to see.
