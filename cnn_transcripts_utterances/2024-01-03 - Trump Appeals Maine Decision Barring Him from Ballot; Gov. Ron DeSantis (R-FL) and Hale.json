He has not been willing to do that. Obviously, if you go by polling, it hasn't hurt. But I think now that we're in the New Year, I think voters do expect you to answer those questions.

And from there, if appealed, it goes to the court, which is what we're seeing happen now. But in Maine also, too, the argument that Trump is submitting here is he's attacking something at the core of what the secretary of state's decision was at. He says, I'm not an insurrectionist. He really refutes that point outright. And that is really at the center of this section of the 14th Amendment that has really not just been the reason that the decision was reached in Maine, but also in some other states as well. So, now the Maine superior court has about 20 days until it can issue its decision. From there, it would go to the Maine Supreme Court, which has until the last day of this month to make its decision.",

His GOP opposition has so far failed to coalesce around a single effective message or challenger, and his political operation has been more professional and disciplined than the past. Joining us now is Isaac Arnsdorf, national political reporter for The Washington Post, one of the three bylines on a very, very good piece this morning. He's also the author of Finish What We Started, The MAGA Movement's Ground War to End Democracy. Also with us is CNN Political Commentator and former Trump White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah Griffin. Guys, thanks so much for joining us. Isaac, I was fascinated by this piece because I don't think people remember that when Trump announced that he was running, it was not at a moment of -- it wasn't a pinnacle moment for him. The Mar-a-Lago room was half empty. People didn't really think he had a lot of juice coming out of the midterms. What changed?",

But this campaign is different in terms of who is around him, right, a lot of people, there was kind of a mass exodus. And I've heard that the people around him are more sophisticated in how they're approaching this race. What do you know? ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORI don't want to overstate, though, this notion that he's got this really sophisticated team around him beyond those two individuals. It's probably a mishmash of folks who have been clinging to him since 2016 or those who kind of stayed after January 6th. But those two individuals know that keeping Trump out of the public eye, more or less, is actually the best thing they can do. Donald Trump is not out giving huge rallies in the way that he was at this time in 2020. We're going to see that tick up. He's not on Twitter. He's not giving big sit-down interviews. He's not on mainstream media in a regular pace. So, I think the public is kind of forgetting the chaos and the crazy of Trump. I think that's reflected in some of the poll numbers that we're seeing and how much he's surpassing his challengers. The more that people see him, the more they're going to remember. The best operative in the world cannot stop Donald Trump. They cannot convince him to not be his own worst enemy. They can't convince him to not say and do crazy.

And the reason for that is because if there are strikes in Lebanon, there is a danger that Hezbollah will start retaliating. There is a danger that Iran starts retaliating. Iran has many allies, including the Houthis, who have been using drones to impede shipment in and out of the Persian Gulf. So, the whole thing could get much messier. And what the Biden administration has been doing is trying to tell Israel, look, focus on Hamas, focus on Gaza, destroy the military power structure there. This is a dangerous move. I can see the advantages for Israel. The sky was critical. Everything will depend on how Hezbollah reacts, how Iran reacts. Israel has sent a signal saying it is focused on a war against Hamas, trying to signal to Hezbollah that, look, we're not trying to fight you, we're trying to fight Hamas. Will Hezbollah take it that way, or will it be viewed as an attack on their territory, one to which they have to respond? There's also the other complication, which I'm sure Israel has thought about, which is Hamas might respond in its own way. And, remember, it still has many, many, many Israeli hostages.

So far, the Israeli government seems to be pocketing the support and resisting all the pressure.There are some minor achievements the Biden administration can point to, humanitarian aid going into Gaza. But given the level of American support, I mean, remember, as an Israeli general said, every rocket, every missile, every bullet is being supplied by the United States.
