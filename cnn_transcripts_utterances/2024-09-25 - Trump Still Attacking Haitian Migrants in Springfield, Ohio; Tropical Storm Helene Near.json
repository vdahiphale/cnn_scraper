Let's bring in Republican strategist for Axiom Strategies, Erine Perrine, and Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. Erine, let me start with you first. What's your reaction to those chants of send them back? You used to work for Trump. You remember a lot of these chants at some of these rallies. I mean, it seems he's bringing this up almost on a daily basis and spreading the same lies about these migrants on a daily basis. It's almost like his campaign these days is on a foundation of horse manure when it comes to this issue. Why does he keep doubling down?ERINE PERRINE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATION, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  Donald Trump always doubles down. He never backs down. This has always been his strategy. Those chants are inappropriate. And Donald Trump is really missing the opportunity here, and so are Republicans. If you want to talk about immigration, and specifically, if you want to talk about the executive action taken versus the legislative work that would need to be done to fix the immigration system, let's have that serious policy conversation, because what he's referencing when they're talking about -- and to your point, Jim, that these Haitian migrants are here legally is through executive action. If you want to have that conversation, let's do it because Kamala and Democrats aren't having in depth policy conversations, especially on immigration at this point. The times that Republicans are not focused and strong on the message regarding immigration and economy is a lost moment in messaging. The American people are screaming loudly about what they care about, about what are the issues that they are going to be voting on in November. It's the economy and it's immigration. Let's stay focused and let's stay on message. Jim, I feel like I say this every time I'm on a show with you. If we stay on message on these things, Republicans can win November.",

So, we wouldn't have a lot of these immigration issues if Donald Trump had not said to his party, by the way, the bill that you worked so very hard on to have a global immigration reform system, I want to put that aside because it's not good for me electorally. I'd rather grandstand do what I'm going to do.And demonizing people who, by the way, came here legally. And that's the part that really offends me. These Haitians not only came here legally, but were invited to Springfield because Springfield was losing population and they needed somebody to work in their factories and sustain their economy. And these Haitians are doing that every single day, legally, and that's why they're there. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has absolutely no concern for the economy of the people of Ohio. Senator Vance, who represents Ohio, has no concern for their economy or their wellbeing. All they want to do is demonize these people. And by the way, why the Haitians? Why not, I don't know, Slovenians who might have come here also legally? Because they're black, right? Because they're black. Let's call this what this is. This is a racial appeal. It's not even a dog whistle, it's a loud bullhorn to racially exploit people who have done nothing more than come to Springfield to help out the economy of a city that was in decline from a population loss.",

There are videos of her saying no deportations. You've got Tim Walz talking about the fact that he -- if there's a 25-foot wall, they'd build a 30-foot wall.They wanted to decriminalize border crossings in the United States. They wanted to provide free health care to illegal immigrants, when in the United States, the American people are struggling to keep up with cost of health care on their own citizens.
