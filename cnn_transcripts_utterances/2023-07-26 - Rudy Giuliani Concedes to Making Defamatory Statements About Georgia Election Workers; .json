It was the first time the child of a sitting president pleaded guilty to a federal crime. Now, a hearing like this is usually just a formality, but, today, the defense threatened to walk away once Justice Department prosecutors indicated that future charges could still be on the table. The two sides huddled and appeared to then refine the scope of the deal. On the political side, we know House Republicans are barreling ahead with their own probe of Hunter Biden based on unverified allegations that Joe Biden was tied to his son's business deals. So far, they have not proved any links. CNN's Evan Perez has been following this for us. Evan, this was supposed to be just a boilerplate procedure, instead, some twists and turns.",

This is a hearing that began at about 10:00 a.m., and we know that the scope of this agreement is what really certainly began unraveling, certainly when the judge began asking questions of the two sides. And here is where we are at this moment. It appears that they have an agreement that they are now moving forward on -- moving ahead on. As part of that, Hunter Biden is agreeing -- he's talking to the judge right now, answering questions, discussing some of the sources of his income that are at issue here. He said he worked for the Ukrainian company Burisma, which is an energy company. He talked about getting paid by the Chinese energy company CEFC. Again, those are central to this investigation. As part of this, he will plead guilty, he's agreeing to plead guilty to two misdemeanors covering the tax years of 2017 and 2018 as part of this agreement. This agreement covers all of his tax issues, all of his drug issues, as well as any potential gun crimes that he committed from the years 2014 to 2019. And that gun charge is where things kind of went off the rails a little bit, when the judge began asking about the relationship, whether the two things were connected, whether the misdemeanor tax counts was connected to this diversion program under which Hunter Biden agrees to abide by whatever stipulations the court says as part of that. Then this gun -- this possession of a gun charge goes away. It's a felony. So it is a serious charge. And Hunter Biden bought a firearm at a time that he was not qualified to own one, because he was addicted to drugs. So that is part of what the issue here was today. Now, you pointed out part of the issue here now is that the government says this is still an ongoing investigation. So there are certain things that perhaps Hunter Biden could still be charged with that are not covered by this agreement, Boris.",

One thing is, House Republicans want to get more answers from U.S. attorney David Weiss about how this Hunter Biden investigation played out, what exactly he looked into. And they want more answers from him about allegations they have heard from IRS whistle-blowers who are working on this case about political interference. Now, Weiss has debunked a couple of those allegations already. But it's very clear that House Judiciary Committee, again, led by Republicans, wants more answers, and Weiss has said he would be willing to testify in September or October, but the committee is going to have to sort of figure out, is that going to be worth their time if there is this ongoing investigation going on and if there are a number of questions that Weiss is not going to be able to answer as long as this is still an ongoing probe? I think the other thing that's going on is, we are hearing the increasing drumbeat about a potential impeachment inquiry for Joe Biden related to all of these allegations around the Biden family finances. We have heard House Speaker Kevin McCarthy make his most pointed comments yet that some of these allegations may rise to the level of a potential impeachment inquiry. Again, Republicans have not been able to prove that Joe Biden benefited from his son's overseas business dealings. But this is a point of inquiry that Republicans have ongoing. And they seem to believe, or at least some of them, that launching an impeachment inquiry may be a way to get more answers to some of those questions, Boris.",

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\":  Well, when they announced the plea deal, there was some disagreement about that, because the prosecutor said there was an -- the investigation continued. But the Hunter Biden people said that this sewed it up. And there was every expectation by the part of team Biden that this means, while it's not great to have your son be the first son in U.S. history, the first son of a president to plead guilty in court, that it would enable them to say that this long five-year investigation led to two tax misdemeanors and the diverted gun charge, and it's over and done with.

It did not allow her to weigh in on whether she thought that the plea was acceptable. She had questions about that and wants both sides to brief on that. Also, on the gun diversion, she had questions about how that deal was structured, because it inserted her in the process if Hunter Biden breached the terms of this agreement, and the government had an issue that they wanted the judge to act as a neutral arbiter, because they cited the political nature of this investigation and of who Hunter Biden is. So the judge saying she wasn't sure it was constitutional for her to have a role that could interfere with the Department of Justice, the executive branch's decision to bring a criminal case. So she said she wanted additional briefing on this. She told Hunter Biden: \"I'm sorry.\" She said she knew he wanted to resolve this, but she said she wanted to make sure he got what he understood he was getting in terms of immunity under that plea agreement, and that the diversion agreement was constitutional.

And the reason why that is in question is because the judge -- as a result of the judges questions, the prosecution admitted that there were some aspects of this that are not covered, that there are some aspects of this investigation. Remember, Boris, this is a five-year investigation, an investigation that has spanned three U.S. attorneys general all the way back to 2018. We have a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney who has been held over by Joe Biden's administration to continue this investigation. It has looked at everything, from money laundering, from this potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. It's looked at his -- obviously, his drug issues and, of course, these tax issues. And what the Justice Department was saying at this court hearing was that there is some aspect of this that is still ongoing, that is still being investigated and that, really, Hunter Biden still has some legal jeopardy over. And so that's the reason why she has this -- these concerns, because she wants to make sure that anybody who's agreeing to plead guilty that they understand what they're pleading guilty to, because, in the end, obviously, if that is not really buttoned up, it raises constitutional questions, obviously, for the defendant. So what it appears now is going to happen is that the two sides are going to go back to the table and try to work out what it is that they can agree to, and then they can come back to the judge. But it appears the judge is going to ask them to put this all in court filings, and then she will bring them back to make sure that there's an agreement that can be that can be -- that can be -- she can consider to be constitutional -- Boris.",

He has the right -- you are waiving or at least acknowledging that you may not be allowed to vote after being convicted or that you may not be allowed to possess a firearm, ironically, after being convicted of a crime. All of these things are rights that a defendant waives. And a judge needs to ensure and the parties, frankly, need to ensure that the defendant is aware of those things before he says, I'm guilty, because all of those things could jeopardize the integrity of the plea down the road and give the defendant a right to reopen it or appeal it at some point.

So she was focusing when she made that comment on the gun diversion agreement, saying that, in other instances where she's had cases where someone was on drugs and they had purchased a firearm, that that was usually brought as a false statement case.That is something that we know that prosecutors, according to our sources, were looking at in this case. As part of their plea negotiations, they had worked it down into this diversion for a possession charge, which is a serious felony. But this was an issue. She had questions about whether it was constitutional, because there was a ruling in the Third Circuit on another case and a question of whether this law that he's pleading to is constitutional. So she was saying, what if this is eventually decided that this law is unconstitutional? What happens here? Maybe you should have brought this as a false statement, but both sides saying that this was what they had agreed to. And then the judge was just pushing on this point. They said that they would accept it that this was a contract between the parties that they both agreed to the terms of it. Biden's lawyer said that, even if the law that this agreement was under was found unconstitutional, it wouldn't matter. They would still abide by the terms of this, but this judge obviously having a lot of concerns about the constitutionality of the structure of these agreements, as well as the substance. She was saying that it looked like they were trying to do form over substance today because of the eagerness to get this done. But she said she wanted to make sure that this was done appropriately. And, as Evan said, she is looking here to protect the interests in many ways of Hunter Biden, to make sure he knows exactly what he is pleading guilty to, and exactly what the terms are of this deal, what the prosecution could do or not, because, of course, there could be changes in the administration. And it's not necessarily clear there's -- were anyone else would look at this. This investigation was under both the Trump administration and the Biden administration. It's been many years in the works, but there is a lot of politicization around it. So she's wanting to make sure that everything lines up legally, and that Hunter Biden knows exactly what he's pleading guilty to.",

There was speculation over whether we were going to hear directly from Hunter Biden early in the day, when we thought that this was just going to be kind of a -- as we said, a boilerplate agreement, they were going to essentially put a stamp on it and move forward.We were supposed to hear from Hunter. It doesn't seem like we're going to now. What was his disposition like in court? What expression did he have on his face as all of this was happening?",

He was responding, \"Yes, Your Honor, yes, Your Honor,\" that he understood what she was saying. But then, when it looked like that plea talks, the plea agreement was back on track, and the judge was going through literally line by line the statement of facts in this case, asking him to explain what tax deduction was this, what was that, he was walking through it. And she asked him. We did hear a little bit about -- from him about this -- part of these charges that he's pleading to is when he had told the judge he was already sober. And she said to him: \"You were sober, so why didn't you pay your taxes?\": And he essentially said, he just become sober. His life was an enormous mess. He was trying to pick up the pieces and put it together, and that essentially fell through the cracks. That was the most that we heard him speak today. Otherwise, he was just answering her questions. But he was very firm that he was not going to plead guilty to anything today without a plea agreement. And we did expect that we might hear from him after court if things had gone as planned. And, as of right now, it doesn't seem like that's going to happen. It seems like they still have a lot of work to do between both sides, both the prosecution and Biden's team, to work out an agreement on this diversion, the issues the judge had about whether it was constitutional, whether she should have a role in it, but also the form of the tax-related agreement, and exactly what is included in that and what the judge's role in that agreement should be -- Boris, Jim.",

So, it sounds like it will be a couple of weeks, at least, before anything will be back before the judge.",
