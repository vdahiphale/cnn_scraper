Everybody here in the arena was on their feet waiting in bated breath for the anticipation of that shot going in. And it was one of his signature fadeaway shots going from the left elbow. And he absolutely drained it, ran back towards center court with his hands up in the air.His entire family, his close friends cheering him on. They're now on the court with him celebrating, embracing. Some of them feel -- or look, I should say very emotional in this moment. It's a record that many people never thought would be broken. We're talking more than 38,000 career points at the highest level of basketball over the course of an NBA career that spanned 20 years for LeBron James. And now he stands at center court as fans chant MVP, as the arena plays a montage of what is essentially him collecting infinity stones over the course of his career. And it could not be more proud moment for the fans, for his family looking on from right in front of them. And, of course, for the NBA as Kareem now embraces him, passing one milestone, handing it off to the next generation. : Omar, how cool as a huge basketball fan and a -- and a former player yourself to be there to witness this incredible, incredible history. I want to go now to someone who knows LeBron James and the NBA and pretty much all of sports very well, sportscaster and CNN contributor, Bob Costas. Omar just said over 38,000. Let's just be exact, 38,387 points, that was the number that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set all those years ago and that was what was just surpassed. I was just reading that we know that LeBron James set out at a very young age to break all kinds of records in the NBA, but this one, he said, I never said I wanted to lead the league in scoring. And for sure never said I wanted to be the all-time leader in scoring. And yet, here he is.",

And Kareem, by the way, also played 20 seasons, but he wasn't playing nearly as many minutes toward the end of his career as LeBron is right now.LeBron still among the tiny handful of best players in the league. LeBron only led the league in scoring one season. Michael Jordan led in scoring 10 seasons, and Michael Jordan averaged more points per game slightly more than 30 than LeBron has over his career. But LeBron also leads Michael in rebounds and assists per game. And when you play at that higher level, and for 20 seasons, and basically stay healthy, then you've got a chance to scale the highest mountain. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar held that record for a very long time. And now it belongs to LeBron. And as I watched the game, not at the game, but watching it, the last flurry that took him past the mark of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a little bit of everything from the LeBron James playbook. He had back to back three pointers, then he took an alley- oop lob and banked one in. And then the last basket that took him pass Kareem was a classic fade away from near the foul line. He's such a versatile player. There's so many aspects to his game, and he's shown a little bit of everything tonight in this his 20th season in the league.",

And when he looks like he's kind of middling, there has always been something else going on in the electorate, in which he's been able to make an argument that I think is actually pretty simple. And it's an argument of general reasonableness. I think it prevents some people who maybe don't love him, from hating him. And as we discussed going into the midterms, these kind of so-so voters, the meh (ph) voters were the ones who allowed Democrats to do better than they expected in November. And I think those will still be the voters who if Biden is going to run for reelection, he will need and He will try to run on.
