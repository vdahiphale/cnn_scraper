In fact, five weather stations in China have topped 50 degrees Celsius in the past day. In Southern Europe, the heat wave has been relentless and, of course, it comes right in the middle of the summer tourist season. Climate scientists in Italy say temperatures could reach the hottest ever recorded in Europe, as high as 48 degrees in Sicily and Sardinia. Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, are under extreme health risks because of the heat. People in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain also sweltering. On the Spanish island of La Palma, a forest fire is only making matters worse. It's burning out of control and forced at least 4,000 people so far to evacuate. In Italy, at least one person has died, and several tourists have collapsed from the heat. Italian authorities are advising people to stay hydrated and, of course, avoid direct sunlight during the midday hours. CNN's Barbie Nadeau with more, reporting from Rome. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Nearly three dozen daily high temperatures were broken on Sunday alone. And high temperatures are forecast for much of the next week.In the Plains and in the Northeast, they've dodged the extreme heat, but they've been dealing with relentless heavy rain and floods. In Pennsylvania, authorities are searching for a 2-year-old and an infant who disappeared in floodwaters. The children's mother and four others died in the flooding. Storms also caused ground stops at airports around New York City and Boston on Sunday. According to FlightAware.com, more than 1,600 U.S. flights were canceled. And that's not all on the extreme weather front. Authorities in South Korea say 40 people have now died from flash floods and landslides in the past few days. Thirteen people died in a flooded underpass in central South Korea, extreme weather turning an ordinary road trip into a tragedy. Here's how it happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (voice-over): Working in mud and against the clock, rescuers in South Korea pump water from a flooded tunnel. Arcs of water redirected from the once-clogged underpass, revealing some of the vehicles trapped inside. Dash cam video shows how quickly the tunnel filled up on Saturday. Local authorities say a levee broke after days of heavy rain across the country, sending a rush of water through the underpass, some cars barely escaping the deluge. But authorities say 15 vehicles, including a bus, were trapped in the tunnel, along with their drivers and passengers. Divers have been painstakingly searching for them and have retrieved multiple bodies from the scene. Many family members of those thought to be missing gathered at a nearby hospital, their misery compounded by the agony of a long wait for information. One man says he's speechless and says he hasn't eaten for hours while waiting for authorities to brief him. The tragedy has shocked South Korea, some people saying the government should have been better prepared after last year's torrential rains, which were the worst in 115 years. One man, who lives near the tunnel, says authorities should have closed it when flooding was expected. He says he feels like this could have easily happened to him, and he feels like part of himself died, too. Heavy monsoon rains have caused dozens of deaths, not just in the tunnel, but across the country. Thousands of people forced to evacuate because of floods and landslides. In some areas, riverbanks completely collapsed because of saturated ground, and meteorologists warn it could get worse, with as much as 300 millimeters of additional rain forecast to fall in some parts of the country over the next few days. Other parts of Asia are also dealing with intense weather. Southern China bracing for a powerful storm, which is expected to lash the area with strong winds and heavy rains in the next few days. And parts of New Delhi are still water-logged, even though water levels in the Yamuna River, which flooded the city, have receded. But the water hasn't drained away yet, creating very wet and frustrating circumstances for people just trying to move about the city. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, the signals that we see are, I'd say, the following. That the Chinese government takes climate change seriously. It has some very ambitious climate-change goals.

The prime minister himself saying in a video statement that he went to the Sea of Galilee without a hat, without water, was in the sun, saying it was not a good idea. So after feeling dizzy on Saturday, he went to the emergency room where, after undergoing a series of tests, the hospital has determined, they said on Sunday morning, that it was as a result of dehydration.
