Sara Sidner is off today. This is CNN News Central. It is Election Day in America, and the polls are open. We are closely watching several key races that could not only impact lives today but can also send some pretty loud messages for the next year's presidential election. Abortion rights are on the ballot today in Ohio, where the voters will decide whether to enshrine access in the state Constitution. It has been a winning political issue for Democrats ever since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, but does that hold today? Democrats are hoping Reproductive rights also helps them in Virginia, where both chambers in the statehouse are up for grabs, but the Republican governor in Virginia is trying a new approach regarding abortion access that he is hoping to serve as a model for Republicans in Virginia and far beyond. CNN's Jessica Dean is in Richmond, Virginia, for us. She's joining us now. Jessica, the election in Virginia isn't just about at the lives in the commonwealth. What are you hearing about today and the clues in Virginia could say about 2024?",

      "sentences": "Right. Kate, you make such a great point. I think some people out there may be watching and going, I don't live in Virginia, how does this really apply to me? But so often what we see happen here in Virginia with their state legislature really correlates with what we see the following year in federal elections across the country.So, in 2019, the Democrats took the House and the Senate. In 2020, Joe Biden won the state by ten points. In 2021, the Republicans took back the House here in Virginia, and that is what we saw in the House of Representatives up on Capitol Hill. So, that's why we like to keep an eye on here to see kind of what we can pull from what happens here in Virginia. So, this is a polling site right here behind me. I will say it has been a very slow trickle of voters today. But let me just set the scene for you. Here in Virginia, every House and Senate seat in the state legislature is up for election today, is up for grabs. So, it is big all across the state. The state's governor, Republican Glenn Youngkin, is not on the ballot. He is in the middle of his term. But you could make the argument, this is kind of a proxy battle for him, because he is really pushing ahead with his agenda and what he wants to do. And he has been foiled by the state Senate which is controlled by Democrats right now. Republicans want to flip that. They want full control of the state legislature. Here is Youngkin earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-VA):  We are delivering. And I think that the results matter. And so now it is time to put it in the hands of the voters to ask them to send a team to Richmond that can work with me and not against me. But I think that we can have a fantastic two years if we can hold our House, flip our Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have seen other national Democrats here in Virginia making the case as well.But, Kate, you mentioned reproductive rights and abortion. Virginia is the only southern state that has not enacted further restrictions Since Roe versus Wade was overturned in 2022. Now, Youngkin tried, that he wanted to put a 15-week abortion ban in place. Democrats in the state Senate stopped that from happening. And so, again, abortion and reproductive rights are central to the conversation here. A couple of interesting things that we don't hear Youngkin talking about it much on the stump at all, he is talking about other initiatives and other priorities for his administration. And we do hear him, when he is asked about it by the media, he will talk about it as what he sees a compromise, that 15-week abortion ban. What will be a test for him and his view for the Republican Party going forward is will that resonate with the voters here in Virginia. It's made up of a lot of suburban voters that will be very is key, of course, in 2024. Kate?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Virginia is going to tell us the most important -- send the most important signals about 2024, because Kentucky, Mississippi, deep red states, kind of anomalous situations, whether or not Democrats can hold a governorship. Virginia, I think, actually encapsulates a lot of the dynamics, a lot of the ingredients we're going to see in 2024.It's a state, as Jessica noted, that Joe Biden won by 10 points, but he's underwater with more people disapproving than approving of his job performance in most recent polls. If you look at The Washington Post and Schar School poll that came out a couple weeks ago, Virginia voters give Republicans a double-digit advantage on the economy and crime and a majority approve of Glenn Youngkin's performance. And, normally, you would look at all of those factors and say that Republicans are poised for a very big night in the state legislative races. But, in fact, it is a toss-up that may be leaning slightly toward the Democrats holding the state Senate and maybe even taking the statehouse.  And the reason is too many of those suburban voters who are dissatisfied with Biden's performance are still reluctant to turn over power to Republicans because of their views on abortion and other cultural issues. I mean, it seems to me Virginia is going to test whether what we saw in many key swing states in 2022 still holds, which is that voters who believe Democrats have not delivered for their interests are still willing to vote for them because they view Republicans as a threat to their rights and values.",

It wasn't enough to overcome the resistance of Democrats on other issues, like crime and immigration. But in swing states, it was a very powerful weapon for Democrats in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. And I think '20, the Virginia legislative races in particular, to some extent, the Kentucky governor's race, where, you know, Yes is counting on big numbers in the same kind of suburban communities will tell us whether this is still powerful enough to over -- not completely overcome, but to neutralize those Republican advantages on other issues, which certainly, as we're seeing in that New York Times and CBS and other polling, are very present at the national level.",

In the U.S., I actually flew for only five days and intend to speak to congressmen and senators throughout the U.S. And because of what I've seen in the campuses, I'm a recent graduate myself from the Ben-Gurion University here in Beersheba.And I just had to do something because it pains me to see that students just support one side without even understanding that this was not an attack or what you can say, people were not just killed, you know. People went to have fun in a rave, just like Coachella or all sorts of festivals in the U.S. and they not only died, they were butchered and massacred. And to see all of that horror through channels on the Telegram channels of Hamas terrorists and civilians just broke my heart every time because there is no other way for a family to really cope with the loss of their kids. They don't need to see the brutality in its way. And if you ask me how I'm feeling, I wish I can say, you know, it's better. I wish I can say, you know, I'm focusing on the war right now that is happening, but I can't really seem to put aside October 7th. October 7th has nothing to do with the war that's happening right now. It was just an excuse to brutally massacre civilians just like myself. And it really changed my life because I can't go back to normal knowing that my friends are now in Gaza or that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to them because they only want to have fun in a party. And that is something that needs to be said loud and clear. Don't make this political. It's not about what's happening right now. I feel very sorry for both Israeli and Palestinian lives that are being taken. But this, what happened to us on October 7th, this is something that happened by its own. This was just an excuse for barbaric people to slaughter the Jewish people. And it pains me to see right now that people are justifying it. And that's why I'm coming back to this state because I can't sit around here and feel like helpless. People need to understand that you have to separate what happens now, which is a war, and what happened on October 7th, which was an attack that just slaughtered many of my friends or just like myself, just went to have fun in a party.",
