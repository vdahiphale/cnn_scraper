Our league and our players and our leagues have always showed up for the causes that matter to us and I don't see that changing because of this. You mentioned Cherelle's comments yesterday.

And, of course, we took the deal that was on the table, that we certainly didn't want to lose, to have the opportunity to see Brittney Griner reunited with her -- with Cherelle and her family back here.But we send a very simple message to Paul Whelan when we talked to him over the past couple of days. Keep the faith. Don't lose hope. We're coming for you. And, in fact, you heard from President Putin today, it's not often that I can say that we actually agree with something President Putin said, but today I can say that, because President Putin himself has said that these discussions will continue. These discussions absolutely will continue. We have demonstrated now twice, first have Trevor Reed and yesterday with Brittney Griner, that even in the midst of the tensions in the broader bilateral relationship, and, of course, that is an understatement, that puts it mildly, we're able to have these conversations and we're able to have successful conclusions when it comes to the return of our American citizens.",

We've demonstrated before that we can be creative, we can be resourceful and we're prepared to make more precisely, the president, because only the president could make these decisions, the president is prepared to make the difficult decisions that may be necessary to get Paul Whelan home. You will understand, Jim, that I'm just not in a position to go into what that might look like but we are committed to the fact that Paul Whelan will be reunited. We wish nothing more than to have had Paul on that plane yesterday with Brittney Griner, just as several months ago we wish nothing more than the fact that Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner could have been on the plane back home with Trevor Reed.

I know you've been talking about that extensively and you spoke with my colleague, Erin Burnett, about it as well, but what this has brought up, even the Twitter thread, is a question about where the line is when it comes to hate speech and free speech. So, I just want to put up some of what we've seen over last few weeks. The use of the N-word, since Elon Musk took over, triple the 2022 average, slurs against gay men up 50 percent, slurs against trans persons up 62 percent, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate. What do you see? I know you are, and we saw this in your Wall Street Journal op-ed this week, you believe in free speech. People need to have a place to talk. You believe in Twitter being there. How do you, though, deal with this content?",

      "sentences": "Okay. So to answer the question, I think there are two aspects of free speech. One is allowing people to express different viewpoints. I don't think we should be censoring people based on their viewpoints. But I also think it means treating people with respect. You can't have free speech if you're not treating the person you're talking to with respect.And I don't think anti-Semitism, racism and vicious attacks on people's identity belong on the site. I do think having a difference of opinion or criticizing a member of Congress or the president, that belongs on the side. And that's the balance. Now, I saw those statistics. I saw that Elon Musk said, no, the statistics are different. We need to figure out over the next couple of months what those statistics are and have transparency. But, absolutely, there is no room on these platforms for that kind of hate.",

I think we need figure out the facts of how much of this hate is actually there and whether Musk claims that he's saying that he wants to end the amplification of hate. So, I think he's put out some statistics, the senators put out other statistics. What I think Congress should do is legislate to have transparency so that there is disclosure requirements on hate groups, on the amount of people there with this kind of hate. And I don't think hate has any place on these platforms, but I think that we should be for free speech and openness of viewpoints, and that is very different than hate speech.",
