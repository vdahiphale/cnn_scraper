Others I spoke to said that they fled with nothing but their clothes on their bodies.We saw folks being escorted out holding pets, holding anything that they could grab onto. Fortunately, at last check, there were no injuries to report. However, I did see someone that needed medical attention. Obviously, it's a very stressful situation. We heard some banging on doors previously. Law enforcement was canvassing -- along with rescue crews, canvassing door to door trying to make sure that everyone was out. As you can see, operations right now are paused. Thankfully, the good news is, it does not appear that anyone here was seriously hurt. Again, this is one of the hardest-hit areas in Clearwater, but I do want to point out, we checked, and this was not actually in the evacuation zone for Pinellas County, so really a wakeup call for folks that were living here. There was a bus that came through just a short while ago, a couple of buses that came through to escort residents out. So they do have a shelter that they can go to, obviously to take in them, their pets, and some of their belongings. But this is just one slice of what we have seen from Hurricane Milton all along the Florida Gulf Coast. Here in Pinellas County, obviously, Clearwater one of the hardest-hit areas, but as you go further south, you get closer to Sarasota and some of those areas, we have seen intense flooding there and storm surge as well, Pamela.",

Isabel Rosales, also, where she is, same situation.Boris Sanchez, thanks so much for the latest there. We will check back in with you later. And my next guest has been working around the clock tracking the scope of this disaster. Michael Brennan is director of the National Hurricane Center. Michael, we have heard that Milton has left at least four people dead. That number is expected to grow. Still, FEMA and Governor DeSantis both say Florida dodged a -- quote -- \"worst-case scenario.\" What do you think about the level of destruction so far?",

So it'll take some time to figure out the full picture of Milton's impacts.But I think, certainly, we did avoid the worst-case scenario for getting storm surge up into Tampa Bay, because we had the system come in and make landfall a little farther south. So we saw that worst surge basically from the south part of the Tampa Bay region down to Charlotte Harbor and Fort Myers, some significant surge impacts there. Just starting to assess what happened in that region. But we did see that very heavy rainfall, those hurricane-force winds play out throughout that heavily populated I-4 Corridor overnight and early this morning.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the hurricanes, because they have really strong winds at the low levels, and then those winds turn in direction and speed and change with height as you go up through the atmosphere, that allows thunderstorms that develop to start to spin and creates an environment that's conducive for tornadoes.So Milton was a big, powerful hurricane. So it had a really strong wind field that was moving across the southern portion of the Florida peninsula yesterday. We also had some heating from the sunshine that allowed the atmosphere to warm up and become unstable and supported those thunderstorms to develop. And the tornadoes we saw develop yesterday in Milton were really kind of supercharged compared to the typical tornadoes you see in a hurricane environment. So, they were longer-living. They were more powerful. There were more of them. But we did have that kind of tornado watch that was issued early in the morning for the whole central and southern portion of the peninsula. Weather Service offices issued tens to even over 100 tornado warnings yesterday to try to keep people safe. But, unfortunately, we did see some fatalities and some structural damage from some of those storms, especially in portions of Southeastern Florida.",

People driving around in these areas of debris and down power lines.Historically, as far back as the 2004 hurricane season, we have seen in some cases more deaths after the storm during the recovery, when it's really dangerous. So that's why we just tell people, look, unless you're in danger, stay home, stay where you're at. Let the emergency services folks get out there and make it safe.",

A lot of people get out there and try to do stuff they're not used to doing, like operating chain saws, getting up on roofs.It turned out the leading cause of death in some of our hurricanes was head trauma due to falls off the ladders. Tonight, there's going to be a lot of areas without power, without traffic signals. We have seen that, when people drive at night and they're in -- they don't recognize the areas they're in, we had head-on crashes. Right after Hurricane Charley within two days, we had a fatal accident from people driving at night. So that's why it's so important that people take it easy, take it slow, heed the recommendations of your local officials, and hopefully we will keep a loss of life to a minimum.",

One of the big agencies that supports long-term recovery is Housing and Urban Development through their Community Block Grant dollars for disasters. Our Army Corps of Engineers, EPA, and other agencies are going to need funding. So FEMA's got the money to do the initial response, but FEMA's also going to need funding for the long-term recovery to do the permanent rebuilding out of these disasters.",

Because there's a lot of reporting out there about FEMA's dwindling work force, right?I think it was only 9 percent of its work force was able to respond to the Milton in Florida. And you have to think it's going to take a lot of manpower to help with recovery after all these back-to-back hurricanes and everything going on across the country.",

      "speaker": "FUGATE",
      "sentences": "General Accounting Office, I think, saves that report every time there's a big disaster.This is not new. And FEMA's always had challenges with staffing for a temporary work force for long-term recovery. But it doesn't impact the initial response. And, again, a lot of what you're talking about is done by state and local officials, volunteer organizations and mutual aid from other states. And where the real work that FEMA will be doing that will require more people is when we get the permanent rebuilding and managing that financial process of the grant reimbursement. So this should not be an impact on any of their spots. It's more of how FEMA should be staffed and funded to have the employees to do long-term recovery. And, so far, there's been a reluctance to increase FEMA's permanent work force. So as long as they're dependent upon at-will employees that they call up during disasters, when the economy's strong, it's very hard to keep those staffing levels at the highest they need. [11:45:12] BROWN:  And, as you point out, it's a collective effort. It's not just FEMA out there helping. It's all kinds of organizations. So thanks so much, Craig Fugate. We appreciate it.

OLDFIELD:  I live on five acres. And I was really concerned about our cows and donkeys and just a tree falling down on one of our fence panels. We did lose four really large oak trees, but luckily they didn't fall on any fence panels. During the night, it was really hard to sleep. I have got two young kids, Paisley (ph) and Brendan (ph). And they kept coming in. They were obviously scared. We lost power about 11:30 and we would hear transformers blowing outside. The wind, it sounded like a tornado, honestly, and we have never experienced one of those before. So it definitely was frightening. And then this morning, when I went out just to kind of check on everything, it was pretty shocking. This is the most I have ever seen personally on my land. So we have a lot of cleanup to do. And driving to the bar so that we could do this video call with you guys, it was a little scary. There's a lot of trees down in the road.",
