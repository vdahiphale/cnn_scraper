I'm not -- no, we're going to be appealing the gag order. I'd love to answer that question. It's a very easy question, the easiest question so far.

Bizarre claim, quite frankly.Let's now get more insight about what went on behind the scenes in the Trump trial today. Let's bring in \"The Washington Post\" Shayna Jacobs, who was inside the courtroom covering it for \"The Post.\" Shayna, some of these exchanges between Trump attorney Emil Bove, and Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal, attorney Keith Davidson, who's a witness on the stand right now, they read the transcript of them, read incredibly testy. What was the actual environment like during that question? SHAYNA JACOBS, FEDERAL COURT &amp; LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": I think that was right. I think the witness was particularly put off by the lines of questioning by Bove, suggesting that he's a shakedown artist and that he's built his career, his legal career, on essentially blackmailing celebrities, trying to get significant payouts for clients who have salacious stories, whether they're true or false, but clients who have salacious stories that might be of value to celebrities such as Donald Trump.",

Judge Merchan cut short Todd Blanche today when he started getting into another explanation of why some of what Trump had discussed, some of these four remaining allegations, is a response, a campaign response, a political response, he's responding to other people's attacks on him, sometimes attacks on him from people involved in the case.

Also, Bill Brennan, a former Trump payroll corporation attorney. Karen, moments ago, Mr. Trump falsely claimed he's not allowed to testify because he's under a gag order. That's not right. Correct? KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Testify is a term of art. It means take the stand in court, raise your right hand and swear to tell the truth and you testify in front of a court, in front of the jury. The gag order has nothing to do with that. Of course he can testify. He has an absolute right to testify. And he is not restricted in terms of what he can talk about as long as it's relevant, admissible evidence. So the gag order has nothing to do with his testimony at trial. Perhaps he's confused about that, but it only talks about statements outside of court. TAPPER: And Bill, who do you think the prosecutors might call next? Do you think Keith Davidson was a good setup for Michael Cohen? Or might someone else come before? WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, FORMER TRUMP PAYROLL CORP. ATTORNEY: I think they'll probably sandwich a few more innocuous witnesses in between these two and have Cohen, you know, he's really the show at this trial. But I wanted to say one thing, Jake, Karen made a great point in the last segment. You know, when Mr. Bove cross examined Davidson and it was brought out that, well, what he did wasn't illegal. He was investigated for extortion but never charged. You know, that jury doesn't check its common sense at the door. They see everything, they hear everything. You know, there's a story in the news now about a politician shooting a dog and it's been said, well, it's not illegal in that particular state. Who shoots a puppy? Who does that? And the jury is going to get back there. And whether he was charged or not charged or it's legal or not legal, as lawyers, we get too focused on the statutes, the laws, the rules, the codes. They're going to get back there and think, who lives like this? Who preys on people's misfortunes? And they're going to have to tie the defendant to this seedy activity. And then even if they do that, they're going to have to show that it was done to commit another crime, namely political campaign violation or some type of election law. It's a far reach.

From the 1960 civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam organizing in the late 60s and 70s, anti-South African apartheid organizing in the 80s.

However, what I thought, so interesting, Jake, was at the end, he clearly waited for a question before he got out. And the question was, are these protests going to do anything to change your policy? And he answered emphatically no.

J.D. VANCE (R-OH): I'm extremely skeptical that Mike Pence's life was ever in danger. I think politics, in politics, people like to really exaggerate things from time to time. I know a lot of folks in the Democratic Party, Kaitlan, act as if January 6th was the scariest moment of their lives. I think, look, January 6th was a bad day. It was a riot.

And we know his definition of fair generally is positive. So there are a lot of people who are concerned that means that if the election doesn't go his way, we'll see a repeat of January 6th, 2021.

Donald Trump lost in 2020. And there was no widespread voter fraud. And most rational people accept that. And I find it interesting, Donald Trump never questioned the results of any of these primaries that he won. He didn't question any election that he won. The problem is, when he doesn't win, he questions the fairness and the integrity of the election.This is going to be a consistent theme. He mentioned this to the Milwaukee newspaper yesterday. He mentioned that last week in the \"Time Magazine\" about if there he sees any evidence of fairness or unfairness, then he will question it. The problem is, this works great with his base. They love this. This is catnip for his base. The problem is now he needs to appeal to the undecided voters and the late decided voters. And when you're undermining the very process you want them to participate, you're not going to overwhelm them in participating in the process, he need to keep that in mind. JOE WALSH (R-IL), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Yes. But Jake, the bigger problem is this is a damn attack on our democracy. Alice is right about the whole cares about the politics of this. This is a -- he's doing it again, America. Jake, this is a direct attack on our democracy. A candidate for president is saying, I will only accept the results if I win. He did this again. Republicans shouldn't be concerned. They should be outraged and pissed off about this. TAPPER: Paul, is there a way, I mean, because Joe Biden is losing -- if the election were held today, do you agree that probably Donald Trump would win?",

And so I think Biden is onto something.This is a -- it is a huge political loser for Trump. I think Alice is right and Joe is right. You know, Trump is the master brander. You know, he's a great marketer. He sold Trump wine and Trump vodka and Trump steaks, Trump sneakers, now Trump Bibles. He'll never sell a Trump car because it won't have a windshield. It will only have a rearview mirror. It won't go forward. It will only go in reverse. He's completely backward looking. I think Biden should take that.

I agree with what he said. Dissent is an important part of our democracy. But dissent that leads to a disorder and threatening people, there should be no place for that.And this is going to be a political problem for Biden because in our recent poll, voters under 35, 81 percent of them, disapprove of the way he's handling this situation.
