We begin the hour with historic cold temperatures threatening to put the Republican race in a deep freeze with just two days left until the Iowa caucuses. A blizzard force campaigns to cancel events throughout the week. Des Moines snowiest seven day stretch since 1942. While most of the candidates spent the week on the ground with caucus goers, the frontrunner was spending much of his time in court railing against the judge in his New York civil fraud trial.Tonight, Donald Trump canceled both his in-person rallies, shifting to a virtual town hall beginning in the next hour. His Republican rivals have been mocking him for relying on MAGA surrogates just days before the Iowa caucuses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're showing up. I mean, Donald Trump, I guess, has phoned it in. He's just going to be hanging out down in Mar-a-Lago. I'm sure it's probably 75 degrees there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's also arguing that severe weather will play to his advantage.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Your night's going to be pretty cold next week in nine days, eight days. So you just have to put on that warm coat and get out there. I said it to one of our people and they said, oh, that's good news. I said, why is it good?

And that was just to go watch something. Now this is a chance for them to go do something. And so I suspect that Trump people feel pretty good about the intensity of the loyalty of their voters.So I don't -- I don't really see this as necessarily disadvantaging one over the other.

Could we see a situation where Trump doesn't pull off a huge win here?

It's not like these races turn around. Trump has a very sizable lead.And I understand his team wanting to downplay expectations. I think expectations may be his most dangerous opponent in these caucuses, because there is this sense that, well, you know, he should get 50% of the vote. That's where he's been polling around 50. They're very clear, no, we're probably not going to do that. And it's dangerous for a number of reasons, Jim. One is how it gets spun coming up. But also, they're worried that their supporters are going to be, you know, complacent because they assume Trump's going to win, or some of their supporters. They bring a lot of first-time people and so on. So I don't see that. I don't see an upset. In terms of who this disadvantage is, I agree with Scott. You know, enthusiasm is a huge thing, and he's got that. They also have some organization, which they didn't have back in 2016. And that should help them too. The one downside for Trump I see is that a lot of his supporters are in these rural areas where you have to travel, in some cases, long distances to get to these caucuses. And there may be some people who just don't want to go out in 35 below. I note, by the way, Jim, that the President was very -- had recommendations for his voters, just put on that heavy coat and just go out there in that 35 below. I notice he's telling them that from Florida. So it's easier to say.",

That would -- that would -- she would be the candidacy with momentum at that point. And DeSantis would be trying to scramble and recover in South Carolina, a place where Donald Trump is very strong. And of course, he and DeSantis are fighting for some of the same kinds of voters. And obviously, you know, he's going to run into the same brick wall down there that he has run into in Iowa. So we'll see what he's doing.I think at this point it's wise to continue to tell your supporters that you've got a path, that you've got a strategy, and you're executing that because you don't want anyone to stay home thinking this is the end of the line no matter what. But it strikes me that his initial reaction will be to say, I'm going to the Palmetto State, and then probably within the next 24 to 48 hours, decide if that's a real thing or not.",

Now, here in Kansas City, Travis Kelce would love to say you've  got to fight for your right to party and that is undoubtedly what these fans are doing here out here at Arrowhead Stadium. Honestly, not a lot of people are here early, but now, people are beginning to come in. They're staying much warmer. They have been using the good spirits, the good vibes of the arena to help keep them warm out here today. Our meteorology team here in Kansas City has told us it wasn't going to get much warmer than minus 25, feels like temperatures. So, these guys are absolute troopers. Right now, you just heard them say it is not even cold out. Now, one last thing I would like to show you, Jim, is that some fans are bringing in card board pieces like this. They can't be any larger than three by five. Fans are standing on these to help keep their feet warm. This is how desperate things have gotten here in Kansas City.",

They got 40 percent of the vote, but KMT got 33 percent of the vote, and a relatively new party that is preaching a middle way between anti-Beijing and pro-Beijing got 26 percent of the vote.Those are a lot of numbers, but what this means is that, yes, the Democratic Party got another term, and that's good for the Biden administration. But every time they go to the Taiwanese legislative body now, they've lost their majority, and they're going to have to do deals with the pro-Beijing party to make anything stick.

I've since talked to a federal law enforcement official who told me that what prompted that higher level of security was a damage to the temporary fence. Around the White House, there were additional barriers that had been placed knowing that this protest was coming to the White House this afternoon and there was some damage to that fence for a brief moment of time that led to that higher security posture. This official also telling me that objects were thrown over that temporary fence. That did not though lead to the higher security posture. Jim, you have been to the White House probably as many times and there was enhanced security over the course of the afternoon. They had prepared for this march on Washington for Gaza to intensify over the course of the afternoon, which is what we saw play out amid chants of ceasefire. Now President Joe Biden was not here at the White House. But all of this is going to underscore some of the -- what he is navigating politically, which is as the US continues to support Israel, there has been pushback domestically and on the world stage for ceasefires, a ceasefire in Gaza where of course there have been images of the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded there and the many thousands of deaths.
