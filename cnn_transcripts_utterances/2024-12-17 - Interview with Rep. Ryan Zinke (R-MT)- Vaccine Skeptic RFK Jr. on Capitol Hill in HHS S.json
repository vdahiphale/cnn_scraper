      "sentences": "Good afternoon, everyone. The unsealing of today's indictment brings us one step closer to securing justice for Brian Thompson and his family and affirming the primacy of the rule of law in the city of New York. NYPD detectives worked tirelessly to piece this case together and along the way the Manhattan DA's office made sure we had every legal tool available to us.Whether quickly providing subpoenas to assist with our evidence collection or traveling with us to Altoona, Pennsylvania last week after the apprehension, our partnership made this a successful investigation. So I'd like to thank District Attorney Bragg and his team for their work in bringing this case forward. Part of that work included the relentless collection and analysis of surveillance video by our detectives, which ultimately produced a clear image of our suspect. That image was shared far and wide through the media and thanks to an observant McDonald's customer and the employee who alerted the police, Mr. Mangione was quickly brought into custody. This outcome is why we always emphasize the critical role of the public in our public safety mission. So again, I want to thank everyone who saw something, said something, and did something. That is why we have a suspect in custody today. As DA Bragg said, Luigi Mangione is now formally charged and indicted for murder. And let me be perfectly clear, in the nearly two weeks since Mr. Thompson's killing, we have seen a shocking and appalling celebration of cold-blooded murder. Social media has erupted with praise for this cowardly attack. People ghoulishly plastered posters threatening the CEOs, other CEOs, with an X over Mr. Thompson's picture, as though he was some sort of a sick trophy. And yesterday, the New York Post reported that some extreme activists were circulating a deck of cards with other most wanted CEOs to be targeted for assassination. These are the threats of a lawless, violent mob who would trade in their own vigilantism for the rule of law that protects us all. Let me say this plainly, there is no heroism in what Mangione did. This was a senseless act of violence. It was a cold and calculated crime that stole a life and put New Yorkers at risk. We don't celebrate murders and we don't lionize the killing of anyone. And any attempt to rationalize this is vile, reckless, and offensive to our deeply held principles of justice. Now, as we await the extradition process in Pennsylvania to complete, we continue our public safety work here at home. That includes our focus on the growing threat of ghost guns, one of which was used in this attack. The NYPD remains committed to tracking down and removing these untraceable weapons from our streets. And we will do that work hand in hand with District Attorney Bragg here in Manhattan and in every other borough to ensure that those who possess, distribute, and use these weapons are held fully accountable. Finally, I want to again thank every member of the NYPD, uniform, and civilian working on this case. Led, of course, by our great Chief Kenny, whether in Midtown North Squad, Homicide, Crime Scene Unit, Intelligence Bureau, and everywhere else. All of you contributed to today's indictment and you've brought the Thompson family one step closer to justice in this case. Thank you. (INAUDIBLE)",

This was not an ordinary killing, not to suggest that any killing is ordinary, but this was extraordinary. And the New York State Legislature has, you know, set out both the paths that we talk about, both the murder one and murder two.

The sergeant that was involved in that case reached out to the San Francisco field office and said, hey, basically, I'm working on a missing case. I saw the photograph that was distributed by the NYPD, there's a resemblance. That tip was forwarded to us close to 45 hours after the incident took place. It showed up to a TFO, which is a task force officer.We have NYPD officers embedded with the FBI. They received that tip. It was one of four tips that they had received that day, and they were vetting it. Part of that vetting process was that they reached out to Mangione's mother in San Francisco very late on the 7th. They had a conversation where she didn't indicate that it was her son in the photograph, but she said it might be something that she could see him doing. So, that information was going to be passed along to the detectives the next morning, but fortunately, we apprehended him before we could act on that.",

We have a great terrorism unit, we were at the forefront of getting the statute passed. Within the last two years, we've tried two very significant terrorism cases, one involving an English-speaking operative based in Jamaica and another involving someone who was here and funding overseas terrorism by cryptocurrency.

We will first get the defendant to New York. We will have him arraigned. We will be before our judge. We will engage in pre-trial litigation. If there's a trial, we're ably equipped to do that.

In a moment, the latest details on that horrific school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin.But first, the major announcement we just heard from prosecutors in New York and the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Moments ago, the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced that the suspect, Luigi Mangione, will be charged with multiple counts of murder. Prosecutors say it was Mangione who shot and killed Brian Thompson outside the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan nearly two weeks ago. He led police on a six-day manhunt, various surveillance cameras capturing Mangione's movements. Police arrested him Monday of last week after a tip from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, PA. Detectives say Mangione had a 3D printed gun in his possession at the time of an arrest. And since then, he's been behind bars in Pennsylvania. But even before today's murder charges, an extradition hearing was set to take place tomorrow. And Mangione's new high-profile New York lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, tells CNN that Mangione will not fight extradition. But let's bring in our experts, CNN's John Miller, the former Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism of the New York Police Department, and Stacey Schneider, a criminal defense trial attorney. And John Miller, let's start with these charges now, first- degree murder and also murder, including terrorism charges. Tell us about that.",
