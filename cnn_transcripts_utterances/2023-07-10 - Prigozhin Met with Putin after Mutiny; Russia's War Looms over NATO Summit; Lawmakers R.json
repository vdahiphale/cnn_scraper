And apparently they discussed not only the so-called special military operation in Ukraine, what we call the full-scale invasion, they also, according to Peskov, assessed the events of the 24th of June.Now, let's not forget that on the 24th of June, when that mutiny was taking place, President Putin called the mutiny treason. And here he is, five days after that, actually meeting with the man behind that treason. Now, of course, since the 29th of June, there have been a lot of questions, now that we know they met on the 29th of June, where Prigozhin actually is. People thought he was in Belarus. Then the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said, no, he's in St. Petersburg, maybe he's going to Moscow. So, this situation in Russia, which was already mind-boggling on the 24th of June, is only getting more mysterious. Phil.",

He accused them of not providing enough ammunition and now he has appeared, for the first time since that mutiny, he was being briefed on what appears to have been a Ukrainian attempt to fire cruise missiles at that strategic bridge linking Russia and Crimea.There were rumors yesterday that he had been dismissed or demoted. But here we see Gerasimov back in public again. We cannot verify when this video was shot, but it does appear that he's being reintroduced to the Russian public in his normal capacity.

It was the sixth meeting between the two world leaders. Biden just left 10 Downing Street. He is now headed to Windsor Castle to meet face-to-face with King Charles for the first time since his coronation. Critical meetings with NATO leaders just a few hundred miles from the fighting in Ukraine. Russia's war posing the biggest threat to global stability for the alliance in recent history. And perhaps the most difficult questions at the summit will be about a pathway for Ukraine to joining NATO. Listen to what President Biden told Fareed Zakaria. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is going to be the key thing that they're going to be discussing. Are they going to actually make this work? Then you have Sweden's succession to NATO. That's another country that is trying to enter the NATO alliance for the first time in its history. And then, of course, the type of assistance that we will actually be providing to Ukraine. Whether the west provides certain weapons, such as ATACMS, and F-16s. That's pretty much a done deal. But the ATACMS isn't. So there are a lot of things that they're going to do.

So, when it comes to the moral compass that you actually need to make this work, you need to be able to have a path forward for this.I do believe that it's very important, from a moral standpoint, that Ukraine be allowed to enter the NATO alliance and that the pathway be very clear in this case.",

That have been a decision that is met with some controversy that the United States decided to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions.

It goes all the way from Australia, to Canada, to countries in South America and in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Europe.Now, the countries that don't ban cluster munitions include the U.S., North Korea, Russia, Ukraine, China, Turkey and Iran. So, these countries are, you know, part of a group that still is using these weapons. And the reason they're using these weapons is because they don't see an alternative. Now, when it comes to what's happening in Ukraine, we don't see an alternative because the defense industrial base has actually not kept pace with the munitions needs that Ukraine has. They -- if they don't use cluster munitions right now, they will run out of munitions, and that's the argument that President Biden is making and why he believes that the United States has to offer cluster munitions to the Ukrainians at this point in time.",

President Biden, you know, if there's one area where I think foreign policy is certainly something that he has some expertise in over his five plus decades working in Washington with in the U.S. Senate, vice president and now president. But I think when you talk to his national security team, what they've been able to do in terms of NATO, in terms of strengthening the alliance over the course of the last year plus, has been, I think, one of the cornerstones of this administration.

And there's this looming issue, of course, of Ukraine joining the NATO. The president said he doesn't want to go to direct war with Russia. That any membership with Ukraine would happen after the war.But there's also the argument being made that Putin is weakened right now and that this might be the time. What do you say? AMB. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Putin is weakened. There's no doubt. The alliance is strong. And the president is, of course, right that now immediately this week is not the time for Ukraine to join NATO because they are in a war. The Ukrainians say that. President Zelenskyy says that. Now is not the time. The question is, what's the pathway? How do you get there? Because they -- everybody -- the NATO alliance in particular is almost unanimous here that the NATO alliance will accept Ukraine in. Will invite Ukraine in. And so moving in that direction, what are the path -- what are the steps on that path to get there? That's what they're looking for right now.",

That they'll come up with because, again, the NATO allies, most of the allies are there. They are even farther -- leaning far more forward than we are.

And the real challenge is the deal that was reached that Kevin McCarthy cut with the White House to raise the national debt limit. Under that deal, they agreed to spending levels that the House and the Senate would agree upon.There's a problem, though. A group of hard right Republicans essentially rejected that agreement and they have the power, given the narrowness of the House Republican majority, a handful of members can certainly hold up the process. And as a result, despite a deal that was being reached on the overall spending levels, Kevin McCarthy was forced to acquiesce to the demands of the hard right members who cut federal spending even more. This is the real challenge because Senate Republicans are opposed to the levels that Kevin McCarthy has agreed to with the hard right of his conference. So now he's got to reach an agreement, not only just among his own members, get it through the House, but also get Senate Republicans on board. And they are tens of billions of dollars apart on how to cut spending and how to deal with spending levels on a wide range of programs, which is going to make things incredibly difficult. And if Kevin McCarthy were to compromise and go beyond the levels that the hard right wants, they have that weapon that he agreed to back in the speaker's race back in January where any single member could call for a vote seeking his ouster as the speaker, which raises the challenges for him internally, as well as trying to simply do the basic job of governing and funding the government.
