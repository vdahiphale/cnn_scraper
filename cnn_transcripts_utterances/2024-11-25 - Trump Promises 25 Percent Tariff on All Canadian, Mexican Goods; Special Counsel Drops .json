So, let's get right to what America is talking about, prices. Tonight, Donald Trump wants to hit Canada and China and Mexico in their wallets, which means tariffs. We are back apparently to the era of federal policy announced via social media, the president-elect on Truth Social, of course promising to penalize both neighbors to the north and to the south with a 25 percent tariff on all products entering the U.S. starting on day one of his second term. Trump also vowing financial vengeance on China with a 10 percent tariff, on top of all the other tariffs already in place against Beijing. CNN Economics Commentator Catherine Rampell joins us in the fifth seat. And, Catherine, I want to start with your initial reaction to this 25 percent, because it's not unexpected, right? We've been hearing that tariffs would be coming with a Trump administration.",

Two-thirds of the tomatoes that Americans purchase are from Mexico. 90 percent of the avocados that they purchase are from Mexico. Just to mention two examples, so that guac is definitely going to cost extra. If you voted for Trump because you thought he was going to bring down the cost of housing, a lot of our lumber, cement, other materials comes from Canada, which means that construction costs are going to go up, not to mention all of the ways he's going to roil the U.S. auto industry, because a lot of autos cross borders in North America multiple times before they're ultimately finished and sold to consumers, not to mention the fact that a lot of U.S. manufacturers purchase inputs, intermediate goods, like metals and cement and other things, from Canada, from Mexico. And not to mention even the retaliation that we should expect.

He always says, this is what I want to see. I want to see fentanyl response from China. I want to see closing the borders. I want to see immigration.And we went through a lot of this in the first term. And Trump would always say, we're going to have the biggest, the most terrible tariffs you've ever seen. We're going to tear up the hell out of you. And inevitably there'd be some sort of -- everyone would panic, and then there'd be some sort of sense of, okay, can we get a fig leaf? Can we get some sort of policy change that Trump can point to and say, this is a win? USMCA was not dramatically different from NAFTA, but Trump acted like he had completely reinvented it and finally gotten Americans this much better deal.

CORNISH:  And I want to add one thing. You said it's not this season, but you already have many American companies speaking to the media, right, saying, you know, whether it be Walmart, whether it be whoever. I know in our podcast, we're talking to people in the fashion industry about like what the materials they're buying ahead of time. So, it will make a big difference even if it means people rushing in this moment. I want to move to this issue of immigration since you guys kind of have all touched on it here, which is that you have the sort of potential incoming administration talking about how they will wield policy.

Almost every cabinet position had two.And we have a whole bunch of people who are experienced from the world of television stepping into administrative jobs where they're going to be fighting bureaucracy day after day.

It's Republicans, however, who are guarding our norms and traditions of the Senate. They didn't stand for it under Trump the first time. They're going to guard it again this time.
