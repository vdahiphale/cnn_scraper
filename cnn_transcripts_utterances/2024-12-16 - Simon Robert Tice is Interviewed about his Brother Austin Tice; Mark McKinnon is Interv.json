Tice was one of the first American journalists on the ground as Syria's civil war grew in intensity, but he was abducted and jailed by Syria's government in late 2012.Now, over a decade later, the doors of Assad's prisons have been opened and hundreds of Syrian families are searching for long lost loved ones. One U.S. official tells CNN, there's a full court press to find Tice, and Austin's mother says the images coming out of Syria give her family hope for their son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEBRA TICE, AUSTIN TICE'S MOTHER: For us, you know, this - this kind of chaos, for us it represented a huge opening, a huge opportunity. And especially when people started going into the prisons, finding their families, you know, there was a man that had been held in silence for 34 years, and he was reunited with his family. And so, you know, we just - we're just really excited about being a reunited family. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
