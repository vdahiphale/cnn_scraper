Breaking news in the search for the killer with fake I.D.s, a bus trip from Atlanta, words scrawled on live rounds, and tonight we have some new details of new evidence in the hunt for the gunman who murdered the UnitedHealthcare CEO. CNN is learning a lot in the last 24 hours about this suspect who is now the subject of a frenzied and far and wide search of this city. A source says that the gunman arrived in New York on a bus out of Atlanta. He was in the city for ten days before the shooting. He used a fake I.D. from New Jersey to check into a hostel here in Manhattan, where he paid in cash. He fled the scene on an ebike. And as of this hour, no one is under arrest, but police are looking for this man. He's identified as a person of interest. The photos were gleaned from that very hostel, and the man in the picture only lowered his mask, we're told, because a hostile employee was flirting with him. That's according to a law enforcement official. Let me bring in first CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, who is live outside of that hostile in New York City on the upper west side. Shimon, investigators found quite a lot of clues. I mean, this is a big break in an investigation like this. Can you paint the picture for us? What is it like there and what did they learn?",

      "sentences": "Well, during the day today, police were back out here. They started their investigation yesterday at the hostel. They learned several hours after the murder that a person of interest was at this hostel. And as you said, that individual arrived here on November 24th.What's interesting is that he checks out, actually, from the hostel on the 29th. Then comes back on the 30th and checks in, and then obviously, a few days later, we get this horrific murder in Midtown. So, you know, investigators have been out here looking for more video. We saw investigators out through this neighborhood looking for other video of the suspect. The thing is what's so important for them is they're trying to figure out his movement. And they've been doing a pretty good job of learning where he was in the days leading up to the murder. The big question now is, obviously, where is he? Where did he go in the hours after the murder? The last piece of video that we know that we have seen and that we have obtained is of him on his bike at West 85th Street. It's believed that he was coming out of Central Park and going west on 85th Street. And after that, we do not know where he goes. And certainly, investigators have not told us, and perhaps there is other video out there, we just don't have it. And that is the big question. Where did he go? Now, interestingly enough, Abby, also, when law enforcement sees him again on that bike on West 85th Street, he does not have the backpack that we see him wearing when the shooting occurs. And they believe that he dropped the backpack that he got rid of it inside Central Park. They have not been able to find them. So, they've been gathering a lot of clues, certainly knowing where he stayed here behind me at this hostel has been an important clue. They've been able to talk to people inside of here. They've been looking for other video inside the hostel. So, they have a lot of information leading up to the day of the murder. Now the big question is where is he and what happened in the hours and now days, two days, since this happened.",

John, let me start where we left off Shimon left off, which is all the clues that we've gotten today, I think, seem to indicate basically the same thing. This was a man who, it seemed, went to some great lengths to conceal his comings and goings.

But as they've developed this video canvas, you know, spreading out the days leading up to this and much, much more time than we first thought, you know, now we know he's here ten days on the ground, not a couple of days. He never takes that mask off. He never puts that hood down because they've been searching. They've been searching for that one moment where he gets out of a taxi or he sits in McDonald's and, you know, he takes the hood back and you see the whole head. What does the hair look like? What does the face look like connected to that? He doesn't do that. Now, they're still looking. They may find that.

But it's just how tactical, purposeful, professional, in some ways, the killing was. And then he sort of vanishes into thin air. Like New York Police Department's very, very good, and, you know, they may be close, but it's now 48 hours.So, you know, you could put the motive into three buckets relatively easy, and one is something quite personal that we're not looking at yet, something that just has to do with him and nothing to do with the company. The second is you would normally think about maybe a former employee, someone who had a personal hatred towards him having to do with work. And then the third is someone who was denied health insurance or some sort of claim. The person who killed him wants us to think it's that third. But they're pretty smart. I mean, what they've done so far is they've sort of, they bypassed all surveillance. They've gotten there -- you know, we can't really tell who this person is.

You would see him vanish into thin air, even in a place like Manhattan.And the thing about Manhattan, as everyone here knows, you know, living here and working here, is that it's, there are just so many people and so many places to duck and hide. He could have got off at 85th Street and gotten into the nearest subway and that's it, been gone. He could have went down to the bus station, maybe hopped the bus back to Atlanta. So, you know, a trained assassin or professional assassin, so to speak, is just going to appear, do his bit or her bit, and then disappear without leaving anything behind, certainly not a cell phone, not a bottle. And the weapon itself, you know, he chose to use some sort of a silencer on the gun but yet chose to shoot this person in clear view of almost a handful of people.

If they want more government services, they have to raise taxes. That was Dick Darman and George Herbert Walker Bush's strategy 30 years ago. And it worked and it got us to a budget surplus in 10 years. MONDAIRE JONES (D) FORMER U.S.:  We're not just talking about a dysfunctional Congress. We're talking about Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy who have demonstrated that they don't know very much about the way government works. I do think this is a real opportunity for there to be bipartisanship when it comes to cutting waste. Democrats, especially progressive Democrats in Congress have laser -- been laser focused on the Defense Department for example, which just this year failed its seventh consecutive audit. And so, if there is seriousness about getting rid of waste in government, that would be one area where folks on both sides of the aisle should be able to commit to looking into.",
