      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins on a very busy Sunday night at Mar-a-Lago.We have some new reporting for you this evening on what's been going on in the last 48 hours inside Donald Trump's orbit as the president- elect is now narrowing down his choices for critical roles in his incoming administration. Staffing was one of Trump's biggest regrets in his first term and he has vowed to get it right this time, which for him means hiring people who are more loyal to him and less likely to push back. Apparently there are many people eager to meet that requirement. Mar-a-Lago has basically been brimming for the last few days, I'm told, with two kinds of people, those angling for a job and those who are trying to influence Trump into hiring their pics. But one person has loomed over all of that. His name is Elon Musk. Multiple sources tell me tonight that Musk has been seen at Mar-a-Lago nearly every single day since Donald Trump won, dining with him on the patio at times. Today they were seen on the golf course together. Musk has been in the room when world leaders have called Trump and tonight we've learned he's also weighing in on staffing decisions, making clear his preference for certain roles even. Publicly tonight Elon Musk is backing Florida Senator Rick Scott as the next leader of the Republican conference to replace Mitch McConnell. While Musk himself is still not expected to take any kind of formal position inside Trump's administration given how complicated it would be with his companies, what's becoming clearer tonight is that he doesn't really need to with one source telling me Elon Musk is having just as much influence from the outside. With Trump on the verge of announcing some new hires including several people who served in his last administration, he did confirm today there are two who will not be asked back. Nikki Haley, who served as his ambassador to the United Nations, and Mike Pompeo, who is Trump's CIA director and secretary of state the last time around. The former president very publicly crossed their names off his list with this post on Truth Social, saying, quote, \"I will not be inviting former ambassador Haley or Secretary Pompeo to join the Trump administration.\" Joining me now is CNN's Alayna Treene, who's covering Trump in West Palm Beach. Alayna, what are you hearing about not just Musk but also what else has been going on down there over the last few days?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think attorney general and I know you know this as well, Kaitland, this is the most important role for Donald Trump. And actually when he had left the White House back in 2021 he had said privately that his biggest regret was who he hired to fill the role of his attorney general, referring directly to his attorneys general Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr.And so this time around, he really wants whoever his attorney general to be is going to be someone that is in lockstep with him. He wants his attorney general to be his legal pit bull. And part of that as well, I should note, is that he wants to completely change how the Department of Justice operates. He no longer wants it to be as independent as it has been traditionally and over the past several years now. Instead he wants it to be operating alongside him and of course potentially even using his attorney general to help prosecute some of his political opponents. I think the other big roles that I'm told Donald Trump values most right now includes the CIA director, includes secretary of Defense and secretary of Homeland Security. I think that also is just a good preview of what Donald Trump may do with all of those agencies and what he is looking forward to as his biggest priorities come January 20th.",

He's been accused of firing people within his companies who disagree with him. I think that's awful. But here's what, my opinion doesn't matter. Donald Trump was given the keys to the kingdom last week. And with that he gets to put anyone he wants around him, and it can be the people that I think are very dangerous to democracy, it doesn't matter.This was a mandate. Unlike 2016 where Donald Trump won the Republican primary by a plurality because 1800 people ran alongside him. And then there was this sense of when he went in that he, you know, he wasn't really going to know what he was doing so they surrounded him with people who had already been in, you know, the establishment, in Republican circles, in the administration. This is not that time. He gets to bring in anyone he wants. We could hate it, we could be very afraid of it, but that's what he won and I would not blame him for bringing people he thinks are loyal to him and he thinks are going to help him implement his vision of the country. Not one bit. BILL DE BLASIO (D), FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, I hear you. I think you're right about the reality. But I think we should ask the question about conflict, and those examples that Shermichael gave which I think we're very historically helpful. The difference here is Elon Musk combines world's richest man with defense contractor with the person who controls Twitter or X. That is not something we've seen before. And the potential there for it to be a further constraint on the function of government, certainly he could be favored in the function of government, with really big contracts that the public should be worried about that.",

There are some very complicated things he's going to have to address for the American people whether it's the economics, economic dislocation. We've seen major technological advancements and the implications for that on work, particularly among men.Maybe Elon Musk can help advise the former president about making some of the decisions that could be helpful through the legislative process. I'm also looking at the foreign policy issue and maybe having some of those outside individuals that Musk can maybe bring to the president's table could also help as well. So I understand why people may be concerned. I would pause and say give the former president the opportunity to see what the advice is, and how does that advice in a positive aspect maybe help him lead and govern a little differently.",

It's every single state where he outperformed his 2020 performance.I went back through the record books, Kaitlan Collins, and I looked at every single election dating back since 1976, when did a party's candidate do better than the prior candidate for that same party did in the last election. It's the first time since Jimmy Carter in 1976 where they outperformed in every single state plus the District of Columbia. That is how wide Donald Trump's win was in this particular year. But there's another way you can get an idea of how wide Donald Trump's win was in this particular year. Let's take a look. You mentioned, the electoral votes, right? 312, 312. You go back to, let's go all the way back to 2016, how many did Donald Trump get that year? He got 306 if you tally up the states that he won obviously when they actually gathered the electoral college. It was slightly less than that but he won in states containing 306 electoral votes. The last time a Republican won that many, I have to go all the way back, we have to go all the way back to 1988. We don't have it up here but George H.W. Bush won over 400 electoral votes. So the bottom line is this was an absolutely mammoth win for Donald Trump. The fact is he put in a strong electoral college performance this time around than any Republican since George H.W. Bush.",

So one thing that was very interesting is right after the election, the markets didn't actually believe that he was going to do what he said, which is protect U.S. manufacturing jobs, you know, put tariffs, broad-based tariffs on.You know, be protectionist in a way that, say, Pennsylvania or, you know, other parts of blue wall wanted to hear. It thought, hey, tax cuts, we're going to go back to the 19th century, you know, it's going to be oligarchs running the economy. It's going to be a free-for-all. We're going to use debt and deficit to bolster asset prices again. So the markets started going up. We are, Kaitlan, six years overdue for a recession if you discount the COVID V shaped blip. So I am worried that Trump is actually going to push us into potentially a little bit more fraught, you know, there's going to be an M and A boom because he's going to get rid of Lina Khan, he's going to get rid of antitrust policies from the Biden ministration. We're going to get a sugar high briefly but then I think it's very possible you're going to get a market crash at the same time that you've got debt and deficit levels rising.

The big thing about the North Koreans is that their presence could expand quite a bit so if you talk about 10,000 now, being basically what we say in theater is somewhere probably near Kursk, in or near the Kursk region, there's a possibility of a total of 100,000 coming in over the course of the next year. So if that's the case, that could definitely tip the balance in favor of the Russian forces as they maneuver in and around Ukraine and that could definitely make a difference when it comes to the personnel shortages that the Russians are experiencing.
