Let's bring in now retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Steve Anderson and former director of communications for U.S. National Intelligence Shawn Turner. Gentlemen, good morning to you. General, let me start with you and what is happening now? What is the IDF doing and what does practically increasing operational readiness for the next stages of the war mean? BRIG, GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, thank you, Victor. What that means is that they are getting ready to execute their war fight and a war plan. They are preparing -- they are gathering food and ammunition, all the logistics they need, water, et cetera. They are probably getting, hopefully, lots of rest. Because that's what soldiers need before they do this. But they are also gathering intelligence and they're trying -- probably going to do some probing patrols to find out where the weakest spots are and no doubt they are going to continue to apply pressure. They need to -- we saw the reports about the shortages of water and fuel. That's exactly what a blockade is intended to do. Because what that's going to do is going to yield, hopefully, intelligence. We want the Palestinian people to be complaining to Hamas and saying, hey, you got us into this. Now get us out of this. And the way they can do that, of course, is to release the hostages and shut this thing down. But they are getting ready to fight. I hope the Israelis show restraint. They are in a good position right now. They occupy the moral high ground. They need to retain that for as long as they possibly can because the minute they start their attack, they are going to lose it.",

I mean, it's going to be an absolute mess trying to take and capture Gaza City, I believe, is not something they should try to do.What they need to do is they need to surround it. They need to tighten the noose. They need to establish a blockade and they need to make it painful for the people -- the Palestinian people so that they come up on the net with Hamas and they say, look, get us out of this.

Now, we've heard conflicting reports as to what Egypt is doing. There are those who say that Egypt has actually not opened the crossing. That actually they have been putting up barriers to prevent Palestinians civilians from entering the Sinai. If so, that would be tremendously discouraging. And I certainly hope that the Egyptians will take seriously their responsibility to the people of Gaza to ensure that they are able to maintain their humanitarian condition. Obviously, this is tremendous humanitarian situation.

It does not get its own hands dirty with this and it does not risk taking on Israel directly.So, if when Iran says it will get involved, I would assume it would try to get involved through Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has been firing some rockets into Israel, but these are more in the nature of shots across the bow. It has not matched, say, Hamas' operation, Hamas' terrorist attack last week by sort of getting its strength, getting its people in strength into Israel in the north. Should that happen, that would be an enormous game changer for this conflict. Then Israel has a two-front war to fight. And Lebanon in the north is a more difficult place to operate. It's a sort of more complex terrain. And Hezbollah has had a lot of recent practice in fighting wars because Hezbollah's fighters have been active in the Syrian civil war for a long time now. So, they have battle hardened veterans as well as quite substantial supplies of weapons, sophisticated weapons from Iran. So, that's something I think we won't be looking out for, talking about since the beginning of this conflict. Will Lebanon get involved? Will Iran push Lebanon to get involved through Hezbollah? So far, that hasn't happened.

(END VIDEOTAPE) SIDNER (on camera): So, that is a situation for up to 150 families, 150 possible hostages in Gaza. I do want to take you to Gaza now because you have a whole huge population, perhaps one of the densest populated places on Earth. There has been some smoke that has been rising from the area there. We haven't seen that in a bit. As you just saw there, the troops on the Israel side are amassing at that border. There have been air strikes throughout the last of what, six days now. The first surprise attack from Hamas came on a Saturday. We are now at Sunday. But there is such fear such terror, such anxiety in Gaza with two million people packed into such a tiny space. It's about two times the size of Washington, D.C., but has three times the number of people living and working there. A very, very, very difficult situation for the families there, the innocent people there and for those who have been taken hostage by Hamas. No one has heard anything about the status of any of the hostages that have been taken. There's just a lot of sorrow, fear, and anxiety on both sides of this intractable situation, this intractable conflict.",

Congressman Jim Jordan is the GOP's nominee for the job, but there is a big problem. He is still far short of the 217 votes needed to get the gavel. He only got 152 votes in a secret ballot after Steve Scalise abandoned his bid. And we're told that Jordan has been spending the weekend trying to win over holdouts.Joining us now is CNN Political Commentator Scott Jennings. Scott, he can only afford to lose four. Five and all the Democrats is a loss. Are there five absolute nos on Jim Jordan? Can he get there?",

I mean, Steve Scalise was the GOP nominee, and he had to drop out. Kevin McCarthy, of course, was the selection of the conference. He's no longer the Speaker of the House, so that means nothing. And there are significant concerns with Jordan among people who are on the Armed Services Committee, Defense hawks, and a few more moderate members of the party.I think the Jordan plan is to try to essentially use the conservative grassroots to bully these people when they actually have to go on the floor and cast their ballot publicly. What happened in conference was a secret ballot, but I don't know. I talked to 1 member this weekend who told me that it was possible but not likely. So, that that was one man's handicapping.",
