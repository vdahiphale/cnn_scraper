There were some efforts to speed up NORAD spending and development on the Canadian side. Certainly discussions about the economic and trade issues that very much animate the relationship at this point, at least in terms of their disagreements. But more than anything else, President Biden -- and to some degree president -- or Prime Minister Trudeau -- wanted to underscore that it is a very strong alliance. It is a bilateral relationship that is both steadfast, has great history and that history is only going to lead to more in the future. And where there are disagreements -- and there certainly are -- they will resolve them. And if they don't, they will remain friends, as President Biden put it in his speech to parliament.

And so the United States is trying to find the path forward for -- to reduce violence in Haiti, perhaps to introduce some sort of international peace force under U.N. auspices.

And so there's been real discussions over the past several months, frankly, between Washington and Ottawa to see if Washington can't really encourage Canadians to take the lead.

And so we just end up hurting ourselves. It's not an issue that has been resolved. It's one that comes up perennially.

But that really is in crisis.As you said the IPCC report published on Monday shows just how difficult it's going to be to keep 1.5 degrees in reach because our climate is heating up and that's producing more and more extreme weather. We've also lost 69 percent of our wildlife populations in the last 50 years. So it's a symbolic action. But it's an action that's incredibly important because, together, we can show that individual actions plus the actions, really importantly of government and business, can make a difference to the survival of the human species if you like.",

I leave my flowers in my tiny little box garden in London to grow a little bit wilder. I look at where my pension is invested. I might walk more, drive less and, importantly, I'm using my voice where I can. I'm talking to my family. I'm talking to my friends about what I've learned. We're having conversations about the small things that we can do and what we want our government and the businesses and the places we consume from to do as well. All of that can really add up and make a difference. And it's important to know that millions of people that doing it at the same time as you, it makes you feel good; 8:30 pm tonight, Earth Hour, we really want as many people as possible to join us and to bank those hours to tell us what you've been doing, bank those hours on the WWF -- our website.",
