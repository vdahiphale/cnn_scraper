Among the last state's reporting results, Alaska, where CNN now projects Trump will win the Republican primary there. Trump is also projected to pick up a big win in delicate, rich California, a victory there too for Biden. The U.S. president is also heading for a win in Utah's Democratic race. He has so far won every Super Tuesday contest except American Samoa. Well, there was one small prize on the night for Nikki Haley. CNN projects she will win Vermont's Republican primary with 17 delegates were at stake. Despite that win, Trump has built a commanding lead in the delegate count over Haley, his only remaining Republican opponent. Trump didn't mention Haley during his victory speech, but did criticize President Biden and his immigration policies. Here's part of his message to supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They call it Super Tuesday for a reason. This is a big one. And they tell me, the pundits and otherwise, that there's never been one like this has never been anything so conclusive. This was an amazing, an amazing night, an amazing day. It's been an incredible period of time in our country's history. It's been sad in so many ways, but I think it's going to be inspiring because we're going to do something that frankly, nobody's been able to do for a long time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now that's not a foregone conclusion completely, he's gonna have to run in November, but he's running against a Republican. California voters had an opportunity to elect a far more liberal candidate, a ceasefire candidate in Barbara Lee, and they rejected Barbara Lee outright. Adam Schiff is by all projections going to be the next senator from the golden state of California. And I think this is a real sign that at the end of the day, Democratic voters will make that call, not solely on the issue of Gaza and Israel, but on larger issues around democracy and ensuring that Joe Biden is able to advance against Donald Trump in 2024.",

It's not a large proportion of those voters, but it is a significant proportion and it has a steady and consistent one over the last several election cycles. So most certainly the Biden camp is going to have to do work to build back those relationships where they can. We see a lot of the shift in some of these voters having to do with the culture wars that are going on throughout the United States and some sort of preference for Donald Trump and his sort of strong man, masculine nature that he has.

Two key Russian military commanders, both functioning in the Black Sea area, issued arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court.Two of them both accused of being involved in attacks on civilian infrastructure and essentially the damage that has caused to the civilian population, essentially killing innocent civilians here. The warrant points to two individuals, Admiral Viktor Sokolov and another man, Lieutenant General Sergei Kobylash, both of whom were key commanders in the Black Sea. The warrant suggests during the last couple of years, while much munitions fired against civilian areas were initially originating from the Black Sea fleet. That Black Sea fleet itself, though, targeted by Ukraine over the past hours. The Ukrainian intelligence service suggested they managed to take out a patrol ship called the Sergei Kotov that cost $65 million, they said. Another example of how Ukraine has begun to project its force into areas that Moscow would normally have considered to be its safe territory. These outlying suggestions of Ukrainian strategic success, it comes at a time of extraordinary trouble for Ukraine here near the Eastern Front, where I'm standing. You can hear the distant rumble of explosions far away from me. Really, Ukraine is struggling to hold the defensive line it said it would be able to maintain after it pulled out of the town of Avdiivka about two weekends ago. Avdiivka had been fought over for months and Ukraine said that it had voluntarily pulled back. It gave up a number of villages in its retreat and it said it would hold another three villages, those villages themselves under significant Russian repeated persistent assault. Russia able to throw extraordinary resources at these particular objectives and Ukraine, I think on the best of days, struggling to suggest that it has that fight calmed entirely. It's significant because if we do see Russia continue to put pressure on Ukrainian front lines around me here, there are minimal signs that there is another back defensive line prepared for Ukraine to be able to hold. And so we are dealing with a very complex time for Ukraine at this moment. They're able to project success in the Black Sea. Yes, they even suggested in the recent days they hit a bridge 500 miles inside Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said they took 15 fighter jets out of the sky in February alone. They are doing things that nobody felt they could do at the start of the war. But the one thing they're able to do right now is hold key parts of the Donbass front line because they haven't got the munitions they need from the West. And that is because of the hold up in Republican-held Congress. No sign of that changing at all. And we hear from Ukrainian fighters on the front line here that it's simply a matter of life and death until that changes. And already the resurgence of Russia is changing the front line calculus daily. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is just after sunrise and as you may see, there is a large Chinese Coast Guard ship directly in front of this Philippine Coast Guard vessel. And we've been watching this over the course of the last hour. These are supposed to be international waterways with free passage. I'm aboard this Philippine Coast Guard ship that was part of a convoy of four vessels that were headed towards a place called the Second Thomas Shoal. And before dawn, all of a sudden, these Philippine ships were swarmed by much larger and many more Chinese ships that are more off to our port bow. These are not marked like the Chinese Coast Guard ships, but they're clearly operating with them and operating in very close proximity to this Philippine Coast Guard ship. In fact, I've seen them in the past cutting this off. And what they've succeeded in doing is not only pretty much stopping our ship in its tracks, but it has separated this ship from the other boats in the Philippines convoy, which included two small resupply vessels that were trying to get to the Second Thomas Shoal. Now, part of what is at play here is a territorial dispute. That shoal, the Philippines claims, is part of its economic exclusion zone. China, though it is much further geographically from this area, claims it for itself and clearly tries to stop Philippine ships from getting to it. We're completely encircled by a fleet of Chinese ships, at least 14 that I've counted. And moments ago, the Chinese Coast Guard ships were blasting a Philippines resupply vessel with water cannons. It is clearly, by swarming this ship, a show of force and a show of intimidation.

But people who live there, people who are in Texas and Arizona, they know that it's not an invasion. An invasion is what's happening in Ukraine and in Gaza. We do have a border crisis, certainly, but it's not really being presented to the American people in a way, I think, in a realistic way. What we have at the border, in my view, we have a humanitarian crisis of thousands of people waiting to enter the country, not to mention millions within the country with no process to adjust their status.
