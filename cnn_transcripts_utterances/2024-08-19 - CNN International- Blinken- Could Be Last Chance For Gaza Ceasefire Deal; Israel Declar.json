But, just last night, Tel Aviv, not far from where we're standing right now, was rocked by an explosion, and now Hamas and Islamic Jihad are claiming responsibility.(VIDEO PLAYING) Police here in Israel are calling this a terrorist attack. They say the only person killed was the bomber himself, though a passerby was injured. That's the atmosphere here right now, already nervous, as these talks continue. CNN State Department Reporter Jennifer Hansler is here with me in Tel Aviv. Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen, he is in Tehran, of course, has a stake in this as well. Jennifer, first to you, Blinken is here. Of course, it's important for him to meet directly with the Israeli leaders, but that's just one piece of the negotiation. On that piece of the negotiation, are we confident that the U.S. and Israel are on the same page?",

Coming out of this meeting with Netanyahu, which I should say is three hours long earlier today, two and a half of those hours were just Blinken and Netanyahu meeting one on one. Coming out of that meeting, they do seem to be on the same page. Both sides are saying these were constructive, productive meetings. The Prime Minister's Office said they had reiterated their commitment to this bridging proposal that the U.S. put forward, a source familiar with that deal. The meeting also said that the Prime Minister reiterated their commitment to the deal and said they would send negotiators on to these talks that are going to be happening this week, and they expect the process to move forward.However, behind the scenes, we expect that there were largely probably very difficult conversations that were had in that three hour meeting about a plethora of issues, not only on the ceasefire deal, but on this issue of the day after in Gaza, what happens on governance, happens on security, and this prospect of perhaps a Palestinian state moving forward? So, we have to see. Yeah.",

But, it's -- a lot of optimism we've heard over the past week or so has not been reflected from one of the key parties in this deal, and that is Hamas, the fact that they did put out that statement, basically seeming to reject the proposal at hand. Now, whether that's posturing, whether that is an actual outright rejection, the U.S. doesn't think it is.But, we'll have to see whether they sign on to this deal that the U.S. is pushing for, and that is why Blinken is in the region to try to get this across the finish line.

The Iranians today came out with another statement confirming essentially what you guys were just saying, that, first of all, they are very closely monitoring those ceasefire talks, but at the same time, of course, that for them, retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is still very much in the cards.The spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry came out today and said the Iranians actually want a ceasefire agreement to be worked out. They say that's something that they believe is in their interest. But, at the same time, they also say that they are not optimistic that one can be worked out, because they believe that the Israeli government, specifically, Prime Minister Netanyahu is not serious about working one out. They also don't really trust the U.S. as being objective mediators in all of that. But, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Jim, also said that to the Iranians, the negotiations for the ceasefire and their own perspective retaliation against Israel are two very separate issues. Here is what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Iran says its drones and missiles are ready for an attack against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh.

This time, they attacked our mainland. The world will witness a serious reaction by us, the time, the place, and the type of reaction is to be decided, he says, and then adds, you saw the first example. You can multiply that as much as you like. We will teach our enemies a lesson so they will not attack us anymore, this parliamentarian says. We are seeking peace and calm in the region and are not warmongers at all. The U.S. says it's seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas also in the hopes a deal to end the violence in Gaza could persuade Iran not to launch the retaliatory strikes against Israel. But, Washington has also deployed substantial forces to the Middle East. A senior Biden administration official warning Iran could face, quote, \"cataclysmic consequences if it attacks Israel\". Iranian parliamentarians brushing off that warning. If they attack or threaten us, the Iranian response will be jaw breaking, he says. Iran has showed in practice it will do so and has the means to do so. The capabilities we have are not what the world knows about. They are far beyond. But, when, where and how Iran plans to use those capabilities remains shrouded in secrecy, keeping the Middle East on edge. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think President Biden is taking this speech that he'll deliver this evening very seriously. He spent all weekend up at Camp David, revising his words with two senior officials. And I think he really does feel the weight of this moment. He first came to a Democratic National Convention in 1972. Back then, he was a long-shot candidate to become the youngest member of the U.S. Senate, and tonight really represents the end of that political arc. He is the oldest sitting incumbent President handing off the baton to his Vice President, his chosen successor.There is no question, this is not the address that President Biden once hoped to give, once wanted to give, and certainly, I think he is still processing some of what led to his departure from the top of the Democratic ticket. But, when you talk to senior Biden officials, they do say that he does want to make clear in his speech this evening that he views Kamala Harris as the best person to carry on what he started in office, and then it's the best inheritor of his legacy, and you will hear that from him tonight. And we did also hear from the White House Communications Director, Ben LaBolt, earlier, saying that President Biden would also call out Trump by name. This is a political convention. There won't be sort of any veiled references to the former guy. He does want to make clear the threat he views to democracy if Trump were to regain the presidency. Now, Kamala Harris will be in this arena this evening to listen to President Biden's speech. That was something that was important to her personally. But, afterwards, President Biden and his wife will head off to vacation in California, essentially giving the keys to the Democratic Convention to Harris. And when you look at the program that organizers have put together for this week, you see two clear themes, I think. One is to introduce Kamala Harris to the American public, who may just not have been paying attention until this point, and she'll certainly have a lot of help with that, two former presidents, two former first ladies, plenty of Democratic wattage to help her make her case. But, they'll also want to make clear the stakes of this election, the threat they see Donald Trump posing to democracy, and we are learning that they are featuring speakers who can sort of underscore that point for them, congressmen who served on the January 6 Committee in Congress, also a police officer who is wounded in the Capitol riot, all trying to underscore this point that President Trump would pose a threat to democracy, if he were to regain the White House. Of course, the capstone speech to the entire event will come Thursday when Kamala Harris speaks to this convention, and the real hope is that that speech will help propel her into the fall and into the heat of the election. There is no question she is coming into this convention on a swell of momentum. She has taken the lead in polls. But, when you talk to Harris advisors, they make clear this is still a very tight race. The real work will begin once this convention ends, Rahel.",

It's been not filled with hope, and that is what we're going to get, the visual imagery of, out of the Democrats for the next four days. So, there really isn't countering that in any way, other than justsaying that the moment is what it is. Let the Democrats say what they need to stay. As a political strategy, what Republicans can try to do is offer up some degree of solutions with what they hear coming from the podium in Chicago. Different speakers will be casting a vision for what they think America should be in the next four years. If Republicans want to have any hope again of looking like a positive party, looking like a forward-thinking party, looking like a solutions-oriented party, then they ought to be responding mono imano, which means taking it issue by issue. We all know there are hugely consequential issues at whatever demographic you're looking at for, whether it's Gen Xers or Gen Zers. There is housing. There is immigration. There is economy, and not least of all, reproductive care access.

He did this conference where he could have talked again about the data, about what a plan he has to make the economy more robust to counter what they call Bidenomics from the right. I didn't hear any specifics again. But, he believes that he can keep attacking Harris because she is running this campaign on vibes. And that's been talked about a great deal. People say you can't win an election based on vibes. I push back and I say it's going well so far.But, I'm thinking past these next four days, Rahel. I'm thinking, what is the strategy when they start to talk, and they meaning Harris-Walz, about their next four years? And this last week, we got a little glimpse of that when they talked price controls, and suddenly, the right was inflamed. They said that's Soviet talk. That's Communist talk. They started painting her as a Communist. So, see, that's Trump's way of needling, meddling, poking the bear, if you will, to activate the right against her. And he thinks that's a strategy that will be most successful as we roll past Labor Day and into the thick of the campaign, which means September, October. So, I would just say some free advice to the Harris-Walz campaign, continue to behave like moderates, continue to campaign like moderates, because all that the right and Trump have right now is trying to paint out this ticket, this Democrat ticket, as too progressive and too liberal to conquer the consequential challenges we see America facing today, whether it's economy, immigration or any other kitchen table issue.",

That's why we see higher education, healthcare and housing, all have such high levels of inflation. So, when you subsidize them this way, sometimes the prices just become higher. I do think, however, this will have the effect of making things more affordable, but it is a four year very, very large tax credit, and the idea that it will just disappear after four years, I think, is not realistic.We know Congress likes to extend things. That makes what will already be a very expensive credit, likely much more credit if it were to become permanent. And that's one thing we haven't talked about with any of these policies.

All of those things they've said we will offset those costs and support many of the Biden tax increases. They have not been as specific.When you're talking about former President Trump, it's interesting. He has much more so far, policies that will cost a lot of money. Those would make the deficit worse. But, he has also talked about some very significant higher new revenues through the tariffs that he is talking about. All told, none of these have been fleshed out yet. None of them are fully scored. But, both candidates, not surprisingly, we see this a lot in campaigns, are emphasizing all the things they would give away to taxpayers, new tax cuts, new spending, and they will have quite a hefty price tag that goes along with them.",

The main job here falls to the Fed. We'll be hearing a lot from them this week at Jackson Hole. There are some things that lawmakers, Congress and the President can do, but they're the opposite of what they normally want to do. When you make things cheaper for taxpayers and voters, obviously that helps making those things affordable, but that additional demand actually turns around and pushes those prices back up. That's why inflation is such a difficult thing to get control of once you've lost control.And so, making things cheaper by giving people more money to pay for them, ironically has the effect of actually making them more expensive through higher inflation, particularly if they add to the deficit.

The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, he is in back-to- back meetings today here in Israel. A source says his three-hour discussion with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was constructive. However, Israel and Hamas, the two parties on either side of the table here, are blaming each other for putting up new block -- obstacles to an agreement. Blinken says it is time for everyone to stop making excuses and get it done. Mediators do believe that reaching a ceasefire is critical if a wider regional war is to be avoided. Israel and Hezbollah, they exchanged fire yet again today across the northern border of Israel, which borders Lebanon, following an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Saturday, one of the deadliest since the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. Israel says its target was a Hezbollah facility where weapons are being stored. Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least 10 women were killed. This includes a woman and her two children. This sort of cross-border fire has been going on for months and months. Our Ben Wedeman is following the developments from Beirut.

The Ukrainian military says that it controls 1,000 square kilometers of Russian territory. Now, while the fighting continues, India's Prime Minister now plans to travel to Ukraine. This comes just after weeks after Kyiv criticized him for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin during a visit in Moscow. And a luxury yacht sank off the coast of Sicily after being hit by a tornado early this morning. Sicily's Coast Guard says that at least one person was killed. Six others are still missing. Among those missing is British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch. The yacht was anchored near the port of Porticello on Sicily. 15 people have been rescued, including one child. The yacht files under a British flag, and most of the passengers and crew were British. According to the fire brigade, the yacht's hull was bound 49 meters below sea by divers. The yacht's captain was among the rescued survivors. Well, still to come, this is not the first time the Democratic National Convention has been held in Chicago.

She will speak on Thursday to formally accept her party's nomination.Joining us now with his thoughts on conventions past and present is CNN Political Analyst and Historian Julian Zelizer. Julian, always good to have you. So, you said in a piece this morning on foreign policy site that Harris should look to Obama's 2004 speech at the DNC. You say it's as relevant now as it was then, even when he was an unknown quantity nationally. In what ways, Julian, can she borrow from that speech? JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; HISTORIAN &amp; PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: Yeah. That was his famous keynote address. He was a state Senator, and he made a speech which we could call kind of an ode to progressive patriotism. He talked about the communal values of this nation, the things that bind us rather than tear us apart. He talked about the role of government in alleviating some of the pain and uncertainty that Americans face in the marketplace, and he talked about himself as a product of what the new America is, pluralistic, diverse and global. And I think all of those themes are very important and should be front and center for Democrats as they talk to the nation in the coming days.",
