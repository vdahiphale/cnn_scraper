And so there are a lot of concerns, obviously, around 5G and whether or not it may pose interference to aircraft.But it's also the case that Europe has had cell phone availability on airplanes for years now and so the reason why we don't have that same capability in the U.S. has a lot more to do with societal factors and questions about whether you want your seatmate to be making an annoying phone call, guys.",

Those materials were turned over to the FBI and the source tell Sara that those were the only documents with classified markings.And as you said, they've searched for storage units according - or, excuse me, for locations according to our source, including Trump Tower, Bedminster the golf course and property in New Jersey and the storage unit. It's unclear what that fourth location is. But - so they - we seem to have kind of narrow down here that they have found these two documents, classified markings that appears to be the limitations of the materials with classified mark. So we don't know what other materials were found, because, of course, there's this bigger question of other presidential records, personal records, this ongoing dispute.

Are you willing to come to court and tell me that you did?So this is - I imagine the first element of this, we'll see what kind of behind the scenes conversations are going on between DOJ and the Trump's attorneys if they'll be forced to sign a sworn statement, which would put a lot more weight on that, a 0lot more pressure on the attorneys to attest to this.

There is very real history here and very real beating of the odds. And I think when you talk to White House officials, look, all the technical details and procedural details Amara laid out about that 51st vote are very real and matter quite a bit, especially considering it will be divided government. But I think there's a broader view of things right now as well in terms of validation to some degree about the President's agenda and the success that agenda had breaking through, sometimes success most people in the lead up to the first election data, the runoff Election Day weren't sure actually existed. There's also the president's messaging when it came to Republicans, particularly Republicans aligned with former President Donald Trump that they feel like resonated.

BROWNAnd so while I certainly think he may have been able to get one or two more points, just recently, a few days ago, at his - and a week ago that he referred to himself, as he said that he was called a coon and that a coon is one of the most smart - is the smartest animal out there. That's a very racist derogatory term that has been hurled at black people in the South that we don't take well lightly of. And people were very upset, but very embarrassed and had very strong opinions of not wanting Herschel Walker to represent Georgia or particularly represent our community. So I think that he had some other elements that worked against him. He also said that racism wasn't that bad.

I think Warnock had shown himself that he actually had been a candidate that stood with the community that had been a vocal advocate for voting rights and other issues for our community and he certainly was a favorite son from Georgia, so I think that that was one element.A second element, I think that you saw backlash from the voter suppression that when you look at even the difference, there's like a 97,000 point difference, vote difference between Walker and Warnock. When you look at on Election Day on that Saturday, when the Republicans, the Secretary of State wanted to prevent from - us from having Saturday voting, there were only nine - over 90,000 votes that were cast that day, right, alone. And so you could - I think that there was a backlash from that. And the third thing is black voters are sophisticated voters. We have real issues and real needs that need to be addressed and it was it was very insulting that there was a candidate that didn't speak to it, we didn't know what his position on anything really other than how he felt about vampires and werewolves and that he was going to plan on supporting a national abortion ban.",

And I would say the opportunity and the obligation for Democrats and Republicans who want to be real constitutional conservatives, not just in name only is going to be - find some areas of common ground starting with this lame duck, things like the Electoral Count Act to make sure an attempt to overturn an election isn't successful, again, Afghan Adjustment Act, things like the debt ceiling, deal with that.And then plot out a couple of big areas where we just might be able to find bipartisan reform in the coming year, maybe immigration reform, I'll be an eternal optimist, maybe algorithm reform, civics education, that's my wish list.

Dr. Roberts, thank you for taking the time to talk to us about this really important issue right now that you were dealing with.

But because we have so many individuals who are eligible, but unvaccinated we're having a spread here in Columbus. Measles is highly contagious, so if you were in one of those locations and not vaccinated you're at risk. We first started seeing this outbreak appear in daycare centers where we obviously have very vulnerable individuals because we have some kids who are under the age of one and they're too young to get vaccinated.",

We've seen a much higher rate of hospitalization here in our community, that's likely due to the lower age of our patients. The majority of our cases of measles in this outbreak are between the ages of one and two years of age and they've required hospitalization from - anything from dehydration to diarrhea, to pneumonia, and some of them have even spent some time in the intensive care unit, so measles can be very serious.",
