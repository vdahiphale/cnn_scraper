We'll have the latest on what the Biden administration is doing and not doing to help civilians escape after U.S. diplomats were evacuated.Also tonight, a major shakeup over at Fox News. The Primetime Host Tucker Carlson is out. Stand by for new details on the timing of his exit and the potential impact on Fox and the Republican Party. President Biden is finalizing his 2024 campaign plans on this, the eve of his expected announcement. Most Americans don't want him or Donald Trump, for that matter, to run again. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're following fast-moving developments in Sudan right now. The U.S. now says warring factions have agreed to a ceasefire that begins about an hour from now. This, as Americans and other civilians are looking for a way out of the country and away from the bloodshed. CNN's Sam Kiley is in nearby Djibouti for us, where U.S. Embassy staff were evacuated over the weekend. Sam, give us the latest on this unfolding and very, very potentially dangerous crisis.",

And of course, on top of that, longer term, if they, in 72 hours can hold, then perhaps there might just be some prospect for peace. But either way, it is the poor, really, that have been left behind starting with the Sudanis. But many others have not been lucky enough to be evacuated by this international air effort, and are having to go out over land. This is how it looked at the airport in Djibouti today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice-over): Relief for the few evacuated to safety. Misery for the many left behind. Multi-national rescue effort involving Special Forces from across the world is under way, with a focus on rescuing diplomats and their families from the horror of Sudan's new civil war. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: My first priority is the safety of our people. And I determined the deteriorating security conditions in Khartoum pose an unacceptable risk to keeping our team there at this time.

That would give an option for medical care, for instance, as well as an option to get out on the ships and transport them to another way. Again, the U.S. is saying, we heard from John Kirby there just a few moments ago that to try to conduct another evacuation, to try to bring in U.S. military aircraft, simply not possible. Perhaps -- perhaps, the ceasefire changes that over the next 72 hours, but of course, we already saw one 72-hour ceasefire fall apart over the weekend. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there were intensive efforts of -- over the course for the past two days, to get to a point where they could announce another ceasefire.

She has tapes, Wolf, that show what Fox News was communicating about two Trump allies, about whether or not the allegations they are making about voter fraud with Dominion Systems were actually were actually true. That could be incriminating to Fox.There's also a bunch of things that was filed in the Delaware Court in pre-trial discovery that was redacted. It might not always be redacted, Wolf. And so, I think if you're Fox executives, you're looking at a potential of windfall of information that could come out, that's incriminating to the network.

Gerry, thanks so much very for joining us. First of all, do you believe this shocking announcement that Fox and Tucker Carlson have parted ways, is connected to your client's lawsuits against the network? PARISIS \"GERRY\" FILIPPATOS, ATTORNEY FOR ABBY GROSSBERG: Well, I've said a few times that I really have given up on reading Fox's mind. But I will say that timing is significant in -- in my business in -- in proving discrimination cases. We often prove cases circumstantially. And I do know that although we had rather preliminary and attenuated discussions from last week, over the weekend, to see whether we could resolve our dispute with Fox, I do know that about 10 minutes after Fox essentially stiff-armed us and said they didn't want to have any further discussions. So, we heard the news that Mr. Carlson was fired. And Mr. Carlson does play prominently in our lawsuit in the southern district of New York where we allege a very toxic and frankly disgusting work environment that included all sorts of misogynistic and anti-Semitic comments. And we have allegations in our lawsuit that we are confident ultimately will be proven through discovery and trial that Mr. Carlson was well- aware of the toxic environment that was being nurtured under his stead. In fact, one of the officials, the senior editors in Tucker's group, Mr. Fox, said to Abby when she complained about this misogynistic and sexist and anti-Semitic environment, that well, we're just following Tucker's lead.

There's no way that case gets dismissed.We have a mountain of evidence to demonstrate Ms. Grossberg's claims against Fox with respect to conspiracy, false light, defamation. But in any event, to answer your question, there's a great relationship between those two suits, Smartmatic's and Ms. Grossberg's defamation suit. [17:20:00] First of all, they both sounded defamation, secondly, a lot of the -- a lot of the connective tissue between the allegations in dominion and in Smartmatic reside with Ms. Grossberg's civil conspiracy claims. She is pretty much at the center of the puzzle and -- and connects those two cases quite nicely.

So, that would be specifically July 11th to September 1st. So, we know this because the Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis did write a letter to the sheriff of Fulton County today, writing, \"I am providing this letter to bring to your attention, the need to heightened security and preparedness in coming months due to this pending announcement of possible charging decisions.\" And then she writes, \"Open source intelligence has indicated the announcement of decisions in this case may provoke a significant public reaction.\" She then goes on to write about how public expressions of opinion have resulted in violence in the past. She's not specific about that, but if we are looking at this case, we know Donald Trump has been investigated here. We know there's the possibility that the grand jury under seal recommended charges to be brought by this prosecutor. And we do know that both in New York, there was quite a significant security ramping up, that there had to be security in place because Trump was -- was calling for protests at the time. And we also know that this case in particular, what's being investigated here, is the same stuff, Wolf, that resulted in protests in Washington, D.C. that led to that Capitol insurrection in January of 2021.

One, White House officials and the President's close advisers did not feel urgency to jump into the race, all of the dynamics they saw from the lack of challengers from -- on the Democratic side to the Republican wars that were breaking out intraparty gave them confidence that they could wait. The other was that those who might know about a timeline weren't actually talking about that timeline. That has started to shift over the course of the last 10 days.The President has shot a video announcing his reelection campaign, they have started to move forward on major staff hires likely at this point that Julie Rodriguez, one of the President's senior advisors here at the White House will help the campaign as campaign manager. We are told at this point in time and all signs pointing to the plans underway for that announcement tomorrow. Now, it would not be some major launch -- some major rally, it would be a pretty low key video announcement campaign style with a fundraising request as well. That kind of underscores that much of what you're going to see, Wolf, from the President over the course of the coming months is not going to be that different from what you've seen the last several months, the message will be very similar, the contrast with Republicans will be critical, the travel will be mostly tied to his legislative accomplishments of the first two years. However, it is clear that the movement towards this relaunch underscores the scale of the undertaking that's ahead. And that's something that White House officials are keenly aware of, knowing quite well that despite those legislative accomplishments, the President has a lot of work to do when it comes to polling, has a lot of work to do even when it comes to the Democratic coalition, has a lot to do -- work to do to prove to people that he is ready for a second term fully capable of a second term. That's all part of the planning heading into this moment. The President will be the one who ultimately decides whether or not tomorrow is the day. But it's worth noting, tomorrow would be the four-year anniversary to the day of his 2020 campaign announcement. As for the President himself, several times today, Wolf, he was asked if tomorrow is going to be the day, he said he let reporters know really soon, Wolf.",

Independent voters are the people who have to look at you and say, OK, we're going to vote for you so important in a presidential race.These are both older man, and there's nothing they can do about that. Joe Biden can tell people, you know, look at what I've done for you, look at what I've done for the country, we're in a better place than we were during COVID, et cetera, et cetera, I've united the world on Ukraine.

And sources say that they expect that vote to happen as soon as Wednesday. Now if the timing slips beyond Wednesday, that could mean that Kevin McCarthy has a problem, but at the moment, they believe that they are able to mollify some of the concerns within their conference.But Kevin McCarthy has very little margin for error. And of the 222 Republican members, he can only afford to lose four votes because all Democrats are expected to vote against this package, which raise the national debt limit till next year and also include a slew of spending cuts, something that the White House and Democrats largely oppose and say that they will not support. But Kevin McCarthy has made clear that the effort to work the phones behind the scenes he believes will be enough to win over his conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: We will hold a vote this week and we will pass in we will send it to the Senate. He needs to show leadership and come to the negotiating table instead of put us in default. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Instead, the White House has held a diametrically opposite opinion as McCarthy. They want McCarthy to move on legislation to raise the national debt limit without any conditions, without any spending cuts whatsoever.That is a position also voiced by Senate Democrats. The Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told me just days ago he would not change his position, even if the House was able to muster enough votes to get a Republican only bill through their chamber. Schumer telling me that any bill must be, quote, \"clean,\" meaning no conditions, no spending cuts and simply raise the national debt limit, something McCarthy says simply will not happen. So, Wolf, even as the Republicans are pushing forward and appear likely to get the votes through -- get this through their chamber. What happens next is anyone's guess as a country could be staring at the first ever debt default as early as June if the two sides don't reach a deal, if a bill does not get to the President's desk, something that could have damaging economic consequences, not just here in the United States, but around the world.",
