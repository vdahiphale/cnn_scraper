      "sentences": "That is exactly right. And, of course, the least transparent branch of government doesn't tell us which opinions are coming down, but we widely expect that they may be issuing their ruling in the ballot eligibility case because, as you noted, tomorrows is Super Tuesday, so voters in over a dozen states will head to vote in their primaries. And the parties on both sides of this case had urged the Supreme Court to issue their decision before Super Tuesday so that voters would know if the person that they're voting for in the primary is or is not going to appear on the general election ballot.Now, it was just about a month ago that we were here for oral arguments in this case where the state of Colorado argued to the justices that that state has the authority to remove former President Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment's so-called insurrectionist ban. Now, I'll remind you that even the courts within the state of Colorado were split on this, but the Colorado Supreme Court, it did opt to remove Trump, arguing that he actually engaged in an insurrection based on his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. But the justices, during oral arguments, justices on both sides of the aisle, they appeared skeptical of that argument. And after the oral arguments, it really appeared that the Trump team did very well, not only because the former president had a very experienced and well- prepared attorney, but also because the justices did not appear willing to accept Colorado's arguments. And what happens in this case, whatever they decide, we expect will apply to all the other states as well, because several other states have attempted the same thing. This longshot, legal theory to try to remove Trump from the ballot. Only Illinois and Maine have opted to remove him. But even in other states, where they didn't go that far, they left the door open to possibly trying this again. That's why this ruling is so critical, not only for Colorado, but for the entire country. And what we're watching for is not only what did they decide, but how did they decided it. And this appeared to be an opportunity where you could get broad, bipartisan consensus. And there was a challenge for Chief Justice John Roberts to build a consensus, even if he could only get a narrow opinion, if he can get something with broad bipartisan support, even something that's 9-0, that would be significant for the court. That is increasingly under scrutiny, not only for concerns about ethics, but also for partisanship. And I'll remind you, John, we'll be back here in a little over a month-and-a-half for another Trump related case that could impact the election on possible presidential immunity to shield him from the federal election subversion case.",

People have already voted in Colorado under a cloud of not knowing whether one of the candidates they voted for is a legitimate candidate for the presidency or not.

Is it, you know, a non-partisan elected panel in a state? Is it a state legislature. And I think it would leave more confusion than anything else.And again, I think the courts goal here is clearing up any of that ambiguity. But it really is an open question. And, frankly, one of the things that came up at oral argument was the question of even who does this apply to? Does it apply to quote/unquote officers of the United States? And is the president of the United States one? Now, as a matter of common sense, it seems like the president's an officer. The language of the Constitution isn't entirely clear on that.

Unlike the Democratic side, where it's mostly proportional, on the Republican side it's either winner-take-all in the case of California, or winner take most in the case of Texas.
