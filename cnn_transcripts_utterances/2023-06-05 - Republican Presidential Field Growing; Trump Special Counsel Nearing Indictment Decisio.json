This is video from just moments ago showing Trump's attorneys as they left the building after an extensive face- to-face with DOJ officials. You may recall Trump's lawyers recently requested to meet with the attorney general, Merrick Garland, accusing the DOJ of prosecutorial misconduct. Today's meeting could signal that the special counsel's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents and possible obstruction is nearing its final stages. CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now. Jessica, we were not inside the room there, but, based on what we know, do we know what took place between Trump's lawyers and the DOJ?",

So there is some question here as to exactly why Trump's team met with DOJ. They had, of course, asked for that meeting to discuss what they allege is prosecutorial misconduct. But it's also possible that Trump's lawyers were called in because special counsel Jack Smith's investigation is in these final stages that we have been reporting. And, interestingly, to that end, our team has also learned that the grand jury is expected to hear testimony this week from another witness in the classified documents probe. They will be hearing that testimony at the federal courthouse. Notably, this is the first time in a month that this grand jury has met. The last time was May 5. So the questions are, will they just hear from a witness or could they potentially be voting on any indictment? We know, Jim, that Trump's lawyers have really been pushing back hard throughout this process. Trump posted the letter on his TRUTH Social page that his legal team sent to DOJ late last month. And it said this, in part: \"No president of the United States has ever in the history of our country been baselessly investigate in the such an outrageous and unlawful fashion.\" That was last month. We know that Trump also posted a similar sentiment on his TRUTH Social page earlier today. But, Jim, it is very clear here that the special counsel's probe is nearing an end. And when that happens, we will see if Trump will face any charges related to his handling of classified documents or, of course, his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, because Jack Smith's probe is on both fronts -- Jim.",

We know that they went before a federal judge and proved to a federal judge that there was probable cause to believe there was evidence of a crime in Mar-a-Lago. Then they executed that search warrant, found the evidence.

But it's always a bit of a long shot. And on the other side of the table, you usually get a very chilly reception. DOJ says very little. They never show their cards.

Now, just before the crash, fighter jets intercepted the plane in the airspace over the nation's capital. The plane actually took off headed from East Tennessee to Long Island, New York, but, instead of landing there, it turned around and it flew into Washington, D.C.'s restricted airspace. So U.S. Capitol Police put the complex on elevated alert. Fighter jets were scrambled and authorized to go to supersonic speeds, causing a sonic boom over the region. Security cameras and home videos captured that moment. Watch this. Officials say they tried to make contact, but the pilot was unresponsive. The fighter jet pilots apparently set off flares, trying to get the pilot's attention. But it didn't work and the plane crashed. We want to take you live now near the crash site in Staunton, Virginia, with CNN's Brian Todd.

That may be a coincidence here. We're not totally sure yet. To command the descent, if the airplane was on autopilot, and the crew was unresponsive, there must have had to be some sort of human interaction to try and get the airplane to come down. But if the airplane remained on autopilot, that is a big sign. And it points to something here where it could have been a rapid decompression of the pressurized aircraft cabin, meaning that the pressurization inside, the breathable air inside, lets out, and then the thin air outside is what is inside the airplane.

CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH):  We have taken the last six months to really kind of look at things, where everything is, and I have made the decision not to run for president on the Republican ticket in 2024. Obviously, a lot goes into that decision, but it's been quite an adventure, but not the end of the adventure, by any means. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's likely to endorse someone, and he said campaign vigorously for them.We know he is no fan of Donald Trump. He does not want to see Donald Trump as the nominee. And so he's going to find a way to make that the cause of this campaign season for him, not as a candidate. I will say it also makes the New Hampshire primary a little more interesting. When you take out a hometown guy, the governor of the state, it may invite more candidates in to compete there seriously, even though it was such a strong proving ground for Donald Trump when he initially sought the nomination back in 2016.",

Bush back in 2000, his initial presidential campaign, when he went to the NAACP, and part of his compassionate conservative message was to take on what he called the soft bigotry of low expectations, right to the NAACP. So this is a conservative mind-set through line. So that is a message Tim Scott has been espousing for his time in public life, and wanted to stick to that. There's also the political tactic here, right, going into the lion's den, showing you're willing to go to a not-friendly territory. And they were just critiquing him recently. He's been fund-raising off of that. He will now be able to fund-raise off of this appearance, show supporters or potential supporters he's willing to take his argument anywhere.",
