      "sentences": "Hi, there, Becky. And it's certainly a lot of the details of all this still remainquite murky. But we are discerning though, especially from Syrian state media that reported about this earlier today and also yesterday as well. Apparently there were a bunch of airstrikes that took place which the Syrians blame on the Israelis. This happened early Monday morning at around 12:20 am local time in the Aleppo province of Syria. So not the town of Aleppo but the area around that. Of course, we know from the Syrian civil war, for instance, that Aleppo does have a lot of military bases around it, a lot of military installations but also a lot of industrial sites that, in the past, have been used by various militias and other forces that were fighting on the side of Bashar al-Assad. The IRGC being one of them as well. So now what Iranian semi state media is saying is they say that one of the people that was killed in these various strikes that took place was apparently an advisor of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran. There are some photos that have already popped up of this individual but also of a funeral, claiming to be his funeral. But its unclear whether or not that funeral actually happened in Syria or whether or not it happened inside of Iran. Nevertheless, of course, this could be a moment of extreme tension between Iran and Israel. Of course, as you mentioned, we did have the bombing of that embassy compound of the Iranians in Damascus that happened on April 1st, killing several top Revolutionary Guard commanders. The Iranians, of course, blame that on Israel. Israel never claiming responsibilities but then there was that -- a counter strike by the Iranians using drones and ballistic missiles to hit Israeli territory. And that strike originating from Iranian territory for the first time. And now, of course, the big thing about this possible new strike is the fact that the Iranians had said that their complete strategic doctrine had changed after those strikes on their embassy compound. And that going forward, if there was an attack by Israel on Iranian territory or Iranian assets in the region, that they would strike back from Iranian territory again. So we'd have to wait and see what happens next. Right now, the Israelis have not claimed responsibility for this yet.",

There would be a considerable amount of negotiation that would have to happen in order for all of those phases to happen in sequence. And not all of the details have been figured out. So they're trying to essentially give credence to the fact that you can interpret what is on the table in different ways. They're also trying to shrink what appears to be this very clear public daylight between what the U.S. is saying about this phase deal and what Israel is saying about this phase deal, because we heard yesterday from John Kirby at the National Security Council that the U.S. fundamentally agrees with Netanyahu, with Israel. That Hamas should not be able to have the capacity to carry out another October 7th but that is not actually what Netanyahu is saying. Netanyahu is saying that Hamas needs to be completely eliminated, not just prevented, stunted from carrying out another October 7th. So there are fundamental disagreements in the public space. However, the United States is also saying that they are completely confident -- those are the words of the spokesperson here at the State Department yesterday -- that Israel would accept the deal if Hamas accepts the deal. So they're saying, yes, there's some confusion here about the details of what this deal would actually look like. But fundamentally, they are saying that they believe that Israel would accept it if Hamas accepts it, effectively putting Netanyahu and the Israeli government in a box here because they are saying that it was an Israeli proposal. And there's no reason that they wouldn't accept it. So we're just really waiting to see what happens next because obviously the ball is in Hamas' court. If they accept this deal outright, which the likelihood of that is probably low. We'll have to see what Israel does next. But the U.S. is putting a lot of pressure on Israel to say yes to this deal. While Netanyahu is trying to deflect a bit from what the specifics that were put on the table.",

And to move Gaza into a day after next phase, for the Palestinians who have survived this war. Part of the sort of calculus for many people has been about whether Benjamin Netanyahu himself can survive this pressure.

So that's going to raise some new questions for him about just the potential stability of his future government. One of the issues that he appears to have run into is an economic one. Yes. India is now the world's fifth largest economy. It is enjoying growth rates that I think many other -- would be the envy of many other countries. But there are some big problems on the balance sheet -- youth unemployment, for example. People between the ages of 20-24 have almost 45 percent unemployment. That is not a small thing and that is going to be a major problem going forward and could have been one of the challenges that Modi faced in a triumphalist message. About India leading, the world going forward into this century when people are still having a hard time and they're battling inflation and unemployment at home. Something might not have been added, might not have added up there. And then again, there're those questions about democratic freedoms, which, at times Modi and his supporters had to be on the defense about. The question of why some of his opposition rivals were getting arrested before the election or being investigated for alleged attacks, crimes. These are all kind of questions that may have come in and made challenges for him. And just a final thought, that the fact that this was unexpected - - just look at the Indian stock market, Becky. It plunged today after record highs on Monday. It plunged, dropping nearly 6 percent when it appeared that that initial exit polls were not going to prove true. And that Modi's margin of victory would not be as huge as what he has enjoyed in the past two national elections. Becky.",

One, he's saying, when the House Republicans want to hold him in contempt, they want to hold them in contempt right now because he refuses to turn over an audio recording of Joe Biden sitting for an interview with special counsel Robert Hur, in an investigation of Biden's handling of classified documents. Garland is saying, I will not back down. You are not getting the audiotape and one of the things he said is he says there is certain members of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee -- meaning Republicans -- are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining, for no legitimate purpose, sensitive law enforcement information. And Garland wants to protect that law enforcement information as well as future investigations and witnesses. In addition to that, on the offensive, Garland is saying he will not be intimidated. And he's calling out Republicans for a lot of other things that they are doing to put the Justice Department under attack right now. He is saying that I see that you want to defend offices within the Justice Department, including special counsel office work. Not only was there about her investigation, the Office of Special Counsel, Jack Smith has brought in two federal criminal cases and is continuing to pursue them against Donald Trump, trying to take the former president to trial. And then Garland, also, is quite unhappy about misleading information that Donald Trump has been spreading. And the Republicans have been fueling ideas that the Justice Department was behind that conviction of Trump in New York in a state case, a totally separate proceeding government court. All of it, the Justice Department wasn't behind that conviction and Garland is quite unhappy about misleading and false statements that Trump has made regarding how the FBI conducted its search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022. So all of those things are part of this that Garland is speaking about right now and we're going to have to see where this hearing goes from here. Going to be quite combative.",

So live streamers will often offer a shout out in their live video or some other incentive to get people to send them those monetary gifts. But this lawsuit claims that those incentives, this incentive structure where people are performing in real time for money could lead to the exploitation of children. It claims that adults can encourage children to perform illicit acts on camera in exchange for those cash payments. The lawsuit also claims that TikTok has known about this for some time. And it alleges that TikTok intentionally designed those animated gift tokens to be like cute, colorful emojis. It says clearly aimed at children. Now TikTok has pushed back against these claims. A spokesperson told me yesterday that the platform has industry- leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. He said that creators must be at least 18 years old in order to use that Lives feature.

We canno longer have a government where the prime minister and a handful of close aides essentially dictate policy from up on high. Because if they move in that direction, their coalition partners will exit and they have the power and the authority, if trends continue, to actually topple this government. So I think that's the first big shift. Now, a lot of investors I think view this, with some trepidation but they really shouldn't. India has experienced the fastest growth rates it's ever had as an independent country when it's been under coalition government. In 1991, when India opened up its economy to market forces, that was by a coalition government. And really from 1991 until the day Modi took power in May 2014, you've had coalition governments and that's coincided with some of the economic boom years in India. It is going to be a messier process. It might be a more incremental process in terms of reform. But this is not going to lead to a wholesale reversal in India's outlook.

If approved MDMA therapy would be the first potential new treatment for PTSD in 25 years but the data on the proposed therapy is already facing tough scrutiny. Our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins, us now. So what are we learning at this point? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, its interesting. There's been a lot of enthusiasm around the possible use of psychedelics as medicines. And this particular FDA advisory meeting is going to get a lot of attention because if this carries forth, Becky, I think its going to maybe usher in a lot of psychedelic medicines in the future. But if it stalls as you sort of alluded to, there, that could be quite problematic going forward as well. So what's at issue here is post- traumatic stress, as you mentioned, an unmet need; really hasn't been any therapies in a quarter century. This is a couple of phase III clinical trials by the company called Lykos pharmaceuticals (sic). Not huge trials but let me show you what they found here specifically. As you look at some of this data, keep in mind, these were people who got MDMA, which is methylenedioxy?methamphetamine, and talk therapy versus a placebo and talk therapy. And what you found there was that the overall reduction in symptoms for those who received MDMA, close to 87 percent compared to placebo, again, with talk therapy around 69 percent. And to take it a step further, when we looked at this data, we found that people, they were asked have your symptoms completely gone away? Have you essentially been treated for your post-traumatic stress? And what they found there was in the MDMA group, 71 percent of people said yes, symptoms completely gone, versus in the placebo group, 48 percent. So that's what's got people's attention. Again. Just wanted to make that point, that both groups got talk therapy and that's I think why the placebo group was so high. Becky, again, a lot of enthusiasm around this. MDMA is thought of as a psychedelic. It's probably better described as what's known as an empathogen, a drug that can actually induce empathy. And the idea that you could treat post-traumatic stress without also conjuring up lots of anxiety, that may be why they think it works so well.
