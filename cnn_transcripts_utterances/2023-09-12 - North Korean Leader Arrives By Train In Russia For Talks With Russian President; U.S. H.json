The North Korean leader has arrived by train in Russia ahead of talks with the Russian president. In these state media pictures, you can see Kim Jong-un meeting with the governor of the Primorsky region in Russia's Far East, as well as Russia's minister of natural resources. The 39-year-old North Korean leader traveling on his heavily-armored train received a military welcome as he arrived at the Hassan train station. Precisely when and where he will meet Vladimir Putin remains unclear. But here's why the West is worried. Analysts say Mr. Putin could provide technology to Pyongyang in exchange for weapons he could use in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman would only say that the meetings will touch on bilateral relations and what he called sensitive areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator): Like with any neighbor, we consider ourselves obligated to establish good, mutually beneficial relations. We will continue to strengthen our friendship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the narrative coming from the United States and its allies is precisely that, that when two pariah states, is how they describe them, join forces or have a meeting, it must mean, A, they're highly isolated from the rest of the world, and in Russia's case, which is, you know, a form of superpower, a massive power, to reach, to be seen to be reaching such a hermit kingdom that is so heavily cemented in the past as North Korea, is being viewed and being described as an act of Putin's desperation. As the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, told me when this visit was first mooted even last week, days ago, he said that if Russia, Vladimir Putin, wants to continue his quote, \"imperialist quest to restore the empire\", well, then, it's kind of, you know, desperate and pathetic to be relying hat in hand, you know, the tin cup towards North Korea, which itself is so isolated and has so little of the kind of modern technology that any NATO nation or even Russia would require. That is how they're seeing it right now. Nonetheless, it would be a violation of sanctions and nobody wants to see this military alliance strengthened in any way at all.",

U.S.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calling on his committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Biden. He made the announcement just moments ago. Right-wing members of his party have been pushing for him to move ahead with the inquiry for months, claiming Mr. Biden benefited from his son, Hunter Biden's business deals. But thus far, Republicans have not produced any evidence to prove that allegation. The White House has just reacted to that move, calling it an extreme politics at its worst. CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox is tracking this story and joins us now. Lauren, this is a quite incredible. If convicted, Biden would indeed become the fourth president in U.S. history to be impeached. What is this over and what are the next steps?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean at this point, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's announcement today makes it clear that he isasking the committees to open this impeachment inquiry. The committees that are going to be leading this charge are the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee. Largely, those committees have been leading these investigations into Hunter Biden and the president for the last several months. They're going to continue doing that work and now ramping it up. But it's also interesting, because in an apparent reversal, Speaker McCarthy announced the opening of this inquiry today. But there isn't going to be, at this point, a vote in the House of Representatives. And there is a good reason for that. Largely, he doesn't have the votes at this point to open that inquiry. There are many Republicans who hail from swing districts and others who have other concerns about opening an impeachment inquiry, arguing that the evidence is not there at this point. That's why you saw Speaker McCarthy make this announcement today and didn't talk about having a vote on the floor of the House. Now, it's always possible, as was the case in 2019 when Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into then-president Donald Trump that the vote could come later. That's what happened in the case of Democrats back in 2019. But it is an important moment, because McCarthy had signaled prior to this that he was going to have a vote in the House of Representatives. We should also note that lawmakers are staring down a very serious spending deadline at the end of the month. And there is no plan at this point to avert a government shutdown. So, the question is, can they do both? Can they continue with this impeachment inquiry while also finding a way forward on government funding. There are some who had already been pressuring McCarthy to move forward with this impeachment inquiry, arguing it would be contingent on their support for a short-term government funding bill. So, you can see that despite the fact that these are two very separate issues, in the minds of leadership, there are some reasons to move forward with both of them at the same time.",

      "sentences": "Well, what we understand, Lynda, is that there were two dams in the Wadi, or the normallydry riverbed, that goes through Derna to the Mediterranean. Those dams, according to one scientific study, needed to be maintained, but because Libya was convulsed in 2011 by the uprising against Mamar Qaddafi, then that followed by that wars between the East and the West, perhaps the infrastructure wasn't being very-well maintained. Now, this storm, Storm Daniel, dumped the equivalent of eight months of rain in this area of eastern Libya in just one day. So, we've seen video that would appear that those dams burst, sending a tsunami of muddy water right through the middle of this city. Now, we've heard from one doctor from Benghazi who made it to Derna. And keep in mind that the roads are very, are almost impassable, because many of them were washed out by the flooding. Nonetheless, this doctor made it. And he said that the hospitals there are barely functioning, that the emergency services aren't working, and that people, ordinary people, are out scavenging, or, rather, looking for and collecting rotting bodies. In fact, we have seen a video from outside the morgue which is reportedly full to capacity. Outside it are dozens of bodies covered in blankets. And it appears that the authorities really are struggling to try to get a grip on the situation. They simply don't seem, they weren't prepared for a catastrophe of this magnitude. And in fact, just within the last hour or so, on the Facebook page of the municipality of Derna, they've put out a message saying, the situation in the city is out of control. We need international intervention. Now, there is help on the way. The Turks, according to Turkish President Rajab Tayyip Erdogan, have sent three planes, including well-over 100 search and rescue personnel, as well as equipment. The rival government based in Tripoli in the West has sent a plane load of emergency workers or medical personnel, as well. But it appears that the magnitude of this disaster is going to require a lot more than that at the moment. Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think Ben really described it best, Lynda, when he talked about this tsunami of water that was literallygoing through Derna as the two dams collapsed. Ultimately, too much water for the infrastructure to hold, and it is all because of Storm Daniel. What you kind of see on this rate, this is actually a satellite loop taken over a seven-day period. Remember, this is the same storm system that brought the heavy flooding rains to central and eastern Greece. And then it started to drift further and further south. It took advantage of the very warm above average temperatures of the Mediterranean. It actually got tropical characteristics. So, we call this a medicane, like a hurricane in the Mediterranean. And then ultimately walloped to the northeastern sections of Libya. And this is where this catastrophic amount of rain fell in a dry area that is typically dry this time of year. We'll show you the climatological averages. But El Bayat is actually just to the west of Derna where the dams collapsed. And this is important because there's a river basin that goes between this area and that received 414 millimeters of rain in just one day. So, why in the world do we still see these heavy rain events occurring across the planet from China to Europe to places like North Africa and in the United States? Well remember, we have warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial averages. What that in-turn has done is allowed our atmosphere to hold more water vapor. More water vapor brings the potential for more extreme rain events. Now, in terms of northern Libya, North Africa, we're typically in our dry season, so getting a medicane, moving off of the Mediterranean this time of the year is out of the ordinary. We don't normally see the rain this time of year. And so to get that amount of precipitation in such a short period of time, unfortunately, Lynda, it led to the scenes that we are witnessing on our TV screens today.",

The former head of Spain's football federation, Luis Rubiales, has been summoned to testify in a Spanish court this Friday. It's part of the investigation into his unwanted kiss on Jenny Hermoso at the Women's World Cup final. It comes after Spain's national court admitted a complaint by Spanish prosecutors against Rubiales for the crimes of sexual assault and coercion on Monday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is in Beijing to meet with Xi Jinping. Mr. Maduro arrived in China late last week and toured the city of Shenzhen, China's tech hub. This is the fifth time President Maduro's visit has visited China as president. A step forward in the efforts to free Americans detained by Iran, including these three men under house arrest.

The court is being asked to weigh in on its own power to decide whether a law that limits the Supreme Court's authority over the government should be allowed to stand.

It'sbeen called the biggest antitrust case in the tech industry in decades. Prosecutors say Google abuses its dominance of internet search traffic because it made exclusive deals with other companies that effectively made it impossible for rival search engines to compete. The case is expected to take about 10 weeks to complete with more than a hundred witnesses testifying. Our Anna Stewart is watching this story for us and joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Anna. So, there have been comparisons to the Microsoft trial of 1998. The tech giant also accused of using its market power to squeeze out competition. What are the similarities and differences? What's this case about?",

Now,the U.S. government wanted to see Microsoft broken up. That decision was overturned in court and instead what you saw was Microsoft was essentially restricted in how it could use its operating system to ensure that there was a level playing field. We could see if Google loses something similar here. There are plenty of remedies in its toolbox. I mean, they could see a massive fine. I don't think they go that way. The government could push to break up Google or it could try and restrict how Google promotes its search engine, given that it's causing all the problems in this case. But we'll have to see. There'll be plenty of star witness testimony, so, it will be a really interesting trial to watch over the coming weeks.",
