I'm Paula Newton, ahead right here on CNN Newsroom.Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un wrap up talks in eastern Russia, what the two are expected to discuss. Plus, the presumed death toll from the catastrophic flooding in Libya has more than doubled and as many as 10,000 are still missing. And the U.S. takes a key step in a deal to free five Americans being detained in Iran. What critics are saying about that agreement? And we go straight to our breaking news. Kim Jong-un is heaping praise on Russia's Vladimir Putin as the two sit down for their first face- to-face talks in more than four years. The meeting in Russia's Far East follows days of warnings from the United States about these two leaders possibly sealing a deal on weapons. But they're not talking about that publicly, at least not yet anyway. Instead, the Russian president spoke of cooperation on humanitarian and economic issues. And an availed swipe at the United States and the West, Kim Jong-un applauded President Putin for standing up to, quote, \"hegemonic forces to defend its security.\" The North Korean leader also pledged his full and unconditional support to all that Russia does in response. Now, earlier, they toured a space launch site, the Vostochny Cosmodrome, and inspected all sorts of spacecraft there. And for the first time, North Korea, this is significant now, fired off two missiles, while Kim Jong-un was outside of the country. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout has been following all these developments for us and she is with us now from Hong Kong, truly a significant meeting already. We believe there's more to come, including they're going to sit down for a meal. But what are we learning so far about the extent that these two leaders are willing to go to forge possibly a new, closer relationship?",

Kristie Lu Stout, I know you're going to continue to watch all of it for us live from Hong Kong. I Appreciate it.Edward Howell is a North Korea expert and lecturer in politics at Oxford University, and he joins me now from London. Good to have you on the program. You know, you've been saying for months now that a new and closer relationship between two countries could be a menacing development. Now, I'm sure you don't want to be alarmist and neither does anyone else, but what are the real risks here if these two leaders become very close?",

So firstly, we have the transaction element of this relationship, where Kim Jong-un is in need of food and, crucially, financial assistance in a declining North Korean economy, but also more advanced and sophisticated technology, and particularly in terms of satellite technology. And North Korea's satellites in recent months have failed quite spectacular fashion.And for Putin, we know that he needs munitions and he needs artillery shells to continue his plight in Ukraine. Now, even though North Korean artillery shells are not, are seen not to be the best in terms of the accuracy and precision. The broader ramifications of this meeting are that it will firstly make the U.N. Security Council and put the U.N. Security Council in a very difficult position with respect to trying to address North Korea's nuclear threat. Already after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russia has been taking North Korea's side. But if a possible arms deal does emerge questions of sanctions violations on the part of Russia also involved.",

I think we must also not forget that these summits, much like past summits involving Kim Jong-un, they don't just target international audiences. This is obviously sending a very clear message to the West and international audiences, but they also target domestic audiences.The same is true for North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, which have a very strong domestic component reaching out to the North Korean population.",

They certainly have not been seeing to encourage North Korea in its nuclear exploits, seeing them as not a rational actor. Do you think tacitly they would send any kind of message to Russia to be careful? HOWELLthis meeting, and we know that Chinese and Russian officials will meet in the days to come. China's ultimate aim is stability on the Korean Peninsula. China seems willing to provide financial assistance to North Korea if that means that the nuclear, North Korea that we have, status quo continues. We've seen in China's relations with Russia, but China also wants to be seen as a mediator in this. China, Xi Jinping in particular, urging for a peaceful resolution, not only of the issues on the Korean Peninsula, but also of Russia's war in Ukraine. China's role is key, though, for broader regional security, particularly after claims by Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Defense Minister, that Russian, Chinese and North Korean trilateral military drills could take place.

But House Republicans have so far not provided evidence that Biden directly profited off his son's business deals or made any decisions as vice president because of them. REP. GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): There is zero evidence of any malfeasance on the part of President Joe Biden. ZANONA (voice-over): The effort has faced resistance from some in the GOP over the lack of evidence. REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): What I wanted to do was look at the evidence and I said I'll go where the evidence takes me. I'm reluctant to agree with Speaker McCarthy. ZANONA (voice-over): McCarthy has been facing pressure from the right and former President Donald Trump to move ahead. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Moments ago, Speaker McCarthy endorsed an impeachment inquiry. This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more. We must move faster. ZANONA (voice-over): A trio of House committees leading the way. The Speaker has not put a timeline on the process, though McCarthy ally Marjorie Taylor Greene said there's no rush. REP.

According to a CNN poll, 61 percent of Americans believe Biden was involved in his son's business deals as vice president, while 42 percent think he acted illegally. But some GOP senators are uncertain about McCarthy's approach. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The way to make an inquiry legitimate is to have a vote as to whether or not you should have one at all rather than just the leadership deciding. ZANONA (voice-over): And Democrats not sweating the threat of impeachment. SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (R-PA): It's devastating. Don't do it. Please don't do it. ZANONA (on-camera): And House Republicans have already taken their first official step in this impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday afternoon, a trio of House committees sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland requesting all information and all documents about whether Hunter Biden's attorneys encourage IRS whistleblowers to be retaliated against by the Department of Justice. These IRS whistleblowers have claimed that the DOJ mishandled and politicized the criminal probe into Hunter Biden. But the DOJ has denied all wrongdoing. Melanie Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.

Look, when it comes to Libya, we are just seeing catastrophic, devastating, and frankly terrifying images. One can only imagine what people have been going through there in the last few days.In terms of international assistance and it's coming through very quickly, you have Turkey that has sent assistance, likes of Malta, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, is also sending a delegation of people to support. You have Algeria announcing that they're sending planes and personnel, Tunis as well on the ground. Most of these teams have arrived in Benghazi. They have to make their way to the hardest hit area, which is Derna, as you say, residential buildings being swept away. Frankly, these images look like they're just melting away into the sea. The human cost is enormous. Estimated numbers right now, very difficult to verify. Right now, we know 5,300 people have lost their lives. The scary part of that is that more than 10,000 people are still missing. Now, Derna in particular has a population of over 100,000 people. And when you see the level of catastrophe, there's a big worry that more people are trapped. And of course, that the search and rescue now continues. These hours are going to be very critical in terms of getting rescue teams on the ground in a place where roads are impossible, difficult to get through, there are blockages. You've had those two dams that burst, sending mudslides to the city, exacerbating the heavy rainfall that was around 414 millimeters in just one day. That is as much as rain that is received in an eight-month period. We know that the Libyan National Army that controls the eastern part of the country is saying the situation is out of control, calling for more international aid. The rival government in the west has sent aid, and they're also trying to coordinate more assistance, more generators, trying to get communications back up. A lot of effort coming through from different parts. The question is, can they get everyone coordinated to assist in this devastating situation that people are dealing with at this stage?",

PARSIthe big measures that President Obama took and that eventually led to the nuclear deal in 2015 took place in his second term when he felt more confident than when he was less vulnerable to political criticism because he was not going to run obviously for a third term. So I think this is also true on the Iranian side that because of the political cost of these matters, the type of creativity and political will needed to resolve many of these different issues simply have been lacking because it is extremely politically costly. Again, under other circumstances, if this was another country, the president would be praised right now for bringing Americans home, but instead he's facing criticism for having brought innocent Americans home from foreign prisons.
