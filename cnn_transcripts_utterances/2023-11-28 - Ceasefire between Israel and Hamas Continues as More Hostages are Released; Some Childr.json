There are several Americans who are still being held, but there are three that they believed would qualify for women and children and that would make it into those first four days of the hostage releases. So far that has not happened.And of course, now we are on day five of what was really supposed to be a four-day temporary truce. It has now been extended for two more days. It's clear why it was extended. Every side right now feels like they are benefiting from this. It's quiet in Gaza right now. There is a lot of aid going in. You are not seeing the IDF forces who are there move around much. They've maintained these truce lines, as they are referring to them. And obviously, Israel is getting its hostages back, and you are seeing that after emotional reunion and emotional reunion with all of these families who want to know whether or not their loved ones are going to be next. And I think one thing to keep in mind here is this is such a heartbreaking day-by-day basis for all of these families who they get a call from the Israel government each night once Hamas has handed over the list either telling them, yes, your loved one is on it, or no, they are not. And so they are kind of just sitting around waiting for the phone to ring. And so that is where we are on day five. I think a big question right now is what comes after day six. It's not clear on either side yet if it will get extended again, what this will ultimately look like, or who Hamas has left into captivity to produce that would fit under this category. What we are seeing, though, are a lot of emotional reunions between these two families, and one that is probably the most searing is Emily Hand and her father. CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward is here in Tel Aviv. And obviously, Clarissa, you spoke to him. No one will forget when he said he initially thought his daughter was killed.

And she is only just now rediscovering her voice.And there is a sense that it is going to be a very long journey ahead. And we asked about the events of October 7th. And of course, one of the biggest challenges for Tom as a dad had been basically telling Emily about what happened in kibbutz Be'eri where they were living and what happened to people in her own community, part of her family. Tom's first wife, Narkis, who was basically like a second mother to Emily, the mother of his two older children, she was killed on October 7th, and this is something that he had to break to Emily.

So there was a lot of movement from house to house. She was kept intact with this unit, the young girl who she had been spending the night with, having that sleepover with, Hila Rotem, and her mother, Raaya. Hila and Raaya were ultimately separated for reasons that we don't fully understand.But he said that Raaya really was like a mother to Emily as well as Hila during that time. And she and Hila became incredibly close. He describes how she used to stroke Hila's ear at night to help her fall asleep as a source of comfort. He also talked about the fact that she hasn't been physically harmed. She has a terrible case of head lice and there wasn't really enough food. She was having to dig up breakfast every day, but lunch and dinner not always. She learned to like to eat just plain olive oil and bread because sometimes that was all that they had. And beyond that, he is really just waiting for her to give more information, to give more details when she is able to talk about it, with the full realization that that might take quite some time.",

And Rick Santorum, yeah, rather Rick Santorum, who ultimately wound up winning. He won at 3 percent on Thanksgiving of 2011, and in 2015, Ben Carson was winning by ten points and Ted Cruz was at 7 percent, and he wound up winning. So, it's not that I distrust these particular polls, I just know that voters make their decisions very late in this business and they're willing to change. In fact, in a recent poll we did, three-quarters of Donald Trump's voters in New Hampshire said they are open to changing their minds between now and primary day on January 23. So, I know everybody wants to make this race over now, but it's not over, and it's not even close to over. And when you look, just look at the history, forget about predictions.

And look, Governor Haley's campaign is good at putting out process stories, like, even stories about someone meeting with someone. I don't put out stories about every person I meet with for two reasons. One, I don't know what the meeting is going to lead to, and two, I like to keep those things quiet. Those people tend to be more honest with you when they're quiet. And so, the process stories are wonderful, but in the end, what's going to matter is who are people voting for. And my concern about this abortion issue is real because you can't say one thing in Iowa and something different in New Hampshire. Now, I was on the stage next to Governor Haley when she gave a long talk at, I think was the second debate, about how we don't want to divide the country on this. We have to respect everyone's opinions, but then when she's sitting across from Bob Vander Plaats in Iowa, a much more conservative place, she says, I'd sign a six-week abortion ban. Well, which one is it? And I think we have to take her out of a word that she would sign a six- week abortion ban. And I don't think that represents that's us in this country.
