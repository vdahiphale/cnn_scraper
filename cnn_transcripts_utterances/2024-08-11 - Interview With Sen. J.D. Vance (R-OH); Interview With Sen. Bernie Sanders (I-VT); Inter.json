And I think that what's different about it -- and you're right, Dana, it is different. But what's different about it is that we're running against a different person who a lot of Americans just don't know. And so I think we have to remind people that President Trump delivered lower prices, lower inflation, a prosperous and peaceful world, and also a secure border, and Kamala Harris' policies have produced the exact opposite. Now, that was an easier case to make when Joe Biden was in there because people associate Joe Biden with the policies. But I think Kamala Harris clearly owns the policies of the Biden/Harris administration, especially when we consider the fact that, as we have all learned over the last few months, Joe Biden clearly isn't capable of doing the job. And so I think that drives home that Kamala Harris really has been the one calling the shots. I mean, how could she not? I think Joe Biden doesn't really know where he is.",

If you remember, for months, even years, the argument was that Joe Biden was sharp, he could clearly do the job. And the minute that he performed poorly in that debate and he became political dead weight, you have Kamala Harris and everybody else trying to throw him overboard. But I think the more troubling question is, why did so many senior Democrats, including the vice president, cover for him?

He said it to you, and he said it repeatedly, that his goal is not to block mifepristone.It's to let states make the decision on abortion policy. Now, of course, that does mean, Dana, we have to be honest about this, that California might have less restrictive rules than Ohio, which might have less restrictive rules than Alabama. I think what President Trump is really trying to do on the abortion question is really admirable. And I wish the press was a little bit more honest about it. He's saying, we've had a 50-year cultural war over abortion where, unfortunately, this issue has just divided the country. And he wants to provide some ground for us to come together, for states to make these decisions, for voters to make these decisions, and for us all to respect one another. That's all he's proposed.",

He seems incapable of talking about a vision for this country in terms of lifting people up or building people up or helping people out. It's always disparagement, disparaging a fellow veteran's military service. I'm pretty sure I caught in your interview him attacking Tim Walz for his -- how he greeted his own wife after speaking, and now not saying we have a disagreement about policy, some reason why his ideas are better than our ideas for taking care of kids, but, rather, if you disagree with him, if you disagree with J.D.

The Nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says many tipped workers make so little that they already don't have income taxes that they owe, and eliminating payroll taxes could reduce their Social Security and Medicare benefits. Do you believe that the Harris proposal actually would help low-income workers, Senator? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Well, Dana, it's an issue I really haven't studied, but this is what I do know. We live in a country with a terribly regressive tax policy. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the richest people are doing phenomenally well, billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than working people. And one of the things that we have got to do is create a tax system that is fair, that says to large, profitable corporations, some of whom pay almost nothing in federal taxes, you're going to start paying your fair share of taxes, and the same thing with the very wealthy in this country.

But I believe during the build back better period, when we tried to really make some fundamental changes in the way this country works, that's what we were talking about. And it's enormously popular, so many of our seniors having a hard time finding dental care or affording it. So many seniors today are just struggling on limited income. So, expanding Medicare is the right thing to do. And let's remember that, when we talk about health care, the United States today is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. And we do that, we have that situation despite spending twice as much per capita on health care as the people of other countries. We have got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. And the Biden/Harris administration has done a good job. They're going to announce, as I understand it, this week some significant breakthroughs in having Medicare negotiate prices with some of the -- with some of the largest drug companies in the world, lowering prices. That is a huge deal. But we have got to go further. We cannot continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. So, we're making progress. A lot more has to be done.
