They said they'd been on the phone all day fielding calls why was Kevin McCarthy not prepared for this question. You have to remember that Trump and his team believed that they got McCarthy the speakership, that they were the ones who convinced these outliers in the Republican Party to vote for McCarthy to turn the tide there. He even made calls on McCarthy's behalf. And for months, I have been asking advisers, why it is that McCarthy has not outwardly endorsed Trump in 2024. And they've really brushed that off saying that he has to please a lot of people if he's going to be running for speaker if he's going to actually be the speaker, (inaudible) of course, he was.

And it also goes to what the world is hearing, what people are forgetting is that really is the - it's still the - I think until like next week it's still the joint, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He is - was - is still in charge of our military branches, so to speak. His job is to advise whatever president and so we advise both Trump and now President Biden.

Now, the latest information we have, Jim is that three people so far, according to the president's office were killed among the dead, a child and 25 people wounded. Now, they're still looking for more people under the rubble.

Now, that will provide some sort of independent verification of the statements we heard from Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, earlier on today who said indeed that Yevgeny Prigozhin had landed in Belarus. I think we have to wait given the bizarre, opaque nature of the last three days around this particular armed rebellion for Prigozhin himself to admit that he's gone to Minsk.But what we heard from Lukashenko today essentially tallied with the statements we'd heard from the Kremlin and also from Prigozhin himself in a sprawling 11-minute audio message we heard yesterday. Lukashenko saying that he got in contact with Prigozhin and (inaudible) laden rant, essentially Prigozhin after multiple calls had agreed to turn his tanks around on the way to Moscow and go to Belarus where he's being offered safe haven. But the Lukashenko version of these events starkly in contrast to Vladimir Putin today, multiple meetings with soldiers, dignitaries, desperate, I think to refashion the narrative in his favor after a startling two and a half day silence, whatever you think about Putin's reluctance to put himself in the public eye during moments of crisis, startling misjudgment after surviving a coup attempt like that to suddenly disappear. But today, there he was standing in front of soldiers, part of the land forces, who essentially had done very little to prevent Wagner from marching up the M4 Highway from Rostov towards Moscow. But instead, Putin said thank you, you saved Russia. You saved us from civil war, baffling and I think many Russians will listen to that and think that perhaps the President has overstepped that sort of sidelining of reality that's so common in his rule. And later on, he went on to tell people that in fact, Wagner who got a billion dollars in the last year from the Russian state, so a lot of messaging now from Moscow and from Belarus. It appears to tally together. But ultimately, Prigozhin is now in Belarus, no longer facing prosecution and possibly with a safe haven there where he can regroup. We simply don't know of his fate. But this is yet to finish, Jim.",

And truly what the big army does at best is to hold territory and mostly right now it's going to have to try to hold territory against the Ukrainian offensive.  But as we know, with past Russian tactics, they will hit populatedareas, they will hit civilian areas to try to hit the population that is supporting the military. That seems to be their strategy overall. They don't care about civilian casualties.",

He also has until this weekend to find out how many of his own forces are going to stand with him, because of course, Putin gave them a deadline.

There's very little way to tell them apart or was it that typical Russian military thing of waiting for orders from hire, in this case to attack your own troops.
