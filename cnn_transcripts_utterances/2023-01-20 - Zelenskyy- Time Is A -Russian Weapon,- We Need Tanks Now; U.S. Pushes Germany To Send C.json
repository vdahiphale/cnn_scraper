And we've already seen Poland, which has been very vocal about this threatening just to ignore Germany and send them anyway.Now this isn't what Austin wanted to focus on. He kept his press conference and his remarks to everything else. The U.S. has sent the second largest Ukraine aid package $2.5 billion dollars strikers, Bradley's a series of other vehicles and a number of other countries making other some very large contributions to Ukraine's defense. The question however, largely prodded by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy kept coming back to tanks. In his remarks, Austin only thanked the U.K. for sending some of their challenger two tanks. But hanging over this was that question of would Germany shift its position? The German defense minister claimed there was no linkage between Germany waiting for the U.S. to send tanks, maybe that's a softening of the position, maybe they're getting closer.

But it's less, I think an urgency that Russia is going to sort of imminently overrun Ukraine and more of an opportunity, I think, for Ukrainians, to kind of take advantage of some sort of kind of a frozen moment on the battlefield before Russia is able to retrofit, before it's able to regroup.You know, certainly what we have seen from Russia over the last however many months is really been kind of a frozen conflict. They've been unable to make any major gains on the battlefield. They have, you know, they were forced to retreat from the west bank of the Dnieper. They've suffered enormous, enormous casualties. So, I think there's still quite a lot of questions actually about, even though the U.S. is expecting to see some kind of offensive from Russia in the spring. I think there's still an enormous number of questions right now about how Russia is actually going to be able to execute that, whether or not they actually have the capabilities to successfully retake a large amount of territory or sort of push forward the advances that they've already made, or whether they're just going to continue to kind of throw manpower at this frozen conflict without actually making any large-scale strategic gains. So, you have to think that that was a sort of key part of the conversation in between CIA Director Bill Burns and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which remember, this is the third time Burns has been to Kyiv in the last three months.",

Our photojournalist Darren Rode is going to take you to show you some of the depth of the crowd as they've been building toward the Washington Monument over here. Some people here have acknowledged that the crowd here is smaller than in years past because of the overturning of Roe. But they now say that the - this is kind of a pivotal moment in the anti-abortion movement. Several people I've talked to here say, what they've got to focus on now is taking the fight to the states. Many say they're determined to have these marches in all 50 states. They think this is going to be more of a grassroots movement. Now, John, they want to do more things like marching towards the legislatures, maybe even knocking on doors individually to get the message across. One woman said, she's focusing on the fact that so many abortion pills have been flooding the country since Roe vs. Wade was overturned.

So, in Wyoming, state Republicans there introduced a full ban complete with criminal penalties for doctors who perform abortions that includes medication abortion.In Nebraska, we've seen a six-week ban proposed plus on the first day of their legislative session earlier this month, Virginia Republicans introduced a 15 week ban and I'm told now that more is coming. I talked to a powerful pro-life lobbying group. They have drafted model legislation that completely bans abortions with criminal penalties. I'm told that was the template for Wyoming's bill, and that more Republican state lawmakers are centered introduced similar all-out bands in the coming weeks and really this avalanche of activity is happening because legislatures are now in the first full session. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June Plus, we've seen that states have become increasingly polarized. 22 states are now solidly controlled by Republicans. That means legislature, the governor's office, 15 states controlled by Democrats. So, at the same time, as we're seeing this huge Republican push to ban abortion, John. We're also seeing Democrats respond in ways where they're trying to protect abortion in their states, namely Michigan and Maryland. So, it's really this split screen battle.

There's a debate about whether that ban would be 12 weeks or 15 weeks. There's a debate about whether or not social services need to be bolstered, something that a lot of House Republicans and the age and returning age of cutting spending would be opposed to, but something that you hear activists talking about, maybe that's the direction.
