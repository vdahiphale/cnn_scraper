The Foreign Minister and other government officials were also onboard after attending an event near Iran's border with Azerbaijan. Rescuers reached the crash site overnight, there are no survivors -- prompting Iran's government to convene an emergency meeting. CNN's Paula Hancocks is tracking the latest developments for us from Abu Dhabi. Paula, good morning to you. What is the latest here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, we know at this point that the conditions at the time of the helicopter crash were bad. We know that the weather was challenging. We have been told that the fog and low cloud reduced visibility significantly.So, this is certainly being looked into by investigators. Now, this happened in a remote northwestern parts of the country. It is very mountainous. It is inhospitable terrain and it took rescue teams about 16 hours to be able to reach the area where this helicopter went down. They were unable themselves to put a helicopter up to try and find the location quicker, they said, because the conditions were too dangerous. So that really speaks to what the weather was like at the time of this crash. Now, we know that there has been this urgent meeting of the Iranian cabinet. We also know that the Iranian government has given their condolences, saying it's a great loss for the Iranian nation, that from the Guardian Council. And we know from the supreme leader himself, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that there will now be five days of mourning in Iran following this crash. He has expressed his condolences as well. Interesting though, all the Iranian officials, including the supreme leader, who have expressed condolences also point out that there will not be any disruption with this accident to the running of Iran, really trying to push forward a message of stability. Certainly, an important message they feel they need to give. Now, we know also that they have already made moves in the political scene. We know that the vice president has been now promoted to acting president, and there will be 50 days before there are elections called to replace that position. We also know that the deputy Foreign Minister has now taken the position of acting Foreign Minister. And this is a man who was known to the United States, Ali Bagheri Kani, he was the top negotiator in those indirect negotiations with the -- with the United States when it came to the Iranian nuclear deal and also hostage transfers and negotiations. So, what we're seeing at this point from the Iranian political sphere is a message of stability, at the same time as we are seeing the bodies being transferred from this crash site on the side of a mountain to the closest city to the area of Tabriz. So, a five-day morning period now in Iran, and we are seeing signs of that mourning starting already. We see on state media, the television anchors wearing black, we see prayers within the news bulletins themselves and certainly, this is a shock for many waking up in Iran.",

I mean, supporters of the prosecution would say, look, Michael Cohen is putting all the pieces there, all of the evidence. But there's still this underlying question of can we trust Michael Cohen? It's so easy for Todd Blanche and the defense to say, look, this is someone who lied under oath in Congress, he'll do it again, what's stopping him now? And he's also someone who could have vendetta against Donald Trump.

He gave an address at Morehouse College. He's of course, been trying to focus on getting black voters in particular to be as excited about them as they were in 2020. And that's proven to be an uphill battle for him. I think we have a little bit of what he said in that Morehouse speech over the weekend. Let's watch.

But it's also young black voters, young voters in general in this issue that plays for that voting bloc is really starting to hurt Biden.

Ebrahim Raisi came to power in 2021, winning an election with a record low turnout. And for three years, enacting policies that made him a polarizing figure at home and abroad. His presidency saw a dangerous escalation and tensions with Israel. In April, he supported a major attack against the country in an unprecedented response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed several Iranian commanders. Throughout Raisi's presidency, Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear program, violating an international agreement, while blaming the U.S. for withdrawing and European states for not living up to their end of the deal. Tehran also supplied lethal drone technology to Russia, fueling the conflicts in Ukraine, allowing Moscow to strike deep behind the frontlines. Meanwhile, at home, Raisi oversaw a brutal crackdown on dissent, suppressing a 2022 uprising sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini; a young woman in the custody of Iran's religious morality police. It all cemented his status as a loyal hardliner, potentially in line to succeed Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader. President Raisi's sudden death plunges that succession into chaos. Raisi died along with his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hossein Amirabdollahian, the top Iranian diplomat took office in 2021 after a long career with the Foreign Ministry. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
