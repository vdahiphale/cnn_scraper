He's on a trip to Berlin. We do expect to hear from him this hour. We will bring that to you live as we cover all this breaking news out of the Middle East. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us on this Friday morning. This just in. Senior Hamas leaders have confirmed the death of their -- their leader and the mastermind of the October 7th terror attacks, Yahya Sinwar, is dead. Israel's military announcing yesterday that Sinwar was killed in Gaza on Wednesday. According to Israeli sources, the hunt for Sinwar came to an end when Israeli forces came under for fire during a routine military operation in Southern Gaza. The IDF returned fire, and one of the militants fled into a nearby building. What you see now is drone video, edited and released by the IDF. They say it shows Sinwar hiding after that firefight, hiding sitting in that chair. Israeli troops later fired on this building again, and they killed the man in the chair. At this point, Israeli forces didn't know the identity of the man that they had killed. But upon closer inspection, they noticed that he looked very familiar. So, we're now going to show you a photo allegedly showing Sinwar's body after he was killed. We want to warn you: this image is graphic and may be disturbing for some viewers. So, we're giving you a second, if you don't want to see it on your screen. But we are going to put it up now. In this image taken from social media, you see here the body of a man resembling Sinwar, buried in rubble and surrounded by Israeli troops. CNN can't independently confirm the photo's authenticity, but our analysis found no signs that the image had been manipulated. Israeli police say that Sinwar's body was positively identified using DNA testing. With Hamas, now at a major disadvantage, President Biden calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a remarkable turn of events, because as you suggest, hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, were spent in the broader intelligence, finding the Hamas leadership and specifically looking for him.And in the end, they came upon him by accident in a firefight above ground. It sort of defied everything with the Israelis and the Americans -- who were helping Israel with special forces units and tracking technology and so forth -- believed would be the case for the end of Sinwar. And to some degree, the fact that this took everybody by surprise, especially took the Israelis by surprise, may tell you why you are hearing such dissonance right now between what the president and the vice president are saying and what you're hearing from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Those were very coordinated statements by President Biden and Vice President Harris, who were saying -- you know, using the key words of day-after, time to move on, end the war. And then, of course, when you heard Prime Minister Netanyahu, he was saying this war is not over. And that's why the surprise here has brought us to such a hinge point, because no one knows which way Netanyahu is going to turn now. Will he heed the advice from the U.S. for the first time, or will he say we've been successful? We've gotten the head of Hezbollah. We've gotten ahead of Hamas. Let's move on to Tehran.",

I mean, he was able to kill Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, three weeks ago. They got lucky and tripped across and killed the head of Hamas, Sinwar, yesterday. And so, he, well -- he may well be thinking, you know, follow your own instincts, use the moment to defeat Israel's adversaries. What the president is saying to them is, essentially, take the win. Convert the military victory into a longer lasting political victory. Otherwise, the military victory is just a passing tactical thing. And that's going to be the -- the fight of the next couple of weeks. It's why Secretary of State Blinken is being sent to Israel and why he's been talking to Middle East leaders to all put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to use this as a turning point, if an unexpected one.",

So, it's hard for me to imagine, despite the gravity of yesterday's news, which was, you know, remarkably significant. It's hard for me to imagine it having much effect on this election.

And even in 2016, one of the things we found in the polling consistently, even though people said they were going to vote for him, and they liked him, they were nervous about him having his hand on the nuclear codes. And so, I do think what these conflicts remind people is, do you want a stable leader, or do you want somebody who's coming out and going along him, who's not going to have the same kind of guardrails around him, frankly, to keep him in check. We know how he said he wants to use our military. They've said that, you know, his own military, his own advisers have said he is a national security danger.

      "sentences": "Well, that's a good question. I mean, first of all, there is some jubilation and some celebration amongst Israelis that this figure who led Hamas, who was seen as the -- one of the main architects of the October the seventh killings inside Israel, has been killed.Many Israelis have been voicing the opinion that justice has been -- has been served. But while it's a tactical victory for the Israelis, and no one is questioning that; and there's political benefit for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, it doesn't necessarily mean that the hostages are going to be released and that the war in Gaza and in the wider Middle East is going to suddenly come to an end. But there's a possibility that it could move towards that, but it is not a certainty. It's more like a hope at this point. And so, we'll see how things develop over the coming hours and in the coming days, with the death of Yahya Sinwar, which has now been acknowledged by senior Hamas leadership figures for the first time since Wednesday when he was killed. We'll see how that affects the outcomes inside -- inside Gaza. In the meantime, there is a high-level meeting that is, we think, underway right now between the Israeli prime minister and other senior security officials inside Israel to discuss Gaza, to discuss Iran, and to discuss Lebanon, where there's also Israeli military activity taking place. And to particularly focus on what impacts the killing of Sinwar may have on the timing, for instance, on a strike against Iran. Whether now may be the time to look at a hiatus, look at a pause in military activity, to perhaps give space for some kind of hostage deal to be done. That's certainly something the hostage families want in this country. There are still about 100 people, Israelis, held inside Gaza, dead or alive. It's not quite clear what their condition is. And the families of those individuals are pushing -- are doubling their efforts to push the Netanyahu government to try and get a deal now, at this stage, to get those people out -- Kasie.",
