I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and tonight we are following breaking news.President Biden speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time since signing a $26 billion aid package for Israel. The call coming just a month after the president warned Netanyahu about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, calling it, quote, \"unacceptable.\" More than 34,000 Palestinian people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, triggering massive protests here in the U.S. with students at major universities calling for an end to the war. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live at the White House. Priscilla, what are you learning about this call today?",

      "sentences": "What we're learning from this White House readout that they touched on multiple issues during this call that happened earlier today between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ranging from recent events like, for example, Israel's strikes back at Iran after Iran had struck Israel. This was something that the White House had been quite tightlipped about when it happened. And Israel had as well.But in this readout, the president, quote, \"reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel's security following the successful defense against Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack earlier this month.\" But they also talked about the hostage deal. These have been urgent talks that have been ongoing for months now with U.S. officials traveling overseas to try to reach an agreement and now we know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be traveling to Israel in addition to other stops in the Middle East. This, again, a priority for this White House, which has been trying to secure a deal that would include a six-week ceasefire for the release of hostages, but also to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza. Now, of course, this has been very difficult and challenging and the process is still ongoing. But this was something that also came up during the call after some recent developments last week when the president issued a rare joint statement with other countries calling on Hamas to release the hostages. Now, in addition to all of this, the president and the prime minister also talked about Israel's potential operation in Rafah. That's an area that has over a million displaced Palestinians. And it is an operation that the White House has been particularly concerned about because they don't see it as an operation that can happen with that many civilians in that region in this moment. And so that also came up during this call. And according to the readout, it says, quote, \"The leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position,\" that position from the United States being that this operation at this point is untenable. So those conversations and discussions that are also ongoing. But what is clear, Jessica, is that we are at an important moment, especially with those ongoing hostage talks. As the U.S., along with its partners, races to try to reach some type of agreement to secure the release of the remaining hostages, to achieve a temporary ceasefire, and then to also get aid into Gaza as the situation there continues to deteriorate. So this phone call coming after an earlier phone call this month to try to sort out the next steps. Again, we'll see the results of that in the weeks to come.",

Great to see both of you. Glad we're in the studio today. Let's just start first. Priscilla kind of laid out those top lines from this new poll that came out this morning with Trump holding an advantage over President Biden, 49 percent to 43 percent, just in the horse race. But 55 percent of Americans saying that Trump had a successful presidency, 39 percent saying Biden's has been a success. Alice, what are these numbers say to you?",

His handling of Israel is certainly under the water. People's opinion of this president with regard to how he's handled and its opinion of the presidency, with Trump at 55 percent, Biden at 39 percent in terms of their success.And when you look at Biden, look at that number, 61 percent of those we polled say Biden's president -- time in office has been a failure. That is not good. And look, this is a national poll and these are good numbers, and that gives people an idea of where things stand. But you also look at where is the numbers -- where are the numbers with regard to battleground states. President Trump is ahead of Biden on every single battleground state, when you're looking at the polling numbers and that's where it's going to make a difference. And look, we were all at the Correspondents' Dinner last night and I know that people like to make fun and joke about President Biden and his falling up the stairs or stumbling through his speech, but people are concerned about him falling down on the job when it comes to the economy and Israel and securing the border. That's where he's got a real problem.",

      "sentences": "I think that this poll is one of many six months out from the election. There is a lot of time left. And in fact, if you look at this poll as compared to the others that have come out recently, other highly respected polls, those other polls have the race at a dead heat. A lot of them have Joe Biden up by one to three points. The CBS poll that came out today has Joe Biden up in Michigan and tied in the other battleground states as well.But look, there's no question that there are challenges here. And the Biden campaign knows that. So they're going to take this poll as they always do and say, we have work to do. They're going to roll up their sleeves. They're going to continue to do what they're doing, continue to remind people all of the great successes and accomplishments that this president has done for the American people on the economic front, on securing democracy, on securing our rights and freedoms. And I think at the end of day, Jessica, what Americans are going to look at is the contrast. The clear choice between what President Biden has done, what he says he's going to continue to do to make the economy work for everyone, to secure our rights and freedoms, to secure reproductive rights for women, which is one of those issues, including the thoughts about securing our democracy. That doesn't always show up in these polls. We saw this happened in 2022. Everyone predicted a red wave when at the end of the day it was a great night for Democrats because the issues of rights and freedoms and securing our democracy were also front and center. So I think moving forward, this campaign is going to continue to tell that story and remind people where we were four years ago. Four years ago, our economy was spiraling. We were losing millions of jobs. A million and a half Americans died because Donald Trump denied the science of COVID while he was getting a shot. I think at the end of the day, Jessica, I'm going to bet on Americans' decency and the fact that they are going to choose somebody who has been a lifelong public servant, as opposed to a fraudster, a sex offender, and a criminal defendant who's only in this to stay out of prison.",

The split screen that has been happening up until now, Jessica, I don't think is a good thing for Biden. On one side, you have him with a criminal hush money, on the other side, you have his attorney arguing that he should have absolute immunity to do whatever he wants in office.Decent people, the majority of Americans are going to see that and say, you know what, we deserve better. And so what the Biden campaign is going to continue to do is remind everyone because there is a little bit of amnesia. And let's look at the numbers that actually matter more than polls. The numbers of fundraising. If people really did not support Joe Biden, he wouldn't be raising the massive amounts of money that he is, overshadowing so much on the money that Donald Trump is raising. The special elections that have been happening since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, if Americans did not trust Democrats more than Republicans, we would not be over-performing and winning in so many of these Republican-held seats.

But finally, police officers with campus police essentially moved all of the protesters out of this area so they use a lot of these security officers to essentially be the first line of defense so that the police officers were not engaging with a lot of those protesters.So instead, these security officers with some of their bicycles pushed those protesters out and then you had campus police officers in their riot gear following behind so that they did not directly interfere with those protesters. So here at UCLA we did not see any arrests. We did not see police involvement throughout the day, but we did see a lot of passion on both sides of this issue. I saw the violence both from the people who were here to support the Jewish students and from the pro-Palestinians and the people supporting them. Both of them were essentially yelling at each other. Some points I saw people pushing some of these security guards. There was definitely a lot said throughout the day and it was essentially impossible to get these people to agree or to listen to each other. Now right behind me, behind this metal barrier, it's hard to see because we're not allowed to go back there, but that's the encampment. Those are the students that are saying here permanently for as long as they say or as long as it takes for them to engage with the university. They say they want divestment. They say they want essentially clarity into where the university is investing that money. And they say they're going to continue to stay here at the university until they made progress on that. So the people at the encampment, they actually were not allowed to come into this area where the protesters were earlier. So the people that were here were essentially just supporting either the Jewish students or the Palestinian students who are inside in that encampments. So again, things are quiet right now, but we did speak to people on both sides of the issue. Take a listen to what they told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are certainly elements here that I think really indicate that both sides are kind of in a very intransigent space here, both the Israelis in the form of the Netanyahu government as well as the U.S. And the reason for that is that the U.S. is looking at this as a not only a public relations disaster, but a humanitarian disaster. And they're trying to avoid getting themselves wrapped into this kind of an operation that could result in tens of thousands more people, more civilians being killed. On the Israeli side, though, you have people who are looking at this from the government perspective, especially on the right wing, and they want military action with Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that he wanted to destroy Hamas.
