The seven men and five women will ultimately decide whether a former president is convicted of felony crimes for the first time in the history of the United States of America. And Mr. Trump is in court awaiting their decision. We just learned that the jury has submitted yet another note.

But, Jake, of course, before those jurors left yesterday to go home, they asked to rehear four key pieces of testimony throughout this trial, including from Michael Cohen and the former National Enquirer tabloid king, David Pecker, and his account of the 2015 Trump Tower meeting, also Pecker's 2016 phone call with Donald Trump about the former Playboy playmate, Kara McDougal, and David Pecker's testimony about not finalizing a deal, a payment from Trump to reimburse AMI for McDougal's rights to her story about her alleged affair with Donald Trump.Just moments ago, Trump repeated some all too familiar false claims about a rigged trial as he walked into the court as we are waiting for the verdict here, but still getting into the notes as of this moment. Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes are here with me. And right now, what the judge is doing is he's re-reading the parts of the instructions that the jury was curious about. And there's one interesting part, which was about David Pecker's non-prosecution agreement, basically, that he could not be prosecuted. He was boyish (ph), basically, on the, on the stand. And what he's reading is, you'll recall the testimony you heard when David Pecker was an executive at AMI, that they went into a non prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors. And basically, he was saying, this is to help you as a jury assess his credibility. You're not supposed to deduce whether or not anyone else, the defendant here committed a crime based on the fact that David Pecker entered into that non prosecution agreement via AMI, but it's just to help you assess what he's saying to you on the witness stand. But it's notable that the jury wanted to hear that again.",

They wanted to hear things about the hearsay exception, and here they're getting into the burden of proof. And, of course, if the government has proven this case beyond a reasonable doubt, you have to find the defendant guilty.But things like this, again, how you use David Pecker's, you know, previous arrangements, previous agreements with the government, that is significant, especially when they're clearly looking and evaluating at some of the things that David Pecker said. So, this makes sense, and, look, I definitely give them the benefit of the doubt about why they needed to rehear this and reiterate it is crazy that they don't just give the jury a copy of instructions.",

But it's not -- he's probably guilty, it has to be beyond a reasonable doubt.

And, clearly, the jury wants to go through some of what Michael Cohen said, and even just have, asking for both Pecker's recollection and Michael Cohen's testimony about that Trump Tower meeting.

Look, I think just pulling back the lens, I mean, the thing that I am most interested in here is that the series of things that the jury seems to have asked for all relate to whether or not Donald Trump was aware of what was going on. And that plays to this I'm not sure if it's intent, right? And was there an intent on the part of the various actors in the rooms?But, really, this idea of, you know, what was said at that meeting, is it corroborated along those lines, which, you know, I actually am subscribing and I'm a little cautious about what we all have to do here for all these hours while we're covering this, because I do feel like speculation in terms of what the jury is going to do is a little bit dangerous to engage in, quite honestly. But these do seem to be kind of the facts that they have laid out. We want to know more about these things. The things that they seem to have laid out, what they have in common is what Donald Trump knew.",

Three of them are from David Pecker. David Pecker, the tabloid king, America Media Incorporated, was a very important witness for the prosecution. And you think this might bode well for the prosecution that they're asking for this?",

We don't have cameras in the courtroom, but obviously we would also want to protect the jurors. I'm not so curious about how the jurors are reacting to the instructions, but once we see reading back of David Pecker's testimony. If I was in the courtroom, I would be watching to see, do you get any aha moments? I'm sure you, you've seen that.But let me just give some context to remind people about David Pecker. David Pecker laid out for the jury catch and kill. He said he was the eyes and ears of the Trump campaign. He testified that he wanted to help him win. He said Trump was his mentor. He was not a hostile witness, that he still considers him a friend. Just two quick things, at one point the prosecution asked him, was your principal purpose in entering into the agreement with Karen McDougal, not Stormy Daniels, to suppress her story so as to prevent it from influencing the election? Steinglass asked David Pecker, Pecker replies, quote, yes, it was. So, that kind of testimony, I don't know that that's what they're going to read back, but that's the importance of David Pecker in corroborating Michael Cohen.",
