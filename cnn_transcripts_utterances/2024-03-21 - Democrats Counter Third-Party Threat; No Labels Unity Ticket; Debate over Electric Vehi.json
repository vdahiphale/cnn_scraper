They can trace where their people are at in most cities all the time. They use that now in a policed state to basically track individuals to know who they are, what they're doing, whether or not they're behaving or not. The same thing, they'd love to learn more about our activities here. They want to know about American culture. They want to know about who our families are connected with. Just the beginnings of it is, is if they can go in and go to a TikTok user and say, we want you to contact your representative in your zip code it is so and so.

Police say Mitch McConnell's late sister-in-law, shipping CEO Angela Chao, was drunk at the time of a fatal accident in February. They say she drove for Tesla into a pond at a ranch near Austin, Texas. And Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani firing his longtime interpreter, accusing him of stealing millions of dollars to place sports beds. In an interview with ESPN, the now former interpreter says he never bet on MLB games and denied Ohtani had any involvement. And then there's this, Oprah Winfrey opening up on CNN's \"KING CHARLES\" about her weight loss struggles, taking weight loss drugs similar to Ozempic, and the criticism she's faced for it.
