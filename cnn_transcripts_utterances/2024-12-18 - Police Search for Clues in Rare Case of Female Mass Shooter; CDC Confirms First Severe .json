The Violence Project looked at mass shootings overall, not just those committed at schools, and found that only 2 percent are perpetrated by females. These cases are so rare that they really stand out historically. April 2018, 38-year-old Nassim Najafi Aghdam opened fire at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, wounding three people before killing herself. She'd reportedly been upset with YouTube's practices and policies. December 2015, Tashfeen Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, targeted a holiday event at the public health department in San Bernardino, California, shooting and killing 14 people before they were killed by police. The FBI later said the couple was inspired by foreign terrorist groups. Analysts who examine mass shootings and who study women committing violence say there are varied reasons why the overwhelming majority of mass shooters are male.",

He's the assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. Thanks for joining us on this. I know a lot of people are paying attention to this. They are more concerned, I think, as things get started and worried about them ballooning out of control. And you have the CDC saying this is also the first U.S. bird flu case linked to a backyard flock, not a factory farm. Tell us why that's significant.DR. JEREMY FAUST, HARVARD EMERGENCY MEDICINE PROFESSOR: Thank you for having me. Look, when I, as a frontline clinician, am looking for diseases and outbreaks that the public needs to know about, there are a couple of things that I'm looking for. One is the severity of illness. And one is just how easy is it to get that disease? And I think the concern comes today because we have checked one of those boxes, the severity of illness. And that's something that we had not seen in the prior cases this year. We have not checked, fortunately, the other box, the box that says, how easy is it to get our humans spreading this? And so the severity of illness is the concern here because in the cases in the United States this year, the version of the avian flu that caused it was mild. This looks more severe.",

But right now, it's coming from generally commercial situations, farm workers with a lot of exposures who need to have PPE. And as you said, from things like raw milk, which can harbor this virus.This is not rocket science. This is settled science. We know that things like pasteurization really remove the risk. But people, they take other risks. We have products that could harbor this virus. And I think given this situation, it makes sense to have a heightened scrutiny on those products and to be careful, buyer beware, because I don't think you want to be the first person to catch a potentially very deadly virus from something that was preventable.",

One at Al- Qutayfah, which is on the outskirts of Damascus, not very far from the Syrian capital, where one advocacy group has been speaking of the truckloads of bodies that were brought each week. What we understand is that four tractor trailers carrying 150 bodies each were brought twice a week, between 2012 and 2018, to this particular site, now be the subject of a search for some of those bodies in the hope that some may be identified.Another site in the southern province of Deraa, also now believed to be another of those mass burial sites. As Syrians try and establish the identities of some of the 150,000 people who've disappeared to try and figure out if any of them may lie in these sites. That's according to the International Commission on Missing Persons. Still many relatives frantically searching for their loved ones in the hopes that they might be alive, but these are the clearest indication yet, the first tangible proof of what we've long heard about from outside of Syria during the Assad regime, of the brutality of its secret services, the brutality of its detention centers, with many of those bodies now, no doubt, beyond recognition. It's unclear also, for the time being, how many people may have been buried there. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
