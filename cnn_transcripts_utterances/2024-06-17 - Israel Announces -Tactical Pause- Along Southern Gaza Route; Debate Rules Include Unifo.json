McIlroy with a one-stroke lead on the 16th green, but he missed a 30- inch putt for par to drop back into a tie for the top spot. And then more heartbreak on 18. His putt for par inside of four feet lipping out. So he ended up with a bogie. But DeChambeau having issues of his own on the final hole. This is his approach, missing the fairway and ending up in the sand short of the green, leaving him with a completely blind shot at the pin. And the 30-year-old is known as a scientist. He came up with what he called the shot of his life -- look at this -- knocking the ball just feet away from the pin. DeChambeau would sink the putt to make him a two- time U.S. Open champ. The win for DeChambeau as exhilarating as it was soul-crushing, Manu, for McIlroy. Like you just said, he has now gone 10 years and 37 tries since his last win at Major championship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRYSON DECHAMBEAU, U.S. OPEN WINNER:  I am so happy I got that shot up and down on 18. Oh, man. I didn't want to finish second again. That bunker shot was the shot of my life. Those fans out there really helped push me out there today. Even though I hit it in the bunker, the fans were still chanting my name. So, it inspired me to get that one up and down. It's a dream come true. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
