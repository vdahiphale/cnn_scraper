She suddenly resigned yesterday, effective immediately, and just three weeks before fall classes start. Shafik's resignation comes after months of protests gripped the campus over the war in Gaza. She was vilified for authorizing police to remove hundreds of student protesters. She also came under fire for her testimony during a contentious congressional hearing about rising anti-Semitism on college campuses. She's now the third female Ivy League president who testified to step down following nationwide protests over Gaza. Elisha Baker is a Jewish student at Columbia and a rising junior. Elisha, thanks so much for being here with us this afternoon. I know you're getting ready to go back to school, start your junior year. I just first want to know what your reaction is to President Shafik's resignation, especially the timing that you all are getting ready to go back so soon.",

It's kind of unclear going into the semester what exactly the time, place and manner regulations on protests are and what the punishments are for students and faculty that violate those time, place and manner regulations. And to me, the only way we stand a chance is if those policies are clarified, then they're codified. And then the university actually follows through on enforcing them.

MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENTThey amounted for more than $50 billion in Medicare spending in 2023. That's 20 percent of Medicare Part D spending. And so how will this affect people personally? Well, seniors under Medicare, for example, a hypothetical example that the administration has given is for the drug Stelara, which is on the list. It's a psoriasis drug and treats other autoimmune diseases. Right now, a 30-day 25 percent coinsurance out-of-pocket would cost $3,400 per month for seniors. With the new negotiated price, they say that's going to come down to $1,100 per month until a cap on out-of-pocket costs for the year kicks in, after which time they won't pay anything more. So that's 66 percent discount right there on that one drug. Some people argue there were already discounts in the system, so it's not quite as big as it looks, but still 22 percent savings, they say, across the board, guys.",
