And this witness, this is someone who is well known in Trump's circles. He's represented a lot of Trump allies, of Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon. His name is Rob Costello.And back in 2018 when federal investigators were looking at this whole hush money investigation, these two, Costello and Cohen, they had many different conversations. And Costello says that during those talks, Cohen told him that it was Cohen's idea to do the hush money payments. That directly contradicts Cohen's subsequent statements about how this all went down. Now, after he testified, Costello gave a little press conference of sorts. He addressed reporters. Let's take a listen to what he said and how it contrasts with what Michael Cohen says.

This affects the borrowing costs if you borrow money on a credit card, for a home loan, for an auto loan, but also it affects the economy. It affects jobs growth and clearly affects the banking system because all those rate hikes there have put some strain on the banking system.Here is the menu of options, right? No rate hike, there are a lot of people who are saying that it would be prudent to pause right here. You're looking at the expectations, right, that most people think it is going to be 25 basis points. But there's a case here for no rate hike. Pause after all of the stress in the system. The con of that, though, is that it could spook the markets. It could be telling the markets, hey, wait a minute, you told us inflation was issue number one. Now, all of a sudden, you're worried about what do you see in the banking system. 25 basis points is the conventional wisdom. It shows the Fed is serious about financial stability and fighting inflation. Inflation is triple what the Fed would likely to see in terms of consumer prices. And then outlier there is a 50 basis-point rate hike. A week-and-a-half ago, we thought that was in the bag, 50 basis points. It's what the European central bank did a few days ago because they wanted to show they were very serious about their fight against inflation, that, overall, inflation is the most important issue.

      "sentences": "Well, Don, the U.S. is watching these meetings very closely for a number of reasons. But if you listen to U.S. officials over the last 24 hours or so, one thing that they've really honed in on and expressed concerns about is the notion that China could reiterate its calls for a ceasefire in the war.And that's not because U.S. officials don't want to see the fighting end in Ukraine. They say that the fighting could end if Russia simply pulled out its troops. But that's because U.S. officials say a ceasefire would merely serve to ratify territorial gains in Ukraine and give the Russians time to regroup and rearm and then choose to restart the war at a time of their choosing. Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, said that it would essentially amount to a tactical move by Russia supported by China. And U.S. officials really want to dissuade the world of this notion that China is some kind of honest peace broker in this conflict. The secretary of state noted just yesterday that China -- that the Chinese president is traveling to Russia just days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges. And he said that Xi's visit essentially gives Putin more diplomatic cover to continue committing war crimes going forward. One other thing U.S. officials are watching for is this possibility that China could decide to provide Russia with lethal weapons for its conflict in Ukraine. That's something that Chinese officials so far have not decided to do, but also U.S. officials say they haven't taken it off the table yet. And so we'll see if perhaps that's one of the outcomes of these meetings.",

The Kremlin says that the two leaders had a thorough exchange of views. That's the word they used, over more than four hours. And all of this comes as the Japanese prime minister has also travelled to Kyiv to meet with the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy there. Joining us now for perspective is Washington Post Columnist Josh Rogin, who is also the author of the great book, Chaos Under Heaven, Trump, Xi and the Battle for the 21st Century. Good morning, Josh. We have been watching this. You so closely watch every word that these two leaders say given it's so highly choreographed. They've barely mentioned the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Right, Kaitlan. Well, that's for a very simple reason, is that President Xi Jinping hasn't condemned the invasion of Ukraine. In fact, they blame the United States for the war in Ukraine. And this just goes to show you that the White House has a lot of very good reasons to be skeptical, as the Ukrainians do that, the Chinese government could be any sort of arbitrary or impassioned negotiator here.I mean, let's face it, these guys are celebrating a war crime. They're celebrating the abduction and kidnapping of thousands of Ukrainian children. They are defending that -- the words -- speaking of words, the words that President Xi said were that China and Russia stand ready to guard the international order, okay, to stand guard over a world order that makes it safe for war crimes and repression and autocracy. So, yes, I think the chances that China plays a useful role in peace negotiations here are slim to none.",

I think, Don, what I'm saying here is that it's a ruse, okay, that he doesn't mean it, that it's meant to distract us from the fact that China, even before they send any weapons to Russia, is supporting the Russia war effort in Ukraine in a number of ways. They're buying the gas. They're helping them bust the sanctions.They're already sending a bunch of drones and other nonlethal supplies to the Russian invading army and standing next to Vladimir Putin as he takes a victory lap for being indicted to war crimes is about a big of signal as you can send that what they are say and what they're doing are two different things. So, yes, they say they're a peacemaker but what I'm saying is that we have a lot of good reasons to suspect that's not true.",

      "sentences": "Right. I think, basically, they're correct that a ceasefire advantages Russia and disadvantages Ukraine at this stage of the war when we're expecting a new fighting season in the spring and summer. There is going to be a new fighting season. But what's kind of funny about that is that Vladimir Putin doesn't -- isn't for a ceasefire either. He has no intention of obeying any sort of ceasefire. So, it just goes to show you how sort of flimsy and disingenuous this Chinese peace push really is.And there's going to be more fighting. We're going to enter a very bloody spring offensive and then a very bloody counteroffensive. And the question is, are we going to give the Ukrainians the means and the resources needed to prevail in that conflict to save their democracy so they don't find themselves in an even worse position next year. And I think when we talk about a ceasefire, what we're talking about is that time is not really on Ukraine's side. That as it goes, the longer this goes on, the worse off they are. And that's why I think there's a big debate both in Congress and inside the administration, frankly, about whether to speed up the assistance so that they can win faster, because if we let this go on for too long eventually, these lines will get dug in and that spells disaster for the Ukrainians and horror for the people living on the Russian side of that line.",
