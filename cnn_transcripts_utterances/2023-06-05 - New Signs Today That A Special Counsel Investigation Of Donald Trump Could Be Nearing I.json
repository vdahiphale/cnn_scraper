Lawyers for the former President held a lengthy sit down with Justice Department officials today. This is video of those Trump attorneys leaving the building this afternoon after their extensive talks with DOJ officials.This is a meeting that is coming after Trump's lawyers recently requested to meet with the Attorney General Merrick Garland accusing the DOJ of prosecutorial misconduct. Today's face to face discussions may signal the Special Counsel's investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents and possible obstruction is nearing its conclusion. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is with me now on this. Evan, what do we know about this meeting?",

We know they did not meet with the Attorney General, who is the person that they had asked to have this meeting with. Just in that letter just a few days ago where the lawyers for the former president said that they believe there had been prosecutorial misconduct committed by the investigators in Jack Smith's office.So we know that didn't meet with Garland. They didn't meet with Lisa Monaco, who is the Deputy Attorney General. But we do know that it was led by the top career prosecutor, top career official inside the Justice Department. Again, that's a sign that - certainly for Merrick Garland, he's trying to keep politics or sort of the political appointed officials out of the work that the Special Counsel is doing. He's insisting that the Special Counsel finish his work and make any charging decisions. And then, of course, if Garland disagrees with anything, he can try to overrule that. But until then, the President's lawyers, the former President's lawyers can make their case, right? It's not only about their complaints about what's going on with this investigation, but I think the larger point they want to bring across to Merrick Garland and to the people at Justice Department is that they believe the former president should not be charged with a crime.",

Russia has released its own video saying that it shows a skirmish also in Donetsk. Its defense ministry says Russia has repelled a large scale offensive, they're killing 250 Ukrainians. But, of course, keep in mind, Ukraine has not confirmed those details and Russia is known for making inflated claims about Ukrainian losses. I want to go now to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen.

In fact, they put out a video this weekend calling on people to not talk about the offensive. And the sort of message that they had with that was plans love silence. So they certainly are saying that they're not going to announce that. Nevertheless, there are some telling signs on the battlefield and I think one of the things that we saw there was that Russian video, for instance, where the Russians were saying that the Ukrainians had launched what the Russians call a large scale attack yesterday. The Russians say they thwarted that attack. However, what we're hearing from a Russian installed official in that area is that the Ukrainians apparently came back today. It certainly seems that Ukrainians gained some ground in the south of Ukraine. The big thing that the Ukrainians are trying to showcase is there games in Bakhmut. They say several areas around Bakhmut, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have made some gains. Of course, that's very significant for the Ukrainians, because the Russians just recently announced that they had completely taken that city. And obviously now we're seeing that that is not the case. In fact, the Ukrainian Central Command came out and they said, look, the Russians talking about the Ukrainians launching attacks in the south of the country are trying to divert attention from the fact that the Russians are losing ground in the east in Bakhmut. So what we're seeing on pretty much all the front lines here in Ukraine, of course, we know it's a very long frontline, Brianna, there's no way that the Russians are advancing and there are areas where definitely right now the Ukrainians have their foot on the gas and are putting the Russians under pressure. And of course, all of that comes on top of the fact that you have that situation across the border in Russia, in Belgorod, where there are those anti-Putin Russian forces that have crossed the border in some cases, they say, and are putting the Russians under pressure there. The Russian military still not able to come to terms with that. So right now, for the bigger picture - vantage point, it certainly seems as though Vladimir Putin has a pretty big problem on his hands, and right now the initiative certainly seems to be with the Ukrainians, Brianna.",

Some of the survivors we've talked to they said that they were in train cars where people were standing in the aisles. It was so crowded. And today is I saw trains running again through this area.
