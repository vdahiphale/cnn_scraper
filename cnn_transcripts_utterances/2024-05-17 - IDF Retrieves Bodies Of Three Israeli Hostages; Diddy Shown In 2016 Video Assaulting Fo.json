We start in Israel where the Israeli Defense Forces say that they've recovered the bodies of three hostages who were in tunnel in Gaza. The spokesperson says the bodies have been identified and their families have been informed. Daniel Hagari vowed that Israel would leave no stone unturned to find the remaining hostages and bring them back. He delivered the somber details at a news conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL'S CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: According to the credible information that we have gathered, Shani Louk, Amit Bouskila, and Itshak Gelernter who were murdered by Hamas while escaping the NOVA Music Festival on October 7th, and the bodies were taken into Gaza. They were celebrating life in the NOVA Music Festival and they were murdered by Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They were all attending that NOVA music festival along the border with Gaza on October 7th, when Hamas began attacking that festival, shooting wildly, killing dozens of people at that festival alone. These three individuals, Shani Louk, a 23-year-old, Amit Bouskila who is 28, and Itshak Gelernter, 58 years old. The three of them were at that festival, but they actually managed to escape Hamas' rampage there and they escaped to the nearby kibbutz of Mefalsim, about 10 miles away, and that, the Israeli military says is where they believe that these three individuals were killed and their bodies then taken across to Gaza. Shani Louk, there was actually a very symbolic image of her, an image that became symbolic at least of Hamas' brutality on that day. It showed her body in the back of a pickup truck with several Hamas militants standing over her and she is the only one of these three who we had previously confirmed was dead. The Israeli government had announced they believe she was dead. But for these other two, Amit Bouskila and Itshak Gelernter, their families seem to have found out today that for seven months, they believed that they were hostages. They did not know if they were alive or dead. And today, of course, being told not only that their loved ones were killed, but also that their bodies are now back in Israel. So at least, amid the pain, amid the heartbreak, there is certainly a sense of closure.",

They have done it before and that is certainly was their intention to do this again.

What is the annual rich list from the Sunday Times with attributes to Paul's success, his longevity and popularity across the generations. The world's top-ranked golfer is near the lead in the PGA championships, which is quite remarkable considering he started the day in jail. A police have charged Scottie Scheffler with assaulting a police officer outside the golf course. The officer was directing traffic. Scheffler was trying to drive round him. And there had been a tragic accident earlier in the day, which somebody was killed. They were hit by a bus. Nothing to do with this, of course, but Scheffler described the whole scene as chaotic. He said he misunderstood what he was being asked to do. Patrick Snell is at the PGA Championship in Louisville in Kentucky. He's with me now. Right. This really -- having read the various bits, Patrick, this really comes down to the policeman thinking, it tells Scheffler to stop. Scheffler continuing to move. Policemen grabbing the car, policemen getting dragged. Scheffler then getting dragged and arrested.",

And so, I started going through my routine. I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could today. But like I said, you know, I still feel like my head spinning a little bit.
