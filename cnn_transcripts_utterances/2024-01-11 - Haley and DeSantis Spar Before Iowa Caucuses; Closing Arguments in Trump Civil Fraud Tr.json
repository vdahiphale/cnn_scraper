He said -- quote -- \"This entire case is a manufactured claim to serve a political agenda. It has always been press releases and posturing, but no proof at all.\" Again, as we said, Trump's team is making his case right now.

And that's what Chris Kise is doing right now. He put it in a political context, but now he's going through his theory of the case. And he's now insisting that, look, my client had no motivation to lie. He's saying, in his expert opinion, and he's describing his client as an expert in commercial real estate, which, of course, the judge took issue with on a technicality, saying he hadn't been certified as an expert in this case, but he's saying he didn't believe that Deutsche Bank was only going to look at his statement of financial fitness when deciding whether to lend him money.

He has tried to tie the district attorney to his political rival, President Biden. I will note that the district attorney did promise to investigate and potentially prosecute Trump when she was running for office. So he's not incorrect that she has previously expressed a desire during a campaign to go after him. But this case, the judge has already found him liable for fraud. They have seen witnesses.

He said he did. And that is part of what prompted this investigation. Cohen was also a witness here.

Trump's lawyer led off this presentation by saying this is a political vendetta. There may be some truth to that, but that is not an admissible, proper argument in court. Now, if it's the judge deciding, as here, the judge can filter it out. You can say, all right, irrelevant, not considering it.
