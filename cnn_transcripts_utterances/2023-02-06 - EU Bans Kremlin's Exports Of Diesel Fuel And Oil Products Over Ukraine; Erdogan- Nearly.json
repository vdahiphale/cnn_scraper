      "sentences": "You know, Christine, in theory, yes -- this hits Russia where it hurts. Oil products, along with crude oil, of course, the biggest export -- the biggest money spender and, therefore, the biggest contributor to Russia's war machine.But we've got essentially three things going on here. We've got an EU embargo on seaborn oil products, which include the likes of diesel fuel oil and that kind of thing. We've got a ban on maritime transport and financial services from the EU, the U.S., and the G7. And we've got a price cut mechanism which essentially provides an exemption to that ban on maritime transport financial services if those cargos are purchased under a certain price. So the biggest impact is going to come initially from the EU embargo. Russia, one of the biggest exporters of diesel in the world. The EU used to buy almost two-thirds of that. So this depends how quickly Russia can find new customers. But take a look at this map because when it comes to crude oil we know that Russia has been selling a lot of the barrels that are displaced from Europe to India and China. But if you look there, China and India are also some of the biggest exporters of refined oil products. So it's much less clear where Russia can go to sell those barrels of diesel and other refined products that it used to sell to Europe. It will have to offer bigger discounts. Then on the flip side, Europe now has to find new suppliers. It might have to pay more to do so, especially because all of this, Christine, coming at a time when we're likely to see demand rising from China because of the relaxing of those zero-COVID measures. And, of course, if the price goes up around the world, that could mean --",

Turkey's president says nearly 1,000 people have died in that country alone after a powerful 7.8- magnitude earthquake that has devastated both Turkey and neighboring Syria. Thousands more people have been injured. And now, a race against time for rescuers to find survivors trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. Syria's White Helmets rescue group says the quake has left northwestern Syria in a state of catastrophe.Let's bring in CNN's Salma Abdelaziz. Salma, how hard is it for a war- torn country like Syria to now deal with this disaster?",

      "sentences": "I mean, it's absolutely devastating, Christine. You just played that video from the White Helmets showing that little girl being pulled out of the rubble -- scenes all too familiar in Syria. Of course, in this case, it is a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that has devastated the northwest of the country.The Syrian president, President Bashar al-Assad, called an emergency meeting this morning, of course, and ordered all his departments and all his ministries to put any resources they have towards those affected areas. But as you can imagine, after over a decade of war -- nearly 12 years of conflict now in that country, there's very little of those resources left. When you think about hospitals and clinics, those were places that were targeted during the conflict. So we already have images coming from these places where doctors are overwhelmed. They don't have the equipment they need. They don't have the medical resources they need to care for the wounded. When you're thinking about heavy earth-moving equipment -- bulldozers and cranes to try to pull people out -- again, much of that equipment destroyed and damaged. And the other thing to remember here is that the Syrian government does not have access to the entire affected area. There are parts of the northwest of the country that are still rebel-controlled. That means families there have to rely on volunteers. Have to rely on rebel groups for help. And while Turkey is busy setting up, of course, spaces for families to gather, whether those be schools or public spaces, Syria will have none of those options. And what's really horrifying about this very traumatized population is many people woke up wondering if they were warplanes, Christine. And now, of course, having to deal with this impact -- over 230 people killed so far inside Syria, more than 600 wounded -- that's according to the authorities -- the number is going up every hour. And you have to remember on the other side of the border in Turkey, right along that area that was affected, there are thousands of families living in tent cities, living in refugee centers. So for the Syrian population, I can't even begin to explain just how devastating this is. And in the hours coming ahead -- these critical -- this critical period, there will be very little resources for Syrian authorities to try to help those hurt and affected.",

His time with the Nets has been chaotic, to say the least, and his final days in Brooklyn have felt that way, too. Two days after asking to be traded and one day after getting booed by Nets fans, the team reportedly sending the 8-time All-Star to the Mavericks for two players and three draft picks. And when he gets there the All-Star guard will certainly team up with maybe the best young superstar in the league, Luka Doncic. Between injuries, his refusal to vet vaccinated, and his suspension over tweeting a link to an antisemitic documentary, the 30-year-old missed almost as many games as he actually played in his three-plus years with Brooklyn. Irving expected to play his first game for Dallas on Wednesday. Elsewhere, Warriors superstar Steph Curry may be out for the foreseeable future with a knee injury after this collision on Saturday against the Mavs. The team has not set a timeline for his return. The reigning finals MVP expected to miss multiple weeks. That, according to a report from The Athletic. And LeBron James is on the verge of becoming basketball's scoring king after scoring 27 on Saturday against New Orleans. LeBron now 36 points away from passing Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most in NBA history. That is a number that he is more than capable of putting up in one night. He's averaging 30 points a game. He's been remarkably consistent in that regard. He scored at least 36 nine times already so far this season, including three of his last seven games. So it could be the night. He's got a chance to reset the record tomorrow night at home in L.A. against the Thunder on our sister channel TNT. Some tickets are fairly reasonable all things considered. You can get some nosebleeds starting at just under $300. But if you're going to pay that price go ahead and watch it on T.V. In college hoops now, a potential national championship preview yesterday. Fifth-ranked UConn hosting number-one South Carolina. Things starting off great for the home team. Lou Lopez, center, hitting the running three at the buzzer there to put the Huskie up 11 after one. And the reigning Player of the Year, Aliyah Boston, didn't make a basket in the first half but turned on the jets after the break scoring 20 points to go with 11 rebounds. She now has 76 career double-doubles as South Carolina holds on to win by four and stay undefeated. Meantime, Iowa's Caitlin Clark continues to be a human highlight reel. A no-look behind-the-back pass to McKenna Warnock for the lay-in -- just ridiculous. She finished with 23 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds -- her ninth career triple-double in the Hawkeyes' Blowout over Penn State. And lastly for you this morning, Christine, it is officially Super Bowl week. It is here. The Chiefs and Eagles touching down in Phoenix yesterday for what will be a historic showdown next Sunday. The first time that two Black quarterbacks will play each other on the NFL's biggest stage in Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes. The first time two brothers will face off in Travis and Jason Kelsey. And two head coaches going up against their former teams in Andy Reid and Nick Sirianni. We're going to have live coverage from Arizona all week leading up to Super Bowl LVII. We've got Coy Wire on the ground getting ready for media night, which is always fun.",

It's the first time since the pandemic that offices have been more than halfway full.But workers aren't back every day yet. Data shows Friday, of course, is the lowest occupancy day.

It was another strong week overall and a strong start to 2023. The S&amp;P -- let's see. We're looking at the bounce in down markets on the week. Anyway, watching that there. The Nasdaq up three percent. A five-day -- a five-week winning streak there. A shockingly strong jobs report Friday has investors wondering what the Fed's next move is. Even more rate hikes to cool down this economy? This week we'll get more information on that. A critical speech by the Fed chief Jerome Powell. We've got the State of the Union Address,  the consumer sentiment data, and weekly jobless claims. Another week of big earnings. Pepsi, Uber, and Walt Disney among the companies slated to report.
