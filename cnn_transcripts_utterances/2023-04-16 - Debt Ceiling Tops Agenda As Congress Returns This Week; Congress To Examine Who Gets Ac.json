      "sentences": "Good morning, Victor and Amara. The first big priority for Congress is the debt ceiling. Current estimates put the deadline for when the treasury department will exhaust the extraordinary measures that uses to pay the government's bills at some point early this summer. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have yet to hold substantial negotiations on this something that has become a key point of anxiety for many members on Capitol Hill.House Republican leaders, I'm told, have begun informally putting together a debt limit package that they intend to socialize with their rank and file members next week. McCarthy is also slated to deliver a speech on this at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Another key priority on the Hill will be around receiving classified briefings. The Pentagon is scheduled to give an all senators briefing on Wednesday as they continue to investigate the massive leak of classified defense documents. The Gang of Eight, which includes the top four congressional leaders as well as the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, started receiving some of the classified documents found at the homes and offices of former President Donald Trump, President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks. They're eager to review these documents more closely in a classified setting on the Hill. Another key focus for Congress is on the recent abortion ruling in Texas. There's little that Congress can do following the court's decision to suspend the use of medication abortion drugs, but Democrats in particular are eager to weigh in on this in person and see what legislation including messaging bills they can put forward to force Republicans on the record. And lastly, House investigations are continuing to heat up. We're seeing more Republican chairman begin to issue subpoenas as they enter into the fourth month of being in the majority. On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a field hearing in New York City as they continue to escalate their investigation into Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.",

Some of it, frankly, is coming from within her party, from people who would like to have that seat. So, California Democrats are really trying to nudge her toward the exit. I see this playing out as very likely so kind of compromise being struck to sort of kick the can down the road. It's a very old Senate, if you look at the average age.

The Trump organization is being put out of business in New York that's real serious stuff. And yes, a little blip in fundraising is kind of a nice way to maybe try and take advantage of the situation, but I'm sure Donald Trump and his campaign would rather not have to put out those kinds of emails say, my life and my freedom and my company are all at risk, you know, please click at the bottom and send me $23.00 or whatever the latest appeal is. Yes, he has picked up a couple of 100,000 brand new donors, apparently, according to the figures. But, you know, not all publicity is good publicity, Amara. And don't let anybody tell you otherwise, the former president is capitalizing on almost the worst kind of notoriety that he is playing the role of a victim.

CNN's Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard has the full report.JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER (on camera): This is the first time a helmet designed specifically for quarterbacks will be available for the 2023 season following NFL lab tests. And this helmet was specifically engineered to reduce the severity of impact when a quarterbacks helmet hits the ground and the NFL says about half of all quarterback concussions occur when that happens. Now it's not required for quarterbacks to wear this helmet. But according to the NFL, this helmet performed at seven percent better than the type of helmet that was most popular last year among quarterbacks. And this isn't the first time that the league has leaned on helmet technology in hopes of making the game safer. In the 2021 season, a helmet designed for offensive and defensive lineman was introduced. And last year Guardian caps debuted at training camps across the league. Those are padded covers that are affixed to the outside of the helmets. But in general, no helmet is 100 percent concussion-proof. That's because while helmets can help prevent skull fractures and other serious brain injuries, they can't stop the actual movement of the brain inside the skull when there's a blow to the head. And that movement, when the brain moves around in the head, can impact how the brain functions and lead to concussions. So, that's what makes this an ongoing health concern as we talk about football and safety. Back to you.",

They lost 30 of their 41 games away from the bay, and that didn't change Saturday night. thousands of fans, they're hyped up outside the arena in Sacramento. Why? They've waited 16 years for this. They had the longest postseason drought in major American sports. They even have a Storm Trooper out there swinging a flag there before the game. Their star, De'Aaron Fox, he put on a show. Check them out hitting a big three-pointer with about three minutes to go, giving Sac Town the lead. 29 of his 38 points came in the second half. Now, it's just over a minute to go, Steph Curry cooking things up yet, 30 points on the night. The step-back three cut the lead to two, but the Warriors, they took 50 three-pointers, they only made 16 of them. And Andrew Wiggins missed this wide open while was seconds to go. So, check out the Kings celebrating as they hold on for the 126-123 win. Afterwards, they went to the coolest postgame celebrations in the NBA. They light the beam.

He scored 29 as Boston beats Atlanta 112-99. After falling in the finals last year, Boston looks like they're actually ready to finish the job. If they do get their eighth team title, it would break their tie with the Lakers for the most all time. All right, Philadelphia, they're facing the Nets and they're looking every bit like a challenger to those Celtics in Eastern Conference. The Sixers had eight players combined to hit a franchise playoff record, 21 three-pointers. James Harden had seven of them. He scored a triple-double -- I'm sorry, a double-double. But it was their seven- foot star Joel Embiid, one of the MVP front runner, scoring team-high 26 points as Philly pulls away late to win by 20. There are four more games today.
