I get the lowdown from Republican donor Frank Lavin on what this means for the U.S. election and for the world. Then, a state of emergency in Ecuador. I ask the country's president about cracking down on gangs. Plus, settler designs on Gaza. We have a special report on the vision of Israel's far-right. Also, ahead, a strongman president. \"The New York Times\" columnist Zeynep Tufekci joins Hari Sreenivasan to explain Trump's lock on America's far- right. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's the day after the night before in America's presidential politics. The starting gun was fired in Iowa and Former President Donald Trump won the caucus convincingly. Taking more than half the vote. This despite facing a slew of civil and criminal charges and after attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Here he is speaking after the Iowa result. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  People in our country are great. They're all great. We love Iowa, but they're all great. They only want to see one thing. They want our country to come back. They're embarrassed by what's going on. Our country is laughed at all over the world. They're laughing at us. And they want our country to come back. They want America. You know, they want us to be great again. It's a very simple MAGA, Make America Great Again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis eked out a narrow lead over the former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley. Now, all eyes are turned towards New Hampshire's primary, which is next week. Our next guest, GOP fundraiser and donor, Frank Lavin, is part of the old guard of Republicans, if we can put it that way, who refused to support Trump back in 2016, who believes in policy. And before that, he served in Ronald Reagan's White House. Now, he's putting his support firmly behind Haley. And he's joining me from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Frank Lavin, so let me ask you, how hard is the hangover? Are you -- you know, are you suffering today or what?

Andunfortunately, we fell a little bit short. It's almost an even split between DeSantis and Haley. But he did creep out a little bit ahead of her. So, be it. But New Hampshire should be a more favorable state for a few reasons. One, remember Chris Christie was polling in the low teens in New Hampshire and he's since dropped out. So, we believe most of that vote does go to Nikki Haley. The second important point is Governor Sununu, very popular, very effective governor, is 100 percent committed, enthusiastic, energetic, and working hard for Nikki Haley. So, you have some local support. Remember, the governor in Iowa, God bless her, was supporting Donald Trump. So, now, the shoe's on the other foot, and we think we've got a little bit of a tailwind in New Hampshire that we just didn't have in Iowa.",

There were eightRepublicans at the first debate, and it just took months and months and months for it to winnow down to one or two. So, that's enormous advantage to the leader. The so supposed -- so-called incumbent like Donald Trump. That's one advantage. Two, I've got to say, whatever you think of Donald Trump and his policies, he has the most effective emotional engagement with the audience. He might not have the best policies, he might not have the most substance, but boy, in terms of getting -- playing to people's emotions, getting people to feel unhappy, or happy, or outraged he does that, I think, better than any candidate today.",

Whereas the economy is actually better today than it was at the beginning -- at the end of Trump's presidency. Others saying that they actually not only like him despite some of the outrageous things he says, but because of, most particularly, that horrible comment about, you know, Asian and African blood of immigrants, you know, poisoning American blood.

I think you're right that he enjoys being a bit offensive, being a bit outrageous, and he enjoysgetting a critical reaction, and if nothing else, it guarantees he's front and center. So, that is a tactic I think he regularly uses of stepping on other people's toes, so to speak, and then getting criticized for it. But there's two elements that he plays into, I think, very effectively. One, Joe Biden is viewed with broad disfavor in terms of his immigration policy. And I think Americans are concerned what they perceive as something close to open borders and Biden just not on top of his obligations. So, that is one favor that plays directly into Trump's strength because Trump is viewed as the most orthodox, if you will, on border controls. And second is just Biden himself, Biden's age, his feebleness, his frailty. So, you do evoke this nostalgia to say, can we get a president who is more alive, more alert. And whatever -- again, whatever weaknesses Trump has, and I think he has many, he has a stage presence that can be electric, and it's a sharp contrast with Joe Biden.",

If she takes that up to 50 percent in New Hampshire, that is quite an impressive accomplishment, but there's a lot at stake there.

I've had the chance, in Iowa over the last five or sixdays, to hear three or four times and she really goes after Trump on January 6th. She goes after him on being an election denier, which I think are two very critical points of this guy's persona to say how -- you know, how irresponsible can you be on January 6th to egg those people on. But regardless of what his direct responsibility was, he sure was cheerleading those guys, those rioters. And then, he's this huge election denier for several years where he's the sorest loser in the history of presidential politics, and he wants to drag the entire country into a debate about his laws. So, she, I think, correctly held his feet to the fire on those two points. But she has a pleasant and professional demeanor. She's not a polemicist. She's not a screamer. She's not a yeller. So, sometimes people want anger or want lightning bolts in a speech, and that's just not her style. She wants to, I think, command the room and share her insight with people but do so in as pleasant a way as possible. So, she's an engaging personality if you ask me. I find it very appealing.",

And you're right with discussion of woke issues or transgender issues. People will focus sometimes on reasonably minor activities. But it alerts them or it alarms them, and they organize their life around something that is not a very common activity. So, these seemingly minor issues have sort of outsized role in political discussion. Instead of you go back a generation ago, the main discussion was how do we get the economy back on track, get economic growth going, get inflation down, get unemployment down, and just allow everybody to have a better life.

So, one of the things that I think is striking across all of these leaders that you just mentioned is that they have a base that theydo protect through both patronage and welfare state and safety net. In fact, one of the misunderstandings about Trump is that he would be like a regular Republican in terms of, you know, targeting Medicare or Social Security. Just quite the opposite. He talks about, you know, his opponents, Florida Governor DeSantis and Nikki Haley, as the kind of people that would target welfare or, you know, would target Social Security and Medicare. They don't see that as -- they see those as deserved. And he also talks about in these, I alone can fix it. I am the person who will take care of you. I am the leader that will look out for your interests in a world, as he would put it, and as these other leaders would put it, everybody else is against us. So, he's channeling a certain kind of anger, a certain kind of disaffection like with many of these other leaders, there's a us and them. And the them, for example, in Orban's Hungary is the immigrants. In Trump, there's a lot of that as well, but it depends on, you know, what part of the world you're looking at. So, if there's a deserving people, there is an other to blame. And there is these elites that have, in their view, sold out the people, the deserving people. And here comes a strong leader here to come and take care of you, to provide a safety net for you, to keep you safe in a tumultuous world. And I have to say, historically speaking, this is with so much precedent. This has happened again and again in history that strongmen come through popular support through a mix of exploiting disaffection, you know, pointing the finger at some enemy that is easy for their base to rally around, demagoguery. And all these details that we worry about, perhaps, in terms of the separation of powers, liberal democracy, you know, journalists in jail, you know, a lot of these examples that you have spoken about are not high on these people's list.

And Ukraine war and even the Middle East situation happened under his watch. And you might say he doesn't run the world. It doesn't work like that. And I wouldn't disagree. But to his supporters and to some people, it looks like when Trump was president, people were scared to oppose him. That's what they say. And they -- also, the counterfactuals, it didn't happen. And the third thing I think that people, once again, are underestimating is the effect of age. Now, we have, I think, 78 versus 81 by the time November comes around, when -- if it's Biden versus Trump, that is a strikingly old matchup. So, there is that. And in some sense, you might say, well, their ages are close to one another. It is both strikingly older than average presidential candidates. And that's true. But the polls are very clear, President Biden's age is seen as a much bigger liability to him than Trump's age is seen to him. It's perhaps like his aggressive behavior. Perhaps it's the way, you know, Trump sort of his rallies, the way he talks, the way he comes across. Like, I'm not going to try to explain exactly why that is. But it's really clear to me, from talking to people, and looking at the polls, that people see President Biden's age as something that makes him weaker and less competent compared to they have the same criteria for, you know, Trump.
