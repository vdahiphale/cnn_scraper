Again, it just seems a bit unrealistic to think that we can handle all 19 and 40 something days.That's my initial reaction, thinking of --  just how to get this -- and are we even delaying the inevitable? If we say there's no severance, aren't we going to have 17 defence attorneys get up here and file motions for a continuous just saying they're not ready? I think we've already had some counsel indicating they're on trial in other cases in federal court.

And the issue is do we pull these two defendants out? Not do we pull defendant 13 out or whatever the case may be.

Their lawyers have filed motions to sever and I don't think any of the case law or anything that the government has cited here today trump's my clients right to a speedy trial.She has asked for a speedy trial. She filed it timely just like Mr Chesebro therefore, I think at a minimum her case is severed from the remaining 17. It must be severed because none of the cases that the government cited point to the idea that all of those considerations trump the statutory rights of my client to a speedy trial. So, you know we can see what post briefing comes in about severing Mr. Chesebro from Miss Powell, but I don't think there's any dispute at this point that Miss Powell and Mr Chesebro are severed from the remaining 17 based on our demands for speedy trial.",

The judge said, it is unrealistic that we can do all 19 in 47 days. I mean, that was like a, sort of to me, shouting from the rooftops. He could be persuaded to change his mind once he hears from lawyers next week. But that to me was very indicative of the way this might be going if it stays in Georgia court.",

      "sentences": "I think that's exactly right. I mean, from the time that Sara asked the district attorney, Fannie Willis, if she was going to try everyone together and she said, yes. There were a lot of questions about exactly how would that work? How would you logistically handle all of these 19 defendants, including one who is running for the presidency again?But this appears to be a win, an initial win for prosecutors. It'd be a lot at stake for them if Powell or Chesebro were able to sever. I mean, think of that, you have one defendant, it's one or two defendants, it's televised, you're previewing all of your evidence for all the other attorneys. Here it appears this is at least an initial win, but we'll be back in court next week with new questions. We'll see how it goes. I'm really curious to see how they explain exactly how they would do this with 19 people.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it was interesting to watch the sort of convenience argument play out because it sort of backfired for Sidney Powell and Ken Chesebro's attorneys who were arguing it would be inconvenient essentially for their clients to have to sit there over the course of weeks or months and hear evidence that doesn't necessarily pertain to the crimes they were accused of.And what the judge came back with is you have to consider the judicial convenience. You have to consider, you know, we are going to need to pick a jury for each of these trials. We need to think about the efficiency on the court, not just the efficiency for the defendant. And I'm sure that that is something that's going to come up as he's considering how to handle the rest of the 17. He may not ultimately be persuaded by the district attorney's office that the other 17 should go with Ken Chesebro and with Sidney Powell and move ahead toward this October 23rd trial date, but it seems like he could potentially be convinced that a large chunk of them should move together at a later date in part because it does take a while. I mean, they're talking about a four-month trial. That's what the district attorney's team suggested they were going to do with 150 witnesses. And that does not include jury selection. And the judge pointed out it wouldn't surprise him if it took twice as long for a trial like this to play out.",
