The head of the pro-Russia Wagner paramilitary group claims that a body was found with U.S. identification documents. The State Department it has not verified the claim but it is seeking additional information.Now, overnight, the Ukrainian air defense says it repelled a major air assault by Russia. Ukrainian officials say waves of Russian drones and sophisticated cruise missiles targeted Kyiv, but they say Ukraine's air defenses, many of the western-made, took out the Russian weapons. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Eastern Ukraine. Nick, we have known that some Americans have gone to fight in Ukraine over the last year. We've also known that Americans have died there. What is the latest on this claim of a U.S. citizen dying in Bakhmut?",

Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is making this claim without putting forward any substantiated facts so far, is known far more for propaganda than it is for truth.But what he has said is this U.S. citizen who he says died in battle fighting for the Ukrainians in Bakhmut, he said he will be repatriated to the United States, or at least to Americans, American representatives, that he will be put in a coffin, that he will draped in a U.S. flag, because he said he died apparently in an honorable way fighting, not died in his bed. But, again, Prigozhin propaganda, we cannot lose sight of that. In Kyiv, though, again, it appears a dose of Russian propaganda, claiming that they were able to strike a Patriot missile defense system of the type the United States has given to the Ukrainians. What we have heard from the Ukrainian military is that Russia tried to penetrate their sophisticated air defenses with multiple missiles, the hypersonic Kinzhal missile, six of them fired from the north from aircraft, nine cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea, from the south, and from the east, on Russian territory, three of their large Iskander S-400 missiles, all trying to penetrate the air defenses around Kyiv. And key Ukrainian officials are saying that none of those missiles got through. This is a war where a lot of missiles, a lot of shells, a lot of casualties and deaths but also a lot of propaganda coming from the Russian side, and Prigozhin is in that camp much of the time, John.",

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is now reiterating her warning in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that time is running out and that the United States could default by June 1st.Sources have described the ongoing staff level discussions and negotiations as productive, but Kevin McCarthy has been pouring cold water on that this week.

You have really heard this different public messaging from the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy heading into this face-to-face meeting at 3The House speaker telling our colleague, Lauren Fox, earlier today that he is not optimistic about these upcoming talks unless things seriously change. That runs a little counter to what you heard from President Biden over the weekend when he said that he felt that there was a desire to reach an agreement from both sides, as he really struck this optimistic tone. Now, we know behind the scenes that those conversations on the staff level were conducted in earnest over the course of the past week since that last meeting between Biden and McCarthy. Both sides have called those meetings constructive even though they have been very slow-going in getting closer to any type of an agreement or establishing the contours of what could be hammered out between President Biden and the House speaker. You know, there are those areas that have been put on the table to open to some potential compromise when it comes to permitting reform and bringing -- clawing back unspent COVID relief funds, but there are certainly still sticking points when it comes to these length of budget caps as well as the questions about work requirements for certain government aid programs. But right now, everyone is facing a real time crunch in this moment. The House speaker has said that he thinks that there needs to a deal struck by this weekend, and it simply takes a lot of time to move legislation and corral caucuses together in order to get these types of agreements signed into actual law. Now, a bit earlier today, we also heard Secretary Janet Yellen of the Treasury Department a warning of the stakes, saying, quote, if Congress does not address the debt limit, there are no good options that Treasury or the government can use to save us from catastrophe. So, clearly, this meeting this afternoon is incredibly high-stakes, it's also running up against that timeframe for President Biden to depart for Japan tomorrow. But aides I have spoken to have acknowledged that he could very well leave for this trip without a deal in hand and with those staff level talks continuing.",

Look at this, $3.53 a gallon nationally, according to AAA, down by $0.14 in the past month, down almost $1 from a year ago, almost a $1.50 from the record high last June of $5.02 a gallon.And, you know, there's actually half the states right now are under $3.40 a gallon, including New Hampshire, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina. There's even one state averaging less than $3 a gallon. That's Mississippi, where AAA says the state average is $2.97. That's down from $4.08 a year ago in Mississippi. So, why is this happening? The Fed's war on inflation, combined with recession fears, that has driven down oil prices, that's keeping the lid on gas prices. Plus, U.S. supply is rebounding from the COVID crash and Russia's supply has been a lot better than people feared. If you put it together, you have gas prices that are a lot tamer than last year. The question is, of course, how long does this last? Think there're two risks. One would be if the economy actually does a lot better than people expect, demand could overwhelm supply. Also, there's always the risk of a hurricane that knocks out refineries. Still, though, GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan, he told me that he thinks there's a growing chance that the national average will not hit $4 a gallon this summer.",
