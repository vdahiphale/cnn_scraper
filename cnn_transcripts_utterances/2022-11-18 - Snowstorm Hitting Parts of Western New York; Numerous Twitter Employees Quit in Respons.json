In terms of what we're seeing here in the heart of Buffalo, it actually let up for just a second, which is why authorities and those crews on the ground, they're actually trying to get on the roads to make sure that the roads remain clear so that some of those folks who might have to be having to get to work this morning are able to do so.But in all, though, that travel ban is in place. It was put into place yesterday. It's going to continue at least potentially for the coming hours. That's because so far the official observation at the Buffalo airport has only slightly above a foot, and there is an expectation that we are likely going to be getting several more feet, potentially even challenging the record set back in December of 2001 when we saw a little bit over four-and-a-half in just three days. And that's really what has officials concerned, and it is also why officials are basically just asking that unless you have to go out on to the streets here in the Buffalo area, that you simply stay home. There is certainly a concern that we're going to continue to see that snow. And so that's why the snowplows are out, people are using those snowblowers to make sure that anybody who does have to get out and about is able to do so. But largely, though, the big recommendation, again, as we send things back to you, stay home because the worst is potentially still ahead, Don. Back to you.",

And it is going to be difficult for Elon Musk, but it is not impossible. We do know that there are many employees that maybe have to stay. The question is, how many are left? Those numbers are still unclear. But again, there are just people who have told me, look, I spent seven years at Twitter and I'm just watching on the sidelines heartbroken and really disappointed.

That's a bill I've watched people try it get done since they passed Social Security. My father-in-law introduced the first bill in 1940. She actually delivered and got it done after Medicare was passed in 65. You can go through what she's done with Joe Biden and gotten it all done. And she helped change the face of the Congress.

The online ticketing giant has now canceled public sales which are supposed to happen today for Swift's Eras Tour, saying that there are, quote, extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient ticket inventory to meet that demand. The abrupt change comes after the fiasco that happened on Tuesday when fans flooded the internet with complaints as a result of the Ticketmaster Web site crashing or freezing, meaning they were unable to purchase tickets during the presale despite having a code.The feud between artists, fans, and Ticketmaster has been I knew it's been going on for decades. 1994, let's take you back.

Although given our proper popularity, we can undoubtedly continue to sell out our concerts with ticket prices at that premium level. We have made a conscious decision that we do not want to put the price of our concerts out of the reach of our fans. Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements with most of the suitable venues and promoters has left most bands without any meaningful alternative for distributing tickets. This absence of any alternative in turn gives Ticketmaster the power to exercise excessive control. The result for our fans has been higher service charges, meaning effectively that they pay higher prices for their tickets. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
