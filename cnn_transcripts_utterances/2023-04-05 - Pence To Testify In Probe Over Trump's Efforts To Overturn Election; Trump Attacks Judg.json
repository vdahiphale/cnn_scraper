His former number two says he will in fact testify, about their conversations, leading up to January 6. Former Vice President Mike Pence will not appeal a ruling that he must testify, in the Justice Department's Special Counsel investigation, of attempts to overturn the election. So, the question, tonight, will Trump appeal, on executive privilege grounds? And one day after Trump pleaded not guilty, inside a Manhattan courtroom, in the hush money case, against him, he continues to attack America's rule of law, and targets the judge, in this case, and also claims that the indictment helps him politically. Tonight, one of Donald Trump's legal allies joins us live. Also, we'll hear from a former federal judge, on whether to expect a gag order, as Trump attacks the New York judge. Plus, you'll hear from the jury foreman, who acquitted John Edwards, in a similar campaign finance trial. Hear what he has to say. And joining me, live, in studio, a panel of great voices, to analyze and make sense, of this all. But we begin with the news involving Mike Pence. Katelyn Polantz joins us now live. So Katelyn, there's some big news out about this that our team is reporting, when it comes to the Special Counsel investigation, and a testimony that had to do with seizing voting machines, right?",

Pamela, what that means is that he will be appearing, before a federal grand jury, in D.C., sometime in the coming weeks or days. We should very much expect that now, because of the position he is taking. So, what had happened, to arrive at this event, which is really an unprecedented situation, a former Vice President, testifying, about the person, he was on the ticket with, the person that he served under, the former President of the United States, Donald Trump. Mike Pence had been subpoenaed, by the Special Counsel's Office, and had initially resisted. He had gone to court, as had Donald Trump, trying to block some of his testimony. Ultimately, the judge, in that case, said \"Yes, you do have to show up, and testify in this criminal probe, around January 6, being conducted by federal investigators. And you're going to have to discuss direct conversations that you may have had, with President Donald Trump, at the time, especially if Trump was acting illegally.\" And so, Pence is expected to be showing up, in the coming days. Even if Donald Trump appeals, it would take a lot of mountains for him to move, at the federal court, for him to get an order that would block Pence. He keeps losing every time he tries to block someone's testimony.",

Prosecutors are asking for a January 2024 trial, one month before the Iowa caucuses. Trump's team, however, is pushing for spring 2024, which would put the trial squarely in the heart of the primary process. If there is going to be a trial. Back with us now, Astead Herndon and Tom Nichols. Tom, I know you wanted to make a point in our earlier segments. I'm going to allow you to do that -- but also get your take on how the legal calendar in the political calendar are aligning in this case.",

To your point, they have created a whole victimhood narrative around this campaign, that this indictment speaks to -- and we should remember, as we talked about this political calendar, there could be more and there's still more investigations. There could be more indictments in the future, which would allow the him to continue to block out the sun from those other candidates.The Nikki Haleys of the world, the Ron DeSantises of the world have not shown the willingness to really use this to directly attack Donald Trump because they do not believe there is space to do so among enough of the Republican electorate. Even the folks who aren't supporting Donald Trump but who are remaining Republicans have largely said they still find these charges to be political, and they're seeing it as a reason to reject his candidacy. I was just at the RNC a couple months ago, and someone told me that the very -- if any, if any plan for victory for Republicans going forward cannot be anti-Trump, that because that is who Republicans are even if they have to change style, even if they have to change policy, they cannot -- there is no future of Republicans that's anti Trump.
