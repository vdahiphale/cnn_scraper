Did he get some people who weren't sure, maybe I'm going to vote, maybe I'm not going to vote, did he convince some people, and they were afraid to put it in the mail but they had it at home. A Democrat requested wasn't sure they're going to vote, don't love the candidates, Obama convinces them and they do it.

As you saw moments ago, Arizona officials in Maricopa County say they will be reporting new numbers tonight, about 80,000 tabulated votes expected. It will obviously affect the current vote count in that close Arizona Senate race where Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly is ahead. Should Republicans win at least two of the three outstanding Senate races, their control of the Senate will be cemented by multiple election deniers. It's important to note, however, that in other must watch races across the country, including those in Michigan and Pennsylvania, election deniers largely lost.I'm joined now by Pulitzer Prize-winning Presidential Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of many best sellers, including Leadership in Turbulent times.

But they cared about it and they cared about it in a number of ways.I mean, I think the election deniers was part of it. They knew a peaceful transition of power is the hallmark of democracy. If you are going to allow people who are still arguing about the 2020 election to argue about this one, and then they will argue about 2024, 2028, it will never be the same again. But I think they also came out because of voting rights. There was voting rights were under restrictions, the great Civil Rights Act of 1965 had been undone. We were talking about states that were restricting different votes. So, they got to get out and vote. They're going to make sure that they can pass those restrictions. And I think abortion rights had something to do with democracy, too.

I mean, he was told right before he took office the first time, if you can make that new deal program, you will be the best president in the country. If it fails, you will be the worst. He said, no, if it fails, I will be the last. And you think about it. It was happening with Mussolini and Hitler. Democracy was in peril and it was saved here.

Lake still trails Hobbs in the count. But again, only 79 percent of the vote is actually in. So Kari Lake just a little bit there closing that gap.
