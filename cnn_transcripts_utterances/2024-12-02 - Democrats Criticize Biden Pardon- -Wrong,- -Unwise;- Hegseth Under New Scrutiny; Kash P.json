I have a host of issues being a firearms guy myself, but there is a lot of precedent with other individuals particularly of color, being charged with the same crime. Hunter Biden isn't somehow absolved or special because he's the president's son. So I think that's a complete nonsense. On the tax charge, I would argue there are a whole host of other individuals that have had to deal with other issues very similar, such as Wesley Snipes, a known actor, who actually had to go to prison. He didn't get a pardon. And so, there's a ton of hypocrisy here from my perspective as a conservative. I agree with what Jeffrey Toobin said and what Axelrod said, most people would understand.

The president feels, the president-elect feels he's got a slate of people that are MAGA people. He's going to put those up if they can get through.I think even he himself will be surprised by that. But he's doing that because he looks at his base and saying, these are for you. You know, Marco Rubio's for the governing. Somebody like Walsh would be for the governing. These are for the base. By the way, if they don't get through, I've got Pam Bondi right behind him five minutes later. And I think it's the same thing with Kash Patel. I don't think the expectation is that he's going to get through. Because just look at the obvious stuff. You just have to watch two interviews. Don't watch the snippets. Watch two interviews of Kash Patel with Steve Bannon. Watch the whole thing. And if you're a United States senator and you're a respectable Republican senator, watch the whole thing. And then ask yourself, if you really love your country, do you want Kash Patel to be the FBI director? And I think the president will have somebody in the queue five minutes after he steps out of that position of nomination.",

And if you put him in and you're a Republican senator listening to this program, do your homework on Kash Patel. He is a dangerous person. He'd be bad for America.

Coming up next, more perspective on how President Biden's decision to pardon his son Hunter could affect his legacy. A talk with Peggy Noonan, former speechwriter for President Reagan, about her remarkable new book and her thoughts on what's happening today. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:43:20] COOPER: Turning to your top story, President Biden's decision to pardon his son Hunter, reversing a promise the president made repeatedly not to do just that. Hunter Biden faced sentencing this month for federal tax and gun convictions. The debate around the historic pardon will no doubt play a role in shaping his father's legacy. I'm joined right now by former speechwriter for President Reagan, Peggy Noonan. She's the author of a new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" which is so wonderful. And I was saying to you, I find so comforting in these times to just sort of have a I don't know, you can turn to any page and it's just it's like a bomb. So thank you. One of the things I wanted to ask you about was some of what you wrote about President Biden. This was you wrote in September of 2023. You said in insisting on running, he's making historical mistake. Second terms are disaster sites. Always now he isn't up to it. It will cloud what his supporters believe is a fine legacy and allow Kamala Harris problem and allow the Kamala Harris problem to fester and grow. She's proof that profound and generational party dominance in the state tends to yield mediocrity. They rely on personal charm, but are superficial, going national requires developing more depth or at least imitating depth. She didn't bother to do that.

It also had to do with right now. It had to do with the sense that we are losing the thread, that America is losing the thread. We compared we couldn't help it. It is the nature of memory, the America of now with the America of 20 years ago. And we see a deterioration. We feel disturbance at this because we don't know if we can get our weight back.

We're really seeing those start to ratchet up on the back of this stunning offensive, which, frankly, left all of us, including those of us who have covered since 2011, just kind of in a state of shock.I mean, Syria had effectively quashed the rebellion, quashed the uprising, but Bashar al-Assad did that with the help of some very powerful proxies, none more powerful than the Russian air force. But it seems that the rebels have taken advantage of this moment and seized the momentum. And they are going even further, not just in Aleppo and the northern Aleppo countryside, but now potentially poised for an offensive on the central Syrian city of Hama, where they have been telegraphing to local people tonight that they should stay away from regime figures and regime forces, as everybody just sort of waits to see what will happen next, Anderson.",

Iran has been very distracted with Israel's bombardment, with the losses that its proxies have been facing in the Middle East.And Hezbollah has been virtually decimated after two months of heavy fighting with Israel. And so it's possible that because those various supporters really kind of took their eye off the ball and were not deploying their full assets and resources to Syria, that the rebels thought this would be the moment to step in. Now, the question is, how long do they let Assad dangle in the wind, so to speak, before stepping in to save him? As I said before, those Russian airstrikes are definitely ratcheting up. President Assad is very valuable to the Russians. They have a big base in the Port of Tartus, and he's an important ally strategically. Interesting to see, though, what will happen with Iran, with Hezbollah, how deeply they will get involved with all that is going on across this region. And more broadly, I would just say, Anderson, that while there are a lot of people who are somewhat jubilant at seeing this offensive because there is such animosity towards Assad, who has committed so many egregious war crimes against the Syrian people, there's also a lot of unease about this rebel offensive, about the makeup of these rebel groups. And there's broader concern that this region simply can't take any more instability, Anderson.",

WALSH (voice-over): So, reposition the entire truck, but suddenly, the drone has vanished. It sounded like a decoy. But that usually means others are coming, and the sky is filling up with drones in the next region. A month ago, the targets here seemed endless.
