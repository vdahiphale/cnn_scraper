Foster fled the scene before officers arrived. This was back on Tuesday. On Thursday night, authorities raided a property about 20 miles north where they found a bunch of evidence, including his car. They believe he was helped by a 68-year-old woman who was arrested for hindering prosecution, but he managed to escape leaving this small community on edge. Take a listen to police chief.

There was two separate charges against him in Nevada in 2019. In the first case, he was charged with felony battery constituting domestic violence. His ex-girlfriend testified that he tried to strangle her in a rage in 2017 after another man texted her. While that case was still pending in court, Foster was charged with felony assault, battery and kidnapping for allegedly attacking another woman, his then-girlfriend, this was 2019. She told police he kept her tied up for two weeks. He strangled her to the point of unconsciousness, burned with lye. She ultimately escaped and he ultimately agreed to plea deals, was sentenced to a maximum of 30 months in prison but given credit for the more than 700 days served in the first case. And police chief in Oregon, guys, are saying he was just extremely troubled by the fact that this man was not behind bars in Nevada.",

You will recall that last week there was this big controversy that was then resolved within NATO about the supply of tanks led when the Germans and the Americans agreed that they would both kind of break the seal on their anxieties over those weapons.Now, those are not strategic weapons. They're battlefield replacements for what the Ukrainians have already lost, albeit much more sophisticated and potentially more potent and useful to the Ukrainians. But what the Ukrainians really want are long range missiles and they're not getting them because the United States and other countries fear that those longer range missiles could be used to attack inside -- targets inside Russia itself, and which is a slightly peculiar argument given the enormously long border between Ukraine and Russia means that if the Ukrainians wanted to attack targets within Russian territory, even with short range weapons, they would be able to do so. But there is a concern over escalation there and then ultimately also, as you know, Jim, the president here has, right back to 11 months ago, been pleading with the international community to allow the supply of fighter bombers, of jets. There has been some talk that potentially they might get hold of some M-16s. There are also some Soviet-era jets still in the warehouses effectively around Eastern Europe.
