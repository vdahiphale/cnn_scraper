Over $2 billion have been poured into broadcast TV ads in the past three months.Democrats are outspending Republicans overall on the airwaves. $1.4 billion versus the GOP's 896 million. And that dollar lead holds across all seven battlegrounds. It's not just about the money, of course, we want you to look at who these ads are targeting and how which messages work, which don't seem to be. And we know that by what is actually the closing message for each of these campaigns as we get to the final days. With me to talk about all of that, two of the smartest political brains, CNN senior political commentators David Axelrod and David Urban. The Davids. David Axelrod, if you were inside the Harris campaign now, as you were in both Obama campaigns, what would your sort of overall takeaway be at this point? Where do you honestly feel like they are and they need to be?",

I think that's where this race is coming down.There's, you know, they -- maybe they will rally in some of the Sun Belt states, but I've felt that Biden never worked those states very hard because he was always focused on the northern states. And so they hadn't been worked. And I think they're a little bit behind there. So I think those states are most important. Pennsylvania is still the essential state, Dave's home state. And I think if she wins those three states that she'll be president, and if she loses one or more of them, it's going to be difficult.",

I saw a statistic that in the state of Pennsylvania, there have been $538 million spent on ads by both sides. $178 million more than the next battleground state of Michigan.

The paradox of the Trump campaign is that their message has been veryconsistent. And I've said this to Dave before and to you. They have run a very rational campaign based on Biden's standing and based on the right direction number of the country. Trump is not a rational candidate, however. And so we're spending a lot of time talking about stuff that has nothing to do with any of that. And that's a detriment to them in the final days of this campaign.

You were just talking about more money here by far than in any other battleground state.So one of the things we have done. This is our fourth or fifth trip here over the past year. I just want to show you where I am. I'm in Delaware County, which is just south of Philadelphia. When I started doing this is my 10th presidential campaign. This was Republican territory. As you can see, it is lopsided for the Democrats. Now the vice President has to run it up in places like I am, where I am in Swarthmore, a college town. I want to blank this out a little bit. Just go north of Philadelphia, come back out and go up. One of the most competitive of the collar counties is Bucks County. Again, that was a heavily Democratic county when I started doing this. Now it's much more competitive. Donald Trump gets a lot of those blue collar workers. But there are plenty of Republicans listening here to Michael Pesce. He is one of 155,000 people who voted for Nikki Haley in the Pennsylvania Republican primary long after she was gone from the race. He says he will never vote for Donald Trump. So Harris will get his vote even though he's not sure if she wins what that means. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL PESCE, PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENT: No, I don't. And that's the scary part is, you know, I'm not voting for a candidate. I'm not voting for a policy. I'm voting against the candidate and policies and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness of some of the things he says are truly scary. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of them voted for Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020, and have told us because of Biden's policies, because of inflation, the cost of living, they're going back to Trump.But remember, if you look, Joe Biden won this state by 80,000 votes. 80,000 votes, 81,000 votes. Harris doesn't need all of those Haley voters. But if she gets some of them on top of the growing Democratic support, and you mentioned the gender gap in Pennsylvania, that's the coalition the Harris campaign is trying to put together here. Big black turnout in Philadelphia, high support here in the collar counties around Philadelphia, and then pick up some of those moderate Republicans, the Haley voters, people like that, who don't want to vote for Trump but might have doubts about Harris. That's the interesting tension in the final days, especially down here. I just want to draw a line right here. If you look at Philadelphia and the suburbs around it, about a third of the vote, even more than that, closer to 40 percent will be cast right there. You see, it's all blue in the last campaign, right. Donald Trump narrowly won this state. The challenge for Harris is in a place like Swarthmore, can she run it up? And then in the other suburbs, can she just be competitive? And it's flip -- let's flip that. Donald Trump won this state in 2016 because he did a little better. Let me just zoom in on this. He did just a little better. This is Chester County. This is further out. Let me get rid of the typing there. Look at Donald Trump in Chester County, which used to be a solid Republican. He gets 40 percent in 2020. You go back to 2016, he gets 43 percent. Those margins matter. Right. So is Donald Trump better in the suburbs? He's not going to win these suburbs, but he's a little better like he was in 2016, then he can win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If Harris can match the Biden numbers and keep Trump down, then she wins the biggest prize of all. BASH: Yes, it's, I mean, the margins are so, so close, as the both campaigns are saying.

Take it away.AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE COOK POLITICAL REPORT WITH AMY WALTER: Yes. So our House editor, Erin Covey put together a fantastic forecast. Basically, we're looking at 22 seats. That's it. That will probably determine who controls the House. Out of the 435 races that are up, if those seats split evenly where 50 percent went down 50 percent Republican, Republicans would still have the majority by an even narrower margin. Right now our forecast says that it's anywhere from Republicans picking up five seats, so they'd have basically an eight seat majority to Democrats picking up 10 which would give them a six seat majority.
