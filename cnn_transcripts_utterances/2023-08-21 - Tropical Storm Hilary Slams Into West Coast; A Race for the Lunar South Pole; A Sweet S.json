With up to 10inches of rain expected in some areas, winds were expected to knock out power for many on Sunday and Monday. Parts of Mexico, roughly a 300-mile stretch along the Baja, California Peninsula were also under hurricane warning with \"locally catastrophic flash and urban flooding,\" according to the Hurricane Center. CNN`s Natasha Chen was in Southern California ahead of this rare storms impact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And the last time a tropical storm made landfall in California was more than 80 years ago. So, a lot of people are wondering what exactly they should do. Officials have said a lot of the preparations that folks would`ve made for winter storms and flooding months ago apply here asking people to please take advantage of the sandbags that are being given out to bring materials indoors, to not go outside or drive in the weather on Sunday and Monday, if they don`t have to. Officials have also been very proactive and going to outdoor areas where there are encampments of unhoused people trying to convince them to take shelter inside before the storm, really comes through the most intense of which is supposed to be Sunday afternoon, at least through the San Diego area with very strong rains and winds. We are seeing a lot of events being canceled or postponed. In fact, Major League Baseball moved their Sunday games to Saturday. There are concerts like ones at the Hollywood bowl being canceled. The U.S. Navy has even temporarily moved their ships and submarines away from San Diego just during this storm, at least until it passes through. Catalina island in Los Angeles county has been warned for people to -- they`re strongly encouraged to leave that island that they`re likely to get hit. A lot of high-water rescue vehicles prepositioned. A lot of personnel out there ready to act as soon as this weather comes through.",

      "sentences": "In the U.S. flash floods kill more people than tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning, a flash flood creates a rush ofmoving water that can sweep a grown man off his feet, a car off the road, and even your entire home off its foundation. When the ground becomes so saturated that water can no longer seep into the soil, it begins to run off quickly into rivers and streams and this causes a rise in water and a flash. Densely populated areas have an extremely high-risk of flash flooding with the additional concrete and less grassy areas for the water to soak into the soil. And they can see flash flooding very quickly. And mountain is terrain the combination of gravity. Plus, the easy runoff can lead to catastrophic flooding. When all of that water is funneled into rivers creeks, and even the valleys. Remember flash flooding can happen in the blink of an eye. That`s why it`s important to stay alert and pay attention in case a flash flood watch or warning is issued for your area. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

All of these sites are actually located on earth, except the Sea of Tranquility. Chosen for its smooth flat terrain, the Sea of Tranquility was the site of the first moon landing by the U.S. in 1969. But did you know that there`s a new space race going on between the United States, China, India, and Russia. And the big focus is landing on the moon`s Southern pole. Why the lunar Southern pole, it`s all about terrain and lighting, large mountains and deep craters at the south pole of the moon create permanently shadowed and very cold areas that scientists believe could hold ice that would have valuable scientific information, but that terrain and those conditions make for a difficult landing. And on Sunday, there was a major setback for Russia`s space program. Roscosmos, Russia`s Space Agency reported that their Luna-25 space crafts crashed into the surface of the moon. This was set to be Russia`s first lunar Lander in 47 years, the pilotless craft would`ve been the first ever craft to land on the moon south pole. But it went spinning uncontrollably while in orbit. So next up is India. India`s pilotless craft is scheduled to make a lunar landing there just two days from now. India`s last attempt to land on the moon in 2019, ended with that craft also crashing into the moon surface. The U.S. while they`re aiming to be the first country to land there with a crude mission planned for 2025. China, they`re also hoping to land there before the end of the decade. As it stands only the United States, the Soviet Union and China have successfully soft landed anywhere on the moon And for today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, we`re hanging 10. Well, this silly marine mammal making waves in San Diego, it`s become a bit of a celebrity among local surfers there who say it brings them pure joy. CNN`s Jeanne Moos seals the deal.
