Widespread pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. colleges. Flashpoints at the University of Texas at Austin, where several protesters are zip tied and pulled away. Students defy deadlines to leave an encampment at Columbia University in New York. In the Middle East, Hamas is considering a proposal to release at least 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And fighting for a better Africa. How leaders across the continent from nearly 20 countries are working to deliver sustainable growth. We'll have that conversation coming up. But first, pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. college campuses entering their second week. Several protesters were arrested at the University of Texas in Austin, but school officials say most of them are not believed to be affiliated with the university. Here in Georgia, the president of Emory University is walking back a statement that said protesters were not part of the school's community. That president is facing a no-confidence vote from the school's faculty. And at Columbia University in New York, the epicenter for this movement, the school's deadline for protesters to disband has now expired. The demonstrators voted to defy the order, and Columbia says it has now begun suspending those who are refusing to leave the campuses. Well, I'm joined now by CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell for more on all of this. Good to see you, Josh. So, we've seen a range of responses to these protests. We've seen situations where there's no outside police, we've seen heavily armed police, and also very violent arrests. But certainly, in Columbia, it's almost six hours since that deadline expired for protesters there to leave the encampment or face suspension. What are authorities weighing there with their response?",

And as you mentioned, the authorities -- the officials at the university gave this 2:00 p.m. deadline today for essentially this group of protesters who had set up an encampment to disperse. Now, the penalty that they were weighing here includes academic discipline, including suspending students who were on campus. Again, that is much different than what we've seen in other places where individuals on campus have actually been criminally charged for trespassing. And I think that comes down to officials. They're wanting to potentially de-escalate this situation, not ratchet it up. Send police onto that campus in order to clear it. But, of course, there is the big question about what comes next. These protesters have indicated they're not going anywhere. We saw several groups calling on others to join today to surge to the campus in order to \"protect the encampment.\" And so, it's just a matter of time whether officials there actually determine that they want to bring in the NYPD, New York Police, in order to clear that area. Of course, as all this has been going on, we've also been hearing from Jewish students there on campus who say that they don't feel safe. One anonymous student filed a lawsuit in federal court today, essentially accusing the university of unfair practices and having students now dial in remotely for classes. And of course, again, we've heard from so many students saying that some of the protests themselves are making them unsafe and not lending themselves to a safe environment in order to get an education. So, certainly, a volatile situation right now, not a surge of police onto the campus, but we're all waiting to see what authorities ultimately do, Lynda.",

Of course, the question here has come down to a lot of harassment that people have claimed on these campuses, some antisemitic material and slogans by some of the protesters. And we've seen, such as at the University of Texas today, authorities come in very -- with a full show of force in order to try to dismantle a makeshift camp that was set up there in the center of campus. Now, you know, I've talked to law enforcement across the country often. One thing I'm hearing now from law enforcement is they don't want to be in the middle of any of this, right? Regardless of what one -- what a view one holds as far as the Israeli-Hamas ongoing war. The role of the police is simply to clear out trespassers. You know, there's no First Amendment right in the U.S. to protest on private property, and authorities are essentially taking their cue from the university whenever university administrators and university boards of directors say, we want these areas clear, these people are trespassing, the police have to go in, just as they would at any type of business or property, but it certainly presents a precarious situation when you have protesters who say that, we're not going anywhere. We saw a number of people detained today at the University of Texas, that ongoing right now trying to clear out that camp. And so, again, we would hope that would be a last resort to bring in law enforcement, but we're certainly seeing it happen across the country.",

When you look at public opinion and public sentiment and, you know, as we've discussed, college campuses orareas where people are there to discuss their views, even the views that might be in conflict and that are certainly controversial. And so, I think that's why we're seeing some universities take a softer approach when it comes to actually clearing out areas. Because as you mentioned, you know, this is an issue that is certainly have -- has garnered widespread attention in the U.S. There's been widespread condemnation of the number of innocent deaths that we've seen in Gaza. And so, it's certainly something that has served as a catalyst. People taking to the streets here in the U.S., particularly at universities and college campuses. But again, I think the big question for the universities come down to how do they balance that with also the need to protect the safety of students and to ensure, you know, a campus where people are free from fear. And we've just heard so many times now in the last several days where Jewish students, in particular, saying that, look, we signed up to come to this college campus to get an education, not to be berated and didn't have to, you know, be exposed to a lot of these slogans and things that we've heard, you know, spraying of swastikas on certain pieces of property and the like. And so, that is the delicate balance that administrators are doing right now. Despite the public sentiment, how do they create a campus that's free from hate? It's worth pointing out that the overwhelming majority of these protests are indeed peaceful, and we have not seen any of that type of vitriol, but it has certainly been there in certain cases, and that's what the officials at universities are grappling with, Lynda.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHNNY JENNINGS, CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG POLICE DEPARTMENT: About 1:30 p.m. this afternoon, the U.S. Marshals Fugitives Task Force went to the 5,000- block of Galway Avenue and attempt to serve a warrant on an individual for possession of firearm by a convicted felon. When they approached that individual, they were met with gunfire. Officers returned gunfire and struck the victim who was later pronounced deceased in the front yard of the residence. As officers approached that individual, they were -- they then received additional gunfire from inside of the residence. So, after a long standoff, we were able to clear this residence and confirm that there were two additional people inside.

Whenever there is something that voters are dissatisfied about, the guy in the Oval Office tends to get the blame, even if it's always not their fault. So, we know that there's a great deal of discomfort still among voters about the economy, about high prices, about the impact of high interest rates, which are still not going down, that makes it hard to buy a house, to buy a car, et cetera. A lot of this is coming to, you know, build opposition against President Biden. And I think that is why voters might be saying, at least some of them, that their economic conditions before the pandemic were better when Trump was present than when Biden was present.

This happened actually during about, say, about a dozen years or so ago when there was the Occupy Wall Street factions, if you recall, in Lower Manhattan. You know, they took over a park called Zuccotti Park. They first started protesting about, you know, the banks and the bailing out of financial institutions during the great crash in 2008. And quite frankly, there were a number of police who were on board with that saying, yes, that is kind of messed up that these financial institutions are not being, you know, bought -- paid for by -- with our tax money and no one seems to have been punished for the wrongdoing of that. So, you know, when it started with that core group of people protesting, it then sort of multiplied into all kinds of different protests, including those who are anti-government, those who are anti-police. It became 52 different protests in one, and then they decided to just camp out on someone's property. And that doesn't work well, you know, for too long either. So, at some point, they need to be removed off of private property.",

Five other law enforcement officers were shot and injured during that incident. Dianne Gallagher is standing by for us.

DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. The chief of police saying that he can't recall a deadlier day in law enforcement here in the Charlotte area. Eight law enforcement officers shot. Of course, three of them killed. The U.S. Marshals confirming one of those three, a deputy U.S. marshal. Look, this started off with the execution of a warrant.

This includes short-term drivers, like whether the Fed is going to tighten or not. But very, very importantly long-term drivers. On the day to day, we use this advice -- give advice to our clients and to manage portfolios. But very, very importantly, we can also use that understanding of what the future might look like or to help policymakers make great decisions. And one of the more important changes that is happening in the world today is happening here in Africa. And it's going to be very consequential to what the world is going to look like over the next 50 years. If I can just say two more things about that, just to make it manageable. Today, an eighth of the world's working age population lives in Sub-Saharan Africa. That's a little under 700 million people. But Africa is going through a demographic boom. It's growing by about 30 percent each decade, and that's happening at the same time, where population is basically declining in almost every other place in the world. So, that means that in the coming future, three quarters of the population growth in the globe is going to come here from the continent, which will result in a third of the population, the working age population being here in Africa in about 50 years in our lifetime. And that's a big deal. And that means that Africa is going to have a huge, huge levered effect on the entire world. This could really activate a ton of untapped human potential, like the ones that we've seen, by the way, in other regions over the last 50 years. But if that doesn't happen, and there's no productivity boom, and we just continue on the current path, there's a real chance that this is going to be destabilizing, not just for the continent, but the entire world. And just imagine, so many people on the continent, in the most critical age bracket, in a region, by the way, that's most impacted by climate change. We're in Nairobi right now. There's a climate disaster happening right now in Nairobi, but I'm talking about enough. There was one that was happening in Malawi not long ago.",
