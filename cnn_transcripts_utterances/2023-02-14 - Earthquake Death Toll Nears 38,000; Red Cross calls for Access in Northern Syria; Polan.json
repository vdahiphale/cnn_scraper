An annual conference where leaders across the business and political world gathered to discuss future trends in technology and in global finance more on that in a moment. First, our top story for you, new aid routes, new rescues, and sadly, a death toll climbing horrifically higher. That is the scene in Turkey and in Syria some eight days after what was a devastating earthquake. Remarkably, several people have been pulled out of the rubble alive today, including two women in Turkey and Hatay. Well in Syria, the UN says that President Bashar Al Assad has agreed to open two more aid lanes from Turkey into the opposition held northwest that is in addition to the - crossing and should help supplies reach just some of the millions who are in desperate need. Meantime, the number of dead now pass 37,000 and that is likely not a realistic number. It is likely that number could be significantly higher. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from Istanbul Nada?",

It's also expected to continue rising. But it is remarkable to see that we are still finding people alive beneath the rubble. Rescue groups have been working around the clock for the last eight days. And today, miraculous rescues it has to be said people been pulled out of the rubble more than 200 hours after the earthquake. So it is a significant feat. But those rescues the discovery of survivors is becoming few and far between. And of course the window for finding survivors is closing very, very quickly. And the focus now is now shifting from rescue effort to a recovery effort. And there is immediate emphasis and a sense of urgency when it comes to providing support for those survivors. We have seen a huge groundswell of support here in Turkey and indeed from the international community. When it comes to providing that vital humanitarian assistance here in Istanbul two aid centers have been set up. They've been sending those donations that humanitarian assistance onwards to Southeast Turkey. And of course, as you mentioned there, there is a real question of what aid is heading to Northwest Syria. The aid program here in Turkey is certainly far more robust than we've seen in Northwest Syria. The White Helmets there have been leading on the rescue effort. They gave up hope on finding survivors days ago. They have called on the UN for further support. The UN itself conceding that it has failed the people of Northwestern Syria without aid taking days to get across the border. But it does appear now that there are further two crossings in addition to the first - crossing from Turkey into Northwest Syria are now operational. Aid is getting through we have seen a UN mission visiting the affected region of Northwest Syria. And there are discussions ongoing, of course, to ensure that cross line transfer of aid from government territory from Damascus onwards to rebel-held territory does in fact happen. But of course, it does seem too little too late for those in Northwest Syria. And there is a real sense of abandonment, as we've heard described by the White Helmets. Here in Turkey of course, there is a sense of frustration, as well. There are growing calls for accountability over the earthquake. The government itself has now established an investigation more than 200 public prosecutors across 10 provinces in Southeastern Turkey now overseeing that investigation. More than a hundred people identified as potential suspects in relation to construction negligence over those now destroyed buildings in Southeast Turkey. We've already seen a number of arrests carried out as well. But there are questions as to whether the government could have done enough to prepare for a catastrophe of the scale? Whether the aid has been transferred quickly enough, but the real focus here in Turkey continues to be getting that aid to those in need as quickly as possible, Becky.",

And I do want to take just a second to explain that these objects probably unlike one of the commentators earlier in the show indicated that there's a pattern here. I do not think that there's a pattern here. What has happened is that the way that the radars work, they've opened up the aperture, they've taken off filters.

We don't know about what's happening, really at the Mumbai office as I speak to you, but he is talking about the controversy. A few weeks back there was a BBC documentary that aired, it was critical of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was also blocked in terms of public access to Indians here in the country. And it was called propaganda by the Indian government. They condemned the documentary they call it propaganda. Now, weeks later, we see these rates taking place. Now according to critics, their concern is that this is a crackdown on press freedom in India under the Modi leadership. This is not what just one person is saying but the opposition political parties here in India saying other local journalists and independent journalists are also saying. But today, earlier in the day, you had the BJP spokesperson, the BJP is the ruling National Party here in India, the spokesperson came out and he warned media houses to abide by the laws of the country.
