      "sentences": "A warm welcome to everyone watching us from around the world. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York.The Israeli Military now offering new clarity on their operation in Gaza, the IDF Chief of Staff sending a clear message to commanders that they will indeed enter Gaza when the time comes. We still don't know when that might be, however. Israeli officials say they're ramping up airstrikes on Gaza starting today, as more and more troops and vehicles gather near the border. Palestinian officials say the Israeli operation has now killed close to 4,400 people, and aid groups are warning that the humanitarian crisis grows increasingly untenable. 28 trucks entered Gaza today, the first such convoy to gain entry. But, the Rafah crossing they used to come and go was only open for that brief period. And Palestinian officials say that flow of aid is an urgent problem still in need of solving. Those groups say roughly 20 times that amount of food, water and medicine was entering Gaza every day before the war began. Salma Abdelaziz reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. Everything is running out, from surgical equipment to medicine, and the tiniest lives are left hanging in the balance. We need power. We need access to clean water, this doctor says. Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. Already, seven hospitals and 21 primary healthcare facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials, because of shortages. After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah border crossing, as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But, the 20 truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent to just three percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict. More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remains stalled on the Egyptian side, according to the UN, and every hour costs lives. And so far, no civilians can leave the enclave. 10-year-old Palestinian-American Aiden is among those trapped. AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN: And we had no place to go. All the streets are bombed. They're literally gone. How are we supposed to go out? How? It's all closed. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Even if people are allowed out, it will be a limited number, most likely only those with foreign passports, sealing some two million others, half of them children, into this hellscape. But, some refuse to go even if they could, fearing Israel intends to bomb and besiege them out of their homes, never to return. Even as Mahmood buries his children, he says he will keep fighting just to exist here. We will still be patient. As long as we are alive on this earth, we will be patient. He says, we will never leave this land. After the October 7 terror attacks when Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in a brutal surprise incursion, Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas. But, with hundreds of airstrikes pounding the densely populated enclave a day, innocent blood is being spilled. Innocent children were struck down while they were sleeping. This woman shouts, what did they do? Did they carry weapons? These are innocent children who know nothing. Tell us when will this end? There are calls for a ceasefire to get civilians out of the war zone and allow more aid into Gaza. But, the pleas fall on deaf ears so far. Israel is preparing for the next phase of its operations, a potential ground incursion that can only bring more suffering. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They cannot get locally. They need to be transferred out for urgent medical treatment as well. Hundreds of injured children in Gaza right now are waiting for transfer out for medical treatment. Many of them are going to die if they don't get that transfer out. So, it's not just aid coming in. It's also the humanitarian opportunity for people to get out of Gaza.",

Tens of thousands of Israeli troops are already at the Gaza border. They've been gathering there for two weeks now ever since the Hamas terror attack. The IDF says the ground operation will be aimed at destroying Hamas operatives and infrastructure. I spoke last hour to IDF International Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus. I asked him if the IDF strikes were ramping up. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, SPOKESPERSON, IDF INTERNATIONAL: I'm not quite sure that we have increased. I think the tempo of operations is rather steady. We continue to hunt Hamas commanders. They continue to hide behind civilians in tunnels and in civilian houses using civilian infrastructure. They continue to fire rockets from civilian areas towards Israeli civilians. And they continue to abuse everything humanitarian. Our operation continues. We are preparing also for the next stage of operations. And as we do, we are focused on weakening Hamas's military capabilities for our next stage of operations.",

And not only him, but we have heard from a number of IDF generals as well as politicians here in Israel, all of them making very clear now that a ground operation is going to happen, that they will be going into Gaza for the first days, perhaps even the first week, after that Hamas terrorist attack. They were kind of walking around the issue of whether or not there would be a ground invasion, talking in kind of broad and general terms. But, this evening, what we're hearing from the Chief of the General Staff of the IDF is we will enter the Gaza Strip, that kind of explicit language, and also making clear that the goal of this ground operation will be to entirely destroy Hamas operatives and infrastructure.Now, what exactly that looks like and when exactly this operation will begin, still remains an open question. But, I can tell you that right here on the ground, as we were driving along the border with the Gaza Strip, what we saw is a significant presence not only of infantry troops, but also of armored vehicles, armored personnel carriers, tanks, and those D9 bulldozers which the IDF uses to clear the roads of IEDs and other obstacles before they go in with their ground forces. We saw not one, not two, but four different groupings, each of which included dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers all very close to the Gaza border. Now, does that mean that an invasion could start in a matter of hours, in a matter of days? It remains unclear. But, certainly what we saw were forces that were coming in, troops that were being bused into these locations. And when you combine that with the language that we're hearing increasingly clear, increasingly unequivocal from the IDF's generals and spokespeople, I think we can all draw the same conclusions.",

We want the resistance to liberate Palestine, (inaudible) Muhammad tells me. Words in slogans like these are not new. Yet, as the death toll in Gaza soars, passions are reaching the boiling point. Earlier this week, twice, protesters north of Beirut tried to reach the American Embassy, stopped only by riot Police firing tear gas and water cannon. In Egypt, a rare unauthorized demonstration demands Arab regimes act to stop Israel's war on Hamas and Gaza. In Jordan, a country where many trace their roots back to historic Palestine, they call on the government to shut the American and Israeli embassies. But, in Lebanon, it's not only protests on the border with Israel. It's just a notch below war. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

Notably silent is Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah who hasn't uttered a word since the war began. I asked Hezbollah Parliament member Ali Ammar if his group is ready to go to war with Israel. The answer to that will come later, he replies. The daily Hezbollah attacks on the border are a hint of what that answer could be. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHATTERLEY: And thousands marched in support to the Palestinians outside the region too. Here is a look at some of the rallies held. On Saturday, in Spain, crowds called for immediate ceasefire, the same call repeated in London. An estimated 100,000 people took part in that March, which went past the British Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. Rallies took place in several cities across Germany and in the Australian capital too. And as you can see, also in Washington, D.C. They all appeared to be peaceful, with no reports of violence. Now, as Israel's battle with Hamas continues, foreigners stranded inside Israel and Gaza are fighting to escape the war zone and return to safety, a look at the challenges of getting home for those at least who can, next on CNN.
