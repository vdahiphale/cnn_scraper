Ukraine pushing Russia back from a key city. We're going to go to the front lines tonight.And DeSantis tonight picking up nearly 40 new endorsements. I'm going to talk to one GOP donor who just met with him. Will he back him over Trump or not? And new details tonight about the Utah mother who wrote a children's book grieving her husband, is now charged with his murder. The attorney for the victim's family is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russians on the run. Just look at these dramatic new pictures. Literally, they're running. This is near Bakhmut. You're looking at what appeared to be Russian forces retreating. These are about a dozen or so as they're just running along that wooded area scrambling to safety. They're being attacked in this video from above. As I said, they are near the key city of Bakhmut. That's where Putin, of course, is essentially focused his entire force for more than eight months and now you see a hasty retreat like this. We also have video of Russian heavily armored vehicles pulling out of the area. In fact, the head of Russia's private army, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is openly claiming that Putin's forces are losing ground, right? It's not just the video. You have Prigozhin saying it. And he's tearing into Putin's generals to blame them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER GROUP CHIEF (through translator): The flanks are crumbling and the front line is failing. And the defense ministry's attempts to smooth over the situation somehow in the media space are leading and will lead to a global tragedy for Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it's pretty incredible to understand what's going on here. In a moment, we're going to take you to those front lines because this is all coming as there are more signs Ukrainian's highly anticipated counteroffensive is about to begin.Today, massive explosions rocking the Russian occupied city of Luhansk. These pictures here are just after the strike. You see the thick black smoke billowing over Luhansk. Keep in mind, this is a city that has not been under attack really at all over the past year. It's been occupied by Russia, and it has been solidly occupied by Russia and it has been too far for Ukraine to strike, which is one of the reasons why this strike is significant. First, what it hit in Luhansk, it hit an important hub for Russia's military operation. And, secondly, it is not on the front line, so it could be Ukraine showing off newly acquired missiles with a longer range. The missiles, we understand, may have been launched from the Kramatorsk area, which would mean they traveled about 80 miles. Just to be very clear, that is a bigger range than any range than any U.S. missiles that Ukraine has. But it is within the range of the so- called Storm Shadow missiles that the United Kingdom just says it's going to send to Ukraine. Those missiles can go up to 155 miles. So if they're already in Ukrainian hands, right, it's not just announcement they're going, they're there, they're ready, they're trained, they're using them, if that is true, that puts all of Russia's occupied areas within striking distance now. That includes Crimea, where Russia, of course, has dozens of military facilities. The Russian Black Sea fleet, training grounds, fuel stations, ammunition depots apparently and even radar for air defense systems, a massive military area, a red line for Putin now in striking range. And this strike in Luhansk coming as we're also learning of another strike in the Russian occupied area in the city of Melitopol, the blast taking out power to a number of neighborhoods. Nic Robertson is OUTFRONT live in Eastern Ukraine tonight, along those front lines. And, Nic, what is the latest on the ground where you are?",

He -- so after Brittney Griner was swapped for Viktor Bout, Putin got a taste for the value of hostages. So they took a \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter that's high- value hostage-taking. So Putin wants to do one of these deals. But he wants to humiliate us with one of these deals. He wants to get unreasonable terms for these deals.
