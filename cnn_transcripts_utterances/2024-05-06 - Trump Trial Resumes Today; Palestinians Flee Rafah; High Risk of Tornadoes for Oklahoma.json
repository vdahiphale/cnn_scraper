The Israeli military telling civilians to evacuate immediately as ceasefire talks have stalled. And the Biden administration saying that is all on Hamas. And a tragedy is playing out in Texas. Horrible flooding that we are watching and news that a little boy is now dead after being swept away from his parents who were trying to get to safety.

      "sentences": "Donald Trump just left Trump Tower for court as his criminal hush money trial resumes in less than 30 minutes. The big question today, who will take the stand? Among the most notable witnesses who may be called, his former fixer and attorney, Michael Cohen, adult film star Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal.On Friday, Hope Hicks, who was one of Trump's closest and most trusted former aides, took the stand. She had dramatic testimony, briefly coming to a stop at one point when she began to cry during cross- examination. Over the weekend, Trump hosted donors and potential vice presidential picks at the Republican National Committee's spring retreat. He also ramped up his attacks. Several attendees telling CNN he accused Democrats of running a gestapo administration. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside court and Kristen Holmes is in Washington. Brynn, we're going to begin with you. Do we now know, or is there any clue, as to who the next witness might be?",

      "sentences": "No, unfortunately not, Sara. But we will know in 30 minutes when court gets started. As you just said, the former president making his way down here to lower Manhattan for what will be the fourth week of this trial.And like you said, there's some big witnesses left on the prosecution's roster, Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal. Unclear who will be called next. But what is clear is that we are getting closer and closer to the prosecution sort of making its case about whether or not Trump knew about these hush money payments prior to the 2016 election, and did it to influence that election. And that's what we saw a little bit of help from Hope Hicks when she took the stand, the former president's former spokesperson, who really played it out for the prosecution that Trump had an idea about that hush money payment. They got her to acknowledge that in 2018 when a \"Wall Street Journal\" article came out about that, that Trump told her that it was better that article was coming out then before the 2020 election, sort of signaling that he did have some idea about this. She kind of also talked about Michael Cohen and how Michael Cohen made that payment and she knew that and she doesn't believe he would have done that out of the kindness of his own heart is how she said it on the stand, saying, \"I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.\" And then when it was time for cross-examination, as you stated, Sara, she got a bit emotional before the questioning even got started. She had to take a break from the witness box before they could resume. And in that questioning she acknowledged for the defense that Trump was, you know, he's a family man, she said, that he never really wanted to embarrass his family with this campaign, that he valued Melania Trump's opinion. Kind of painting a picture of this former president, who maybe took action not because of an election, but rather for the sake of his family. And she also took some jabs at Michael Cohen, who again will be one of the prosecution's star witnesses. So, we will see how this court is going to play out today and into this week. This is really the first time in a little while that we've had a full week of testimony in this trial. So, it's going to be an eventful week. Again, a lot of people still waiting to be called to the witness box. Sara.",

This morning, before 9But 100,000 people currently live in that part of eastern Rafah that is being evacuated. And there are major questions at this stage about whether or not that humanitarian zone has sufficient shelter, food, and medicine for the number of individuals who are being directed to go there. Concerns being raised by humanitarian aid official about the adequacy of that area, but also concerns that wide-scale panic could be spreading in Rafah with people outside of that immediate eastern Rafah evacuation zone also beginning to head north. We've already started to see people who did not receive those leaflets beginning to flee north out of concern for what may come next. There's no question that there is major fear and anxiety in Rafah at the moment as the Israeli military says that it is carrying out a limited scale operation, but one that make no question it is certainly setting the stage for Israeli tanks and troops to begin going into Rafah. How quickly that could happen is still an open question. Whether it is a matter of hours, days, or weeks, the Israeli military simply will not say at this stage. But there's no question that it is all happening because of the state of those ceasefire negotiations. There had been considerable optimism this weekend that perhaps Egypt - this Egyptian framework, Hamas and Israel could perhaps agree to it. But now two Israeli sources telling me that these talks are at a standstill over Hamas' demand to end the war altogether as part of these talks. Something that the Israeli prime minister has said he simply will not agree to. John.",

It's identified the parameters, the location that they're most concerned about.And anywhere you see this color coding here, this is the severe weather threat. But we're really going to focus in on central and southern Kansas, through Oklahoma. To put this into context, this is a level five of five, the highest risk of severe weather threat that the storm prediction center does issue. And it has been five years since Oklahoma has been included within this. It's been seven years since Kansas has been included in this. The last time a high-level risk was issued was over a year ago. So, this is really saying something. I don't want to mince words today, but this is one of those days you want to have a safe place for a tornado shelter, perhaps underground, have a helmet available if you live along this I-35 corridor, perhaps I-40 as well, right through Oklahoma City. This is really ground zero for wording from the Storm Prediction Center, intense, long track tornados, very large, to giant- sized hail. That means the potential for baseball to softball-sized hail falling from in the sky, and damaging winds in excess of 80 miles per hour. The timeframe, 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. this evening, but nocturnal tornadoes are still possible. That means tornadoes after sunset. They're twice as dangerous and twice as lethal. Kate.",

The mother of that child speaking to NBC DFW, sharing that the boy's name is Lucas Warren (ph). He's four-years-old. And this mom described the conditions. In essence they were driving through a storm. That were headed back home. And they were driving through a road that normally floods, but this mom says that there was no barricades so they kept on driving. But then their battery died from their vehicle. Water started going into their vehicle and this couple decided to get out of the vehicle with their son to try to get to safety. And then the mom told NBC DFW the following, quote, \"and the current came up really high and just let go. And I didn't hear anything from him. I think he just went under.And she went on to tell NBC DFW that rescuers arrived soon thereafter but, of course, it was too late. They recovered the body of this little boy hours later. And, Kate, that tragedy happened near Dallas. I'm in Harris County, which is near Houston, and it's the same storm system. It just gives you an idea of the magnitude of this storm and how people across this state are dealing with that flooding. We hopped on an air boat with the Harris County Sheriff's Office yesterday, and take a look at this video. Look at the water levels. And you can see that are - stop signs were at eye level while we were on this air boat. And first responders talked to us about some of the challenges they face when they try to rescue people and convince them to go to higher ground. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEPUTY DARRELL BAILEY, HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: We can tell them that we're primarily have is, it's just the elements that represent (ph) the warning, because you don't know what's in the water. Whether it's ants, whether it's snakes, whether it's - whether it's spiders. That's going to be the biggest challenge.

      "sentences": "So, a couple of things. Let's remind everyone that the reason we don't know the next witnesses is because the prosecution does not trust the release of the information because Donald Trump may tweet about them. In a normal set of circumstances, right, prosecutors really cooperate with the defense and they tell you who they're going to call. So, the reason we're having the guest conversation is because of the gag order and the inability, right, of the president to follow it.To the specifics of your question, I think Stormy Daniels, is she an essential witness? I don't think so. Now, having said that, I think not bringing her would be the glaring discrepancy. She's been talked about so much. You don't bring Stormy Daniels? Why not, right? Now, she just knows that she had, of course, the story, of course backing up the affair. That's number one, right? Not critical here. Only critical in as much as she was going to out him as it related to the affair. She knows, of course, the $130,000 payment. She knows who she dealt with. So, I think she lays some very firm foundations. Will she bury ultimately the president? No. Because you have to believe, at the end of the day, that there's this connection between Trump and the payout, right? And, of course, the defense is trying very hard to say, this is Michael Cohen gone amuck. He's rogue. He's out there doing it for his boss out of fealty. But I think she gives you a piece that's very important. And I think the jury wants to hear from her and, for symmetrical purposes, I think it's important.",

You don't have to like them, but let us tell you why you should believe them. That's why they're setting up all these witness who are corroborating Michael Cohen in advance, so that when he gets on the stand and says, I did this, a jury says, oh, yes, we already heard about that from some other people.So, you know, prosecutors, I think, are not concerned about the dislike-ability, if you will, of Michael Cohen.
