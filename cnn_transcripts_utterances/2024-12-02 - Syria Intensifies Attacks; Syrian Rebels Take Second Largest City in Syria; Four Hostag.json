Just a warning of the video you're about to watch is graphic.Unbelievable. New pictures also appear to show rebel fighters with tanks that were abandoned by Syrian forces. Retired General Wesley Clark joins us now. He's the former NATO supreme allied commander. General Clark, what are your thoughts on what looks like just a tinderbox in Syria right now? What's next, do you think? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER:  So, I think we're going to see continued back and forth struggle between the Turkish-backed forces and the Syrian forces. I think Russia will weigh in increasingly. Russia can't afford to lose Bashar Assad as an ally. It can't afford to lose its footprint in the region. And Russia is going to commit additional resources there. Turkey wants to end this with a little more terrain in Northwest Syria and greater credibility. So, I think this is going to go on for a while.",
