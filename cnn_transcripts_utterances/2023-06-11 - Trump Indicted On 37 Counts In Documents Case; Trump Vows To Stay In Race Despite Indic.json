And Jim Jordan is just sort of almost robotically repeating the talking points that he planned to come in with.JONAH GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DISPATCH: Yes. I mean, I got to say, bless your heart for thinking that Donald Trump has a sense of shame. That's really sweet. I think he's a little embarrassed by it. And I think, look, it's obvious, he spent his entire life the way, you know, tearing up pieces of paper, not using e-mail, speaking in euphemisms, because he's always had this sort of mobster wannabe kind of attitude. Roy Cohn was his big mentor. He's always done things that gave him plausible deniability. And he spent his entire life trying to avoid essentially get indicted. So of course, he doesn't want to be indicted. And but I think that, you know, the problem the Republicans have in this situation is that if you watched Lindsey Graham on ABC this morning, two seconds after the conversation starts, the first words out of his mouth are Hillary Clinton. And at least Jim Jordan, in a weird way, is actually trying to defend Trump on the merits of the indictment, on the merits of the accusation. The problem is, is that, as we saw Bill Barr say this morning, the indictments are really solid. And so ultimately, the only place they can go is to politics. PHILLIP: But partisanship is a hell of a drug. And at the ABC News/Ipsos poll, just out this morning, they were in the field right after the indictment happened on Friday and on Saturday. This is -- do you think the charges in this indictment are serious? All Americans say 61 percent, yes. Republicans, 38 percent. Those are the numbers that Donald Trump -- I mean, he doesn't even have to look at them. He knows them because he knows his base. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Two things can exist at the same time. One being that this indictment paints a damning portrayal of the former president and what you did with those documents. And then also that his Republican allies are not interested in engaging with it, or are not interested in being moved by it in a way. There's also another strategy that you've seen already, since this was released and your propaganda see in the weeks to come of filling sort of the void of voices, you're filling this void of information with attacks against the Justice Department to paint it as partisan, to paint this investigation as partisan as well. Even though you're seeing Republicans not move to criticize Trump here, you are going to see them continue to talk about this and paint the Justice Department as one [inaudible]",

You know, people haven't talked about on the press a lot, but Nixon's fat at the time of Watergate. The guy that Donald Trump admired the most in America is Roy Cohn, who had four indictment charges. He ended up beating three of the four raps. You know, one was a mistrial. Trump learned everything from Roy Cohn, which is to delay, stall, obfuscate. Roy Cohn denounced the IRS as being like a Soviet SWAT team or like a Nazi operation. And you see Trump and his followers demonizing the FBI, the Department of Justice, in a similar fashion.
