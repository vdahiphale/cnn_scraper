The country's interior minister says four people are missing. NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels for a two-day meeting at the Ukraine defense contact group. It comes just after NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg announced that the military bloc would take over the coordination of arms deliveries from the United States to Ukraine. He says he expects the defense ministers to approve that plan. Stoltenberg also wrapped up a visit with the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Budapest. Mr. Orban says that his country would not block NATO's decisions on giving support to Ukraine.

Ukraine is giving some of its prisoners a second chance by allowing them to join the military to redeem for their crimes.

And of course, not so much the economic crisis, because things are going little better. Inflation is now receding but at the same time that was this problem of migration, Gaza and kind of dominating the campaign.The result could be read differently, of course, as I certainly push for the far right. At the same time, the majority that made the Green Deal is still there. And if you look at what the center right, the center, the Socialists and Democrats, the liberals and the greens, they -- whoever is the President of the Commission, he has to work with that majority. All of them finally committed to continue the Green Deal. The big issue in reality, is that on one side, all the laws, you know, the regulation at the center in the well, at the Brussels level, have been decided already. So, the problem is now implementation. But so now the big thing will be what happened in the countries. And then, of course, we can -- there are little -- very mixed picture. If France and Germany have seen a big push and Italy turn out for the right -- for the far right, you see that the northern countries, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, but as well in Hungary, in Poland, as much and Spain in particular, have seen a good resistance as a contrary, a push back against a far right. So, that will be interesting to see. Finally, we will win. When we have to remember that 77 percent of the European citizens are very concerned about climate change. So, I think now, in a way, when the big decision will be made about who will lead the European Commission, the parliament's roles, et cetera, we will see a big discussion between, of course, a push from the far right and in reality, push from many goods in many countries to continue and to implement the Green Deal at home. And just one note we have to remember. Anyway, if Europe wants to keep its role at global level, you know, when China has invested so much in renewable energy, electric vehicle, batteries, et cetera. There is no much choice for the competitiveness which was a center issue in the European campaign than to continue and implement release a Green Deal for real.

Now, most of all countries have a climate plan. Now we have to accelerate and we need that's true global leadership. And probably the problem is the destruction of many, many leaders that are concerned about, of course, the world geopolitics, when in reality, of course, climate ignores its geopolitics anyway.So, there is a disconnect between whether people feel the anxiety, the problem of impact, and the reaction of the government. And that's why I think the role now to really accelerate the implementation of Paris Agreement is the role of the business sector, the local authorities that are not losing the direction of travel. But really, we can say -- but at the same time, never before, and even before Paris, the climate has been present so much in G7 and G20 discussion. So, I see that we have seen in a shift. There is a big discussion about how this is connected and supporting the development economic policies, but -- and then so the -- there is a minority at what level, of course, look at Malay, for example, in Argentina, that are saying that this is not a problem but I think that's now a given because of the severity of impact. So, I see -- we will see a different coalition around different measures in Europe but certainly elsewhere. I don't think, for example, if the election in U.S. change the majority, I don't think that the IRA, for example, will be dismantled, because it just makes sense.

And then of course, vowing to take countermeasures to protect their interests and industries.But unlike the U.S.' 100 percent tariffs on the Chinese EV announced by President Biden just last month, this one may actually have a real impact because Chinese EVs have almost no presence in the U.S. market, but they have 20 percent market share in the EU, including both Chinese brands, but also European brands and even Tesla making cars here and then selling them in the EU. And lot of European economies and their auto industries are actually much more entwined with the Chinese EV industry compared to their U.S. counterparts. Germany, for example, their auto suppliers that are big names have a huge presence here, not only selling cars and parts, but also making EVs here cheaply and efficiently before exporting them back to their home markets. So, that's why the Europeans have a lot more concerns and say, a lot more fearful of potential Chinese retaliations. That's why we have heard German Chancellor Scholz and the likes of Volkswagen coming out publicly to oppose these new tariffs that, obviously, plays well into the Chinese playbook of divide and conquer in dealing with the EU. But the bigger question here is, are these new tariffs even going to be effective given the amazingly low-cost base Chinese EV makers enjoy. Byd, for example, the biggest name, facing a new tariff of 17 percent, but a lot of experts say that's not going to affect their ability to have a comfortable profit margin in the EU. It has to be something like 50 percent to make a difference. So that's why, Lynda, all eyes on Beijing to see what they would do next after months of threats. They may have to do something if this decision becomes final, but they also may want to exercise some restraint given that very complex and nuanced picture in the EU. Lynda?",
