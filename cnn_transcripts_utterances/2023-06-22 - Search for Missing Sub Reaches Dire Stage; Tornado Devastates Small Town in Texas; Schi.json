This morning, the continuing search for that missing sub near the Titanic shipwreck really is entering a dire stage this morning. At this point, it is feared that the five people onboard may have little to no breathable air left. But more banging sounds were detected yesterday. The Coast Guard, though, has not been able to find exactly where they're coming from or determine if they are even from this submersible. This is video of the Canadian surveillance plane that has been dropping those sonar probes into the ocean and listening for any signs of the sub. More ships with that equipment have been racing to join the search as the window for survival is closing. That includes this ship The Horizon Arctic, which has located -- which was loaded, I should say, with a U.S. military remotely-operated vehicle. The U.S. Navy's deep-sea salvage system has also arrived in Newfoundland. It can retrieve objects even deeper than the Titanic. But it's just not clear when it will reach the search area. Also this new overnight: OceanGate and its CEO, who is now missing on the Titan submersible, are coming under more scrutiny. A former subcontractor who helped develop the sub says the construction materials and design choices were considered controversial and experimental. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and especially now given all that's happened, Poppy, I will say that this is a submersible --Stockton Rush said that, look, there were a lot of redundancies. And that's what you want built into a system like this. One of the ones that he had built in there was the capacity to actually rise to the surface. What they've got on their hands today, Poppy, is the best shot yet of either finding the submersible or being able to understand what those noises are all about.

He sued for wrongful termination. The other resigned. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and OceanGate says it conducted further testing on the sub. (END VIDEOTAPE) NEWTON (on camera): You know, CNN has continually reached out to OceanGate Expeditions to get more information on that. Obviously, everyone is hoping that the integrity of this submersible will last and be able to help those five passengers survive. I want to point out a couple things, Poppy. Those noises, right, that was from a Canadian surveillance aircraft that takes off about an hour and a half from here at Canadian Forces Base Greenwood. They started to hear those noises as early as Tuesday, and that is what gave them a lot of hope for them to continually run that surveillance. As I said, a lot more help out of the scene now, as well for them to hopefully move from what the U.S. Navy says are noises that are inconclusive and move to something more concrete, right, to give them more of an opportunity to find out what the noises are and hopefully launch more of a rescue -- Poppy.",

There's no longer light.Further down, at 5,200 feet, there isn't much marine life at all. Most animals can't even survive at those depths. Ten thousand feet below the surface is the deepest a sperm whale can dive. The average depth of the ocean is a little more than 12,000 feet, and that's about where the Titanic shipwreck is. That's 2.4 miles below the water's surface. Let's bring in oceanographer and deep-sea explorer David Gallo. You saw him in the piece just now. He's a senior adviser for strategic initiatives for RMS Titanic Incorporated, which owns the exclusive salvage rights to the Titanic wreck site. And David, you were mentioning in the piece: full-speed, everything you possibly can, resources wise, to try and find and then start a rescue operation here.

And so I think that, you know, it was a norm of the institution that they didn't do this very much. But once that norm has changed and once you have this extreme acrimony there. And then also, you know, Adam Schiff has been particularly driving Republicans crazy. A lot of them, I thin, really think that he has been leaking stuff to the media through this process. And so I think that, you know, it was an expression of that animosity. But it really doesn't go beyond that. There's no material consequences for Adam Schiff. I mean, they already removed him from the Intelligence Committee. But it doesn't have any force --",

So that's pretty long ago history, those one-term majorities.But I think, you know, when you ask about it being indicative of how the House is spending its time, we have a divided Congress, and there's a Democratic president. So they needed to raise the debt limit. They will need to pass government funding bills sometime, probably before the end of the calendar year. Technically, the fiscal year will run out at the end of September. But other than that, there isn't a really large, robust policy agenda to actually be passed through both houses of Congress and be enacted. The Senate has lots of nominations to act on. It can -- it can confirm judges and members of the cabinet and that sort of thing. The House sort of has a lot of time that it can't really do very much with, other than political messaging. And so Republicans are deciding among passing pieces of legislation that won't become law. or passing statements like this censure that don't have the force of law. And so I think partly, you know, why -- why they spend time on this is that their opportunity cost is not that high.

And there's a fairly high likelihood that you'll have a general election in California between two Democrats. Quite possibly between Adam Schiff and Katie Porter, congressman for Orange County.And Katie Porter is clearly to the left of Adam Schiff substantively on policy issues. But you have -- I mean, when Dianne Feinstein was last reelected in 2018, she was running against a candidate to her left, but she was less -- that candidate was less familiar to Republicans than Feinstein herself. And he picked up a lot of Republican votes from people who were just trying to vote for not Dianne Feinstein, not the Democrat they'd heard of. So I think that you could have a really weird dynamic in an election in California where you could have a candidate run to Schiff's left, pick up a lot of progressive votes, and then also pick up some Republican votes from people who don't really know a lot about Katie Porter but just know that they hate Adam Schiff from all of this coverage. Now, I think what Schiff wants is he wants to run against a Republican in the general election. He might get that. But so I think that, in terms of the idea that this is going to make him a senator, I'm -- it's not clear to me that that's true. Although on the other hand, then maybe they've made Katie Porter a senator.

And Marjorie Taylor Greene has had a number of these resolutions drafted. And then Lauren Boebert had the idea I can bring this up as a privileged resolution, which allows her to force it to a floor vote, even if the speaker doesn't want to bring it for a floor vote. And Marjorie Taylor Greene was clearly mad that she hadn't thought of this first. Or, I think, maybe more likely, that Marjorie Taylor Greene wanted to be just so outrageous, but not quite this outrageous, because she actually has a real relationship with Republican leadership in a way that Boebert doesn't.
