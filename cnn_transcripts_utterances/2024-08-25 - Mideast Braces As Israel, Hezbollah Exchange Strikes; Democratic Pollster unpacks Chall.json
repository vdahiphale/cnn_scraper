In just two weeks, some voters in battleground North Carolina will begin receiving mail-in ballots. The next presidential debate is on September 10th. And before the end of next month, half a dozen worst dates will have kicked off in-person early voting. Now the big question. Will this race emerge in neck-to-neck slog across key battlegrounds? Or will Kamala Harris capitalize on her party star-studded convention last week and keep that momentum going? But first, there's some news from the Middle East this morning with Israel saying it launched preemptive strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hezbollah launching a barrage of rockets into Israel. And for more, we're joined by my colleague Jeremy Diamond, who is live in Haifa in Northern Israel. Jeremy, so tell us what happened overnight and about the concerns that may exist, about this spiraling into a larger regional conflict.",

Trying to head off, what they said, was an anticipated large- scale attack by Hezbollah against Israel. And then it was at about 5.30 A.M. that sirens began sounding across Northern Israel and the Golan Heights as Hezbollah fired hundreds of rockets and drones at targets in Northern Israel. The Israeli military says that that Hezbollah rocket attack caused, quote, little damage. The Israeli Prime Minister, for his part, says that all of the drones that were fired were indeed intercepted. Those, the Israeli military believes, were headed for strategic targets in Central Israel. So for now, at least, it appears that we are heading off the risk of a broader regional escalation, at least in the immediate future. Hezbollah, for its part, has said that at least for today, its attacks have concluded, although they have said that this was just the first phase of their response to the Israeli military's killing of their senior military commander about a month ago. In Israel, security restrictions that were imposed earlier in the day were lifted just several hours later. And the Israeli Prime Minister, though, warning that this is not the end of the story. So there still is, indeed, some uncertainty. And, of course, all of this is happening as those ceasefire negotiations are set to get back underway in Cairo, Egypt today. We know that an Israeli delegation has landed in Cairo, set to resume those negotiations, whether Hamas is actually engaging in those talks, still very much uncertain, as is the prospects of actually reaching a deal in those talks.

She needs to -- she needs, you know, those undecided voters who may not have initially been open to her candidacy to see her as a serious candidate who is presidential and who is ready to walk into that job. But I think for a lot of those voters, they are -- they may be open to her candidacy, but she hasn't necessarily sealed the deal. So I think Cleve is exactly right. It's those unscripted appearances that have the potential to either convince or put off those voters. And it's hearing more about these policy plans.

So we've seen this evolution among Democrats just trying to take Trump, the MAGA movement head-on. And I have to say, you know, there was that enthusiasm, but the Harris campaign is very aware that this hope, this feeling of hope and change that many Democrats were saying they felt from the Obama era has come back through Harris. They know that that doesn't necessarily move that -- those disaffected voters and those are the people that they're trying to turn out. And it's something -- it's part of their strategy to go to Southern Georgia, because it's interesting hearing them say, you know, we know we're going to lose some of these areas, but we want to lose less. And that is exactly what I hear from those very moderate swing district House Democrats in the midterms.

Just to look at the Pew Research poll that tested how county voters, how they have shifted over from July to August, 39 percent of Kennedy voters from July to August became Harris supporters. And it says actually should be 20 percent of Donald Trump's -- were Donald Trump supporters.

And that's why his vote chair went down so much when Joe Biden dropped out was because a lot of those third-party voters were people who didn't like Biden or Trump. But the feeling of a lot of Democrats that I spoke to at the convention, while this was all happening while we were hearing that RFK was in the process of getting ready to drop out, was that they didn't -- they weren't too worried about it, in part, because they see him as part of this weird narrative. They see him as sort of a coup, right? He's an anti-vaxxer with a brain worm who has supported all kinds of conspiracy theories.

Now, while several Democrats in swing Senate states races took the stage at the DNC last week, others stayed away, including Ohio's Sherrod Brown, Montana's Jon Tester, and purple state Democrat, Jacky Rosen of Nevada. And on the final day of the DNC, Tester even told reporters in Montana that he did not point to endorse a candidate for president at all. Now, in Chicago, I caught up with two top Senate Democrats, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the head of the Senate Democratic campaign arm, Gary Peters, to talk about what Harris means for their most difficult races.

He's running in Texas, another red state that Trump is almost certainly going to win. Although, of course, Democrats always talk about how they'd like to put it in play.

Number one, that he gets so many donations from being up there on the national stage and saying I'm running against Ted Cruz that it's worth whatever hit he takes from being associated with the top of the ticket.
