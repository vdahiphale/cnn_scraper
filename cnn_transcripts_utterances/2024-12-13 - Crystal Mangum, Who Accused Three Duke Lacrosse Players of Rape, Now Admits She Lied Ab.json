What we're learning about Travis Timmerman and the prison he says he was kept in for months. And later, President-elect Donald Trump rode anger over inflation to victory. And last month's election now a backpedal. He says it will be, quote, hard to bring down grocery prices. Hello. I'm Jim Acosta Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. And we begin this hour with breaking news with a first ever stunning admission from a woman who accused Duke University at lacrosse players of raping her nearly 20 years ago. The story was a national firestorm. She now says she lied about the encounter. Crystal Mangum first made the claims back in 2006, saying three members of the school's lacrosse team raped her after she had been hired to dance at a house party the team was throwing. Police charged David Evans, Collin Finnerty, and Reade Seligmann after Mangum's accusations. But after much back and forth in the city's D.A. stepping down from the case, North Carolina's attorney general later dismissed the charges, citing a lack of evidence. But now, hoing on the record on a podcast nearly 20 years later, Crystal Mangum says she was lying the whole time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I have been -- I started my show let'stalkwithkat.com, and I was looking for an interesting interview. In my circle people have talked about Krystal and there was so much mystery around it for me because it seemed like some people viewed her as a pariah and some people still viewed her as a victim.
