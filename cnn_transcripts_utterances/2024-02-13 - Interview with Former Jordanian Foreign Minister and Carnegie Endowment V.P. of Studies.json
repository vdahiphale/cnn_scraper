You just heard your King say, \"We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah.\" Do you think that will make any difference? MARWAN MUASHER, FORMER JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND V.P. OF STUDIES, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT:  Christiane, over a million Palestinians have been pushed from North Gaza into Rafah, which is on the border of Egypt, you know, in Southern Gaza. Any attack on Rafah is going to result in hundreds of thousands of Palestinians probably trying to flee into Egypt. We talk about a credible plan to prevent that from happening. But frankly, I don't see any plan that can be credible in preventing these people. They have nowhere to go. They cannot go back into their homes. And their homes are gone in Northern Gaza. But they cannot even go back to the area because Israel is preventing them from doing so. They have nowhere to go.",

Although, as you rightly say, many of his far-right coalition partners have said different things. Egypt and Jordan stood up very, very forcefully at the beginning of the war, saying that they would not accept Palestinians being forced out of either side. Do you think you can still hold the line?

And remember, every Palestinian that left in 1948 was not allowed to return by Israel despite the presence of U.N. resolutions to the contrary. And so, you either let them in and help, you know, empty Palestinian land of its inhabitants or you don't let them in and you are faced with a huge humanitarian problem. That's the kind of scenario that both Egypt and Jordan want to guard against. And I think the two countries have successfully, at least, brought attention to the issue of mass transfer to the International Community, so that today the International Community is standing firm against mass transfer in a way that that it did not before. That does not mean that Netanyahu is not going to try to affect that. And it is clear today that while the United States is pushing Netanyahu not to go into Rafah without a credible plan, as President Biden said, that Netanyahu has no intention of heeding the advice of the Americans. He wants to stay in power. He wants revenge.

But President Biden has himself said that what Israel is doing in Gaza is over the top. Well, it is going to still be over the top if the United States keeps sending arms to Israel in what has become clearly mass killing. You know, Israel has said that it is defending itself but there is no international law that defends collective killing of innocent civilians, none. And I don't think that there should be any, you know, basic -- there's no basic humanity in allowing the killings of people in such a manner.

We have not talked enough about people like Ben- Gurion, people like Smotrich, who are members of the Israeli cabinet openly and publicly calling for the expulsion of all Palestinians from their land. That, to me, is an equally radical, if not more radical position than the position of Hamas. What we need is to offer Palestinians a political horizon so that they, you know, have hope that they can live in peace and security. And in the end, Hamas, which, you know, is deemed a terrorist organization by many countries in the world, let's remember that the IRA in Ireland was also deemed a terrorist organization by many members of the International Community. In the end, when there is a political process, these forces become political forces rather than military ones. This the natural evolution of things.

They have said that about excluding Palestinians, et cetera. But Hamas has said the same thing. I guess I'm trying to get at -- where -- about Israelis, right?

If the International Community does not credibly launch a political process that ends the occupation and establish a state, then I'm afraid the alternative is going to be more violence on both sides for a sustained period of time.

And it was a place that worked very well for my middle-class white family, largely in the public schools. I got a lot of opportunities. And, you know, in some ways, it's not hard to trace my career as a journalist back to my experience in the public schools in Penn Hills. When I was in third grade, for example, I was the kind of kid who used to, you know, get bored and I would draw on my desk. And my teacher, instead of punishing me, she brought in her typewriter from home and said, Ben, when you get bored, you work on this typewriter. And so, I actually started a class newspaper up to date with room 38. And so, that was my first journalism job. And you can kind of see how things progressed from there. But when I left in 1994, I really didn't look back. I thought the real world was happening somewhere else. And I spent much of my career as an education journalist covering big cities and rural areas. And then in 2015 and '16, all of these headlines started coming out of Penn Hills. Somehow this community and school system that had worked so well for my white family had somehow run up a $172 million debt. They were laying off teachers. They were slashing programs and services. Property taxes were going up, and home values were stagnating. So, you could really see how this dream was eroding almost in real-time, and it was overlaid with this demographic shift. So, the Penn Hills public schools were 72 percent white when I graduated. By the time all of this bad news started happening, it was six -- the school system was 63 percent black. And so, it really made me realize, oh, wait. All of these opportunities and benefits that my family and me personally received a generation ago were really being paid for by the families who live there now. And I was very curious if that was something that was happening just in my hometown or if it was happening elsewhere. And what I learned is this a cycle that's common in suburban areas all over the country.",

And so, there's -- you know, there's always been this mythology that the suburbs are the place where we can go to escape our problems, to escape the past, to escape our racial sins as a nation, to escape the people that we want to leave behind, that we don't want to share resources with, that we don't want to share tax dollars with, that we don't want to share schools and neighborhoods with. And it's fundamentally racialized from the beginning. The idea from the federal government was essentially subsidizing through cheap mortgage loans, through developer guarantees, many of which required segregation, you know, essentially setting up these communities to, by design, be racially and economically exclusive.

And I'll give you an example of a story. So, I -- one of the families I got to know and spent several years following along with, they're named the Robinsons. They're a middle-class professional black family in the suburbs of Atlanta. And so, you know, we have multiple advanced degrees. Mom's working on a PhD. Dad's a former teacher and a network engineer. They're incredibly invested in their kids' education. Very much what you're describing. They bought the nice house, in the nice neighborhood, attached to the nice school, and kind of felt like, OK, we're buying into this dream. We're doing what we're supposed to do. And it kind of worked out OK for a while. Until their oldest son, who's a black boy named Corey (ph), starts middle school. And then all of a sudden, his physicality, his personality, his way of communicating, his -- like the way he interacts with his friends, all of that starts to become a problem in a way that gets starts getting punished very directly. And so, the parents, you know, they're very involved. They say, OK, we're going to nip this in the bud. We're going to go up and talk to the school system, say, we want to be partners with you. We're in this together to, you know, hold our son accountable for what he's done wrong. Make sure he can improve, you know, corrected and move on. And so, what happens is when they decide to go to that meeting, the mother and father say -- you know, they're very intentional and strategic. And they said, we're going to invite also his grandparents, his minister, his coach, his mentor and some of his adult friends. And for them, the idea is, we're coming here to show you that we're a good family, that there's a lot of support for our child, and there's a lot of resources that we have that you can tap into.

And mom says, I see what you're doing. You're trying to document my child to death so you can send him out. And I know what you're doing because I'm in management too. I've done it myself. And so, there's this moment of trying to say, see us for who we are. And like you're saying, recognize the gifts and the resources that we bring so we can work together. And there's just this constant mismatch around that. And you see it in these micro interactions and you also see it at a school board level. So, in that county, you know, Gwinnett County outside of Atlanta, was 90 percent white and as recently as 1990.

And that is a -- it's deeply rooted and it's a big problem. That's part of why we're so bad at talking about what's happening in suburbia now. But what I did see when I traveled the country and got to know these five families and spent time in the communities and school districts, is that every suburban community that I went to, there were groups of parents who were working on these issues. And sometimes that might be, hey, we need to get the dress code right at the school, because I'm not going to let my kid get in trouble for wearing braids. In some places it might be, hey, we need a school board that looks like us. In some places it might be, we need to repair the sewer system.

And that is the one that is to be subsidized and supported by shared resources, right? I'm just interested in if your reporting indicates a way out of that binary, what seems to be a binary. And frankly, a sense of entitlement on the part of some that other people -- that they don't believe other people have, right?",

And I had a very difficult set of conversations with my father, for example. And he told me at one point, you know, kind of explaining the condition that he had left the house in. You know, I just didn't want -- I wasn't interested in being a good community person. And that was part of how I grew up, and part of what I had to unlearn in order to write the book, and it really showed up most directly in my relationship with Bethany Smith, who's the African American mom who bought the house three doors down from my home -- my childhood home in Pittsburgh in 2018, and found herself all of a sudden confronted not with this generous social contract, but with all of the burdens that had been left behind. And so, when we would talk about this stuff, you know, we would -- you know, the relationship evolves over months and we would talk and it became very personal. And at one point, Bethany said exactly what you're saying to me. She said, I'm very uncomfortable with this, with this idea of you as a white man coming in to tell this story and take it away and tell it for your own purposes. And she was exactly right. It was a repetition of that pattern. And so, once I knew that pattern and what it was, I was able to understand the accuracy of what she was saying and we reconfigured the way we work together. And she actually ended up writing the epilogue to the book in her own voice, and in some ways, you know, kind of putting her own perspective on these dynamics. It was different from mine, but it adds something that is incredibly powerful. And for me, the root of that part of what was so powerful was that I learned to not only see my own experiences in a different way by considering them side by side with others, my own experiences as a white middle-class suburban child by comparing them with others, but also began to understand there are other ways to dream about a community and what it can be, that there are ways to have, you know, a notion of community that is about intergenerational contract, that is about making sure you leave behind something that is good for who is going to follow. And that was something -- it's not how I grew up. And I had to unlearn a lot of what I grew up with and learn something new. And we do that by allowing ourselves to hear these conversations and stories from other people. Not everyone's willing to do that, but a lot of people are.",
