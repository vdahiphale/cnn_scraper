It says this is in retaliation for a recent attack. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for that attack but it said that missile launch was in response to an earlier Israeli airstrike. The Iron Dome defense system intercepted some of the missiles that had targeted Israel. This morning, Louisiana is now the fourth state in the United States to allow executions using nitrogen gas. The governor signed it into law. Before this, only lethal injection could be used. And this is all happening after Alabama carried out the very first execution using nitrogen gas last month.

He's now having conversations with the world's second- richest man, Elon Musk. They met over the weekend as Trump's campaign tries to keep costs low while dealing with soaring legal expenses and fundraising concerns.Also new this morning, after major Super Tuesday wins for both Trump and President Biden, the Biden campaign is making a case why the former president is, quote, \"wounded, dangerous, and unpopular.\" In a new memo, the campaign says Biden has a clear path to victory in November. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House with more. What else is Biden saying in his campaign strategy?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, Biden campaign officials have long felt that Super Tuesday would be the moment that this race crystalizes for voters between President Biden and former President Donald Trump. And perhaps the latest proof point in that argument is the expectation that this morning, Nikki Haley will drop out of the Republican presidential primary contest.One thing that the Biden campaign will be working towards in the coming months is trying to potentially peel off some of those Haley voters who have been turned off by Trump -- not just voters, but I'm told also donors that they could also target as well. Senior campaign officials spoke to that in a memo last evening as they painted the former president as damaged and unpopular. In their Super Tuesday assessments, the two women leading the campaign, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, wrote that, quote, \"A significant share of moderate and Haley voters across the country are saying that Trump cannot count on their votes in a general election.\" And that will be key for President Biden going forward. The campaign will try to tap into those Haley voters. Try to tap into moderates and suburban voters as well. The campaign really believes that the issue of reproductive rights is a huge vulnerability for the former president and one that could work to their advantage come November. And they acknowledge that they anticipate this contest will be incredibly close. It comes as polling has shown CNN's average of the poll of polls has found that there's no clear leader in this contest. I think that average is about 48 percent for Trump and 46 percent for President Biden. Now, President Biden certainly faces a host of challenges in his own reelection bid trying to keep the coalition that elected him in 2020 together this time around. Also, trying to address some of the growing discontent within the Democratic Party over his approach to the war -- the conflict in Gaza. And then there are the questions that he has faced about his age and ability to serve in a second term. But the White House and the Biden campaign clearly believe that Super Tuesday and tomorrow's State of the Union address will be key for voters as they're trying to make their arguments for a second term in office.",

The New Jersey Democrat and his wife face a slew of new criminal charges related to an alleged yearslong bribery scheme involving Egypt, Qatar, and several businessmen. In the new federal indictment, prosecutors accuse Menendez and his wife of lying to their own lawyers to cover up the alleged bribery. This comes just days after an accused co- conspirator pled guilty and agreed to cooperate in the investigation.Senator Menendez is denying any wrongdoing. CNN's Kara Scannell is joining us live. Can you give us the significance of these new charges? There were a bunch of them before and now they've piled on more.",

He was facing four counts before, all conspiracy-related charges.Now they've filed new obstruction of justice charges and then also, what's known as the substantive counts. So he was charged with conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. And now he's charged with honest services wire fraud. He's also charged with bribery, with extortion, as well as acting as a foreign agent. That was a key one for the government of Egypt. So what these new charges are -- I mean, now there's a total of 16 charges that he's facing. And this new allegation of obstruction of justice where, according to the indictment, he told his attorney who was meeting with prosecutors -- so his attorney, according to the indictment, misled the prosecutors based on what Menendez told him that these weren't bribes but had said they were loans. And that he -- Menendez had signed checks that were handwritten notes. And then both he and his wife saying that it was repayment for a loan. And prosecutors say that is not true. That Menendez had been well aware of these payments and that they were actually bribe payments and not repayment of a loan. So he has different attorneys now, which we saw take place but didn't really know why. Now this sheds some light on that. But he, though, remains defiant as ever. He has not resigned his seat as senator. Even though Democrats in his own party have been asking him to step down, he has not. He issued a news statement after these charges came out saying, \"These prosecutors are trying to get me to give in simply by making wild allegations again and again, without actually proving anything. I am innocent and will prove it no matter how many charges they continue to pile on.\" Now, he is set to go to trial in May. We'll wait to see with these new charges if that date sticks. But now they have one of these co- defendants now cooperating in the investigation, so that is another very serious and significant step in this case.",

A lot of pundits kind of roll their eyes but a lot of voters really feel democracy is threatened. They remember January 6. And so, he can talk about voting rights.
