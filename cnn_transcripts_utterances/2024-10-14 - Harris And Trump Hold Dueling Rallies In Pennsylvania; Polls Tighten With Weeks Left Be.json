It's Monday, October 14th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once again. Tonight, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris holding dueling events in Pennsylvania as they look to gain an edge in that key swing state. Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes helped secure the 2020 election for Democrat, Joe Biden, and they are up for grabs in this year's race. Kamala Harris is in Erie, Pennsylvania. It's a swing county, too, favoring Biden in 2020 after backing Trump in 2016. The former president is in Oaks, Pennsylvania. He's trying to cut into Harris' lead in the Philadelphia suburbs. Stephen Caruso is a reporter at \"Spotlight PA,\" and he joins us now. Stephen, fantastic to have you on the show. I read today that out of a total of, wait for it, $1.5 billion that's been spent on advertising in this presidential campaign, more than a fifth of it, so we're talking over $300 million has been spent in Pennsylvania. What does it feel like for somebody living there and experiencing all of this?",

People are kind of sick of hearing about him if you don't like him. Now, if you're a fan of him, this is delightful and you're excited that he has another chance at it.

Harris is pitching, you know, I have a plan, which usually involves a lot of tax credits, a lot of sort of sort of wonky solutions that I think are focused on trying to, you know, she's -- I think she puts it as an opportunity economy. Trump has been trying to pitch his idea of tariffs to cut down on unfair imports that he say harm local industrialization. Obviously, that's a compelling pitch to Pennsylvania, because this was an industrial heartland of the state. I can't tell you which one is working best, because those last twenty, thirty percent of voters who not made up their mind are occasionally hard to get to, but overall, I always am going to go back to the economy's people's number one issue and I think most people who do this get that.",

So, I think, like what we argue in the book, is that, you know, China succeeded economically since the late 1970s because it created more inclusive economic institutions and it dismantled this sort of socialist economy. But you can't have an inclusive economy at the whim of a totalitarian dictatorship. So that's the train wreck waiting to happen. China does not have the political institutions necessary to really create a modern, prosperous society, so, you know, I still believe that will be, fundamentally a transitory situation. That's what the theory implies. You know, everyone comes up with sort of specific reasons for why China might be different. But everyone came up with specific reasons for every other society that looked like that and then collapsed, like Argentina around the First World War. So I think, in terms of changing the world, our view is that, the creation of economic success is a very deeply political process, and it's not about economists having better ideas or it's not about people not knowing what to do. You know, I work a lot in the Global South, in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and I can tell you, people in Nigeria know what needs to be done, they just can't do it, you know. So I think, for me, the role of ideas, you know, and theories and evidence like this is trying to help people kind of get an interpretation, a better interpretation of what the problem in their country is, and maybe find common axes to cooperate and organize to change things ultimately, you know, that's -- you know, think about the Civil Rights movement in the United States, you know, how did a lot of barriers to inclusion be -- how were they dismantled in the 1950s and the 1960s in the south of the United States? That was collective action by the people who suffered under those institutions. And that's for me, is the bigger picture of how change happens.",

The UN's director of the relief efforts inside of Gaza, you know, is saying that the situation there is getting worse, and that the polio vaccine campaign there that they're trying to roll out that is going to be impacted by the current military operations the IDF has undergoing there right now. And then, as you rightly say, along the northern border, I mean, with Lebanon, where UNIFIL, the sort of UN force that's supposed to enforce the last UN agreement in 2006, you know, the prime minister here, coming up very pointedly and saying, look, we are not out to target UNIFIL, we have told them that they need to move away, that it's not going to be safe for them there. And I think we're up to sort of at least five or six different incidents over the past three days, four days now, where UNIFIL soldiers have been injured or got caught up in the conflict, and one of those was where 15 of them were in a base and it appears that the IDF, this is what the IDF say. They were targeted by Hezbollah from close to that base. They were they caught in an ambush, and they had to pump out a lot of smoke, get their troops out, their tank reversed it, they say, into the gates of that UN base. So the war is happening right around the UNIFIL troops and the question is, how long can they stay?

And right now, those tariffs are suspended on U.S.-based distilled spirits and E.U.-based distilled spirits. But in March 2025, the tariff on American whiskey is scheduled to go up by 50 percent in less. Either the Biden administration or the incoming Harris and/or Trump administration tries to get a resolution, we want those tariffs permanently suspended. And the big impact is it would have a direct impact on American whiskey exports. And certainly, imports come in from Europe. Many of our member companies have cognac, scotch, Irish whiskey, rum, American whiskey. So, we want to make sure that we're going to work with either administration coming into power to make sure those tariffs remain suspended or permanently removed all together.",

If there aren't Boeing Airbus dispute resolutions, the potential for more backlash as well. So fast forward to the presidential election. And what we've seen is the former president, Former President Trump threatening a whole host of additional tariffs, enormous ones up to 60 percent on China but even between 10 and 20 percent on other importers into the United States. Chris, is that your worst fear for the industry at that moment? And I'm sure you're explaining this to both the White House and contacts around him.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Well, we're committed to working with either administration that comes into power, and we recognize. President Trump isvery invested in reducing the trade deficit. What's unique about U.S. distilled spirits and distilled spirits products in general is we're not a commodity. American whiskey can only come from the United States. Cognac can only come from France. Scotch whiskey from Scotland. So, our products are very, very unique and not a commodity. And the -- when the E.U. imposed tariffs on American whiskey back in June 2018. We saw a dramatic decrease in American whiskey exports and had an impact on jobs and economic vitality in the United States. So that is counter of anything President Trump would want to do on. We certainly appreciate the Biden administration's leadership on having those tariffs suspended. So, we're going to work with either administration, whether it's a Kamala Harris administration or Donald Trump administration to make sure that we can continue to work closely with our European partners and make sure that this industry remains tariff free because trade barriers do nothing to help foster the economic development and most importantly, consumers enjoying the product.",

We'll see, Chris, as yousaid, you're willing to work with both, but they're both -- the former administration and the current one have had their issues with tariffs and imposing tariffs.

There are 50 rare tapes in this collection, which includes some unheard tracks. Now, the titles fans will be familiar with. For instance, this master tape has Up From The Skies, Ain't No Telling, and Little Miss Lover. But they're different, the versions that appear on the Axis: Bold as Love album. The auction house expects it to sell for up to $260,000. It's not just the music going on sale. All sorts of personal items, from a dry- cleaning bill for a gold suit to pay slips and a note from Hendrix's record company informing the artist he was being evicted from Ringo Starr's London flat on account of complaints from the neighbors. Possibly a bit unsurprising. This auction will take place in London on November 15th, and if you're not a Hendrix fan, there will also be pieces associated with Michael Jackson, Oasis, Queen, John Lennon, amongst others.
