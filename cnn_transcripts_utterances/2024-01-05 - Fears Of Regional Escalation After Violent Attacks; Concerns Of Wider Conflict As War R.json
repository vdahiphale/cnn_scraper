      "sentences": "Yes, it is. This hour the Middle East is tense after what has been a violent week in multiple countries. Weare going to dive deeper on that this hour for you. First up, though, your other headlines this hour. And South Korea's military says North Korea has fired roughly 200 artillery shells of its west coast. South Korea responded with a shooting exercise of its own and asked people to shelter. Former Olympic sprinter and convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius is being released on parole from prison in South Africa. It's been more than a decade since the double amputee shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. And ahead of the Iowa caucuses on January 15th, CNN last night hosted town halls with two of the leading candidates. We'll have a review of what they have planned for the coming weeks. Welcome. You are with us for the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Becky Anderson for you. Anxiety mounting as fears spread that the Israel-Hamas war could really ramp up and possibly engulf this region. Almost every day this week has brought another violent incident. Nobody wants to see this escalation, but tensions have skyrocketed Tuesday when a senior Hamas official was killed by a suspected Israeli strike in the Hezbollah controlled area of Beirut. Then on Wednesday, a double bomb attack in Iran killed dozens of people. Even though ISIS claimed responsibility for that attack, it could put pressure on Tehran to act against Israel in response. And on Thursday, the U.S. killed a militia leader in Iraq, who Washington accused of carrying out attacks on U.S. troops. So it's against this backdrop of escalating tension that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken flies back into the region for what will be his fourth visit since October 7th and that violent Hamas attack on Israel. One of the questions that Blinken, the world, the U.S., want answered, is what will become of Gaza once the war between Israel and Hamas ends? A public spat has emerged over that issue within the Israeli government. The far-right finance minister slamming a day-after plan floated by the defense minister. Yesterday, he says it falls short of providing security to Israel. Well, that plan called for no Israeli civilian presence in Gaza after the war, with a multinational task force involved in the territory's, quote, \"rehabilitation.\" Let's get a view on this from Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv and Oren Liebermann from the Pentagon. Let's start with you, Nic. The last couple of times Antony Blinken was in region, he tried to get a conversation going about the day after these guns go silent in Gaza. And frankly he was not backed by this wider region who want to see a cease-fire in this Gaza conflict. They haven't got that, and Blinken certainly coming into a region which at least has begun to talk about the day after. What do we know about the internal divisions at this point in the Israeli cabinet?",

You're right to point out that Yoav Gallant has made a lot of noise about that northern border. He also said, just in the past week, that Israel is now fighting on seven fronts. And it includes that northern Israeli border, the Southern Lebanon border as one of those fronts. Thank you. Oren, let's bring you in at this point. Ahead of Blinken's trip, the U.S. grappling with Iranian proxies amid concerns about a wider Middle East war breaking out. I've just suggested that Yoav Gallant has already said Israel is fighting on seven fronts at this point. The U.S., of course, involved in an attack on an Iranian proxy in Iraq. They're running a coalition in the Red Sea trying to ensure the Houthis don't get completely out of control there. As Blinken arrives in the region, what will his priorities be, Oren?",

They say that they have not got their eye enough on what is going on out of Tehran. And I want to turn to what's going on inside of Iran at this point. But as I say, a lot of critics saying, keep your eyes focused on Iran. People around this region that I am in here, in the Gulf, a lot of critics of Israel suggesting that Israel is trying to draw Iran into this conflict at this point. Iran's president and other top officials are vowing revenge at funerals for Iranians killed in twin explosions on Wednesday in Kerman. Israel claimed - - I'm sorry, let me very specifically underscore who claimed responsibility. ISIS claimed responsibility for those bombings. ISIS claiming responsibility for those killings. At least 89 people were killed as thousands visited the grave of slain Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. The interior minister told state TV a number of suspects have been arrested. Let me bring in Paula Hancocks who's been following this part of the story. And I want to underscore again that it's ISIS who has claimed responsibility for the attacks. There were some speculation before that claim of responsibility that Israel may have been behind the attack. We've been talking about the risk, the fear of an escalation of violence in this region just as Secretary of State Antony Blinken comes back into the region for the fourth time since October 7th. And I have been suggesting that, you know, those who are critics of the administration Anthony Blinken works for are saying keep Iran in your crosshairs because they are very much the instigators of what is going on through the proxies, the Iranian- backed proxies in this region. What happened, though, in the past 48 hours in Kerman in Iran is very specifically not tied specifically to this conflict at present, is it?",

This particular event at this point does appear to be internally Iranian. Now ISIS has claimed responsibility for what has really been the deadliest attack in Iran since 1979. We're getting a few more details. We know now 89 were killed in those twin blasts. And many of them were young. I mean, we're hearing that 30 of them were under the age of 18. Nine of them under the age of 10. So these twin blasts were designed to kill civilians and innocents. ISIS has claimed responsibility. Now what they have said is that they had twin suicide bombers, they were brothers who carried this attack out. It doesn't tally exactly with what we heard from the interior minister. He said yesterday that he believed one was a suitcase bomb that was detonated remotely. But we have heard through state media that Iran has made a number of arrests. We hear over five provinces at this point. We don't know more about the individuals or the potential affiliations. But at this point it does appear, if in fact this claim of responsibility is accurate, this is an internal Iranian issue but it comes at a very tense time for the region.",
