Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira was arrested yesterday. Federal investigators say he leaked documents, which included detailed intelligence assessments of allies and adversaries, as well as the U.S. military's assessment on the state of the war in Ukraine.Teixeira's job title was a cyber transport systems journeyman, in layman's terms, that's an I.T. specialist. He entered the Air National Guard in September 2019 and was recently promoted to the rank of airman first class. Teixeira graduated high school in Massachusetts in 2020. Several of his former classmates tell CNN he was fascinated with the military, guns and war. CNN's Jason Carroll is outside the court in Boston.

He walked backwards as he was taken into custody without incident.Still a lot of focus on that online chat group on Discord where he allegedly posted much of these classified documents, and so a lot of questions as to why someone in his position had access to classified documents. A lot of questions also, as you can imagine, about who he is what he was all about. I spoke to one of his former students, someone who went to school with him in high school, also in middle school. She told me that a lot of folks and other students tended to stay away from him, especially when you brought up the issue and talked about guns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they are, you know, air-to-air defense. And their purpose, whether it's them or any fighter unit, frankly, my fighter units out of Madison, Wisconsin, you know, their job is to take on enemy aircraft. Their job is to be deployable in war. The Air National Guard actually carried even a bigger broad -- you know, a bigger burden of the war on terror than active duty in the last few years. And in terms of when it comes to the young people, look, some people have to put the briefing slides in front of us, you know, in front of the officers, in front of those making decisions, and you can't just wait until you get somebody that's a major to have access to the first time for this information. So, it's young people that put these slides together that brief the officers, that brief those going into battle.

And then my plane at that unit does counter drug. So, the intel there, the intelligence people have to know all about our adversaries, they also have to know about some of the cartels and some of the counterdrug issues for us. So, that's important.Is it necessary, though for a fighter unit to know, for instance, as we know in this leak, that at one point, Ukraine was about to deplete all their air defense systems? I don't think so. So, I think those kinds of things, you know, yes, it's good to know, but maybe, unfortunately, we don't have to know it.

They're hoping to fast track this case after the Texas judge suspended the use of the pill, and it's now working its way through the appeals process.Let me bring in CNN Political Director David Chalian with more on this. David, this is -- it's important to point out, as Joan Biksupic did, when we brought in this breaking news, this case is the most important abortion related dispute to reach the high court since the justices overturned Roe v. Wade. it cannot be overstated how important this is to the country but also how important this move that they've just now requested that the Supreme Court take it up. What this is going to mean legally and politically? Let's focus in on that because the abortion has been front and center very much so over the past week and far beyond that. How do you see this, David? What do you see in this in this now that the Supreme Court is being asked to take it up?",

But as you've noted, this has been an issue at the center of American politics for quite some time. I mean, last year, when we saw the Supreme Court over overturn Roe v. Wade and sort of upend 50 years, a half century of precedent, it ignited a moment in American politics, one in which the Democrats believe they have an advantage politically. We saw that last summer in that Kansas referendum, remember, then in November, in the 2022 midterm elections, where this was an issue that Democrats believe significantly help them perform better than expected and defy historical trends. And just recently, as recently as last week in Wisconsin in that battle for that critical Supreme Court race there, we saw this issue benefit the Democrats and fuel that candidate who won that judicial race to an 11-point victory. So, there's potency in this issue in politics. And what you see now, Kate, is the Republican field which is forming in the 2024 presidential race, they're going to have an intraparty debate on this of how and where to draw the lines and what restrictions in place in a post-Roe world.",
