      "sentences": "Yes, Abby, I mean, you can see the fire a little bit behind me -- or the smoke, I should say.It's a lot better than it was. But it still does pose that risk, as the Indiana state fire marshals described, with fumes that are definitely toxic. So, a lot of that smoke going up into the air, and that actually is the primary concern, the smoke. And that's partly good news. And I say that because, well, one -- let's take a look here. One is that a lot of these toxic fumes are going up into the air. But the tests that have now been taken of the ground-level air quality, which is I guess what most people here are breathing, outside of those in the immediate area there, that there were no signs of toxins. However, they did find signs of particulates in there, so little particles that oftentimes we see with smoke. So, at the very least, smoke inhalation could be an issue for a lot of folks here, which, of course, we know can be troublesome. Around 2,000 people are being affected by evacuation orders. This is a town of about 35,000 between Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. Now, these are plastics that are burning. It's a plastic recycling factory. And officials believe it started with the semitruck trailer that burned, that then spread to piles of plastics, that then spread to the entire compound. And while the specific reason for this or the specific cause, we're still trying to figure out, the mayor here says that they have had issues with this property for a long time, particularly about fire hazards, that, for them, talking among officials, it was never a matter of if something like this would happen, but when. And it seems like we have gotten to that point now. Good news, they have got the flames or the -- at least the smoke contained. So it doesn't appear that there will be more flame threats, other homes and things like that around the area. But, obviously, that major concern is the smoke and toxins that are going up into the air. And the last point they mentioned for something to watch for in the future is, while a lot of those toxins are going up into the air now, as the smoke dies down, as they get this more under control, a lot of those toxins will end up staying around the ground level. And that's something they're really watching for. And it's why EPA officials told us here on the ground they are testing air quality constantly to make sure that we're just worried about particulates, and not necessarily toxins.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely.And for the people in that area, what should they be concerned about as it relates to the plastics? And, if they do have health concerns, what signs would they take on at this point?",

      "speaker": "GUPTA",
      "sentences": "Yes, so, with regard to the smoke, call it the smoke right now, I mean, you see it, you smell it, you feel it. That can cause health -- health issues in just about anybody, even healthy people.I think people who say, look, I'm healthy, don't need to worry about it, that's probably not the case. But people who are most at risk are the people who have underlying heart disease, underlying pulmonary disease, lung disease, things like that, young children, babies, in particular, at risk. But I think if you start to look at, again, some of these compounds, you got this uncontrolled burn. There's all these different things that are spewed into the air. Some of the ones that they have talked about earlier today at that press conference and that you worry about with plastics are things like styrene and benzene, for example. Styrene, we know less about. In the short term, it can cause irritation of eyes and difficulty with breathing. Still, the long-term impact of that is not as well-known. Benzene, we know more about both in the short term in the long term. It can cause people to have headaches, feel confused. It can affect their heart, just like the particulate matter. In severe cases, it can lead to unconsciousness as well. So, again, I don't want to unnecessarily alarm people. And, as Omar mentioned, so far, the testing has not shown evidence of this. But keep in mind, where those toxins, potential toxins, would be right now, if they are present, is near the top of that plume of smoke, where it's harder to do that testing. You got to follow this to see, does that start to come down, literally down to the ground over time? And where it most likely falls in some of the lowest-lying areas around the community. So, that testing needs to happen over the next several days and even weeks.",

They recovered items from his residence overnight, and the shooter's family broke their silence, saying that he was dealing with -- quote -- \"mental health challenges.\" We also have newly released body camera footage from police showing officers storming that bank where the attack was in the lobby -- where the attacker was in the lobby, and they were -- and ready to ambush them.

It says: \"No words can express our sorrow, anguish and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people.\" It also goes on to say: \"We mourn their loss and that of our son Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized.\" And later this evening at 5:00 here in town, there will be a vigil to honor and recognize and remember the five people who lost their lives. Their lives ended here at the bank, Abby, where they worked. You can see now the front of the bank. The windows that were shattered by gunfire are now covered with plywood -- Abby.",

Can you clarify what you know about that? GWINN-VILLAROEL:  Yes, thanks for asking that question. We did get clarification. There was no discussion about him being terminated. And, of course, he wasn't fired. So he was an active employee there at Old National Bank, but there was no discussion about this individual being terminated.

GWINN-VILLAROEL:  We didn't receive any initial warning time on that voice-mail. But I'm just truly grateful that, as soon as the call came in that we had an active shooter situation that was actually occurring, within three minutes, my officers were on scene, and they were engaging that individual.

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby. Good afternoon.As of this moment, all the filings are into the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. It's the regional appellate court that will be handling the arguments from both sides on what to do with Judge Kacsmaryk's order from last week, as, remember, when he invalidated the FDA approval of the first pill of this two-drug medication abortion, he said that his order should take effect on Friday, this -- at the end of this Friday. He gave it seven days. And what the Department of Justice and the drug manufacturer, Danco, have said is that this -- this ruling has to be put on hold for a longer period of time, so that appeals can work their way through the system. If this order were to take effect so immediately, it would cause substantial harm to women, to physicians, to pharmaceutical companies, to so many different players, because not just would it throw in doubt access to this crucial abortion medication that has become the most common way that women end pregnancies in the early stages; it also cast lots of doubt on the FDA's approval of other existing drugs and new drugs. So, just so much chaos would ensue, the Department of Justice says, again, joined by the drug manufacturer. Now, the group that brought the original complaint against the FDA submitted its filing just overnight, saying, look, this order should take effect. The judge found that the approval process was flawed, it did not take into account the proper scientific groundings and harms caused by this drug. This is the argument from these challengers, these anti-abortion doctors and medical groups. So those are the competing views that are now before the First Circuit -- Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have to say, Abby, this is a very conservative Fifth Circuit. It has a very -- it's very top-heavy with Republican appointees and Republican appointees who tend to tip further to the right wing. But this issue right now is not a straight abortion rights one. It has to do with the approval process and, most specifically, right now, if everyone can just wait, have what's called an administrative stay, so that the actual legal arguments can be presented. One final thing. If the Department of Justice does not get relief with the Fifth Circuit, it says it's going to go immediately to the U.S. Supreme Court to try to have the justices put this matter on hold, so that the legal case can play out -- Abby.",
