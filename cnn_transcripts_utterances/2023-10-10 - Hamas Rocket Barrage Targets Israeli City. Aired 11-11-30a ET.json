We saw with our own eyes video of the Israeli Iron Dome intercepting many, if not most, of those rockets. Let's get right to Clarissa Ward, who is in the Israeli city of Ashkelon to tell us what you have been seeing, Clarissa.",

But, certainly, we came upon areas where we were not allowed to pass, because there was still a state of heightened alert that perhaps there still could be a threat. What have you been seeing?",

And then they get a report that says, hey, something suspicious is happening over here. I don't know why so many police have flooded to this particular neighborhood, but they were outside there searching around with flashlights. So they clearly got word of something. And I think it's a similar scenario, potentially where you were, that something happened and that something was spotted, and, therefore, the IDF went on -- stepped up their patrols, stepped up their positioning, if you will. When I spoke to the general in charge, he took us into the kibbutz that's literally about 700 meters away from Gaza that Hamas overran early Saturday morning, was 48 hours of gun battle to get back control of -- I think that's artillery outgoing -- to get back control of this particular kibbutz. And I said to him: \"Look, can you be 100 percent sure that you have got all of these Hamas militants?\" And he said: \"No, there is no 100 percent at the moment. We're pretty sure we have got them, we have got them all, but we're not 100 percent sure.\" And just half-an-hour ago, we heard small-arms fire behind me here towards the towards the Gaza fence. Again, as you know, small-arms fire means probably a contact, in military parlance. Somebody spotted gunfire, gunfire shots exchanged, contact broken. I don't know if that was by the fence or what it was. But it shows you that people are on edge. And it shows you that potential still exists. So, that's what we're experiencing here today, from what we have seen.",

It's low-tech, but it's high- volume. That's what they're trying to do.

And one U.S. official said that the president is not going to urge Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have restraint in this situation. This comes after CNN had previously reported that, when Netanyahu raised the possibility of going and launching a ground operation in Gaza, that the president did not push back on that matter in a previous phone call.Now, the president is expected to have his third phone call with Netanyahu today. It should be happening before that speech begins. And what the president is also expected to talk about in these remarks is the U.S. support for Israel's ability to defend itself and the assistance that the U.S. and other allies can offer to the country in this moment. We have heard from President Biden and top officials at the State Department and Department of Defense that the U.S. is prepared to offer further assistance to Israel. They have started surging resources to the country during this conflict. And another issue that the president is expected to touch on is the fact that there are still many Americans who are unaccounted for due to Hamas taking potentially some American hostages. Now, the White House has not put a number on Americans who could be held hostage, but they said that it is likely that that is a possibility. The president has outlined that there at least have been 11 Americans killed in this conflict. But in addition to sending some military assistance to Israel, the U.S. is also offering special operations and intelligence planning for a possible rescue effort for these hostages. Take a listen a bit earlier today to a top National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, and what he had to say about the assistance being offered in this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
