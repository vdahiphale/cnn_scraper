We've got airlines scheduling us to the maximums, they're reducing pilot training, they are basically running along a barbed wire fence, right up to the maximums, and we shouldn't be surprised when we see these safety seals start to leak.We've seen reliability gone down the drain. And that's recovered a bit. But pilots across the nation are saying, you're trying to do too much with too little. And the FAA has now called for a safety summit, which is great, but it's time for actions and not just words.",

And, by the way, in those tapes, you have pilots, two highly trained, experienced and well rested pilots that are making the difference between an incident and an accident.And I'd like to hit on one thing. One of those incidents, a FedEx aircraft went around. They saw what was happening before they were going to land on a Southwest aircraft during low weather. Those two pilots did the right thing. They made it work. But here's the deal. They're actually -- they fly under different safety and rest rules. It's called a cargo carveout. It's these types of things that are going on in the industry that the public doesn't know about. And responsibility lies right with the FAA. Folks who fly NetJets, a business -- the executive jets, they fly on another set of rules. We're flying in the same airspace. So, this has got to stop and be aligned.",

You know, we sent a letter to the FAA back in June saying that our particular airline was reducing the frequency of training and the quantity of training at just the wrong time when we have all of these new pilots coming in. They're experienced, but they're not seasoned in this operation. So, the FAA responded to us, believe it or not, well, what they're doing isn't illegal. So, if it's legal, good to go. But we have a saying on the flight deck, just because it's legal does not mean it's safe and smart.And I - and I would like to add one more thing to go further. For five years we've been waiting to get a secondary barrier before the flight deck door. There's legislation. It's done. And we are still waiting for that. And I'm thinking about that passenger that became unhinged and attacked a flight attendant. The fact that we're talking about this now, how many years after 9/11, and we can't get this done because of pushback by the airlines not wanting to spend a couple extra bucks, the price of a seat back entertainment center, is beyond belief. It's time to get this done. You know, they're making record revenue right now, airlines. It is time for record responsibility to our passengers. And pilots will make sure that happens. But we get a little weary having to fight this every turn. But we're hopeful that the safety summit may make a difference. But it's not going to be a comfortable space because we're fighting for our passengers' safety. That's everything.",

The world's biggest, most populous Muslim country where they are able to come out on to the streets and, you know, celebrate their rights, demand more rights and do all these kinds of things. I also have sources who have told me that in Afghanistan, which has literally the world's most draconian anti-girl and anti-women policies established under the Taliban over the last several months, that they know -- the Kabul group of Taliban leaders know that they can't continue like this and they are trying to convince the fundamentalists religious leaders who live in Kandahar, you know, the Muslim fundamentalists there, that denying girls education is not Islamic and it's not good for Afghanistan.

That doesn't normally get said between and amongst the Taliban.And, on top of everything else, they say that they put it to the so- called Ulima (ph), in other words, a group of religious scholars, and even they have told the fundamentalist leadership in Kandahar that, you know, cracking down on women and their right to education and work is not in the Quran.
