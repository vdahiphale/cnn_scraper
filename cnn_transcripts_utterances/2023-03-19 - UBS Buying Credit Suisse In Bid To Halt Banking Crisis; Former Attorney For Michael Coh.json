Switzerland's largest banking group UBS just agreed to buy its rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue. The purchase is aimed at halting investor panic brought on by two sudden U.S. bank failures this month. Investors and customers pulled their money out of Credit Suisse over the past several days as turmoil swept the global banking industry. Now Credit Suisse lost 25 percent of its shares over the course of the week despite an emergency $54 billion loan from the Swiss National Bank. Now I want to discuss this with Jeanna Smialek. She reports on the Federal Reserve and the economy for the \"New York Times. Jeanna, will this UBS move to halt the panic, will this work?",

I think what really happened here is we saw the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States which were very much tied to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle, and with those, I think you got this real collective look around by investors in the banking space saying, you know, who else is weak, who else in the banking industry isn't looking great these days?And that's really what came home to roost for Credit Suisse. I don't think it was necessarily the same variety of problem. It was just that they were in the same industry at a time when there's sort of blood in the water and the sharks were circling.",

The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates because inflation had popped, because inflation has been so rapid and they've been trying to wrestle that under control, and they really only do have this one tool, which is raising interest rates in order to get that under control.So I think that, you know, when you're talking about whether it's fair or not, you just have to dissect why is it happening, did they have an alternative, what else could happen here. And I think there are certainly some fair questions about whether there could have been more done here from a regulatory and supervisory point of view.

In New York they invite someone who is possibly or likely to be indicted to have a chance to make a pitch to the grand jury. Trump apparently is not going to do that, which is wise. And I guess this is the substitute.What's particularly odd about it, though, is he had at one point spoken with Cohen and he says that he was not formally retained by him. He also told \"The New York Times\" that Cohen had waived attorney- client privilege. But it's a very dicey ethical situation if he gave Cohen at one point any kind of confidential legal advice, whether or not Cohen had waived the privilege. One, he might reassert it, but two, you still as a lawyer can't use confidential information to do something adverse to your client. He is obviously going in to be adverse to him to try and undercut his credibility. So it's a very odd situation.",

And it's not really a good strategic thing for them do, which brings me to my original concern that it might be a little bit too quick in terms of Bragg having decided to move from zero to 60 on this.

Ukrainian government officials heaping scorn on this visit saying that it was conducted under cover of darkness so that some of the destruction of the city could not be seen. Let's just remind you that after the invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, the Russian forces encircled Mariupol and pounded it for weeks.

And that Costello is expected to provide information pertaining to Cohen's credibility as a witness, because, of course, he is the central witness in this investigation. And this all comes amid growing concerns about political backlash if prosecutors do, in fact, end up indicting the former president in the hush money case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: I think it's building a lot of sympathy for the former president. I think the fact that I was with coffee this morning with some folks and there's ever -- not -- none of them were big Trump supporters. But they all said, you know, they felt like he was being attacked. SEN. MARK KELLY (D), ARIZONA: I would hope that if they brought charges that they have a strong case, because this is -- as you said, it's unprecedented. And, you know, there's certainly, you know, risks involved here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, are there real concerns that an arrest of former President Trump, or an indictment could help him, politically?SEUNG MIN KIM, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST (via Webex): I think that's -- first of all, I think that's what the Trump team is banking on, at this point. I mean, all throughout his relatively brief political career, you know, the former president has really, kind of, seized on this politics of grievance to galvanize his supporters. And I think you've seen the continuation of that, even when he's been out of office. So, there's -- his team has, kind of, always generally thought that had he actually faced criminal charges, that it would galvanize his supporters even more. I do think you're also hearing that from some of the candidates -- or of some of the actual and potential presidential candidates who are running also for the Republican nomination. And I think that is a little bit of the fear that people aren't yet talking about openly just yet, but we could probably have escalate later this week. That this certainly could, really, you know, bolster his standing. But, again, I mean, we are in unprecedented territory here. No former president has faced criminal charges, has been indicted like this, so it's really hard to predict the political consequences. And it does come at a time when so much of the Republican Party has been shifting away from him. So, you also have to gauge that dynamic as well.",

And I do think that his team is already out there kind of using this as a wedge issue against some of his most prominent potential opponents. You saw one of Trump's top advisers on Twitter, maybe about an hour or so ago, pointing out the fact that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hasn't said anything much about this, you know, looming indictment, whether it actually happens on Tuesday or not. He is, actually, one of the big ones who hasn't weighed in just yet. Obviously, we don't know what's going to happen. So, perhaps, Governor DeSantis is being careful there.

You know, most families, their lives are, like, you know, going to the beach, going to the lake, going, you know, to the playground. Henry's family has to think, will he be overwhelmed by these events, that it will trigger a seizure? They can't go anywhere without their emergency rescue bag. The worst part of it, I think, is that, you know, Mary told me that they're constantly prepared. You know, she -- whenever he has a seizure, she's almost ready to say her last words to him. And I think that's something that no parent or, you know, anyone with a loved one, can imagine. Just being prepared to share your last words with someone, while you're saving their life, let alone your baby.

So, there are currently about a thousand people worldwide who have it, but there are most likely more that just have gone undiagnosed.And in, you know, Henry's case, his is caused by his mutation. It's a very specific mutation in his brain. And it causes one of the most severe cases of AHC where he has really life-threatening seizures. Very frequent and regular spells where he is not breathing. And he also has a lot of motor delays. It takes a lot of work for Henry to learn how to talk and how to eat. How to even breathe. How to walk. These small things that, you know, for a lot of toddlers, just come naturally, Henry's brain works incredibly hard to do it. And it works so hard that, you know, these triggers -- the worst part about AHC is that it can be triggered by any and everything. When he was a baby, he would seize every single time that, you know, he took a bath. Sunlight can trigger seizures. Excitement can trigger seizures. So, this basically means birthday parties, holiday celebrations, families with AHC think twice before, you know, they do these things, because they have no idea if the excitement will cause a seizure. And the reality is, you know, of course, you know, although Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood, the name is a little bit deceiving because there are adults with it. It gets worse as you age. And, again, the fear is that Henry, if he does not receive this treatment, he will have permanent brain damage that all of these things will be reversed. He might forget how to walk and talk.
