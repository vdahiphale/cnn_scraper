Well, South Koreans are demanding answers from authorities after at least 154 people died in a crowd surge. Many want to know why there was very little crowd control during the large Halloween celebrations in Seoul. The area was brimming with party goers making it hard to move or breathe. Many people fell over and were trampled by others around them. Some were so desperate to get out that they tried to climb over walls. It was so crowded in fact that by the time emergency crews got there they struggled to people reach people in need. So, let's get more now from CNN's Ivan Watson who joins us live from Seoul. Ivan, families of the victims are dealing with the loss of their loved ones in the midst of this tragedy. What is the latest on all of this?",

It's a normally busy shopping district as well as this kind of night life district. And as you can see, it's completely blocked off because of the scale of the disaster that took place here.The old U.S. military base is down the road there and this is where the throngs were gathered on Saturday night to party for a Halloween weekend in costumes and where things went terribly, terribly wrong. I'm going to bring you over to here, as you can see now, the tension of the Korean media, the international media is here. And over there is the entryway to this little alleyway where so many people lost their lives. I think we can show you a map of where just the surge of the crowd took place, where people fell on top of each other by the scores and where we believe that the majority of the loss of life took place as people were piled underneath, just piles and piles of other members of the crowd. So much so that the rescue workers struggled to pull people out from underneath the weight of this crowd. Now, all around here, you have people who are laying flowers, lighting candles, putting little bottles of soju out in honor of the victims. It's just the beginning of several days of mourning that have been declared by the president here. And we've been hearing from some of the eyewitnesses and survivors of this. Let's take a listen to what one woman had to say about what she witnessed that night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Many thanks.Well, more than two dozen foreign nationals from 14 countries were among those killed in Saturday's crush. China's leader, Xi Jinping, says he was shocked to learn of the tragedy which killed four Chinese nationals. He has sent condolences to the president of South Korea, the victims, and all of the grieving families. U.S. President Joe Biden has also expressing grief after learning that two Americans died in that crush. He says he and the First Lady are devastated, adding that their hearts go out to the victim's families and that they are praying for the recovery of all of those injured. In just eight days, American voters will decide key races at the state and national level including the contest for control of Congress. Top powerbrokers from both parties have been campaigning for their candidates in battleground states. Among them, former presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama as well as President Joe Biden. Right now, Obama is in the middle of a five-state tour. On Saturday, he tried to convince voters in Wisconsin and Michigan that the Democrats will fix the economy. But in New York, conservative star Ron DeSantis urge people to vote Republican. He said Lee Zeldin was the better choice in the governor's race there. New York is one of many states holding early voting right now. So far, more than 20 million pre-election ballots have been cast nationwide. Well, Democrats are hoping that they can sway still undecided voters. CNN's Kevin Liptak is following developments from Wilmington, Delaware.",

And Democrats may have a shot in Ohio and Wisconsin as you mentioned.But the likelihood in this year is that all of those are going to be hard for the other party to flip, which means that when you get down to it, you've got the Republicans with two top tier opportunities to take away seats now held by Democrats, which are Nevada and Georgia. And Democrats having won real top tier opportunity to take away a state now held by Republicans, which is Pennsylvania. So, the likelihood -- the strong likelihood is that whichever party wins two out of three of those three races or three out of three, they are going to have the majority. Nevada and Georgia are both seriously at risk for Democrats. And Pennsylvania, despite the debate, Fetterman I think is still considered nominally the favorite there to beat Mehmet Oz in part because Fetterman is more aggressively linking Oz to the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Doug Mastriano, who is very unpopular. I think the Senate is an absolute coin flip, but it is likely, as I said, that the side that wins two out of three from Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada probably has the gavel at the end of the day.",

They are -- in all of the midterm elections since the civil war, the party in the White House has lost fewer than five seats, only four times. And each time there was something really unique going on in the world, 1934 with the new deal, 1962 with the Cuban missile crisis, 1998 with Bill Clinton's impeachment and 2002 with 9/11 and the aftermath boosting Republicans and George W. Bush.So, it is highly likely that Republicans win the House. The question is how big? And whether it is a margin that makes it impossible for Democrats to win it back in 2024 or soon thereafter. Don't forget, I mean, the last time Democrats lost the house in 2010, they held it only four years, which is where they are now. And then it took them after 2010, within eight years to win it back. I mean, that would basically wipe out the entire decade of the 2020's. I think the key in the House is whether Democrats can hold down their losses in some of these white-collar districts. I think in a lot of these working-class, blue-collar districts to a large extent across racial lines, they are really going to struggle because those are the places that feel the most squeeze by rising gas and grocery prices. Those pressures are there, but maybe less intense in white collar districts where more voters may feel free to vote their values on issues like abortion and the threats to democracy posed by Trump and his movement. So, the question is, can Democrats hold enough of those white-collar districts to hold down their overall loss, but winning the house, holding the house would obviously be, you know, breaking the historic tradition with only four counter examples in what, 160 years.",

It took place Sunday evening, local time, 6:30 p.m. And this is a video, I want to show you, and it is very disturbing and distressing to watch. It's been circulating widely on social media, and it shows you the immediate aftermath of this bridge collapse. And in the video, you see people clinging and attempting to climb the cables and the twisted remains of the bridge after the collapse, all in a desperate attempt to just make it to safety. Some people managed to get to the water to swim to the riverbed. Some made it, and many others did not. Among the victims, were children. I want you to listen to what this eyewitness had to say. And a witness did speak to us earlier saying that many children were enjoying holidays for Diwali, the Festival of Lights. He said all of them fell, one on top of another. The bridge is a popular tourist destination. This is a bridge that was built in the 1800s during British rule. It was recently closed for renovations. It just re- opened last week. We're looking at live pictures on your screen of the bridge in Gujarat, in the town of Morbi there, as rescue workers and recovery workers comb the scene looking and trying to find any trace of the missing.
