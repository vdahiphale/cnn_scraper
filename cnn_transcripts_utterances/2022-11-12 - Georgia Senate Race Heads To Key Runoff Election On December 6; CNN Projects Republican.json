So, only about six percent of the vote remaining unaccounted, but less than 900 votes separating these two. Which counties are you waiting for? TABITHA MUELLER, POLITICAL REPORTER, NEVADA INDEPENDENT: So, we are still waiting for the two most populous counties, which is Clark County and Washoe County. Clark County is down south, that's where Las Vegas is. Washoe County is up in northern Nevada. Clark County is sort of a Democratic stronghold, whereas Clark -- sorry, Clark County is the Democratic stronghold, whereas Washoe County is more of a purple county. Very swing, it'll be interesting to see how that turns. And we're waiting on about 40,000 to 55,000 ballots right now is my estimate. So --",

But there are still 1000s of ballots to be counted. Let's go to Camila Bernal, who is live for us in Los Angeles, who has been following all the developments. Wow, another nail biter. What's going on with the latest count? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, that is -- that is true. Karen Bass lightly gaining a lead. She is up by about 4,000 votes. But still, a lot to be counted here in Los Angeles. Look, this is a race that has not been called yet. And it's between the establishment candidate Karen Bass, who is a lifelong Democrat represented Los Angeles in Congress for years now, was backed by former President Barack Obama. She got his endorsement. She was on the shortlist for the vice- presidential pick for Joe Biden. And then, on the other hand, you have this billionaire Rick Caruso, a real estate developer here in Los Angeles, who has dumped a lot of his own money into this campaign. He was a Republican, then an Independent, now a Democrat. And it's part of the reason why it's been such an uphill battle for him here in Los Angeles, the second largest city in the country. He made homelessness a key issue. But frankly, both of these candidates making homelessness and crime some of their top issues in this campaign. According to those latest numbers, Karen Bass is at 50.4 percent, while Rick Caruso is at 49.6 percent. And so far, only 58 percent of the vote has been counted. That's just a little more than half of the votes. So, yes, we will likely be here for a long time. We're expecting results today between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. local time, then, we will not have anything tomorrow, and we're expecting the second update on Monday, same time between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. local time. So, we might be waiting a long time not just to find out who the next mayor of L.A. is going to be. But also a number of House races here in California. We're waiting for, at least, 10 of these races to be called or projected. And according to our CNN politics team, at least nine of these races are key races. Meaning, they could help determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives. So, we are going to be waiting for a while and the country really just watching California as they continue to count these ballots. Fred.",

As the election here in the U.S. continues to play out, President Biden is in Cambodia for a meeting with Asian leaders. WHITFIELD (voice over): It's the latest stop on his week-long trip overseas. He arrived in Cambodia after attending a climate summit in Egypt. His next stop is the high stakes G20 summit in Indonesia. And there, he will host his first face to face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office. CNN senior White House correspondent Phil Mattingly is traveling with the President in Cambodia. So, Phil, I set the stage for what is at stake with the president's meeting with China's president. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Fredricka. I would start with the fact that the president is certainly still keeping an eye on domestic politics back home. Obviously, White House advisors is very pleased with a midterm that ended up much better than most analysts expected. Even some in the White House expected the president after a 2-1/2 hour dinner with East Asian leaders here at the summit in Cambodia, making phone calls to two Democratic Congressman Pat Ryan of New York and David Trone of Maryland to congratulate them on their victory. So, no halting. And the president is keeping an eye on what's going on back home. And to some degree, that's because there is a very real carryover effect of that domestic achievement. I think, when the White House looks at things right now, heading into this critical meeting at the G20. You have the president here in Cambodia meeting with ASEAN leaders, critical leaders when it comes to the competition that is, to some degree implicit playing out in the backdrop. But it's very real and almost visceral given the relationship or almost lack of relationship between the U.S. and China, at this moment in time. There is a competition for some type of the power in terms of the relationships with the countries represented at the ASEAN summit. There is a relationship in the region in how the U.S. is trying to expand its influence in the region. At a moment where China has certainly operated in a more muscular and aggressive way than they have at any point prior to now. Now, Fred, as you know, quite well, the president and President Xi Jinping have not met in person since President Biden took office. They met plenty (PH) when he was vice president. They've also spoken by phone five times in the lead up to this meeting. But as the relationship between the two countries has continued to spiral into a pretty low place right now, there is a recognition with U.S. officials that you speak to that this is a critical moment, not to have some big breakthrough, not to completely change the dynamics of things, but to better understand red lines, perspectives, and how this relationship can move forward in a way that doesn't result in conflict. Whether that's possible, it remains a very open question. But White House officials make clear this is an absolute necessity, and one they hope spurs future meetings in a better place than it's been over the course of the last two years. Fred.",

We have -- we have nine years left, if we continue emitting the same rate that we're emitting greenhouse gases now.Once we reach that tipping point, we're in unchartered territory. Science tells us we can't increase global temperatures by more than 1.5 degrees. And there is a lot of things that we need -- we're going to need to do. We're going to need to decarbonize the economy, we're going to need to change the way we move around and fly to places. We're -- but we're also going to need to protect the world's forests. And that's crucially important. Deforestation represents 10 to 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. So, without addressing that, you know, look, if all of the world's deforestation were a country, it would be the third largest emitter behind China and the U.S. You know, look, when I was a child, I learned that planting trees were -- was a great idea. It was good for the environment. Trees, breathe in CO2 and breathe out oxygen, which is what we need to breathe. And so, planting trees I learned was a great thing and it is a great thing to do for the environment. But what people -- I think most people don't realize is, as a global society, we're destroying the forest. We lose -- the time we're talking now, we'll probably lose a tropical forest the size of Central Park. These are the lungs, not only the lungs of the Earth, but they provide huge, important climate benefits. And so, when we destroy the forest, when we burn them, when we bulldoze them, they emit -- they're actually a source of pollution. And, you know, the -- a visual might be, the act of deforestation is you've got, you know, coal burning power plants sitting in Amazon jungle, emitting greenhouse gases. So, we need to stop deforestation and then restore the world's forest. And the good news here is that we have the technology, we know how to reverse deforestation. We don't need to design a new plant, a new battery, a new widget. All we need is the political will and financing. And that's what we're working on with the LEAF Coalition.",

Nevertheless, we clearly understand that the artillery that was provided as assistance to us for the United States and Europe, it definitely had to break this initiative which Russia launched to us 24th of February. And we did break this military initiative. We stopped them. We de- occupied a large part of our territory. And, this indeed, was helped by the artillery and the new technologies. We never resorted to any of the lies that the Russian Federation produces about dirty bombs or nuclear challenges, and so on. And I'm very pleased that we're working jointly and responding quickly to that.

He might be tired of life, in principle because of his age but he's definitely not tired of the war. Now, this person and the Russian political and military leadership need a pause.

Please respect our people, our rights, our freedom, our land, and our choice. That's it. So, this word fatigue is a big word. You can't get fatigued. So, it's too early for all of us to get fatigued. But when Russia truly wants peace, we will definitely feel it and see it. But you know, you can't wish for peace with words alone. Words are not enough. Stop the war, withdraw from the territory, stop killing people. Start reimbursing the damages inflicted on our country. Criminals must be prosecuted. So, words are not enough. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, we have kids here, myself included back in the day who didn't even know what a computer is. We refurbish them. We install our own custom operating system that is geared towards teaching our kids self-efficacy, troubleshooting, and internet skills. We are working with institutions, colleges, companies, even individuals. And then we bring it to the schools. All of you are going to be graphic designers today. They can go from doing a remote class with NASA to music production, video production, coding, personal branding, and so on. The thing that was really frustrating me growing up not seeing change, not seeing hope, not even seeing progress. I feel like with these kids, I can see a path, I can see a way where they can make a living online. And that is really like why we're doing this work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
