      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with the post-mugshot world for former President Donald Trump. That world includes what is shaping up to be a busy and complicated courtroom calendar for Trump as well as his co-defendants in the Georgia election subversion case. But for the former president, there is more where that came from. He is now facing four separate criminal trials after his historic surrender to the Fulton County Jail on Thursday. District Attorney Fani Willis is proposing an October 23rd trial date. It would be the earliest case to go to court. The federal election interference case could happen in January of 2024. The hush-money case in Manhattan in March and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents trial possibly in May, not to mention a civil trial on the same day as the Iowa caucuses. A judge presiding over the Georgia case approved the October date for Kenneth Chesebro, an architect of the fake electors scheme. And now Sidney Powell is requesting a speedy trial. This could get even messier given Trump's history of trying to delay proceedings against him. Joining me now in studio defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. Shan, your thoughts on -- we just laid out there how the calendar is getting really complicated, and you're starting to see these co- defendants look out for themselves to some extent. Some wanted a speedy trial. Some want the case moved to federal court. How is this going to get sorted out?",

      "sentences": "Well, the problem for the prosecution isn't that they're not ready for the case, and they're ready for the speedy trial motions, too. They can go fast. The problem is this critical mass of defendants is going to start to split and go in different directions. That's good for the defense. They don't want to be all sitting there in one mass being treated as the single entity there.So even the speedy trial motion ironically ends up becoming a delay issue because if someone gets that granted, they're going to go first. And then others are going to want to sever, they don't want to go at the same time. So it all starts to kind of discombobulate that way. The speedy trial motion for the ones that go first is very helpful for the defense because they get to preview the case, get to analyze the strengths and the weaknesses of how strong the prosecution's case is going to be. So all of this not unexpected, but will definitely result in more delay.",

It will cause some delay which, again, is part of the tactic. I think the problem for Meadows is the same problem he has in theprosecution. He can say I'll just be the chief of staff arranging phone calls. The problem is, you're outside the orbit of what you normally would do legally as the chief of staff. Arranging a call for the president to pressure Raffensperger, being part of these ideas for fake electors, that's outside the scope of what his authority is.

It sounds like you're on the same page.There's a report from \"The Boston Globe\" that just came out that says that the New Hampshire secretary of state is now going to seek some legal advice on whether Trump is disqualified from that first-in-the- nation primary after receiving several letters on this.

Congressman, great to see you. Thanks for taking the time. Donald Trump won Ohio by eight points in 2016 and 2020. I think that's right. He's had a pretty solid lock on your state I guess for almost eight years now. Do you think that these legal issues are having any impact there, or is it the same phenomenon that we're seeing in other states, among Republicans it's just not moving the needle much? TIM RYAN (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM OHIO: Yes. I think it's going to be probably very similar. In the primary he'll continue to have a lock with deniers. You know, just from the debate the other night, everybody wearing a red tie and a blue jacket. You know, like Trump, they're all in line, they're all raising their hand to support him again. But in Ohio, Jim, midwestern values. I mean, this dude has been indicted four times this year, right. One time it's like, OK, maybe there was some conspiracy. Two, eh.

We do know that at least one person died in the series of shootings back in 2015. And then in 2021 there was a young man that was simply watching the parade, according to the district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, when an individual that he did not know walked up to him and then stabbed him in the neck killing him.So as a result, what we have seen is Boston PD really sort of boost their numbers at this event to make sure that people feel safe, to reassure them. And that's really the tone that they tried to strike today as they were offering an update, again trying to sort of separate this incident that took place this morning from the parade itself. But what is for certain, it obviously is tragic that this event that usually draws so many families from the Boston area, at least did pause this way, albeit temporarily.",

And the Kremlin still vehemently denies any involvement in the crash. Meanwhile, there's a growing memorial to Prigozhin in St. Petersburg, Russia. Take a look that. Flowers, flags, pictures, and even a symbolic sledgehammer were placed at the makeshift site. Let's bring in retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the former European Affairs director for the National Security Council. Colonel Vindman, great to see you, as always. Thanks for joining us. The Pentagon said that Prigozhin was likely killed in the crash. I guess you always have -- with the Russians, you always have to have a bit of skepticism. And U.S. and Western officials tell CNN they believe it was deliberate, but they say there's no indication a missile was launched. Lots of speculation. What's your take on things so far? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN, (RETIRED) &amp; FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Frankly, the means of Prigozhin's murder are less relevant than the culprit or the mastermind behind it, which is Vladimir Putin. Yes, there are different theories. Initially it was air defense missile shot him down. Now supposedly a bomb on the plane. I mean, it really doesn't make a difference. The bottom line is that he was murdered by Putin to settle a score, to strengthen Putin's own hand, his own leadership in government, at least for the short term. That's probably true. And the results of this may actually have some positive effects on the war. It frees Putin up from criticism, it silences the voices of naturalist actors that have been criticizing Putin for not doing enough, and may free his hand, give him freedom to maneuver to look for other options. Maybe that may mean testing the Waters for some peace negotiations, especially as the rest of the Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely to go relatively well and put a huge amount of pressure on Putin. So I think Putin is the murderer, that's clear.",

Is that essentially what you're saying in a weird and twisted way, this may give Putin some flexibility to negotiate his way out of this, get out of this situation that he's gotten himself in?",

Very skilled pilot. Had the kind of swagger that pilots, fighter pilots have. And it's a loss not just because he was an excellent spokesman but that he was one of the best-known, possibly one of the best fighter pilots that the Ukrainians had. I think this was likely an accident. So F-16s on that count maybe don't mean that much. What it does mean is saving the lives of many, many more Ukrainian pilots that will be able to effectively employ advanced aircraft against Russian air defense systems, against Russian aircraft. And employ those aircraft to advance the military aims, destroy Russian forces, provide close air support. One other thing I want to mention on the topic of Prigozhin. You know, in the same breath that we witnessed brutality of Putin, we also had a debate in which the entirety of the Republican establishment and, frankly, the frontrunner, Donald Trump, continue to believe that there is a way to negotiate through appeasement, through capitulation with Vladimir Putin, that this is the way to separate Russia from China.

What prevents him from making whatever gains he gets from these guys, these Republicans that are appeasers, and then going on and strengthening his hand and his cooperation with China? Nothing. I think the only thing we could do is really continue to support Ukraine, arm Ukraine, make sure they're successful on the battlefield. And that, with all the internal pressure in Russia, including the fact that the war's going quite badly, Putin freeing up bandwidth by eliminating his right-wing criticism, that may be enough to start to work around to negotiations.
