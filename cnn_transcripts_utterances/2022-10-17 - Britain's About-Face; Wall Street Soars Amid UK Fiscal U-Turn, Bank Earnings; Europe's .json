Let'stake a look and see how pretty much in the green all day, 555 points higher. Those are the markets and these are the main events. A full retreat: UK Finance Minister, Jeremy Hunt abandons nearly all of Liz Truss' economic plan. Ukraine's Finance Minister says the country is on stable economic ground despite ongoing attacks from Russia. And the Bank of America says the US consumer is still spending despite recession fears. Coming to you live from New York, it is Monday, October 17th, I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, the UK's new Finance Minister is scrapping nearly all of his predecessor's fiscal plan. Jeremy Hunt says the government needs to be responsible and is promising stability in public finances. The pound rose with the announcement the previous plan has caused financial turmoil. The pound fell to multidecade lows and bond yields soared, forcing the Bank of England to intervene. On his fourth day as Chancellor, Mr. Hunt told Parliament what was at stake. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In her campaign, Liz Truss promised tax cuts and help with soaring energy bills. Now, Number 11 is scrapping most of those policies, which would have required heavy, heavy borrowing and that raises questions about the Conservative Party's future direction whether it will be pro-growth at all costs or whether it will favor fiscal responsibility and appeasing financial markets. Bianca Nobilo is in London following the political implications. We've also got Mark Stewart on the economic angle joining me live now from New York. Bianca, let me start with you. Liz Truss was actually late to the House of Commons today. What do you make of her body language when she did actually show up? She looked so defeated to me. Her eyes were staring down at her feet. The overwhelming emotion I saw in her face was shame. It was humiliation. She looked mortified.",

There was no element of being relaxed. You can see it there, how she is sitting up prim in a controlled fashion, almost as if she is trying to be impervious to everything that's occurring around her, and I'm not surprised because she was late, as you mentioned, and when Penny Mordaunt who we see that to the left of the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt was standing in for the Prime Minister, the attacks on Liz Truss were blistering, with MPs pointing out that she is clearly no longer in charge, that if her economic policies and the mandate that she built for herself as fragile as it was, has now been completely dismantled by the Chancellor, then why is she even there? Many people questioning this evening, Zain, what she will do when she has to appear in front of this chamber in Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, when they say none of the policies are coming from her.

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, a lot of Jeremy Hunt's speech focused on themes about stability and confidence, which he really needed tosay, not only to Members of Parliament, but to Wall Street and the rest of the world because as we have seen, in recent weeks, global markets in many ways have been shaken by this financial disarray, if you will, in the United Kingdom. So today, we saw the FTSE after some very wobbly days close with some gains. The DAX in Germany closed in the green. There's even a rally taking place today, as you mentioned off the top of the show here in the United States with all the major indexes, some of it could be because of bank earnings, but you also cannot discount what happened to United Kingdom. I was looking at some analysis early this morning by Deutsche Bank, and it pointed out that you really cannot underestimate just how much the relatively small UK market has buffeted global markets in recent weeks. There is the UK economy, but also these are investments in bonds, in gilts, as well as other financial tools that extend well beyond the UK's border. So right now, Jeremy Hunt needs to basically be a CEO and tell the world there is a roadmap for the future. There is a plan that is one way to bring some calm to what have been a very turbulent market -- Zain. ASHER;\tAnd Bianca, let me bring you back in. I mean, you touched on this earlier, we obviously don't know why Liz Truss was late today, what else she had going on; I have no idea what could have been more important than being in the House of Commons today, but we talked about Penny Mordaunt standing in for her. There were several Labour MPs who joked, you know, look, is the Prime Minister sort of cowering under her desk? Is she too afraid to face politicians today? Could there be a sprinkle, obviously, we don't know why she wasn't there, but could there be a sprinkle of truth to that?",

Now, no doubt they did address the fragility of her position and the strength of opinion within the Conservative Party at the moment that's growing that she can't continue. It's also a curious judgment call, because of course, she is the Prime Minister and she could have quite reasonably and justifiably postponed that to appear in the House of Commons and try and regain that authority. Also, significantly, Zain, in the last 20 minutes or so since I actually left my desk, a fifth Conservative MP has come out and called for the Prime Minister to go saying that her position is untenable. So that is sort of within the last 24 to 48 hours now, we have five. There were three of them yesterday that came out; now, we've had two today. We know how this rhythm can go, there can be trickles of MPs and then a flood, and that can add more pressure on the Prime Minister's position. So far, we don't have any Ministers or members of government, that's when things get really, really difficult. But I think it's just another sign that her position does not look sustainable and I have no doubt that when she faces the House of Commons on Wednesday, if she does that, that will be a brutal and grueling political experience for the Prime Minister.",

So, there are a few lessons here, Ithink, for everyone, including the UK authorities, but others as well. The first lesson is that fiscal expansion, particularly if it is large, unfunded, and poorly targeted, we will face indeed, market pressures, pushback from analysts, even from the IMF, as we have seen the case of UK. Second message, I think, is that if there is certainly a case of being better coordinated in terms of fiscal policy and monetary policy, Bank of England is tightening interest rates, hike interest rates, trying to slow down the economy, at the same time that fiscal policy is easing, it is like driving a car and stepping on the brake and accelerate at the same time, it doesn't work. And last but not least, authorities have to be mindful of unforeseen side effects, as we have seen with turmoil in the gilt market, and the pension fund and so on in the UK.",

The Central Bank, therefore, in the UK will have to hike again. We're looking for at least another 75 basis points hike next time, and the terminal policy rate, so to speak, we think will be much higher than previously was the case, maybe all the way to four and a half percent. So last fiscal easing, as we have now helps a little bit relative to what we had before. However, it does not prevent the Central Bank, the Bank of England from having to hike rates either anyway, in order to contain inflation, which is too high for comfort.",

Bank of America share is up six percent after thisearnings beat that I think helped to paint the picture of resiliency for both Main Street and Wall Street. They said deposits were up, loan growth was up, that's encouraging. Brian Moynihan, the CEO, he said people are still spending money, maybe not as aggressively as they were, but they are still spending. And Bank of America's of fixed income trading and trading revenue overall was up. At the same time, we do have to talk about what's going on in the currency market because the dollar has been so strong for so long, and that has been a negative for the US stock market. That has reversed, the dollar is down significantly against the euro today, down big against the pound on that reversal by the British government on the tax cut plan. So again, that has been seen as a positive. And I think some of the Fed fears are maybe easing just a bit for the moment. I mean, Treasury yields have stopped going straight up. That has been a positive for the stock market and St. Louis Fed President, Jim Bullard, he was out on Friday, talked to Reuters, and he said that he favors the Fed going big with rate hikes in both November and December. But -- and this is key -- he wants the Fed to pause after that. And I think that anytime, Zain, we've seen even just a hint of the Fed pivoting away from these monster interest rate hikes, we have seen markets rally and that is happening again today.",

I think the keys are going to be what these tech companies say about supply chain stress and inflationary pressure. I mean, is it getting better? Is it getting worse? When do they see a light at the end of the tunnel? Also, what do they say about that strong dollar? How is that hurting their profits? And of course, whether or not these companies see a risk of a recession in the United States or around the world in the coming months. And remember, because tech companies are just such a big part of the overall stock market today, I do think that what these companies report and the tone that they set in their outlooks, that is going to be a critical factor for the markets in the coming weeks.",

Well, this is something that happens today, obviously, also, in the wake ofthose attacks that we saw on Kyiv with that massive destruction that was called -- caused thereby those four drones - kamikaze drones that impacted Ukrainian capital. Well, here in the Dnipro region, a power plant was attacked by drones as well. And the authorities here say that the damage to that power plant was extensive. They said there was a massive fire that broke out and that took rescue crews a very long time to put that fire out. And the big impact that this had is something that you probably see behind me, is the city is really dark right now. That's because the authorities are calling on people to use as little electricity as possible as they try to get these problems fixed. And it's something that I've seen -- that I think we've seen throughout Ukraine, where the damage to the infrastructure that these drone strikes, especially kamikaze drone strike caused, they are -- they are quite extensive throughout the entire country. The Ukrainians say that they are trying to repair things as fast as possible, but of course, the more often strikes like this occur, the more they're going to have to do and the more difficult is going to be for them to try and come to terms with all of this. Of course, today, the main focal point wasn't the Ukrainian capital, but there as well. It was first and foremost a power plant that was hit.

They say that none of this is true, that this is all political in nature. The Ukrainians, though, are not having any evidence. It's been quite interesting to see a big change in the tone coming from the Ukrainians. In fact, the Ukrainian foreign minister, he says today that he had never in his entire time as a politician called for sanctions against Iran. But right now, that is exactly what the Ukrainians are doing because they say there have been so many strikes using these Iranian-made drones, that it's really damaging, obviously, and it's causing a lot of lives here in Ukraine as well. The Iranians today, once again, said that they are not party to this conflict, that they are not on either side of this, that they've never provided any sort of weapons. But certainly, the Ukrainians say from what is crashing into their infrastructure that it looks exactly like the Shaid 136 drone that the Iranians make, even though of course, now it has Russian markings on it. In fact, there was some parts of those drones that were shown by Ukrainian politicians and forces here in Kyiv, which they say clearly shows that these are parts of Shahid drones. And the Ukrainian side of things are very, very dangerous for them because they are cheap, they loiter for a very long time, and they attack in swarms.
