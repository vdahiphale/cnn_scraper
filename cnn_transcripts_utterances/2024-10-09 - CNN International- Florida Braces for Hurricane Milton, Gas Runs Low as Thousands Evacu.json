I'm Omar Jimenez, and this it this is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, millions of people brace across Florida for Hurricane Milton expected to hit the coast early on Thursday. There are warnings it could be one of the most destructive storms the U.S. has ever seen. Meanwhile, signs of a gas shortage as thousands of people heed warnings to get to safety. Look at that line, they are trying to get out of the storm area. And we are live across the Middle East as well, as Israel claims to have occupied a village in Southern Lebanon.We'll start with our hurricane. In less than less than 24 hours, Hurricane Milton will roar ashore on Florida's western coast and the storm is now a Category-4 hurricane, packing winds of 160 miles per hour, 257 kilometers per hour, and there are still big questions as to where it will make landfall and how strong it will be.

I saw the long lines at grocery store and supply areas where people were getting those essential needs. Listen, I think a lot of people did heed the warning. With a little help of Hurricane Helene, they saw how horrible it can be, and this is going to be a lot worse. You know a lot of years we talk about hurricanes coming -- two years ago, catastrophic, worst hurricane in the history of Florida was coming right for Tampa Bay and it changing and it went to the Fort Myers, Naples area. These storms are unpredictable. That's why they call them the cones of uncertainty. Because of the uncertainty, I think everyone saw during Helene, when they, this time they called for seven-feet storm surge and we got every inch of that storm surge. Now, they're being prepared. We knew then that a lot of people didn't heed the warnings. They almost became a little too complacent. The good part was as the winds never became too sustained over 40 miles an hour and we never had to suspend service. We conducted over thousand rescues with our amphibious vehicles, our marine unit, with airboats. This storm is going to be different. When it becomes too dangerous, we are going to have to suspend services, just too risky for our personnel who will be prepared and ready for that after-storm response. So imagine that sickening feeling that I can't even think about, when you figure it out, like, hey, I shouldn't be here. Hey, I need help, and help is not coming. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are extremely worried here about the impacts. We heard from Derek Van Dam there that even though the storm surge expectations for the Tampa Bay have lowered to eight to 12 feet, that is still much higher than the worst-case that we saw from Helene. I'm keeping an eye on Hillsborough Bay right now, in front of Tampa General Hospital, the region's only level-one trauma center. During Helene, Omar, this got so bad here, the storm surge actually reached the walls of TGH, something that we had never seen before. And now, with Milton, we are looking at potentially a war situation depending again, on landfall. Debris, that's another major concern. We have seen a flurry of activity yesterday and even into today of dump trucks trying to get all of this Helene storm damage out of the neighborhoods because if we are looking at potential peak winds of up to 115 miles per hour, that's going to lift pieces of plywood, all sorts of things, and make them into flying projectiles. That is dangerous for homes. That is dangerous for people that might still be in the area. So, still a flurry of activity before people have hunkered down ahead of Milton. Omar?",

Now, Harris is staying across events in Florida, but she is also expected to virtually join U.S. President Joe Biden for a briefing on the storm before heading to Las Vegas later today.And President Biden had this to say about the massive storm. Well, he was essentially just talking about the seriousness of this storm and making sure to be prepared for it. CNN's Eva McKend joins us from Washington with more. So Eva, look, as a candidate, you are -- and a vice president, you are balancing running for president, while also supporting the administration in your job as vice president. How is she balancing those commitments, especially with this response to Hurricane Milton? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  You know, Omar, as you can imagine, it is a delicate balance and we saw the campaign be nimble enough to switch gears during the last hurricane when she cut her swing out west short to come back to be briefed by FEMA. She is continuing to knock the former president for politicizing the crisis, arguing Trump has no empathy for others as he continues to spread misinformation about the federal response to Hurricane Helene. She has also talked about this issue at length during her media appearances to really illustrate that this is top of mind for her. She described traveling to both Georgia and North Carolina to survey the impact of the hurricane, emphasizing the pain and shock people are still in, and extending her empathy and reinforcing that there are federal resources available. She is urging people to access those resources and not listen to disinformation and to really heed the advice of local officials at this time and get out of harm's way if they are in a position to do so. So, she is still going to be on the campaign trail as for now, but just like the last time, Omar, if it is evident that she needs to return to Washington, she will likely do so.",

She anchored herself in Pittsburgh during that five- day stretch to prepare for the debate. And then she has since returned to Pennsylvania several times. And so, we see the campaign just leaving no stone unturned, Omar, as they try to get their message out there, consolidate the various coalitions and try to appeal to undecided voters, voters that or maybe conservative, have no appetite for Former President Trump and would otherwise stay home.

      "sentences": "Well, we've heard the Israeli prime minister over the course of the last week make a number of addresses, direct addresses to the Lebanese people, at least that's how he is framing them. And in them, there's clearly this implicit threat that if Hezbollah doesn't stop firing rockets, if Hezbollah doesn't agree to put down its arms, then Israel could do to Lebanon what it has done in Gaza, and that is to say the displacement of millions of people, the destruction of hundreds of thousands of homes and of course, potentially the deaths of many, many people as well.And so, his comments are very much being viewed as a threat, even as the Israeli military insists that for now at least, the Israeli ground operations in Lebanon are limited and targeted raids limited to the areas closest to the Lebanese-Iran border. But I think what's also clear is that the Israeli prime minister, in conjunction with the military action on the ground, the strikes that have been taking place in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, is trying to squeeze Hezbollah right now. And he is trying to squeeze them by putting pressure not just on Hezbollah itself, but on the citizens of Lebanon as well, and on the Lebanese government and the other political factions that exist in Lebanon. There is certainly a thought process within the Israeli government right now, that they believe the combination of military pressure as well as the diplomatic pressure that is currently being leveled on Hezbollah could be complemented by internal political pressure in Lebanon and could ultimately, potentially produce some kind of a diplomatic agreement. Now, we know that Hezbollah for its part has indicated now that they are open to a ceasefire negotiations but it is not clear exactly what that would entail. Would that be something akin to the three-week ceasefire that the U.S. had previously offered, but says is no longer on the table, or would they be open to some kind of a much longer-term ceasefire, which is ultimately what Israel is looking for here, some kind of a diplomatic agreement that would see Hezbollah forces pull far away from the Israel-Lebanon border, removing the threat of that Hezbollah poses to Northern Israel to allow the return of those 60,000 or so Israeli civilians who have been displaced from their homes. It is not clear that Hezbollah is open to a grand bargain like that. In the past, what they have made clear is that if Israel stops its war in Gaza, then Hezbollah will also put down its arms.

There is a concern, not really so much about the possible Israeli response to that missile strike by the Iranians that took place at the beginning of last week, but for all of this to possibly lead to some wider conflict in the Middle East, that in the end could pit the United States and Iran against one another.At the same time, publicly, we do have a lot of defiance and certainly bullishness also, on the part of those who are in power here. In fact, I'm currently on a place called Revolution Square and I want to show you over there is a huge billboard that's been put up, which essentially shows Iranian strikes on various places inside Israel and that writing up there, it reads, 'if you want war, we are the masters of war.' So that is the message that those who are in power here in Iran are trying to send. And if you look very closely, you actually see that that writing is both in Farsi, but in Hebrew as well.

First, they're trying to get the necessary resources into those devastated communities, but they are also grappling with misinformation about how exactly their federal response has played out. President Biden yesterday said that those who are spreading misinformation are un-American. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg this morning said that there is a massive misinformation problem that is simply making it difficult for officials on the ground to do their job and get the necessary resources to the people who need it most.Now, one way that the White House is hoping to combat some of this misinformation is by launching a Reddit page. They said -- a Reddit account, I should say. They said that they will be posting information on that page relating to their various response efforts. So far, there's been about a three posts that they've made, one highlighting President Biden's briefing relating to the response efforts and preparations for Hurricane Milton, other specifically looking at the resources that are available to North Carolina and Georgia. Now, it comes as the issue of Hurricane Helene has really become a political flashpoint on the campaign trail. President -- Former President Donald Trump is among those who has been promoting some of these false narratives about what the federal government is doing in response to the hurricane and how they are utilizing their resources. You heard Vice President Kamala Harris there criticize those who are spreading this misinformation saying that it is irresponsible, but it really speaks to one of the challenges facing Harris, not just politically, but also in just trying to get resources to people on the ground in these devastated communities. Now at the same time, the White House is also making in preparations for Hurricane Milton, pre-deploying resources to Florida as they expect that storm to hit in just a few hours. They are sending in airlift teams, high-water rescue vehicles, as well as other search and rescue teams to try to help in the response and recovery efforts. They are already setting up possible deployments of millions of food and meals and water to head into those communities. President Biden, last night, spoke with the Mayor of Clearwater, Florida and also the Head of Pinellas County, as he tried to talk about and see what they would need in response to this hurricane. President Biden and vice president Harris will receive a briefing around noon about the preparation efforts and then President Biden will be speaking later tonight around 5:30 p.m. Eastern, as this hurricane is barreling towards Florida Coast. So, the White House trying to do all that they can in this moment to help these communities in anticipation of this storm coming, while also battling those misinformation efforts with they say are simply making it more complicated for people to do their jobs and get these resources to the people who need it most.",

Officials did voice some concern about, in addition to all the worries, the construction towers that are all over this growing city here, in these Category-4 winds, those could come down. And they admitted they don't have enough time to disassemble them before landfall. But honestly, even if they were to come down in a worst-case scenario, so much of this area is evacuated, it may not cost a lot of life.What is really worrisome is that mound of water being pushed by Category-5 winds less than 500 miles away from this part of Tampa. Keep in mind, the last time a major storm hit this part of Florida, hundred years ago, the population has gone up by about 3.5 million people and sea level has gone up by a foot.

Of course, we know that southwest Florida will see that eye wall come ashore, but there will still be forecast to be hurricane force winds by the time the worst of Milton comes to central Florida where I am here in Orlando. I'm at a Home Depot here, so there has been a steady stream of people coming here to buy those last-minute supplies -- the flashlights, the batteries, some plywood even this late in the game, generators.I spoke with the store manager who says there are supplies still available, but they will be closing at three o'clock today to prepare for the storm as well. The amusement parks here, the Disney Parks will start shutting down at about 1:00 p.m. in stages today. And it really is an interesting place here, this part of Florida, because you have both the people who are trying to evacuate Florida, the tourists from around the country and around the world who want to get out of the way of this hurricane, but also the people who have evacuated to Orlando to get away from the coastal areas that are anticipating that massive deadly storm surge. Storm surge here, Omar, is not the major concern though. As I said, there will be that hurricane force wind that comes through later today until early tomorrow, so there will be downed trees and downed power lines. So there will be outages. It is the flooding that is the major concern here, up to 15 inches of rain forecast for this part of Florida, so the creeks, the retention ponds, Lake Davis which flooded and isolated communities from Ian in 2022, just cannot accommodate that much water. We know that the city crews have been out trying to clear drains to prepare for the storm that's coming. The Mayor, Buddy Dyer, who has been here for 20 years, more than 20 years, so he was here leading this community through 2004 when there was Charley, Francis, Ivan, and Jeanne, four hurricanes hitting Florida over six weeks. So with Helene just two weeks ago, he does have that experience how to navigate this, with storm so close to one another. He will be meeting at the top of the hour with the emergency operations managers to make sure that everything is in place and when the emergency operation center goes into full operation in about eight hours from now, at 4:00 p.m. local to prepare for Milton.

In the Fort Myers region as of last night, almost a third of the gas stations had no fuel. And in the Tampa area, according to GasBuddy, almost half of the gas stations had no fuel. Now, GasBuddy says that fuel is flowing, but it is just that demand that is the problem. And they say that the best bet if you still need gas and you're trying to get out of the area, is to go to the major travel stops or any of the big chains. Now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he addressed this yesterday. He said that the state is doing everything they can to try to bring emergency supplies of fuel to the stations that need it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R-FL):  We have been dispatching fuel over the past 24 hours as gas stations have run out. Now, there is no fuel shortage. Fuel continues to arrive in the state of Florida by port and what we are doing to bring it in on the ground. But lines at gas stations have been long.
