Taking alook at US stocks, you can see, the Dow is up about three-tenths of a percent, the S&amp;P half a percent, and the NASDAQ the big winner up 1.02 percent. US stocks there getting a late session lift. That's thanks to the latest Fed Minutes. Those are the markets and these are the main events: The era of supersized rate hikes may be ending. That is the main takeaway from the minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting. Violence breaks out at a major iPhone manufacturing hub in China as workers clash with police. And as other media giants tighten their belts, James Cameron is making a $2 billion box off his bet at his new movie to light up the silver screen. An expensive bet. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, November 23rd. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest and I too, mean business. Tonight, the era of supersized rate hikes could be over with Federal Reserve officials favoring slowing rate rises soon. That was the prevailing view presented in the Minutes from the latest Fed meeting, the Dow surging on its release, you can see it's up about a hundred points, or three-tenths of a percent. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ also given an immediate boost. So, after four straight hikes of 75 basis points, the markets expect the Fed to slow to a half percentage point rise next month. Just how big an impact its fight against inflation has had is now being put to the test. And the countdown to Thanksgiving, today is the biggest travel day of the year and the biggest shopping day of the year is on Friday. We are heading into the Holiday season, apparently in a bad mood, not me, but apparently others in a bad mood. Consumer Sentiment falling to a four-month low amid higher cost of living. We'll get to that. Catherine Rampell is a columnist at \"The Washington Post,\" and she joins me now from Palm Beach, Florida. Catherine, always good to have you. Thanks for being with us. So this news from the Fed meetings essentially slowing rate hike, maybe half a percent the next time they meet, it seems as if the Fed is finally starting to feel like maybe we should take our foot off the brake a bit and sort of see how these interest rate hikes are really playing out in the real economy. What are they going to be looking for?",

And in fact, if you look at the Fed Minutes today, you know, they're sort of opaque, but they indicate that some of the members are concerned that we haven't yet seen the full consequence in terms of labor market effects and financial stability, and other things of the rate hikes that they've already put into effect. So, I think we're going to see them watching price growth going forward, as well as what happens in the labor market, what happens in financial markets, and they will have some very difficult choices to make.",

So consumers are just exhausted, they're financially strapped. They are coming into the Holiday season, knowing that they need to make a lot of purchases, as they always do this time of year, and everything has gotten more expensive. Hopefully, there will be some discounts, but they don't know it for sure that that will be the case. And you know, there is also this sort of darkening of the global economic outlook that we may have a recession next year and the Fed obviously wants to avoid that. They've said that they can engineer a so-called soft landing, but it does look pretty likely, or at least there is a high likelihood that there will be a recession, which means those Americans who have been struggling with paying their bills with, you know, with higher cost of groceries, may have less income coming and may lose their jobs altogether, and that may make people concerned, understandably.

You point out it could work in their favor that they'll be showing in China. But of course, as you know, China is still dealing with the unpredictability of zero COVID. Is that a net positive? If anything it seems like a wildcard.",

Andto have this movie available in more territories, more countries around the world, is really important. I think it is a blockbuster that is needed right now. This is coming in the wake of \"Black Panther:  Wakanda Forever,\" which is up to about $552 million worldwide and has only been out 2.5 weeks now. We have in the domestic market as well as other countries around the world, we have a big holiday period coming up. So that will be really important and I think having movies like \"Avatar\" are going to set the stage for 2023, which we are hoping to be a much bigger year at the box office in 2022. But it's amazing how strong the box office has come up over the past couple of years, given the challenges facing this theatrical landscape.",
