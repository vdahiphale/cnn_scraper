I want to give you a warning. We're going to show you one of these photos. I want to give you a chance to look away from the television before we show you this photo. Two of the photos that Israel says show two babies burned beyond recognition. We are not going to show you.We're about to show you just one of these images. This photo that you are now seeing is a baby's body stained with blood. We've blurred the face of the baby. CNN cannot verify where these were taken or who the baby is. These have been released to the world and shared with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Secretary of State Blinken spoke about those images as well today. I want to bring in Leon Panetta, formerly the U.S. Secretary of Defense under President Obama. Secretary Panetta, appreciate you being with us. With so much violence and so much outrage about the attack that took place here starting Saturday morning, the risk of obviously a wider war growing that might involve certainly other countries, I'm wondering what you make of this situation that we are in right now.",

More than two million people there, many -- there are many people living in Gaza who do not like Hamas but are powerless to stop them. Is there any chance you believe that Egypt would agree to allow large numbers of civilians from Gaza to cross over the border? And I mean, it seems that seems highly unlikely given Egypt's refusal to do that in the past.",

A lot of casualties. And I guess my hope is that Israel is thinking about exactly what are their goals here? What do they want to achieve? I know Netanyahu has talked about totally destroying Hamas. But what are those goals they want to achieve? And what is an endpoint ultimately look like? Because if the end result is occupancy of Gaza, that's not going to be a pretty picture either.",

And it was a positive movement that we were developing the Abraham Accords and getting moderate Arab countries to join those accords and recognize Israel. And that effort would have been climaxed in many ways if we were able to get Saudi Arabia to have been a part of the Abraham Accords. Because that would have meant that the major moderate nations, Arab nations, would have recognized Israel, and then they could all have focused on the Palestinian issue and how to resolve that issue.So I hope that we -- I know it's obviously not a good time now -- but that we ultimately continue that diplomatic effort. Because ultimately, regardless of what happens with this war, the fact is we have got to find a peaceful solution to the issue of how Palestinians, Israelis and Arabs all live together in the same part of the world.",

But I will say this, President Trump's record on Israel is clear. He has been supportive of Israel over the years. He is the one who moved the embassy to Jerusalem. So I think he's got a clear record of support for Israel. I don't think there's any question about that.
