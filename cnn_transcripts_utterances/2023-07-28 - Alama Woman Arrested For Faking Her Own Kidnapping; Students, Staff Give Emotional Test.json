      "sentences": "Yeah, Ryan, so obviously a lot of concern, right, by the community and others. I think the really the country as a community being concerned about her looking and really leaving no stone on turn so that she can be safe, et cetera, et cetera coming to find out that it was all false. And so obviously there's a lot of disappointed people with respect to the charges, that's what really the law demands as it relates to Alabama law concerning you reporting to law enforcement and that being false. And then of course filing a false report that being false also misdemeanors, what's the difference between that and felony a world, right? The essence though is only punishable by up to a year in jail.With regard to the defenses, I mean, at the end of the day, this is a young woman and many people for a variety of reasons suffer a lot of different things. You know, we don't know what those were. What was happening with her such that she could have done this. We're not as bad as we are now worst day. We're not as good as we are in our best day. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. And so, you know, again, in terms of mitigation, I think, you know, while it's, of course, many people are judging her and this what she did was abhorrent and shouldn't have been done. At the end of the day, she has a long life to live. And as a 26-year-old woman, you could only hope that she'll get the assistance and help she needs to live it, live it well and perhaps pay a debt to society, which will transcend this day. And so I think her attorney, Boris, will be looking for what we call mitigation and redeeming qualities. And her attorney already indicated all of this was false. All this was a hoax. And I think they're moving forward in doing that and accepting blame, accepting responsibility and looking to move forward in a way that she's not so punished that it would cripple her life.",

And I think her attorneys will acknowledge that, listen, you know, obviously there needs to be some punishment here because this is not acceptable behavior.As it relates to deterrent, you want to be stiff enough where people know that this is not acceptable, that resources being dedicated to her and finding her and people coming together for something as a hoax. We don't want other people to do that. And so we want them to be deterred. At the same time, there's a rehabilitative element and that I think her attorneys will seize on, saying that she is a young woman. She does have a lot more to give. We don't know what the essence of her issues and maladies or what she was going through would lead her to do this. But certainly, you know, is it the worst thing? It's bad. But, you know, no one fortunately is dead or anything else. And I think they'll be looking for the judge and prosecutor to go lightly on her as a result of that. But to be sure, I think based on the resources and based on the coming together of the community bars and the diversion of those resources, there will be a punishment to be suffered without question.",

Some major banks now backing away from their recession forecast. Inflation as well, that continues to come down. All those indicators seem to be having an effect on the public. New numbers today show a boost in consumer confidence. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, he is in New York, has been looking at this.Vanessa, it's a whole collection of numbers here, right? That have defied some of the more pessimistic expectations when you look at the market, when you look at company earnings forecasts for interest. What picture is that saying about the way ahead? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Economists and analysts have been bracing all of us for recession, but what recession? These are very strong numbers that we've seen this week. The Federal Reserve saying itself that they can still stick that soft landing and Fed staff saying that they're not forecasting a recession any longer. But some of those big numbers, GDP, outperforming expectations, the U.S. economy growing by a healthy and strong 2.4%, despite 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And PCE, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, cooling in June, just up 3% year over year and 0.2% month over month. And as you mentioned, consumer sentiment at its highest level since October of 2021. So consumers actually feeling pretty good about the economy right now. And so is Wall Street, Jim. Wall Street is liking these numbers. That mixed with strong company earnings and with the Fed saying that they may pause in interest rate hikes for the remainder of the year. We've seen 13 straight days of gains in a row by the Dow. That's something we've never seen -- that we haven't seen, rather, Jim, since 1987.",
