Jury selection is back underway after a day off for this historic criminal trial of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Unlike what we saw earlier this week, Trump did not speak with the media before entering the courtroom. And while seven jurors were seated when we started today, one of those jurors was excused this morning over concerns about their identity being made public. Now, six more jurors are needed to fill out the panel, as well as up to six alternates. Now, the court has been working through another group of potential jurors, excusing more than half already, either because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial, or because they have other conflicts. Still, with the speedy pace we've seen so far this week, we could be, keyword \"could be\", on track to start opening statements as soon as Monday. But, we will see. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us now from Washington. Thanks for taking the time. Thanks for being here. Look, the judge has scheduled a hearing next week on social media posts, that prosecutors argue violate Trump's gag order. What more do we know about that?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Prosecutors raising seven more social media posts from Donald Trump today in court before jury selection got underway, and they were saying that these posts do violate the gag order on Donald Trump because they do specifically address the jury pool and the potential jury pool in this case, and we're seeing this happen all in real time. Donald Trump posting on his day off outside of court yesterday about reposting something from a Fox News host. It's essentially a theory that there were liberal activists that were trying to infiltrate the jury. There is, of course, no evidence to support that. But, prosecutors say that that does violate the terms of the gag order, and they're asking the judge to reprimand Donald Trump as a result. But, look, we also had a juror excused today. We had seated seven. Wehad seven on Tuesday. And this morning, one of those seven was excused because they found that they couldn't be fair and impartial anymore because of concerns that their identity had been compromised. The jurors in this case are anonymous. They're supposed to be anonymous to protect the integrity of the trial. This juror said that enough information about their identity had been out there publicly. And they received calls and texts from family members, from colleagues, from friends questioning whether or not they were a juror. So, the judge letting them go. We're back down to six, meaning we need six more jurors to be seated, plus about six alternates to be seated in order to have this trial move forward, as you mentioned, to the judge, was hopeful that we could get opening statements started on Monday. It will be interesting to see how this challenge with the jury, how these developments with removing -- losing a juror this morning, does that impact the timeline? But, jury selection is moving forward. It's underway right now. They're currently going through that 42-question questionnaire with the remaining jurors. There are 39 remaining jurors after about half, more than half were eliminated because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. Nine more were excused because they had other conflicts. So, we're going to work through this 39 remaining juror list one by one, and they're going to go through this 42-question questionnaire, and then, ultimately, that pool will be narrowed down, and we'll see how many jurors are seated as a result.",

And as there was one juror that I believe he is still on, he said something to the effect of he is fascinated or he has some fascination and wonder with Trump. That sounds like a pretty good juror to me.So, I think that's probably what they're looking for.

And so, when they go through the process, as soon as they're sworn in and paneled, that can be pretty jolting. And to a lot of jurors that has a big impact on how they see things. And now, that can be for a regular case. So, think about this case, Donald Trump, such an unprecedented trial. So, it's not that surprising that a juror who might be seated then all of a sudden realizes, wow, I didn't think I was going to be picked. I'm going to sit on the trial of a former President of the United States in this hush money falsifying business records case.So, it's going to be a challenge to do that. And I think that the judge is doing a good job of making sure that the -- there is a significant number who are going to self-eliminate so they don't waste time doing that and then will get to it. So, he is being efficient, and it can be done. But, there are hiccups along the way. And I think what happened with this one juror was probably one of them. It's not unheard of, but it's also not that common. JIMENEZ: And look, there were suggestions earlier this week that we could potentially be opening statements by Monday. I'm not going to throw that possibility out just yet. But, obviously, as you mentioned, sometimes complications come up. We started the day with impaneled.

On the other hand, you have this this push into Gaza or Rafah imminently, which, as you laid out, no world leaders want. And so, what do you make of the diplomatic push that has been made as of late because you sort of have these two objectives where you're not really seeing how effective it has been? HANCOCKSBut, on the other hand, you also have this diplomatic push trying to de-escalate the situation in the wider region following those Iranian strikes on Israel over the weekend, and the expectation that there will be some kind of response from Israel. They've made it clear that it is necessary for them to respond to this unprecedented attack. But, of course, the concerns that whatever the Israeli response might be, that it could escalate the situation. Now, U.S. officials familiar with what may happen say they believe or they get the impression that Israel is not looking to escalate the situation, is not looking for a wider regional conflict. And they hope that that would be reflected in the ultimate decision that they make. But, there is disagreement within Israel itself. There is disagreement within the war cabinet as to what exactly this response should be against the unprecedented attacks by Tehran. But certainly, there is great concern and there is diplomatic posturing and pressure on all sides to try and contain what is already a regional tension, not a regional conflict necessarily, but you have multiple fronts where these tensions are simmering over at this point. There is significant diplomatic efforts around the world to try and contain what is already a quite significantly tense situation. Rahel.",

The International Monetary Fund is reporting that the standout growth could also make America's inflation problem harder to solve. The IMF upgrading its forecasts for U.S. economic growth to 2.7 percent this year.

In the room just behind me, I've just seen go in there, Jay Powell, the head of the -- the Chair of the Federal Reserve, and Janet Yellen, who is, of course, the U.S. Treasury Secretary. Now, Jay Powell has admitted this week that he -- it is getting much harder to get U.S. inflation down to its two percent target. And therefore, an immediate cut in rate, some had hoped in the June meeting, maybe not on the cards. That is a positive in a sense. The markets take it as a negative. And if you're paying higher interest rates on your mortgage, then most certainly it's a negative. But, it does show the -- and judging by what the IMF Managing Director told me a short while ago, of all the economies that are around at the moment, it is the United States that's doing the heavy lifting at the moment of keeping the world's economic growth high.

FBI Director Christopher Wray saying that his agency is particularly concerned about so-called lone actors targeting Jewish gatherings or events. There has been a dramatic upward trend of antisemitic incidents since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7.

Now, in several cases, including the city of Las Vegas, authorities asked people to text 911 for life-threatening emergencies. Now, full service is back on and back in in some areas, although it's still unclear why the disruptions included a mix of both landline and mobile service. All right.

There is currently jurors in the juror box, and they're answering questions like, what sort of media do you consume? Have you ever attended a Trump rally? These are all things that could impact whether or not the defense or the prosecutors wants to try to strike them from the jury ultimately at the end of the day here. So, we are working through jury selection. But, like you said, maybe having to overcome a challenge of losing a juror this morning.

He is just quoting somebody.So, to remedy that, I think it would be better for the gag order to be broader and simpler. I mean, to use an analogy, I think it might want to take a Will Smith kind of style, which is just keep the juror's names, to keep the jurors out of your mouth. Don't even talk about them, I think that would be much easier to follow rather than trying to nuance it the way it's done.

Why are we not calling and talking to the EU who are at a greater threat of the fall of Ukrainians than America and allowing them to step up and do what they're supposed to be doing?And I have to argue the fact that our border is the priority. We have 70,000 to 100,000 people dying of fentanyl overdose, with Angel families that are going and increasing by the day, as we saw with Laken Riley, or even one of our own Florida House Representatives Kiyan Michael whose son was killed by a guy who had been deported three times.
