The search is now just over 24 hours in, and police are asking for the public's help in finding this man -- the man they suspect -- they believe gunned down the UnitedHealthcare CEO in what investigators consider a targeted attack and then disappeared into Central Park.Now this morning, ABC News is also reporting this detail that \"deny, defend, and depose\" were found on shell casings at the scene. A cellphone and a water bottle were also discovered. But at this hour it's unclear if police know his name or his identity or have a clear lead on where he could be at the moment. With me right now to talk more about this search and where it heads is bounty hunter Zeke Unger. He also works with the U.S. Marshal's Service often on fugitive matters. It's good to see you, Zeke.

If you look at the homicide investigation and the totality of the circumstances, you can see that they say he was laying in wait. I don't believe that because in order to do that you have to have prior information as to where the target is going to be and at what particular time.

KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND):  The drinking thing is a pretty significant issue -- whether you have a problem or don't have a problem, or you think you have a problem or you think you don't have  problem.

If he can get through, say, the next 48 hours without, kind of, another major story dropping, that's a step in the right direction certainly. But then as we get to next week the two most important meetings -- Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, right? Those are two of the -- kind of the prime swing votes for any cabinet nomination. So you combine them with Joni Ernst. Those are going to be the ones I'm watching most closely. Now, stepping back a little bit, with some of these nominees there is strength in numbers because who were we talking about five days ago? It was all about Kash Patel. So when you have a couple of these nominees, whether it's Tulsi or RFK, you divide the scrutiny. You divide the media attention and some of the outside money coming in where last time around it was really only Betsy DeVos that got a lot of that outside attention.

And the more the courts interfere with the policymaking process the less healthy our democracy is. We need to be continually working on our self-government. So I think that's a really important component of this case. But the other issue is there is a huge scientific dispute here. Every systematic analysis of the research shows minimal to no benefit to kids from these procedures, and the risks are huge. So there's a lot of enthusiasm on both sides of the argument.

If you give a girl testosterone to deal with gender dysphoria -- a psychological condition -- you are creating additional medical complications. And so the fact that sex is involved is only because every human being is one of two sexes, and it's necessarily part of it.
