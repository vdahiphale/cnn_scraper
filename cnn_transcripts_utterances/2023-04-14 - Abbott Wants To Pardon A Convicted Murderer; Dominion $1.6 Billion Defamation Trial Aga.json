All I wanted to do was incapacitate him. LAVANDERA (voice-over):  A Texas jury rejected his claims of self- defense. (On camera):  We reached out to Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office to find out if he was still pushing for a pardon of Daniel Perry given this new information that has come to life. His office responded with a simple one sentence statement which read, all pertinent information is for the Board of Pardons and Paroles to consider, as this is part of the review process required by the Texas constitution. And what he's referencing there is that the governor has to wait for the recommendation from that board before he can issue a pardon. But right now, there is no timeline on exactly when that will happen. In fact, we should all remember that this trial isn't even over yet. The sentencing hearing hasn't even been scheduled. Alisyn?

It is a false errand. It is doing great damage to our justice system. I will say here that, you know, this to me brings back memories of 2013 where a Black man who also was an Air Force veteran by the name of Michael Giles found himself sent to prison for defending himself with a firearm. And I think that the Republican Party does itself a great disservice when you have a person who is lawfully carrying an AK-47, when you look at the place of Michael Giles who is still in prison, by the way, 25 years, sent to rot in a jail cell, a man who raised his hand as this man did to serve his country. We do a great disservice when we don't say, yes, you have the right to defend yourself, yes, you have the right to bear arms, and then suddenly, when we don't like the cause for which you are bearing those arms, suddenly, all of a sudden, you're abandoned.

So, Misty, one of the questions they were asked, the lawyers got to ask the perspective jurors, do you regularly watch any Fox programs on television or any other social media and, if so, would this affect your ability to be fair and impartial, or do you avoid any Fox programs on television or social media, and will that affect your ability to be fair and partial?
