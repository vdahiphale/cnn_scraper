But they are the two and three in the race and I think that showed in the debate.I thought that Tim Scott was pretty low energy. I suspect this may be his last debate. He didn't really cut through very much, and did so with Chris Christie, who is, you know, effectively trying to be the anti-Trump candidate in a primary field that's not so interested in him. The wild card was Vivek Ramaswamy. Who went in there as a bit of a bomb thrower, but I -- but I think his act is wearing thin. I don't think he had an especially good debate.

You saw there some of the candidates take a softer line perhaps than we've seen in previous Republican primaries. I think there is a recognition among leading Republicans that in effect that, you know the Republican Party is the dog that had finally caught the car with the Dobbs decision. It was easy to criticize Roe v Wade, and that unified the party. But when it comes to actually deciding what the limits are on abortion, that turn -- turns out to be much more fraught.I think that the line that Haley and DeSantis want to effectively take is let's now leave this to the states to decide. Tim Scott came in with a much stronger line that there needed to be a national limit. Sorry my fire alarms going off. I don't know if you could hear that. But that was -- that was that was it was a test of clearly. But that was a -- that was a more interesting discussion on foreign policy -- on your point about foreign policy. I think that helped Nikki Haley tonight. She is the most experienced candidate, having been ambassador to the United Nations and that showed. It was also an area, broad agreement when it came to Israel, but when it came to Ukraine, you can see that there are cracks within the Republican Party about how strong to support the effort of the Ukrainians, again, against Russia. Ranging from Ramaswami, effectively calling Zelenskyy Nazi adjacent, to Nikki Haley taking the view that Trump has been too weak with the Russians.",

These are Hamas propaganda videos from the perspective of its fighters. Showing Hamas militants peering around buildings and through the rubble before striking armored vehicles.

The videos provide a limited window into the group's guerrilla tactics. And the threats Israeli forces face as they move deeper into Gaza. LT. COL.

Another one, they said they discovered a drone manufacturing and weapons manufacturing facility in a residential building next to a child's bedroom. There is an information war going on here. What Israel wants to show is that it is being careful to avoid civilian casualties, that it is simply targeting Hamas and Hamas's infrastructure, and that, you know, this is a just war that it is carrying out in order to protect its own civilians. Of course, it's also an information one. We've seen this from Hamas, of course, is projecting their perspective. And from Hamas's perspective, the more of these images, which are heartbreaking images of death and destruction and despair in the Gaza Strip. Then the more demonized Israel is going to be and the harder it is going to be for the United States, for example, to support Israel. And of course, the harder it's going to be for Israel's allies in the region, Arab allies in particular, to stay silent and or maintain, you know, relations with Israel.

The Pentagon says two U.S. F-15 fighter jets struck a weapons depot in eastern Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and other affiliated groups. But as Natasha Bertrand explains, the U.S. is taking a measured approach at striking back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: The U.S. conducted an air strike against a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria that U.S. officials say was being used by Iran and its proxy groups to store weapons that were being used to carry out attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria over the last several weeks. There have been over 40 such attacks in recent weeks since October 17th by Iran backed proxy groups on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria. And the U.S. says they conducted this strike, which is the second in just over two weeks on these kinds of weapons storage facilities in Syria, in order to degrade Iran and its proxy's ability to carry out these attacks in the future. They said that they are targeting this infrastructure in order to send a message to the Iranians that these attacks will not be tolerated and also to destroy their weapons stockpile. Now Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did release a statement about this and said that this strike was carried out in self-defense. It is a precision strike. And he emphasized that the U.S. does not want to see this war expand any further, but that the U.S. is committed to defending its troops and that it will do so in every possible scenario. And so Secretary Austin, other defense officials, really emphasizing that they are carrying out these strikes in limited self-defense in order to destroy Iranian weapons supplies. But that this does not indicate a broader desire by the U.S. to escalate the conflict any further. However, all of this comes on the same day that Houthis in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, they shot down MQ-9 Reaper drone that was carrying out surveillance activities over the Red Sea. And so this conflict obviously the U.S. is very concerned that it could spiral, that it could expand. But right now doing everything possible to take limited steps to try to defend U.S. troops as well as degrade these Iranian proxy group's ability to attack U.S. forces in the future.
