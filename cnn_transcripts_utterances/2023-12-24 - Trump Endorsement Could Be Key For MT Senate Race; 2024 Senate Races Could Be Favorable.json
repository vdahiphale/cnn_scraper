Just so viewers understand that the dynamic here in the United States, there are 23 Democratic seats that they are defending. That includes a Purple State like Arizona. That's where Kyrsten Sinema serves. She caucuses with Democrats. 11 GOP seats are being defended, but there are seven seats currently held by Democrats in purple, swing-ish states, as well as three in Trump states, states that Trump won, and really only two pickup opportunities, Florida and Texas.So Democrats are trying to hold on to all these seats. If they lose Montana, that could be the end of the majority. And that's why Republicans are fearful of this primary. I talked to Senator John Thune, who is number two Senate Republican, about the prospects of Matt Rosendale impacting this primary and potentially their chance of picking up the seat.

And he's done a really effective job so far in moving numbers out there. So we'll see what happens. You can't, you know, you can't control these things.

What kind of impacts are they going to have in the fight for the Senate?AMY WALTER, COOK POLITICAL REPORT PUBLISHER &amp; EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: So I think the way to look at the fight for the Senate is Montana is very critical, as you said, it's one of the just handful of red states that Democrats have to defend. But there are seven that they have to defend. And right now with West Virginia basically off the table, that means the Senate right now is 50-50. And if Donald Trump wins the presidency, the Senate is already in Republican hands. So the map is more than Montana. It's that Democrats need to go seven for seven. Montana looks the easiest because it's red, and Ohio is the next because it's red. But easy for Republicans, I'm sorry. Easiest to knock, for Republicans to knock off because those are red. But even if you say, OK, well, let's say, Tester holds on, Democrats still have to be able to hold on to Ohio and Arizona and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Nevada and what groups go down.",

They need primaries to go their way. In other words, Republicans would nominate candidates that they believe are unelectable in the general election. And what's been fascinating is the maneuvering around Trump. He backed a lot of candidates who were weak in the last cycle in the midterms, the Democrats held onto the Senate.This time they're trying to align themselves with Donald Trump. So the Trump loyalty factor means a lot for Republican leaders like Steve Daines, who is the Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee. I asked him about the timing of Rosendale's endorsement. This is what Steve Daines told me. He said, \"Well, Tim Sheehy endorsed President Trump in April. It's a pretty late endorsement for Matt Rosendale. This time, he sees the inevitable that President Trump will be the nominee. I like Matt Rosendale. I hope he stays in the House -- excuse me, and builds seniority.\" It was interesting, I mean, Rosendale was in Mar-a-Lago and he did a fundraiser there. He shook hands with Trump. He tweeted about that image. I mean, Trump is still such a heavy presence in these primaries. JOHN BRESNAHAN, PUNCHBOWL NEWS CO-FOUNDER: Oh, he's going to be the nominee. You're likely to be the Republican nominee. So yeah, I think your -- Amy's point is great. I think in this particular race, it's so interesting because Montana is such a small state Tester -- John Tester, Democratic incumbent is popular and could win that race. I think Ohio is much more difficult because that will be, you know, be lots of ads there and they don't vote the voters there as good as Sherrod Brown is, a candidate. It's harder for him to carry Ohio. I think this is going to be a race. And Democrats can win one of these seats, I think it's because Tester can do it on his personality.

Yes, it's in the leads. Yes, it is something that plays out. It's hard to see, but it has such a significant impact. And just look at the states in which these issues, these district lines could be redrawn because of court battles or because of courts have ordered them to go ahead and do so. There are 13 states that in which, in 2024, where they'll have to redraw these lines. And that could absolutely impact, which party is in power come 2025. So significant.
