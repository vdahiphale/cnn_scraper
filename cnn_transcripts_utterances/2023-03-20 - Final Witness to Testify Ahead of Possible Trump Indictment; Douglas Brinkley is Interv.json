That grand jury could issue an indictment or indictments against former President Donald Trump any day now, and Trump has called for protests if that happens.

We'll take a closer look at what that means as Putin is, of course, now facing an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes. We'll get to all of that, but we do begin this hour with CNN correspondent Kara Scannell, who's outside the courthouse here in New York City.

So, Robert Costello, according to a source, had reached out to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and lawyers for former President Trump, saying that he had information that would contradict what Michael Cohen has been saying. Now, Cohen, remember, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations several years ago in the federal case, and he said then that he made these payments in coordination with and at the direction of Trump.Now, Costello has now since handed over hundreds of emails and documents to prosecutors saying that this would back up his contention that what Cohen said then is not the same thing as what he had told him when he was representing him. Now, according to a letter that Trump's lawyers had given to the district attorney's office, they say that Costello could testify before the grand jury, telling them that Cohen told him at the time that Trump had not committed any crimes. So, they had asked the DA's office to bring Costello in as part of an exculpatory witness testimony to try to contradict what Cohen has said. You'll remember, Cohen was in meeting before the grand jury providing testimony two days last week. And as Cohen said on MSNBC this weekend, he was asked by the DA's office to return again this afternoon as a possible rebuttal witness. He said he didn't know if that would be just meeting with prosecutors or if he would be asked to go back before the grand jury. But this all is - all signs that this investigation is coming to a head and a decision on a probable indictment of the former president is expected soon. Erica. John.",

Defendants have much broader rights, potential defendants, in New York than in other places.The thing that happens, John, once you're past the issuance of the indictment should be pretty standard. The defendant, through his lawyers, agrees with the prosecutors on a time and a place to appear in court to answer the charges, guilty or not guilty, to be booked and, in this case, to be released. And we'll see if Donald Trump does that. If he doesn't, you have a very complicated legal process to get him from Florida to the state of New York, to Manhattan, called extradition. But I'm guessing that despite the former president's protestations on Truth Social that it won't come to that if he's charged. That still is a big if. It is important to remember charges have not issued. We will see. We're predicting it. We've looked at the law. They look likely. They seem well-founded.

He sees it as a way to have people like Vice President Pence say nice things about him. The governor, DeSantis, is going to probably say Trump's being handed a bad deal if this goes down. So, for Donald Trump, this isn't that grim of news.Now, whether this will corrode confidence in Trump and the Republican Party, or at least, you know, start losing some voters, saying, look, the Trump days are over, is yet to be seen.

But what's happening here to Donald Trump is that he is going to be indicted as an ex-president, it looks like, on a number of felony charges with Stormy Daniels just leading the pack. It's all unsavory. It's all confusing. My fear is that there's so many coming around him at once people are going to simply think it's a political takedown.But we've never had a president like Trump before, one without military service, one that claimed -- claims to be a businessperson, but really just ran his own father's operation and expanded it. There's not somebody, as we've talked about, John, for a long time that we can compare Donald Trump to.

So, when these charges broke, there was a lot of talk about how they are largely symbolic since the reality of Putin traveling to a country, right, an ICC country, where he could potentially be arrested, seems slim. Why do you think the charges were filed now? PROF. LEILA SADAT, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS SCHOOL OF LAW: Well, the charges are filed because Ukraine referred the case to the court, and actually 41 states joined the referral to the court. Ukraine asked the ICC to investigate, as did 41 members of the court's state's parties, if you like. And that means that the prosecutor has an obligation to investigate. And the prosecutor has to follow the facts and the law. And the facts, as we've seen on our television screens, thanks so much to CNN for your great reporting, by the way, Erica, the facts really drive this case.

They're relatively obvious. Russia has essentially admitted to what happened. Vladimir Putin and his minister have stated that they engaged in this conduct. And so it's really obvious.And it's also a particularly heinous offense. These are actually grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. And Russia's a party to the Geneva Conventions. So, Russia knows exactly that these are not OK. The transfer and deportation of children during war is unlawful. So, I think these are the tip of the iceberg.

They've met each other face-to-face more than 40 times according to the count that's being carried on Russian state media. But this is by far the most important one because Russia is increasingly isolated in the world. It comes, as we mentioned just after this indictment at the ICC. It's the first time Xi Jinping has met Putin since his invasion of Ukraine. And so it is a potent, symbolic show of support from China, one of the world's super powers, remember, to Russia. And that's been noticed, of course, by the Russians, and they -- they've seen it -- they see it as a diplomatic coup. But it also sends a message to the rest of the world as well. You know, Xi Jinping is willing to stand by Russia. Maybe others should, too. There are a couple of concrete issues, though, on the agenda. The first is whether or not China will take the step of providing military aid to Russia. So far it hasn't done that. It says it has a relationship without limits with Russia, but, in fact, it's put a limit on that relationship, which is providing ammunition and weapons for the battlefield. It's not doing that, but the concern is it might do that, and that might be a turning point, an inflection point in the conflict if the military might of China gets behind Russia. So, we're watching carefully for that. The other issue is the peace plan that China has put out. It's put out a 12-point peace plan, calling for talks, but stopping short of demand that Russia withdrawal from the territory it has conquered. And so it's got a pretty lukewarm reception in the west so far.",
