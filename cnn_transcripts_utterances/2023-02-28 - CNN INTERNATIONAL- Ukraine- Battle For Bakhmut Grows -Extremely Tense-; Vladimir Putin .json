We'd heard from President Zelenskyy only yesterday about how challenging conditions were there. And we understand that the situation is now extremely tense. It's been at the heart of battles, fierce battles, for so many days. And whilst Ukrainian speak of heavy losses on the Russian side, their messages about what's happening on the ground have grown increasingly desperate. We'd heard a while ago that Ukraine has said they were going to defend it, but that they were not willing to do so at any cost. The question is, how quickly really Russia will manage to encircle this town and what that will mean for the Ukrainian troops that are left there, Max.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Max. Well, he certainly sounded pretty serious. First of all, he said that the FSB plays an important role for Russia in what they call the special military operation, obviously, the war in Ukraine. And one of the things that he acknowledged there was that yes, FSB operatives are very much involved in that special military operation in the war that is, of course, ongoing.He claimed that they were operating some of them behind enemy lines on the front lines. And he also admitted, Max, and acknowledge that there were losses among the FSB in all of that. And he obviously said that the Russian state needs to protect the interests of those who were fallen, and their families, obviously, as well. So Vladimir Putin mapping that out. He also said that it was important for the FSB to get established in the areas that are currently under occupation by the Russians. Obviously, the Russians view all of that very differently. They view all these now as Russian territories because they say that they've annex these territories, even though they don't actually control large parts of the territories that they now claim to be part of the Russian Federation. But he's saying that the FSB's big task for the year that is upcoming now is to get established in those areas and to start working there. He also claimed that there were attacks by the Ukrainians inside of those territories, as he calls a terrorist attack by the Ukrainian regime. He also claimed that those were being aided by Western nations as well. And that's part of the narrative that we've been seeing from Vladimir Putin, especially over the past couple of days in the run up to the one year anniversary of the war. Also, yesterday, when he gave a speech to Special Operations Forces, he sort of tried to make this out to be Russia against the West, rather than just Russia against Ukraine. That was certainly one of the narratives that we also heard from Vladimir Putin today. But he did indeed say that the FSB, that the intelligence service was a very important asset, as he put it in the special military operation that they need to get established there very quickly, that they need to do more of what they have been doing so far, which is obviously seeing to it that the security services are active in those new areas that are under Russian control. But certainly what we saw today was a Russian president, who was extremely determined, definitely spoke the language also of the FSB, there it is, obviously, an organization that is very close to him, and obviously said that this organization is going to continue to play a very important role in Vladimir Putin's plans. Even though right now, of course, we know that things for the Russians on the front lines in the war in Ukraine are still quite difficult. And it really is unclear what their strategy is going forward. There is talk, of course, Russian offensive, that could be emitted that may already have started. But right now all of that seems to very slow, very difficult going. And that's probably one of the reasons why Vladimir Putin also is saying that he feels he needs to consolidate those areas, also, with those intelligence services, obviously, being very active, that are under Russian control right now and to make sure that Russia doesn't lose any of those territories going forward, Max.",

He moved to Israel a few years ago and joined the Israeli military, and that's when he gained citizenship.But then he actually moved back to the U.S. several years ago and had actually just graduated from Columbia University in New York last year, and he was just in town and he was just here to actually go visit for a friend's wedding. We've spoken to some of his friends and people that know him this morning and they say that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they say. The road on which he was shot, the area in which he was shot is a road that's often actually used even by tourists to come visit Jericho, to go visit the Dead Sea. And what we know from Israeli officials is that while Elan was driving, attacker shot at several cars as they drove by. Several cars were hit by gunfire but Elan was hit in the upper chest, in the upper body, medics said and he was killed. The attackers then fled. They burned their vehicles in the process. And now we know that a massive manhunt is underway in the nearby Palestinian town of Jericho. We know the Israeli military has set up checkpoints for people going in and out of that city to look for the attackers. Now, as you noted, this followed a very violent day on Sunday. We saw two Israeli brothers actually killed in a similar attack while they were sitting in their cars in traffic. This was though in a near Palestinian town of Hawara, in the occupied West Bank. This is much more of a flashpoint area, compared to where Elan Ganeles was killed near Jericho. And then after that attack in Hawara, a few hours later, is when we saw that essentially those rampages by Israeli settlers being called revenge attacks, they set fire to several homes and cars. And we know that one Palestinian man was shot and killed in the violence, several others were injured. Now we know from Israeli authorities that they arrested several people in the wake of those attacks. But just a lot of concerns now about what happens next, all of this happening actually, soon after Israeli and Palestinian officials met in a rare summit in Jordan and occupy alongside Egyptians, Jordanians and Americans. And this whole point of the summit was to try to reach some sort of agreements to reach some sort of calm on the ground. And the events of the last few days just further illustrating the sort of crisis moment this region is in if things don't change quickly. There's a concern that now there's sort of a tit for tat revenge attacks going on. The Israeli military sending an extra battalions into the West Bank as we speak to not only look for these attackers, but also to try to keep Israeli settlers separated from Palestinians. Max?",

But I want to read for you something that the International Republican Institute, International Democratic Institute said in their own observation report. They said in part that, \"The election fell well short of Nigerian citizens reasonable expectations. Logistical challenges, and multiple incidents of political violence overshadowed the electoral process and impeded a substantial number of votes from -- voters from participating.\" So I got to point out here that the supporters of the incumbent party's candidate Bola Tinubu said this is all incitement to violence, and that the election was fine, and that Bola Tinubu is on his way to victory to be the next president of Nigeria, Max.",

After all, he's got an elected prime minister. And so far, it looks like he's managed. The success of this deal that he's struck with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been praised in the British media. He hasn't had any open revolt or even strong verbal dissent from his own MPs. What remains the obstacle here is trying to get the Democratic Unionist Party on board with this deal, it will be able to pass without that support. But in order to keep the Conservative Party brand intact and fulfill their commitment to the Democratic Unionist Party who don't want any divergence from the rest of the United Kingdom, he needs to make sure that they're on board too.

It's been managed, and they can get on with the rest of the business of governing. The other implications, of course, are the fact that relations between the E.U. and the U.K. really got to a low point under Boris Johnson, they're incredibly strange. Now, this is a potential reset moment, as you were saying, Max, not to mention the political circumstances are so different now with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a reminder of the values that the E.U. and U.K. have in common. There could be more potential for cooperation on matters of Defense and Energy, for example, going forward if their relationship is in a better place, as well as the fact that President Biden was very committed to finding a solution to this problem.

These are things we simply did not hear the E.U. applying to Boris Johnson.So even the fact that it's a different person at the helm, somebody who has a reputation for their attention to detail and wanting to present himself as a problem solver. This is obviously all extremely helpful in terms of resetting their relations. I think they're on a very good path to being able to do that. And for the time being, Boris Johnson, who's always lurking pretty close by in the political shadows for Rishi Sunak has not said anything openly about this. I'm sure he wasn't happy to see some of the front covers of the British newspapers this morning.
