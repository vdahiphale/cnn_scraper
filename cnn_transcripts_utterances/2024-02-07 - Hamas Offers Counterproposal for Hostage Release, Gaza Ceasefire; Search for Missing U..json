In just hours, we will hear from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his meeting with Secretary of State Tony Blinken. Blinken is in Israel for crucial talks on the war in Gaza. Now, Hamas is offering a counterproposal for the potential release of hostages, and Blinken says they are looking intensively at the deal. However, an Israeli official familiar with the negotiations tells CNN that there is, quote, no way that Israel will agree to Hamas' proposal. We have team coverage for you. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House and Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. Nic, let me start with you. Prime Minister Netanyahu, as you pointed out, is going to hold this press conference in just a few hours. It is expected to be in Hebrew for a domestic audience.

Now, yesterday, President Biden was asked about it in the hours after Hamas presented that counterproposal, and he said that parts of it were a little over the top. The president did not elaborate on what made him lead to that assessment. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that getting a hostage deal is essential. That is a key focus of his meetings today while he is in Israel. It was a key focus of his discussion with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a bit earlier today. And in a meeting, a sit-down with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the secretary of state said that the hostages remain at the top of the U.S. minds, but that more work needs to be done on this proposal. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We now have a response from Hamas to the proposal that was put on the table the way forward. We're looking at it intensely, as is I know the government of Israel, and there is a lot of work to be done, but we are very much focused on doing that work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is something that, so far, Netanyahu has rebuffed, even as U.S. officials have consistently pressed him on this. But it all comes at a very high-stakes moment as there is pressure both on Netanyahu, but also domestically here at home, to not just get those hostages back but also put an end to this war.",

In months rather than weeks, to date, Israelis, even, you know, you might describe it as drag kicking and screaming, have agreed to deals measured in days, perhaps weeks in exchange for those first releases of hostages, but this would extend it into months.So, that's a big step for Israel to take. And I think you can expect some strong words, criticism of that from the Israeli prime minister. But the other piece here is that inherent in accepting a deal such as this, particularly before Israel has accomplished even half of its goal, right, its goal of destroying Hamas, best estimates are perhaps a third of Hamas fighters have been killed, and to date, really none of the senior leadership, it would be agreeing to that large deal with those large concessions before even getting halfway to their stated goal of these military operations. And that would, regardless of what the prime minister says as they're discussing this, that would be quite an admission to make that, listen, we're not there, we're not really even close.

The third Marine aircraft wing is coordinating search and rescue efforts, according to the statement from the Marine Corps, with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the Civil Air Patrol.Now, according to San Diego County Fire which we spoke to just a few moments ago, they received their first report on this missing helicopter at 2:20 A.M. local time. And the last ping from this aircraft was around 11:30 P.M. on Tuesday. They then deployed three fire engines and an ambulance to the area but they encountered heavy snow and winter conditions. And so they went as far as they could in this search area before having to pull back. So, now that they have encountered daylight again, they are going to re-engage this search effort, according to the spokesperson from the fire department there. But, look, this is not the first time that one of these helicopters, which is essentially a heavy lift helicopter used for transporting heavy equipment around the world by Marines has been involved in an incident, the last one being in 2018 when one of these helicopters crashed also in California and killed all four Marines that were on board there.

How often do people listen in?But this is such a consequential question of who's going to be on the ballot and who may be the next president of the United States that I'm sure the audiences will be listening. Several people to mention, but I have to start with Chief Justice John Roberts, who I know well. He is at the center of the bench and he is at the strategic center of this court. He has no doubt already been, you know, thinking about these arguments well before the case was even filed in Colorado because he saw this issue coming up. Even if he might not have predicted it would definitely get to get to the high court, he would have been ready for it. So, he has probably already started gaming it out. One phrase that I've heard so many people refer to John Roberts as someone who engages in three-dimensional chess. So, he will be trying to figure out where will a majority or almost a unanimous court go to try to answer this question of whether Donald Trump should be precluded from ballots without saying whether Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection. As you know, John, the Section 3 of the 14th amendment that's at issue here has several parts and there will be several ways that the justices are going to have to interpret that statute. So, people will start to hear a lot of parsing of the text, a lot of parsing of the history of this provision that was enacted after the Civil War and aimed at Confederate leaders. For example, is this the kind of thing that Congress should have passed legislation for to actually invoke it against a former president or is a former president even covered by language that refers to an officer of the United States. It's counterintuitive that the Trump forces are arguing against that. But what they're saying is, if you look at constitutional terms, Donald Trump would not fall under it. So, we're going to listen chiefly for the chief. And then I just want to point to another justice who's coming to this case with distinct history, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was appointed by President Biden. She's the first African-American woman to sit on this court. She actually is the only member of this court to have actually sat on cases arising from the January 6th attack on the Capitol. She was a district court judge in early 2021 before going to the D.C. Circuit and then coming to the Supreme Court in 2022. So, she saw these issues face on when she was sitting as a trial judge, John.",

I also think just, politically, they want to kind of stay away from that. I think they'll look for one of the pure legal issues, whether he's an officer, whether it's a self- executing provision.

The worst of those, of course, was the Dobbs decision, wrongly overturning decades of constitutional protection for women's rights to choose. If the Supreme Court looks for an off ramp here, there are two. One is, was Donald Trump an officer of the United States as the 14th Amendment requires? Rahel, it's silly to say the president is not an officer, but there are some historical, legal, constitutional pegs if the Supreme Court just wants to sidestep the whole question. Perhaps the more likely off ramp is to say, hey, this is a political question for Congress. We don't get into political questions. That's fundamental Supreme Court doctrine. And, besides, there are some words in the 14th Amendment that you can read. The Supreme Court will need to stretch a little bit to say, hey, this is really for Congress. So, I agree with Jennifer. Those are the two most likely off-ramps, officer of the United States, political question under the text of the 14th Amendment.",
