Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANOTHY BLIKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We will be talking about concrete steps that can and should be taken to minimize harm to men, women, and children in Gaza, and this is something that the United States is committed to. I'm not going to get into the details here, but it's very much on the agenda. When I see a Palestinian child, a boy, a girl, pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And today, the chief of staff of Israel's military saying that Israeli forces are in Gaza City and have been operating in Gaza City for several days now, including he said in quote, significant areas of Gaza City. But what is clear is that these battles are very contentious between Israeli forces and, excuse me, and Hamas militants.And even as Israeli forces are entering Gaza City, they are also still engaged in very fierce fighting in Northern Gaza as well. We were just across the border from Beit Hanun, the northeastern most city in Gaza City today, where we witnessed fierce fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants, artillery fire, mortar shells being fired off, and gun battles between Israeli forces and those Hamas fighters as well. And so, it's clear that even as Israeli forces enter the largest city in Gaza, they are still fighting Hamas forces along those defensive front lines in the north, near where Israeli forces initially entered when they launched that expanded ground operation on Friday. And one of the reasons for that is those tunnels, dozens of miles of tunnels underneath Gaza, which Hamas fighters use to evade as well as to ambush Israeli forces. That is a clear and present danger for those forces, and that's why we have watched both in the days before this expanded ground operation as well as in its initial days, those tunnel systems have been a massive target for Israeli forces. The problem with that, of course, as well, is that those tunnels are underneath residential buildings in Gaza, including that Jabalia refugee camp where we saw Israeli forces struck twice in just 2 days, resulting not only, they say, in the targeting and the destruction of underground Hamas tunnels, command centres, as well as a senior commander, but also in a number of civilian casualties. You see those images, the enormous craters that were left by Israeli munitions dropped there, and you also see the images of women and children being pulled from amidst the rubble. Boris.",

It's like discussing the Marshall Plan before the Battle of Stalingrad. We're still very early on in our campaign to defeat Hamas and destroy it in response to the October 7th massacre. There are several scenarios that are on the table.I can tell you the common denominator between all of them is that the Gaza Strip will be completely demilitarized. When this campaign is over, we will not go back to a world in which this enclave can be used to attack us with rockets, thousands of rockets just in the last few weeks for the invasions of the death squads that burned, butchered, raped, beheaded people on October 7th. But it's very premature. We know that the battle ahead to dislodge Hamas, just as the world took many years to wipe out ISIS in Syria and Iraq, that road is going to be long.

We're in this war, not because we initiated it, but because Hamas declared war on us on October 7th with that massacre, leaving us no choice but to move in and to exercise our right to self-defense by dismantling the terror organization that perpetrated that. I wish I could come and say that there were an organized plan and vision in advance, but this is a war that we were surprised by and dragged into.And we look forward to working with our international partners to rebuild the Gaza Strip the day after Hamas in a way that it can no longer pose a threat to the security of our people. But I think also just as importantly that it can never be used again by a terror organization that has subjugated it like it has in the last 16 years and diverted all that humanitarian aid into building its tunnels, building its rockets.

We know that Hamas immediately with the October 7th massacre called on Palestinians in the West Bank to grab their guns, grab their knives and go and attack Jews.
