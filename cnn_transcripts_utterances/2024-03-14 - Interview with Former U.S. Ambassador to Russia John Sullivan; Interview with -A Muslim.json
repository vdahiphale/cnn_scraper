Iwant to start by asking you about something he told Russian television this week, and I'm going to read it to you. Our triad, the nuclear triad, is more modern than any other triad, and it's only us and the Americans who have such triads. In general, if we talk about the carriers and the number of warheads, we're more or less equal. But ours are more modern. Everyone knows that, all specialists know that. So, Ambassador, how concerned are you that Putin keeps talking about having the upper hand in the nuclear domain, and even though he's not threatening to use them he kind of still dangles that threat?",

If you'll recall back, when he was running for re-election the last time in 2018, hespoke in front of a video, a cartoon, that showed a Russian missile striking South Florida where then President Trump, of course, had his Mar- a-Lago club. He has been rattling the nuclear saber for years. It's been part of his way of dealing with the United States. He's invested a lot of money in his nuclear weapons and particularly in new delivery systems. He has been basically using nuclear blackmail over Ukraine since the start of the so- called military -- special military operation. So, this is just of a piece with what he's been doing for years. It's how he operates. And in my opinion, it's crazy. You don't hear any other -- you don't hear the president of the United States or any other leaders that have nuclear weapons talking the way he does.

The problem though, Christiane, and why it's really crazy is the more that Putin says it, the more that he says, I'm really going to do it, the less potent the threat of nuclear war becomes. And in fact, it's -- it may be a sign of weakness and maybe make nuclear war even more likely because the threat is diminished because people don't believe him when he says, keep saying we might do it, we've got the potential to do it. But the administration -- the Biden administration has been very concerned about this from the start. They've been worried about Putin using a nuclear weapon, a tactical nuke in Ukraine if his troops were being routed on the battlefield as they were in late 2022. And as I say, Putin has been rattling the strategic nuclear saber since the very first days of the war as a threat to the United States to back off.",

I mean, he's been -- the former presidenthas been suggesting that the U.S., more than suggesting, you know, expressing extreme skepticism about United States' support for Ukraine, which, in my opinion, is vital, A, for Ukraine's continuing survival, but more importantly, for the strategic interests, foreign policy, and national security interests of the United States. Now, what will President Trump do if he's re-elected in November? Honestly, I can't tell you. Why? Because what I learned -- I served for three years as deputy secretary of state before I was appointed ambassador by President Trump in December 2019. President Trump is unpredictable. I never got the sense that he himself had any well-formed foreign policy or longstanding views on foreign policy. He's flip-flopped on issues like whether the United States should have invaded Iraq or not in 2003. My concern is that he's unpredictable. And it's often the case that the last leader who speaks to him, who flatters him may get the final say and influence him the most. So, I wouldn't say it's locked in stone that he would cut off aid to Ukraine when he becomes president, if he would become president, but it's certainly a significant risk and would have an incredibly negative effect, virtually determinative on the war without the support of the United States in rallying European and other western countries to support Ukraine. It would be very difficult for the Ukrainians to resist the Russian military machine.",

In this era of deep polarization, a new podcast hopes to bridge the divide. It's called \"A Muslim and a Jew Go There.\" And it's hosted by two well- known British figures, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim cabinet minister and author of \"The Enemy Within: A Tale of Muslim Britain,\" and David Baddiel, a familiar face on British TV, as a long-time comedian and presenter, and more recently, the author of the best-selling book \"Jews Don't Count.\" Both are here with me now on set.

So, for me in politics it's either in Parliament and often if you watch the Commons it's the yaboo on political point-scoring that you see in politics. And even in the House of Lords, where there is much more space for a measured debate, the time simply is not there to directly engage with another person of a different faith. And -- or alternatively you're on the broadcast media doing a 30-second sound clip. So, to have the ability to have a long-form conversation over 45 minutes on some very difficult issues where you can build and make your argument, you can have your argument challenged and then go back and have that discussion in an environment which is friendly and compassionate and open, simply didn't exist. So, for me, I think this is a really important place for us to push back those boundaries and say to people who are often saying, we can't talk about these things, they're too sensitive, don't go there.

We talk about this on the podcast. Because, you know, at Suhur in the morning, as you're having your meal, you're thinking about Gaza, when you have your Iftar, you're thinking about Gaza.

It feels subdued. It feels that any sense of celebration is inappropriate, but the positive that has come out of it is that the British Muslim community, as Muslim communities across the world use the month of Ramadan to give generously to charity on average, the -- a community of 4 million in the United Kingdom raised over 150 million pounds just in the month of Ramadan.

So, even, I think, in these kind examples, well, what's the harm? There is harm in the idea that we don't know what to trust. If people just go, well, it does matter. So, I think that's -- we have to label, we to make it clear when this is A.I. generated or if it has been photoshopped. It's important that we know and have an accurate historical record of what did actually happen or not. And that's what we have to keep reminding each other. Many disinformation actors don't have a very big audience. They might be on a kind of a niche online site and they might have couple of people who follow them. What they're desperate for is the megaphone that the media brings. So, so much of the tactics and techniques that that we see shared, it's not a particularly clever use of technology. The vulnerability is how can I get the media to cover it, how can get I the outrage, how I can people to hate, like it on Twitter?

So, that does mean in this election cycle, we all have to be aware of how our communities might potentially at risk through some of these technologies, not making people overly concerned, but to saying, that is a potential threat, let's be away if hear something, double check it before you just trust it implicitly.",

So, first of all, we've got to take the pressure of people to say, look out for the glitch.

So, I use the acronym, which is SIFT, which is, first stop. Don't let your emotions carry you away when you see something that seems too good to be true or too convincing to be true. Then I investigate the source, try to find out where this comes from, then see if anyone else is covering it, F, find alternative coverage and then trace the original, see if there's an original. And the reason I'm sharing those is, I think, for many of the examples we're looking at, for example, if we traced back those deepfakes, we'd see they came from a satirical site. If we looked at the Trump images on reverse image search, we'd find that they had news coverage around them, right? So, by doing those steps first, so we don't have to all do the same work of trying to be forensic analysts, I think it's absolutely critical and is learning from our existing skills. Then for journalists, there is a gap, and it's one of the things we've been calling out is that there's a gap in access to the more technical tools for a broad range of journalists to do the analysis and then know how to explain it to the public. And that's something we've got to address as A.I. tools get better. And that also requires really putting the onus on platforms and other people who are creating the A.I. tools to make it as easy as possible, both to detect the presence of A.I., to be able to label it, and also to be able to authenticate the real, right? Again, I said I don't want us to place pressure on the individual to be a forensic analyst, but we shouldn't place all the pressure on news organizations to do this all themselves. We need to find much better ways to make A.I. detectable, make it easy to label it when we see it in our timelines or when we encounter it in the wild. And also make it easier to authenticate the real, to be able to show when something was made in a particular time and place. And if we do those together, we'll be in a much more resilient place.",

      "sentences": "So, about two weeks ago, OpenAI launched a new tool, Sora, which allows you to essentially write a sentence and you get a 60-second video.And so, the first five minutes, I saw, like, many people were scrolling in awe of what had been created. And then, the second 10 minutes, I was like, how is this allowed? It's like putting a really, really fast car that can drive twice as fast on the interstate, but they don't have to wear a seatbelt and, you know, there's no rules of the road. I mean, I find it astonishing that this can just be rolled out without any of those kinds of safeguards. And we knew this was coming. And so, we can't just, you know, put a watermark on that can be photoshopped out. We need really significant and sophisticated technology that would embed those kinds of markings. But the idea that this -- they can launch these new products without that is astonishing. And we don't have a regulatory framework right now. I mean, imagine a new food or a new car, or I mean, we'd have to have that. These guys are, you know, creating all sorts of things. So, I am concerned that in this very short time period before the election, these new tools are being rolled out at a pace that's much faster than the speed at which we as consumers can catch up and adapt.",

I think -- you know, I come from a context of really also thinking about the creativity of video and of images. And so, there's potential there. But overall, I'm nervous and I want us to prepare much more actively, as Claire said, but not to panic because that plays into the hands of people who want to use these tools maliciously.",
