U.S. officials tell CNN they're worried that Israel's Iron Dome air defense system could be overwhelmed in a full-scale war with Hezbollah.Attacks from the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran have been on the rise over the past few months, and Israel has responded with airstrikes. U.S. officials say Israel plans to shift resources from Gaza to the north, and a land and air incursion into Lebanon is increasingly likely. Israel has evacuated about 60,000 people who live along its northern border, and more than 90,000 people have fled their homes in southern Lebanon. More now from CNN's Natasha Bertrand.

Israeli officials have actually told the U.S. that they are planning to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive against Hezbollah, and one U.S. official said the U.S. is preparing for the worst, telling CNN, quote, \"the fact that we have managed to even hold the front for this long has been a miracle.\" Despite the Israelis signaling that they are preparing for a possible offensive, though, they have been surprised by the sophistication of some of Hezbollah's recent strikes, and they continue to worry about the fact that Hezbollah has been stockpiling precision-guided munitions and missiles from Iran for years, as many as 150,000 of them, according to IDF estimates. Now, the U.S. is scrambling at this point to try to de-escalate the tensions at the border, but Israeli officials have signaled that they are determined to create this buffer zone and push Hezbollah back so that Israelis can return to their homes in the north. The U.S. is trying to do that diplomatically, but as one senior administration official said, quote, \"we're entering a very dangerous period.\" Something could start with little warning.

Public opinion for presidents can be punishing. Biden's favorability has fallen 11 points since 2020, with nearly 6 in 10 Americans holding an unfavorable view. Perceptions of Trump have changed less, with more than half still seeing him in an unfavorable light. Televised debates have long been a storied part of presidential campaigns, with history making moments for candidates. Yet this showdown is without parallel. The nation's 45th and 46th presidents still seeking to define one another in the earliest general election debate in memory, an old duel being fought on new ground. And it will be an extraordinary sight, a sitting president facing a former president. It simply has never happened in a televised debate in American history. Of course, the last debate was all about Trump's record. Now this one is likely to be about Biden's record. Of course, both candidates are still trying to draw that contrast with one another. One thing is clear. This is the earliest debate in presidential campaign history. The question is, will this define the race for the months to come? Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
