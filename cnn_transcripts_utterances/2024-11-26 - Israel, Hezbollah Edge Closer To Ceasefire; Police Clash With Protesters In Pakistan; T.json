One, as indicated by your reporter, there is an internal political challenge for Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel itself with some of his right-wing ministers, but I do think he's made the calculation that even though some of these ministers will be upset. They are not likely to leave his cabinet because of this agreement, whereas they would have left his cabinet if he'd made an agreement with Hamas or made some major compromises on the West Bank.So, I think internally, he has a challenge, but I think he thinks he can get over it. The second point, which has been difficult, Israel wants to maintain the ability to hit Hezbollah if it feels that it's violating this agreement. That was not a term that the Lebanese side was willing to accept. So, the solution, \"that they found for it\" is that there will be a separate letter between Israel and the United States where the U.S. acknowledge -- acknowledges this kind of ability of Israel to go after Hezbollah if Hezbollah violates the agreement. So, those are some of the things that are still being worked out. But leaders on both sides in Israel and Lebanon do seem optimistic that this could be done, same optimism we see in Washington and Paris as well.",

They've collectively punished, as it were, 1.2 million Lebanese who many of whom are supporters of Hezbollah, displaced them from the south.So, they have achieved a lot of what Bibi Netanyahu wanted to do. They have prevented the ability of Hezbollah to do a lightning strike across the border. So, I think at one level, it is somewhat sustainable, but I do expect violations here and there. There is a supervisory committee led by the United States which will continue to try to keep a lid on this.

This is largely a volunteer army or a citizen's army, as it were. They've been fighting on multiple fronts, so that's been a pressure for Prime Minister Netanyahu to ramp things down. Secondly, you do have Donald Trump, who came to office, or at least won the election in the U.S.And he's been very clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that he supports him. He wants him to win those wars but he also wants those wars to be over before he takes office on January 20th. And I do think if Prime Minister Netanyahu survives this ceasefire agreement with a longtime foe like Hezbollah and is able to survive it politically, perhaps he might be more courageous about broaching a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.

But of course, this is something they have been preparing to deal with for months. And they probably could use some clarification from Trump or his team as well. Remember, we're not sure if this additional 10 percent is going to be imposed at the same time as the 60 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports Trump had repeatedly threatened during the campaign or is this just the first phase that could lead to a much bigger tariff later on. And interestingly, I've been hearing slightly different sentiment from officials here, with those in charge of diplomacy trying to put on a more brave face, saying China is capable and willing to fight back while those with an economic portfolio sometimes sounded a bit more cautious, perhaps because of the sluggish Chinese economy at home.And that, of course, is something a lot of experts have pointed out is going to affect how they respond with many suggesting the Chinese response is likely to be more targeted and asymmetrical. Meaning they're going to target on U.S. companies and industries that they perhaps already intend to squeeze in the Chinese market. And also, another thing they've been doing in the past few years is to diversify their export market, trying to reduce their reliance on the U.S. Perhaps more noteworthy at this point, though, is the fentanyl issue. We recently actually got rare access to China's national counternarcotics lab, where officials they're telling us that the recently resumed dialogs and exchanges on this issue have led to some progress. They say their regular communication with their U.S. counterparts has helped both sides identify and trace new chemicals used to make fentanyl and U.S.-provided tips actually leading to law enforcement actions here in China on the -- on the ground. So the irony here is, if those new Trump tariffs trigger another free fall in this overall bilateral relationship, it could actually negatively impact the very issue that Trump is now linking to his new tariff threat against China.

And you rightly note, Rosemary, that this would have a real significant cost on American consumers, just by passing higher prices on to them.There will be a real question about whether dissent can mitigate or attenuate some of these tariffs, because you're right, they don't seem to be on the same page. It's a very similar situation, actually, if you recall during the first Trump White House where Steve Mnuchin who also held this Treasury Secretary position, was kind of working behind the scenes to lessen some of these tariffs that ended up kind of blowing up within the White House.

Worth noting that this isn't even close to the most powerful weapon we have seen Russia use in past days. Just last week, they used for the first time, an intermediate range ballistic missile with multiple warheads that were launched as that missile was in flight, what are officially called MIRVs in the lingo of the Pentagon. Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was a an experimental hypersonic missile, claiming, as he has before, that it's impossible for Ukraine's air defenses to intercept this missile that has been proven wrong in the past and may well be proven wrong once again, but Russia clearly showing that it's willing to escalate, saying that this was in response to the U.S. permission for Ukraine to use U.S.-made long range attackers missiles to strike targets inside of Russia. A green light that Ukraine only got within the course of the last few weeks. Last week, they used eight of these ATACMS missiles according to U.S. officials to strike an ammunition depot in the Kursk region with reports of secondary explosions indicating that they were able to successfully hit ammunition. There were more explosions in the Kursk Region overnight. So, it's possible Ukraine used more of these ATACMS missiles, though, that part isn't clear. At this moment, the National Security Council publicly acknowledging for the first time that Ukraine has used attack of missiles to strike targets deep inside of Russia. They don't have a lot of these ATACMS missiles, so each time they are used, it is clearly against an important target, and they seem to be using a number of them at once to be able to evade or overpower Russian air defenses.

So, things are certainly seeming to be heightening in terms of the tensions that exist between the government and the protesters. But it's key to understand what the protesters want, Rosemary. And how this all started a few days ago, we have Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan saying from his -- from his jail cell essentially that he wants his supporters to march on Islamabad and march on parliament to call for his release. That is the first demand of three central demands that protesters have. They want Imran Khan out of jail, as well as people whom they deem to be \"political prisoners.\" They also want rosemary, a repeal of the 26th Amendment to Pakistan's constitution. And what exactly that does? It makes it easier for the government to select Superior Court justices and put those judges and justices in positions of decision making when there are cases that involve political matters. And the third demand that they have returned what they call the \"stolen mandate.\" Back in February, there were elections across Pakistan and Imran Khan's party is saying, hey, we won all of these seats throughout Parliament and they were denied to us unfairly. From their point of view, the elections in February were neither fair nor free. So, they want again, a return of those seat -- of those seats which they say are rightfully theirs. So, what does this all amount to? It amounts to the tableau that we're seeing on the screen right now. Protesters being met with tear gas. The government in power right now, Prime Minister Sharif saying they need to maintain order within and around the capital. Islamabad, with population of more than one million people, the government is saying it's in talks. It wants talks with former Prime Minister Khan's party. Those have not happened yet. Officials are banning gatherings of more than five people for two months plus, Rosemary. And we have reports of internet service being down within the capital, mobile phone service.

Smoke was still seeping from the debris as residents pick through the ash and rubble to find anything unscorched by the fire. But for many, it's a total loss. ELVIRA VALDEMORO, MANILA RESIDENT AND SHOP OWNER (through translator): I feel bad because we have no livelihood and no home. Everything is gone. We don't know how we can eat. We're in a very bad situation, and it's almost Christmas. CHATTERLEY (voice-over):  Some tried to escape the fire by sea, piling their belongings on rafts as the fire spread to the edges of the sea port where the slum is located. Manila's mayor urged people to evacuate to a temporary shelter where the displaced can get meals and supplies. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but faulty wiring and gas canisters have sparked previous fires and the densely populated slums, often filled with shacks made of flimsy and flammable materials, are no match for a fire of this size and ferocity.
