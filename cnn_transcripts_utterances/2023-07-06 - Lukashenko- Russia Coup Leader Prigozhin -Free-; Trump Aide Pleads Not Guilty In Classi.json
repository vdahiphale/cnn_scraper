Weapons as well. And you know, it all implies that Russia is sort of moving to discredit the Wagner leader, possibly ahead of arrest. Although that's not been confirmed yet. I spoke to the Kremlin earlier today and they said at the moment, they're not commenting on it. But clearly, the deal for Wagner and its leader to be exiled in Belarus is at the least being renegotiated. And that could end very badly indeed for Yevgeny Prigozhin.

This is actually what Prigozhin said. And I think that kind of populist message did carry with some Russians.Now, where that goes, is I think, the most difficult thing. Where did those feelings go to people blame it on Putin? You know, a lot of them kind of switched when they saw that there was a rebellion by Prigozhin.

Did investigators get it, or did anyone try to prevent them from receiving it?
