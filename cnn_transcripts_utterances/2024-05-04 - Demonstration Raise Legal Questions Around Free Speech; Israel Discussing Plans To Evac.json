When it comes to protecting free speech, the First Amendment is very clear that it protects all speech, no matter how grotesque or offensive or inaccurate.The protection for the freedom of assembly does have that caveat that this assembly needs to be peaceful. But this creates a subjective judgment. So my idea of what constitutes a peaceful assembly might differ to yours, which might defer to a police officer, which might defer to a university administrator. So the lack of clarity comes from the fact that the law means that people have to make the subjective judgment of what counts as peaceful or not.

I'm really nervous she revealed to the court as she began her testimony. She did have some warm words for her former boss praising his ability to message. He deserves the credit for the different messages that the campaign focused on in terms of the agenda that he put forth, but she never looked at him during most of her testimony, instead focusing directly on the lawyers asking her questions. She testified at length about the impact of the Access Hollywood tape on the 2016 Trump campaign and how it was a crisis. She was the first person in the campaign to learn of the tape when she was contacted by a reporter. I was concerned, she said. She also witnessed Trump's reaction to the story asked if he was upset. She said, yes, yes, he was. She also told the jury about conversations she had with former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen and Trump when reports of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels first surfaced in early November 2016, saying Trump wanted to make sure that there was a denial of any kind of relationship. In a significant moment for prosecutors, Hicks revealed Trump communicated directly to her about the payment to Daniels. I only know about one instance sometime in the middle of February, Mr. Trump told me about it. And Trump was relieved that the story did not come out before the election. It was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have had that story come out before the election. Hicks appeared nervous throughout her appearance on the stand. And after that key exchange as defense attorneys were starting their cross examination, Hicks broke down in tears. Sorry about that, she said, as she returned to the stand. And when Trump's attorneys had the chance to question her, they got her to confirm that he was worried about his wife, Melania's, reaction to some of the stories. President Trump really values Mrs. Trump's opinion. And she doesn't weigh in all the time. But when she does, it's really meaningful to him. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera): Now the big question is who will take the stand on Monday. Next week is actually the first full four-day week of court that we've had since this trial got underway.

But it's been a tense week here, although probably not as much as what we have seen in places like Columbia University and UCLA. Nine pro-Palestine protesters were arrested Monday evening here on campus, a group that calls itself, UF Divestment Coalition, publish the list of very specific demands, including the disclosure of the university's investment portfolio for the last 10 years and divesting from what they called funding and partnering with weapons manufacturers and implicated in the war in Gaza. They are also demanding that UF President Ben Sasse, publicly denounced what they call violence and discrimination against pro- Palestinian students, as well as a call for a ceasefire in Gaza. In response to the students accusations, a university spokesperson published a statement earlier this week, saying the following. This is not complicated. The University of Florida is not a daycare and we did not treat protesters like children. They knew the rules, they broke the rules and they will face the consequences. The spokesperson also said that some of the protesters were outside agitators. But according to local media, at least seven of the nine protesters arrested Monday were current or recent U.S. students. This of course has become a political issue at the state level.
