A CNN crew had to scramble to safety as a Russian missile exploded just a few yards away from them. It's an apparent example of the ruthless so-called double- tap missile strategy, hit a civilian target, wait for the first responders to arrive, and then hit it again. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is there with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It was a really heavy explosion very close by, I would say maybe 40 or 50 yards from our location. So we then went trying to go into shelter, trying to go into a sheltered building. And as we were doing that, I turned around and you could see the second missile hitting the exact same area. We already know that there were people who are severely wounded on the ground there. It's unclear if and how many people were killed. Of course, right now, there's a big rescue operation going on there. But I think it's important for our viewers to understand that this area of this was in, there was an active search-and-rescue operation in a residential area. And, today, the Russians targeted exactly the same area with two very heavy missiles. And this was as there were a lot of civilians there on the street. We didn't see anybody in the way of military on the streets or any sort of military installations. It was right in the heart of the town of Kramatorsk. Then, of course, we then decided to leave that area as fast as possible after we realized the coast was clear. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Fred Pleitgen and crew, stay safe out there.And just days after an American general warned that a war with China could be possible in a couple of years, there's a new spike in tensions. The U.S. has announced its military will get access to four more bases in the Philippines. And that could put American forces within 200 miles of Taiwan, as fears grow that China could invade that self-governing island. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Oren, how is China responding to this?",

      "sentences": "Well, China appears to be furious, lashing out at the U.S., saying it's part of Washington's -- quote -- \"selfish agenda\" and accusing the U.S. of being the one to endanger regional peace and stability.So, in many ways, similar language we have seen from China before, when the U.S. makes moves like this and expands its presence in the Indo-Pacific. We, of course, know that the latest U.S. national defense strategy is aimed towards China. And this is a broader part of that. You can see why China was so angry looking at that map again. Just a few weeks ago, the U.S. announced that they would put a newly reorganized Marine unit on Okinawa, Japan, just about 200 miles off Taiwan's northern coast that would have advanced capabilities and some advanced anti-ship weapons, and now this. From China's perspective, this puts U.S. forces perhaps on the southern side of Taiwan in the Philippines. The agreement, which was signed when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was just in Manila and in the Philippines meeting with the leadership there, allows the U.S. to rotate troops through four more bases in the Philippines. Now, neither the U.S. nor the Philippines will say what those bases are. But, a few months ago, a Philippine military official said the U.S. was looking at some bases and interested in bases in the Northern Philippines and then on the Western Philippines, which is right in the South China Sea, most of which China claims as its sovereign territory. So it's easy to see where all this tension comes from, and why China is so angry about this. Kasie, from the 10,000-foot perspective, there is also the shift in the alignment of the Philippines. The previous president, Rodrigo Duterte, had moved the Philippines more towards Beijing, even threatening to kick U.S. forces out of the country. The new U.S. president -- I'm sorry -- the new Philippine president has come in and sort of realigned closer to Washington, a move that has not made China happy.",

Hunter Biden is requesting criminal investigations into people tied to the release of private information from his purported laptop. Hunter Biden's lawyers allege that Trump allies, including Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, as well as a computer repair shop owner, broke the law to weaponize materials to smear his father. Let's break this down with CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers. Evan, so this is the first time that Hunter Biden's camp is saying it is his personal data that was being trafficked, although they aren't confirming the narrative out there on the right about how it all got started.

I mean, it's going to come down to who brought in the laptop, what the terms of the deal for service were, and whether the person in the laptop store stayed within those or did not. But it is possible, although I suspect that because it's not like we didn't know about this laptop long ago, if the authorities in Delaware and on the federal side thought that there was a case to be made here, they probably already would be doing it on their own.

It paints it as a political hit job, as opposed to a legitimate look into possible criminal violations or ethical violations by both Bides.

And we anticipate that prosecutors are weighing whether to bring charges related to his tax issues, related to a gun that he purchased.

He has a think tank office here right across the street, as a matter of fact, from the FBI and the Justice Department. And the idea is that that search will happen in the next coming -- next few days. In the case of the Pence team, they want to try to get this wrapped up as soon as possible. This is for now being handled as a review by the FBI working with the National Security Division at the Justice Department. There's no special counsel, in part because Pence is not a declared candidate, right? There's no -- there's no presumed conflict of interest for the Justice Department to do this investigation. If you're Mike Pence and his team, you cooperate, you're trying to get this wrapped up as soon as you can, so that you can move on and perhaps announce that you're running for president in the coming weeks or months.",

And we expect to hear them later today speaking more about this. But what is coming into view is this video that we have seen on social media, which does show that there is a man outside of a wheelchair. He is moving away from police officers on what would be the stumps of his legs, moving away from them with something shiny in his hands. Now, according to the Huntington Park police, they're saying he had a knife in his hand. And so that is something that they keep speaking about. In the one document that they have put out here, you see them following along after him. It does appear that they do try to Tase him. And in their statement, they did say that they tried to Tase him twice. And then, from the view that you can see on social media, it is absconded a bit but you see the point when the officers who are following behind him take out their weapons and then begin to shoot. You do not actually see Anthony Lowe getting shot. But, still, the way this looks of a double amputee moving away from police officers on what would be the stumps of his legs, is really what has so many people concerned here, Kasie, and that is why they're saying that they want justice for Anthony Lowe. I have reached out to the police department to ask if there was body cameras that were being worn by the officers, asking for any more clarity. I have yet to hear back from them, but also expecting to hear more from the family today when they show up here shortly to speak about this wrongful death lawsuit they are expected to file.",

You want to block off this person's path. Additional units can help get others who might be in harm's way in front of him out of the way. And that would be the ideal purpose. That would be the -- I would want to do that first, is try to, like I said, do everything that I can before I jump to deadly force. And so what's the urgency? I mean, I know he stabbed somebody. He's not stabbing in progress. He's fleeing. And he can only go so far, and so quick on those stubs. And so I just think the officers acted too quickly. Now, if they're out there and they're afraid of a man with no legs, then this is the wrong profession for them.",

President Biden is meeting today with members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the White House. And they're going to talk about police reform. And Biden is calling on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which we talked about quite a bit a year or so ago. And, of course, this conversation is happening again in the wake of Tyre Nichols' death three weeks ago in Memphis. I just want to remind our viewers who may have forgotten about what this act would do. It would require police officers to complete training and racial profiling, implicit bias intervention, would increase body camera use, create a national database for officers who have misconduct allegations, and ban no-knock warrants and choke holds in some cases. There are also questions, of course. The most controversial piece of this was qualified immunity and whether that should be extended to police officers or not. But it's been two years since this was introduced. There's still not the support to pass this bill. What can Biden -- what can and should President Biden be doing right now on some of these issues? DORSEY:  Well, we know that the Republicans are not going to pass this with qualified immunity on the table. They have already said that's a nonstarter. Having a registry, a national registry with names of officers who've been involved in misconduct is a joke, because we know that at least three of the officers involved in the Tyre Nichols murder were on a list. Chief Davis knew exactly who they were. She had disciplined them prior. So, here in California, we have a senator by the name of Braffed, who -- Bradford, who has submitted legislation, Senate Bill 2 -- trying to remember what it's called, but it would certainly decertify police officers who engage in the kind of activities that we saw the officers engage in with Mr. Nichols. And so, if you decertify a police officer, what happens is, it's much like a person who doesn't have a license to drive a car. You can't do so legally. You can't be a police officer. You can't resign and get that gift of resignation and move on to another department before they have the time to fire you. And so, if you're decertified, if you don't hold a post-peace officer standards and training certification, that would be a great first start. And so I'm not even sure that the president on a national level can compel every 18,000 police chiefs and sheriffs to do that.",
