Now, look, this was the scene from just one demonstration, a massive banner asking the U.S. president not only for help getting those captives out, but actually saving them from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Protesters also voiced anger at the government in this rally, demanding that Netanyahu resign and that elections be held. Now, all of this coming after Biden laid out what he calls a new Israeli ceasefire proposal. The U.N., the U.K., France, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are all expressing support for the plan with mediators in Qatar and Egypt calling on Israel and Hamas to finalize the deal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has agreed to address a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress after being invited by top congressional leaders. He calls it a privilege to represent Israel, adding that he's thrilled to present the truth about the war. All right. We'll have more on how this is all playing out in Israel in a live report from Tel Aviv. But first, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has details on the new proposal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It was a notable moment and perhaps a pivotal one. It was the furthest that President Biden has gone in telling Israel that it has met the its stated goals and that the capabilities of Hamas have been degraded.Now, the plan includes three different phases. Some of the details of which we have reported before, that includes the first phase, a six- week temporary ceasefire that would include the release of hostages of women, the elderly, and the wounded in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is the release of all hostages and opens up the possibility for the ceasefire to continue longer, as long as negotiations are ongoing. And the third is the major reconstruction of Gaza. Of course, the president noting in his address that it is a decisive moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This is truly a decisive moment. Israel's made their proposal. Hamas needs to take the deal. I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal. We can't lose this moment. Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory, that will not bring hostages home. That will not bring an enduring defeat of Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, in this instance, he's been invited by all four main leaders of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike. I suppose he also wants to reassure lawmakers in the United States that Israel isn't misusing any of the weapons that the United States is providing. As we know some of those weapons -- shipments have been suspended. And I think also for his domestic audience here in Israel, it's always helpful for him to be seen on the international global stage that he is still a global player and he is the only person, in his eyes, that can represent Israel's interest abroad and with its main ally the United States.

So, there's clearly -- there is not a close friendship between Ukraine and China in this matter. Meanwhile, the Chinese were at this forum earlier today, Kim, and the message they were trying to spread was that, A, they say that China is a force for stability around the world, but at the same time, they had some harsh words for the newly elected government in Taiwan, which they accused of being separatists and they had a warning that that government would be nailed to the pillar of shame of history if it refuses to peacefully reunify with Beijing.

Russia launched a massive wave of attacks Saturday morning, including this one that left at least 12 people injured in the Kharkiv region. Now, most of the attacks went after energy infrastructure across Ukraine, causing critical damage to at least two power plants. At least four more people were wounded in the western part of the country. And officials said some restrictions on energy consumption will be imposed. Ukraine says this was the sixth wave of attacks on its energy system in a little over two months. Now, those attacks came after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to conduct strikes inside Russia with U.S.-made weapons. The permission applies only to areas near Ukraine's Kharkiv region, but it marks a dramatic departure from previous U.S. policy.

On the battlefield, I saved myself thanks to the fact that we were constantly undergoing medical training. I immediately put a tourniquet on myself and remained conscious. His right leg later also had to be amputated. The problem for Ukraine, scores of amputees but not enough technicians to make the prosthetics they need. Now, a German project called Life Bridge Ukraine is bringing both Ukrainians who lost limbs and Ukrainian technicians in training to Berlin to help the wounded while giving the trainees valuable experience. Volodymyr Khavrylov (ph) just constructed his first artificial leg, and he knows he'll remain busy. Unfortunately, there will be even more guys with injuries, he says. We need good workshops to provide these guys with a good life. We need to bring them back into society. We must be aware of this, not forget, and most importantly, help each other. Ukraine keeps the number of war related amputees secret, but estimates go into the tens of thousands. Life Bridge Ukraine aims to establish several prosthetics workshops and care centers inside Ukraine.
