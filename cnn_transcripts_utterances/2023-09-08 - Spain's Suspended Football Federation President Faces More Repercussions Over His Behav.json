Spain prosecutors have filed a sexual assault and coercion complaint against Luis Rubiales over that unwanted kiss he gave Jenny Hermoso after Spain's World Cup win. The complaint is step one, rather, in a process that could result in charges against Rubiales. Journalist Atika Shubert is tracking this story for us. So, Atika, have we heard any kind of reaction or response from Luis Rubiales over the fact that he may indeed be facing criminal charges?",

We also reached out to theSpanish Football Federation, of course, which he is the president of, that has now been suspended by FIFA. And they say they have nothing to do with the legal defense of Rubiales. So, they have distanced themselves from him as well. I have to say that Rubiales has maintained his innocence throughout all this. You know, even when the scandal was just beginning to break, he insisted that this kiss he forcefully planted on Jenny Hermoso was a consensual kiss. She maintains that it was unwanted and not consensual. The end result is this filing by the national prosecutor. Now, what this does basically is open up the way for national court to have an investigation. If that continues forward then this could lead to possible charges and the complaint specifically says sexual assault and coercion. Now, the sexual assault part, we can see from you know, the World Cup celebrations with that kiss. But the coercion part happened actually several days later as the scandal was breaking. According to Jenny Hermoso, the player, she says that she was pressured into making a statement and that a number of people around her were pressured by Rubiales and his associates. And this is what she told the prosecutor. And the prosecutor's complaint says that this could be perceived as harassment. So, there's a lot more to this case file, Zain.",

The storm just weakened slightly to a Category-4after skyrocketing to a Category-5 overnight. But the last report, maximum sustained winds hit 249 kilometers per hour. The northern Caribbean could see dangerous surf and rip currents sometime today, and the U.S. East Coast could feel some effects in just days. Let's bring in meteorologist Jennifer Gray. One of the reasons why this particular storm is so scary is because of how rapidly it intensified, just how quickly it went from category one to category five. It has weakened to a Category-4, but Category-4 is still no joke. Will it hit at some point next week the east coast of the United States? What's the trajectory?",

      "sentences": "Well, as of right now, it looks like it's going to stay off the east coast. However, there's a lot ofuncertainty, so this is still days and days away. So, we're going to be watching it closely. But with 250 kilometers per hour winds and gust of 305-kilometer-per hour winds, this is definitely a force. So, this one's going to stay just to the north of the of Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, the Leeward Islands. You can see Turks and Caicos in the Bahamas. Still out of the cone, this storm is expected to take a turn to the north. And that's really the million-dollar question, Zain, is when will that turn occur? It's supposed to occur midweek next week, and that's really going to determine the impacts that we see along the U.S. East Coast. We know we're going to get high surf. We know we're going to get ripped currents, but are we going to see more than that? So, here's the forecast satellite radar. You can see just some isolated showers across the Caribbean, but you can see the storm staying well away, so we'll see high surf, high waves. Will see some rain, but this is that turn and you can see that red box. These are basically all the forecast models we look for to determine the forecast and you can see the later turns could have more impacts along the East Coast. If this takes a turn sooner, then we know that we're not going to see as many impacts. So, the big synoptic features that we're looking at this going to determine where exactly the storm is going to go is this high to the east and the low to the West. So, it's basically going to go right in between. So, some of the forecast models do have it close to maybe Nova Scotia or even Maine is not out of the question. We know that Cape Cod and Massachusetts sticks out a little bit, so that's really going to be well. We'll be watching closely over the next couple of days, especially by the time we get in to the end of next week. But Zain, I would say, really, the time to focus on this is midweek next week. We'll have a much better idea of where this storm is going to go once we're able to see when that turn takes place. And we see how close it could potentially get to the U.S. mainland. But this storm is huge and we'll see if it can maintain that intensity going forward.",

Despite that, the White House has deep concerns about Mr. Modi's record on human rights and what's said to be democratic backsliding, like restrictions, for example, on the press. The summit is notable this year for two major absences. Chinese President Xi Jinping not attending. Neither is Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ivan Watson joins us live now from New Delhi. So, Ivan, so much talk about here. I think one of the big things is whether or not the U.S. can fill the void at the summit left by Xi and Putin not attending.

The alternate route would allow ships to avoid international waters and travel close to the Romanian, Bulgarian and Turkish coasts. Just this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wouldn't renew the grain initiative unless his demands were met. Meantime, the Kremlin is trying to tighten its grip on regions in Ukraine it either fully or partially controls. Russian-installed authorities are holding so-called elections today in occupied eastern areas. But Kyiv is slamming the vote, calling it a sham. They're calling it a farce. And they're also calling on the international community not to recognize the results. The U.S. describes the process as nothing more than a propaganda exercise.

The reign of Elizabeth II was very clearly, the post-war, post-colonial Commonwealth era. Charles III, I think, would very much accept that we are not in that position anymore. We have to move forward, especially given the fact that young people in Britain are not really monarchists. They may not be rabid anti-monarchists, but if you ask them, okay, what's the King for? They might say, well, I don't know what he's for.",

Perhaps someone who was brought up in very,very privileged circumstances will feel it a bit less than we do. We work in current affairs. It's our job to politically analyze what's happening. But even he couldn't have failed to have noticed, not just the end of the post-colonial era, but what you say about these changes in the wider world completely. We're in the middle of a war situation. Russia has invaded Ukraine. You have got Rishi Sunak going over to India to try and beg India for a trade deal. You've got the rise of China. You've got the breakdown of the idea that democracy is a norm. It might be that 20 years into the future, democracy is not the norm at all. Dictatorships are the norm. So, what role can King Charles of Merry Old England play within that? He has to realize with humility that times are changing and he may have a relatively limited role. What he can do, however, is stand up for his long- standing beliefs, things about the environment, things about agriculture. All of the issues that we made fun of him for when he was a younger gentleman. And now we're thinking, oh my gosh, you were absolutely right.",

      "sentences": "Yes, things are seeming to spiral out of control in terms of the insecurity in the country. And someanalysts are saying that since the coup which happened first in 2020 and then in 2021, led by the same general who now runs the country, Mali has effectively turned its back on its Western powers. First, France left -- the French troops left, and now the U.N. peacekeeping troop, which has been in the country since 2013 -- excuse me -- they're on the way to leaving. The Minusma have been leading the peacekeeping efforts in Mali, trying to keep the insurgents at bay. We're not only talking about Al Qaeda-linked insurgents, but we're also talking about ISIS, who are trying to gain ground in this region. So, some are saying that Mali is going to be in trouble as all these peacekeeping forces leave and they find themselves somewhat isolated. And of course, Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, has been present in Mali since that second coup happened in 2021. But of course, Wagner is in flux. We don't know really where that organization is and what is happening with the fighters who were deployed to Mali. So, there's this kind of geopolitical backdrop that these attacks are happening. The passenger boats that was attacked on Thursday was actually attacked again previously last week and local media reporting that a 12- year-old died in that previous attack. So, things are looking very bleak kind of security wise right now in the country's end.",

U.S. military officials says that Some American troops and military equipment will be repositioned, moving from a base near the capital to one in central Niger. And some non-essential personnel are going to be told to leave the country. Officials say the move was done out of an abundance of caution following that July coup. The U.S. has 1100 troops stationed in the country. Oren Lieberman joins us live now from the Pentagon. What I find interesting about this, Oren, is just the timing of this. The fact that the U.S. didn't make this move immediately, but instead waited six weeks after the coup to make this change. Just walk us through the thinking.",

      "sentences": "Correct. And Niger is obviously an issue we have repeatedly pressed the Department of Defense onto find out what the thinking is, what the reasoning is, and what's coming in the future. And for six weeks, the answer was that nothing has really changed. Yes, the troops and other personnel there are essentially on lockdown, confined to the bases. That includes the embassy, which has some troops and the Airbase 101 near the capital of Niamey and Airbase 201 in Central Niger near city or inner city called Agadez (ph). Now, after six weeks in which the U.S. simply didn't carry out its CT operations, its counterterrorism operations or its recon operations out of Niger, the defense department and officials here say they will move some troops from the base in Niamey towards the base in Agadez as you point out of an abundance of caution. This is not in response to a new threat, according to the Pentagon, and there's no new threat to U.S. troops in the region instead. This was simply after a look at the situation and a decision to move those troops and that personnel and equipment to Air Base 201 there. Now, it does not indicate the U.S. will restart the operations that it has suspended or put on pause there. That's an announcement or a decision we're still waiting for. So, the troops that are, that will remain there and those that are moving around, essentially remain on lockdown restricted to the bases they are at. A U.S. official says the move from one air base of the into another from 101 to two 201 was done in coordination with the Nigerian military even as the cooperation exercises and training with the Nigerian military have been paused ever since that coup. Still, Zain, worth pointing out the Biden administration has not called it a coup yet because that would trigger a number of follow-on steps and perhaps force the U.S. to pull out its troops, but the U.S. is essentially still waiting and hoping, it seems, for some sort of diplomatic resolution to what's happening there in some way out of what is quite clearly a mess from the outside.",
