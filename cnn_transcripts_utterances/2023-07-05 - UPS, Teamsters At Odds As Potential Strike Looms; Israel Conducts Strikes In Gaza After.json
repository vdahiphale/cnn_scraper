We're also heading into back-to-school shopping season and believe it or not, the retailers, the holiday shopping season as they're bringing inventory into the U.S.A strike in August is very bad timing, Boris. We've seen a little of what a supply chain slowdown can look like at the ports of the docks. We had a little bit of a scare with the railroads. And now we're looking at a potential scare with the roads. No one wants to see this strike. There are still weeks to go.

It's interesting because Senator Tom Carper is retiring.And sets off this chain reaction. Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester is running to replace him. She would become, if elected, the first African American ever to represent Delaware in the Senate. And the first woman to ever represent Delaware in the Senate. And then of course, she also would be replaced in the House by another trail blazer, Sarah McBride, State Senator Sarah McBride who won her state Senate seat with more than 70 percent of the vote in 2020. Interesting, President Biden credits Sarah McBride -- who worked for him -- as helping to shape views. I don't know if he would say open his mind. But certainly as a life-long Catholic who has been more conservative on social issues than other Democrats, hoping, you know, to make him see things through her eyes in a way.",

So of course, the Paris Accords, the IPCC is all about holding it at 1.5.It doesn't mean the planet has now tipped beyond that. We dip over and then come back day to day, week to week. But the trend line is just clear. And what's staggering is that the amount of extra heat now earth's system is holding in. All that planet cooking pollution from fossil fuels holds in the equivalent of ten Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb explosions per second every day. And the oceans have hidden a lot of that heat from us on land, absorbing 90 percent of it. Now that El Nino is back, this natural warming pattern, boom!

Japan's Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant will soon begin releasing radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. Officials say the plant -- which remember was devastated fire powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 --has run out of space to hold its treated wastewater. the United Nations nuclear watchdog has approved the project, arguing the radioactive water will be highly diluted and will be released in small amounts over time. Even with nuclear safety standards in place, there are still some experts who worry it may impact marine life. A shark swimming near the shore of a very crowded beach in Florida sent swimmers scrambling to get out of the water. Of course, I would run too. The woman who took this video says the shark appear to be chasing fish. No one was bitten or hurt. In 2022 Florida recorded the highest of unprovoked shark bites worldwide, which of course still remain statistically very small. And Subway is now offering its deli meat freshly sliced. Around 80 percent of the sandwich chain stores will now display these $6,000 slicers near the deli counter. This is a major shift from Subway's previous method of pre-slicing it's meat at its factories and then delivering it to stores. Boris, I think there's a \"Seinfeld\" episode about that, but we could talk about that later.",

But I will say this is one study that is part of an emerging body of research showing that just your BMI alone may not necessarily be the best indicator of your overall health. And what researchers did for this particular study, they did look at people's BMI and then they looked at death reports, death rates, and did that comparison to find that being overweight itself may not necessarily be associated with an increased risk of early death.Now I will say we're looking specifically at the measurement of being overweight which is having a BMI of 25 to 29. Obesity is having a BMI of 30-plus. And we know that there are many chronic diseases associated with obesity. So, we have to keep that in mind here. But overall, Boris, this is just another indicator that more factors other than BMI can help really give a picture of a patient's overall health like co-morbidities which are other chronic diseases, like family history. And of course to maintain a healthy BMI, the best thing to do -- work out, eat right, and have those kind of healthy lifestyle factors which can play a role in your overall health, as well.",
