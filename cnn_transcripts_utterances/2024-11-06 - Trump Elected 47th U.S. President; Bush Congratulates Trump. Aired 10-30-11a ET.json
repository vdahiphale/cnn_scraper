So, in any case -- that's besides the point, as usual. One of the things that I think is important to keep in mind is the two of them may not be able to coexist in the same place.Elon is very petulant and so is Trump. And I don't think Trump's going to like the attention that Elon's going to grab for himself. He's an attention sponge like you cannot believe. Having interviewed them and known him for 30 years, I've interviewed more than anybody has, he really -- he and Trump will clash at some point, much in the same way that he clashed with the Biden administration. I absolutely agree with you that the Biden administration, by not inviting him to that particular event, which was a car event, Elon called me a lot and texted me a lot about that. He was very hurt by it. It was a big mistake. So, much so that I called Biden people and said, what are you doing? And I thought it was a mistake because he does get credit for the cars. He does get credit for the space stuff. He does get credit for innovation as do many people. What he does not get credit for is his heinous comments and behavior and bringing people down that -- and that troubles me and you can separate it from the entrepreneurship if you have half a brain.",

But from what I was seeing and what I was hearing a big focus on the economy and inflation and frankly, a lot of folks not recognizing the real progress that was made by President Biden and Vice President Harris.

It's really legacy for her at this point and how she graciously gets out of this, at this point.As far as what happens long-term, you can't count anybody out in politics anymore. I mean, we've counted so many people out in politics and they've all come back, including the president elect of the United States, right? But in addition to that, though, I do think that Democrats have really got to start thinking to themselves right now. Do they try to use every lever and power of government that they can pull right now, which is probably executive orders, across a host of issues and have Biden try to do those very quickly before he gets -- you know, knocked out of office and Donald Trump comes in?

We also have to remember that the Supreme Court has essentially said that anything that the president does, you know, while they are in office is, you know, gets granted presidential immunity. You know, people have been saying for a while that Joe Biden should take advantage of that. He has not. Now, is the time to take advantage of that.The other thing, though, that I think is really important is that Kamala Harris needs to give the kind of speech that I think acknowledges just how historic and important her campaign was. And I think it's the kind of statement that you make when on the -- you know, essentially on the -- in the aftermath of the election, you can point and say, even as the country is changing and radically different, here is an option, here is what so many people in this country also chose. And so, there is a way to do it that is both magnanimous, but also that sets the blueprint for what Democrats can do in the future, particularly because if you are a member of the Democratic Party, there are dark times ahead, but it is also a time for rebirth and for rethinking what the Democratic Party stands for and how to actually reach and touch people and to use Kamala Harris perhaps as a linchpin to do that is a really powerful thing that should happen in her speech.
