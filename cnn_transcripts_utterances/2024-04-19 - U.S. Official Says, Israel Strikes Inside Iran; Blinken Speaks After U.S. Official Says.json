But this morning, we're seeing what appears to be the first signs of relief around the world as a source in the region declares direct strikes between the two enemies are now over and both nations so far seem to be downplaying it all.We are standing by right now to hear from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He is in Italy right now and will deliver his first remarks since Israel's strike. Here's what's happened. U.S. officials confirm Israel carried out an attack overnight at a military base near the city of Isfahan. Iran says air defenses intercepted three drones. Israel has vowed retaliation for the barrage of missiles that Iran launched last weekend into Israel. So, what message did Israel intend to send? And where does the risk for wider conflict stand at this hour? We have live team coverage in Israel and Washington. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. Kylie Atwood is at the State Department. Jeremy, what are you hearing in Israel right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, over the course of the last nearly week since Iran carried out that attack on Israel, we have been hearing this talk of threading the needle, of trying to find a way for Israel to respond militarily to what they viewed as a crossing of a red line by Iran, by carrying out an attack from Iranian soil targeting Israel directly, using its own forces rather than its proxy forces in the region.And it appears that this response that we saw last night done very quietly without any public comment so far from the Israeli government, appears to have been that attempt to thread the needle, to carry out an attack on Iranian soil without doing so publicly and without, it seems, causing significant casualties. What we understand from a regional intelligence source is that Iran is not expected to retaliate any further, basically this source saying that the tit-for-tat between these two countries, at least directly, again, I'm not talking about the battles between their proxy forces, but at least directly, that this exchange of fire appears to be over for the moment. And that is quite notable because it was only yesterday that we heard the Iranian foreign minister warning directly that if Israel struck Iran directly, that Iran's response would be immediate and it would be overwhelming. And so it appears that this kind of quiet attack that Israel appears to have carried out overnight in terms of public messaging, that that may have been enough to avoid that kind of retaliation and to avoid all-out war between these two countries.",

There is also historic symbolism as it relates to that target. There also appear to have been air defense targets in Syria that the Israeli military has struck.But, again, the details are coming through kind of in drips and drabs, especially because we don't have anything official from the Israeli government or from the Israeli military acknowledging this attack. But I do want to kind of focus back on what the Iranian foreign minister said yesterday just hours before Israel carried out this strike. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  In case of a repeated adventure-seeking and adventurism of the Israeli regime, what will our maximum response be? I can only say that it will be carried out at a maximum level and it will be regretful for them. The details have been planned by the armed forces of my country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And so, as we were talking about, that was a pretty grave warning from the Iranian foreign minister just hours before it appears that Israel carried out these strikes, and yet we didn't see that response from Iran.We didn't see that immediate and overwhelming response, and part of that appears to be because of the way in which Israel carried out this strike, by doing so without any kind of public fanfare, without any kind of public acknowledgment, allowing Iran to effectively save face in the process, to avoid the embarrassment or needing a sense that they would need to retaliate once again. So, again, for now, at least, things appear to be quiet. I also think that one more point to make is the fact that the Israeli prime minister, as he has been deliberating over the course of the last week, he has been facing enormous pressure from the United States and from other countries that helped Israel carry out that enormous and very successful air defense operation in the early hours of Sunday morning when Iran carried out its attack with more than 300 drones and ballistic missiles. And in those days, we have seen the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries beginning to level more diplomatic pressure, more sanctions on Iran once again, and if you know anything about Benjamin Netanyahu, that kind of anti-Iran coalition has always been something that he has sought to strengthen. And in this, he certainly saw an opportunity to do so, and there's no question that if he had carried out a strike that had escalated things further, that he could have risked that coalition crumbling once again.",

Will you take action on those recommendations?

All I can say is that, for our part, and for the entire G7, our focus has been on de-escalation, on avoiding a larger conflict. And actually, that's been true since day one after the horrific events of October 7th. A big part of our approach has been to prevent the conflict from spreading, to avoid escalation everywhere. And that's a common policy across the G7. And it's very much our approach now. So we've been engaged in efforts to avoid escalation. Those efforts will continue. Italy plays a critical role in this. As a leading country, as a country that's engaged around the world with many other countries that have their own relationships with countries involved in the Middle East, Italy has its own direct engagements. And I think what we've seen over the past ten days or so, a couple of weeks, is that those engagements have been and remain very important to keeping things calm, to avoiding escalation, to preventing a larger conflict. Italy is an important player in this.",

Would you say that now we are averting a major confrontation and a possible war?And what messages would the U.S. play in sending to both sides for restraint? And are we back to the proxy war? And if you allow me on Rafah, the U.S. position is very clear. You are opposed to a military operation in Rafah as long as there is no plan to evacuate 1.5 million Palestinian civilians. The Israeli government is adamant to go ahead. What is your understanding of the plan now and what is acceptable for the U.S.? And finally, on the U.N. Security Council, the United States locks isolated yesterday. Your allies, close allies, France, Japan, and South Korea, both voted for admitting Palestine as a member. The Israelis, including Netanyahu, on the record, saying they opposed the two-state solution. So what is the path forward and what message do you give to Palestinians and to moderates in the region if you truly want to isolate extremists? Thank you.",
