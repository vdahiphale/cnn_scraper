One, these are early preliminary exit poll findings. These numbers will shift as the night goes on and more and more interviews come in. The second thing everyone should be aware of, this exit poll encompasses every kind of voter, whether you voted pre-election day, on election day, by mail, early in person before election day. We have incorporated polls of all kinds of voters that are incorporated into this exit poll. With that being said, let`s look at the numbers on the mood of the country. It`s a pretty dour mood in terms of the way people feel things are going in the United States. Nationally, only 7% of voters say they`re enthusiastic. 19% say they`re satisfied. Look at these numbers. 43% dissatisfied, 29% angry, 72% of the electorate in nationally say they`re dissatisfied or angry. What about America`s best days, we ask? Are they in the future or are they in the past? 61% of voters in this election across the country say America`s best days are ahead of the country. Six in 10 say so. 34% say the best days are in the past. And finally, President Joe Biden`s approval rating, it`s at 41% in these early preliminary exit poll findings. 58% of voters in this election across the country nationally disapprove of the way that the incumbent Democratic president is doing his job.",

It`sbeen sort of trickling all day with lots of people in the morning, and now we`re starting to get a lot more people in the evening. I do want to bring in quickly the Fellows-Leese family. What we have been seeing that is so lovely here in Cedarburg is that entire families are showing up, voting separately, but together. I noticed that you did this lovely thing where they were showing you the ballots and sort of how it was working. I heard you guys talking back and forth, and it was just wonderful to see families teaching and also learning about this really important process that we all should be taking part in. And Cedarburg, as we understand it, may have up to 95% of the voters come in to vote, which is an incredibly high number. So thank you so much for doing your civic duty and coming in today as the whole family. I love it. It`s wonderful.",

If you`re a Republican, you might be saying, wow, this is a route. If you`re a Democrat, you might be saying, oh my goodness, we should be worried. No, we`re early in the night. As Chris Wallace said, I love the analogy, nobody has broken serve yet. As in every red state here, Donald Trump won in 2020 when he lost the White House. Every blue state on the map so far, Joe Biden carried when he won the White House. What don`t we have? We don`t have Rhode Island. We don`t have Connecticut. We don`t have New Jersey. We don`t have Illinois just yet. Long time blue states. So as we move west and as the count advances in some of the New York as well, some of the most reliably blue states, this map will change in the near future. At least that is our expectation. We`ll keep an eye on it.",

This is a huge, huge achievement for Donald Trump and a huge bucket of electoral votes, 19 of them for his path back to the presidency. CEDRIC RICHMOND, HARRIS CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIR:  We still have votes to count. We still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to fight to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken. So you won`t hear from the Vice President tonight, but you will hear from her tomorrow. She will be back here tomorrow to address not only the HU family, not only to address her supporters, but to address the nation. So thank you. We believe in you. May God bless you.

We`re going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help and it needs help very badly. We`re going to fix our borders. We`re going to fix everything about our country. And we made history for a reason tonight. And the reason is going to be just that. We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible. And it is now clear that we`ve achieved the most incredible political thing. Look what happened. Is this crazy? (APPLAUSE)",
