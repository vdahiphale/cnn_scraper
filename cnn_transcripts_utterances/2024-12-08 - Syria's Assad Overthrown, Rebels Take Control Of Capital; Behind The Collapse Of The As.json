I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And we begin with historic breaking news out of Syria, where after more than 50 years, the rule of the Assad family is over. And for many Syrians, it is the end of a brutal dictatorship they have known their entire lives. A source telling CNN ousted President Bashar al-Assad and his family have fled to Moscow where they have been granted asylum. The fall of the House of Assad came quickly. Just weeks after a coalition of Syrian rebels began a rapid sweep across the country taking control of several major cities, and finally the Syrian capital. Our Fred Pleitgen is joining us now from Moscow. And, Fred, what more do we know about Assad's departure from Syria?",

It was quite interesting because they say they are giving Bashar al-Assad and members of his family asylum here in Russia on humanitarian grounds, as they put it, and it really comes after a day where it was really unclear where the ousted leader of the Syrian Arab Republic was for much of the day.Early this morning, the rebels stormed into the Syrian capital or fully stormed into the Syrian capital, went into government buildings, of course also went into the presidential palace there. And the first that we'd heard this morning is they said that he had fled the capital, Bashar al-Assad, but it was unclear where he was. And it was actually the Russians who first came out and confirmed that Bashar al- Assad had left Syria. The Russian Foreign Ministry coming out with a statement saying that Assad had instructed the members of his government to make sure that there is a transfer of power before leaving the country. They did not say where Bashar al-Assad was going. And so for much of the day that remained unclear. And it was only in the evening hours that the Russians then said that they did confirm that he was here on the ground in Moscow with members of his family, and that the Russians are giving him asylum, which means that Russia, which has been one of the main backers, of course, of the Assad regime for an extended period of time, as Assad has now been ousted, is allowing him to come here and obviously giving him a safe haven -- Jessica.",

It was obviously important at the time of the height of the Syrian civil war, especially in 2015, things were not going well at all for the Assad government at that point in time. In fact, I was in Damascus as that was happening. And there was one setback after the next for the Assad forces on the battlefield.And there was a real fear in Damascus at that point in time that they could fall then and that Assad would be ousted. And it was the Russians then that came in with their air force at that airbase in Khmeimim, near Latakia, which they still have, that then really turned the tides on the battlefield. There was, of course, pro-Iranian and Iranian forces who were on the ground as well. But Russia's air force really coming in with a punch and helping Bashar al-Assad's forces. And so they were key to him staying in power also up until now. But it seems as though at this point in time even the Russians have realized that on the ground, so few people now willing to fight for Bashar al- Assad, that the Russians themselves are saying, look, it is what it is. They say that they're in contact with all the armed factions that are on the ground. Of course, the big issue that they now have is whether or not they're going to be able to keep those military assets that they have here, their air base in latakia and then also that port, which is really important to them, near the town of Tartus, where they just recently conducted a big naval exercise from there -- Jessica.",

Fearing the developing threat, the United States led a coalition to fight Assad's terrorist enemies for him, ISIS and al Qaeda. Russia, too, joined the fight. Assad and his allies Hezbollah from Lebanon, an Iranian militia, were losing ground, committing more forces than any other country with barbaric internationally condemned ground and air assaults. Russia turned the tide in Assad's favor. But when Russia's forces went to war in Ukraine in 2022, the clock on Assad's rule began ticking down. By late 2024, his other main allies, Iran and Hezbollah, were bloodied by over a year long war with Israel. Assad's fortunes plummeted. Former al Qaeda turned nationalist Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham surged out of their northern enclave, exploiting Assad's allies' weakness, overrunning the country. Within two weeks Assad had fled to Russia, ending his family's half century, ruthless repression of the Syrian people. His life in exile begins living in the shadow of fear.

General, thanks so much for joining us. When we left you last night, this was all really unfolding. And now here we are 24 hours later and the Assad regime has officially fallen. What do you make of where we stand right now? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, I think right now the question is really what's going to happen there in Damascus and in the rest of Syria because there are contending factions. The Syrian Democratic Forces that we're supporting and U.S. forces on the south as President Biden has made a lot of strikes against ISIS. Those Syrian Democratic Forces are going to try to expand their reach. The Kurds are going to be very, very concerned about what happens because this HTS group has had backing from Turkey and President Erdogan was the first of the national leaders who said, when this was all unfolding a couple of days ago, he said, well, I hope that everyone will get out of the way and support them. So he's behind this group and that's not good news for the Kurds. But President Erdogan and Turkey have always had larger ambitions to stabilize this region and to do more. On the one hand, that could be helpful and on the other hand, it will bring its own challenges and rivalries from other regional powers and all that's going to play out because it would be very surprising if HTS has a constitutional game plan to call the U.N. and supervise some elections or elected parliament and so forth. I hope it happens but it would be really remarkable if it does. Instead, what's likely to happen is one party rule behind the scenes, cutting deals, some people will be cut out. The real question is, what about these terrorists that are being held in northeast Syria. For goodness' sake, if they get released, that's a whole another level of challenge for the United States and for the region. So there are many, many uncertainties in this. One thing, though, Jessica, is President Biden did take credit for this. And his support of Israel and the way that the United States has handled it and there's no doubt that the weakening of Iran, the weakening of Hezbollah and so forth, Israel's actions have enabled this to occur. As far as Russia is concerned, I suspect that President Erdogan and President Putin have got this worked out. The naval base will stay there. The terrorists won't bother the Russians. This gives actually, for President Erdogan, it's good. He's got a little whole card to play with Mr. Putin if he has to because -- through his influence in this regime if he has that influence. And again, we don't know that for sure but he can, you know, turn the screws on Mr. Putin on those naval bases and the airfield when he wants to. And so, in this region, everybody is talking to everybody all of the time at various levels. So there's a lot more to see as this unravels.",

We have these young kids who the world left to get gassed and they wrote on the wall, you know, your next doctor and they got their nails pulled out. They grew up, they liberated their country without anyone else. And now when we cleared ISIS completely out, as we've done for Russia, Iran and Assad, U.S. troops can go home in the right way, honorably, after doing a massive favor to the world in the Syrian people by helping us get rid of ISIS in the northeast, as the rebels did in the northwest.",

And how are we going to take care of them? What is the resolution to that?And in that group is DACA. They're the Dreamers. And so, you know, I've always been in favor of them. But it's been these policies that have really stopped us from having those discussions because the border has been wide open. And that's just the facts. And so once we do that then a lot of Republicans and then we can work with some Democrats to get some legislation to take care of that problem once and for all. And I think that President Trump, ironically, is going to be the president who's going to be able to do that.",

Remember that this fall happened quite suddenly and abruptly while the U.S. was monitoring and tracking these developments in Syria. Senior administration officials acknowledged to reporters earlier today that this is certainly a surprise. And now comes the task of trying to sort out the next steps.And as you just mentioned President Biden in his remarks earlier said that it was, quote, \"a moment of historic opportunity as well as risk and uncertainty.\" And so he did also take a bit of a victory lap by saying that U.S. policy had in some respects helped this happen. Of course, Iran and Russia were tied up and he said that that basically didn't allow them to defend Syria and left them in this situation. Now, the president also saying and outlining a plan ahead in the ways that the U.S. would help the region. He said, for example, that the U.S. will support Syria's neighbors, for example Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Israel. He also said that he would speak to his counterparts in the coming days and send senior administration officials to the region. He did not say who or when, but certainly that is part of the plan going forward. He also said that the U.S. would work to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and engage with Syrian groups. And this part was notable because he was inviting discussion and encouraging those Syrian groups to speak up in this period of transition, and that goes to the bottom line here, which is that the U.S., while they plan to essentially have a hand in this, it is ultimately up to Syria what their future will or how their future will unfold. And that is what the president had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
