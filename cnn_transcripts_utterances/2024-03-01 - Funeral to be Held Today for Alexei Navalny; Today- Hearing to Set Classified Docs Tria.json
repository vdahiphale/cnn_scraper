      "sentences": "Well, at the moment, we're not able to watch very much, because as you say, it appears that that live signal has been jammed. That's the same situation facing Navalny's team, who had also been putting out a live signal from the church.We have seen scenes, though, as you've mentioned, of hundreds and hundreds of mourners lining up for many city blocks for an opportunity to attend this funeral and to pay their respects to the slayed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. I think many people are bracing themselves for the possibility -- you talked about that heavy police presence -- of some kind of crackdown, if those protests -- I'm sorry, if those mourners attempt to protest in some way, shape, or form. It's worth underscoring what an act of bravery it is just to attend this funeral, which is, frankly, a very tense and potentially dangerous place to be right now. And the other thing I think is worth mentioning, Kasie, is that today is as much about who is not there as who is there. Who is not there is Alexei Navalny's daughter, Dasha; his son, Zakhar; and his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, who has been speaking publicly and boldly against President Putin since her husband was killed. She just addressed the European Parliament a few days ago. She met with President Biden in San Francisco while she was visiting her daughter last week, who was a student at Stanford University. And she has indicated that she is really going to take the mantle, as it were as, you know, a leading force in Russia's opposition. But very telling that she is not there today. And of course, one can only presume just how dangerous it would be for her to even attempt to go back to Russia at this stage -- Kasie.",

Welcome all. Josh Rogin, let me start with you. You know, Clarissa noted just the bravery of the people that are there today. What do you see when you look at them, when you understand how many of them are willing to risk their own freedom to come out for that? And what message that sends to us in the West.",

      "sentences": "Right? Well, I think, first of all, the fact that Putin is blocking the public, or at least trying to block the public from watching this funeral exposes his lie that he doesn't care about this, right? The Kremlin says no comment. Putin famously won't mention Navalny's name. He says no, he doesn't have any support.Well, if he's not so concerned, then why is he deploying thousands of police to arrest hundreds of people and blocking the world from watching it. So just from that, we can see that Putin is lying. Now, what I think it shows is that, despite the technology, can we see this again in China and Saudi Arabia? Lots of places. That's used to suppress these voices. These voices are persistent that, despite the fact that we in the West may have forgotten, in a sense, in our own politics, why people value sort of, you know, democracy and human rights and freedom. Maybe we don't -- Americans don't think it's our role in the world anymore to promote these things. The people in these countries are not going to stop. They're going to keep fighting for their own dignity, whether we help them or not in Russia, in Ukraine, in China, you name it. And to me that says that we should probably help them, because eventually, they will struggle to get their dignity one way or the other. Eventually, all dictators die. One way or the other. And eventually, the -- the struggle for human dignity will succeed. And I feel like in the West, we have an opportunity to be on the right side of that history, whether we realize it or whether it's popular in our politics at this moment or not. HUNT: Well, I mean Sarah Longwell, we've been on that side of history since World War II, the end of World War II. But it's fraying, and it's -- that's in no small part due to Donald Trump.",

I think it's important that -- you know, here in America, I think it's easy for us to sort of dismiss that for most people going about their day-to-day lives; don't think about it, necessarily. However, those images -- those people who we're seeing standing outside, they are literally risking their lives to be there. That is how dire this is. And this is a man not only there, but in -- as we're seeing in the Ukraine, what he is doing. And those images need to remind us that that is what Donald Trump wants to emulate.

But what we all -- they understood that we had to show strength and support for the president, because showing too much distance was actually going to make it harder to get her back.

But that's not what you're hearing from Donald Trump. I mean, his comment on Navalny's death was mostly about himself, whereas other leaders in the GOP said, this -- this is a horror; this is -- this is Putin's doing. That was not Donald Trump, and he is certainly, obviously the leader of the Republican Party right now.

That's what's going on here. Jack Smith's team says July. We should be ready to go just after July 4. And the defense teams, they're saying dates of August and September. They have to propose something, because they already tried once with this judge to say, We don't want to have a trial at all before the election. And she said, No, that's not how it's going to go. We are going to put some dates on the calendar. So they proposed some dates, but the way they did this, very cooly, is they have put into their filing, helpfully for the judge, all of the dates of primary elections for Donald Trump and other candidates, potentially, between now and for the rest of the season. And so the judge is going to be looking at both her calendar, the calendars of the Justice Department and the defense teams, as well as now, she has before her the political calendar.

Politics would need to yield to the justice system. We're going to be watching very closely to see if Judge Aileen Cannon here in the Southern District of Florida is going to have a similar view. Does the criminal justice system come first? Does his responsibilities as a criminal defendant standing trial, is that something that Donald Trump is going to need to do, even if it's in the middle of the Republican National Convention or in the middle of the campaign season, where he would be -- much rather be very likely somewhere else than sitting in the courtroom behind me.",

That is how all of these trials are looking like for Donald Trump, at least the two federal cases against him, that the prosecutors are putting together cases that would take a couple of weeks to present. And then there would be time for a defense case if Trump's team would want to do that, as well. So this would not be a one- or two-day thing. This would be something that would last longer.
