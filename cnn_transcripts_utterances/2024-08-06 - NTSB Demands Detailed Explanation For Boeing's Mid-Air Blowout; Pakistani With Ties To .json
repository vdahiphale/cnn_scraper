And officials for Boeing subcontractor, Spirit AeroSystems, are also in the hot seat today. Also the NTSB released some new interview transcripts today. One Boeing worker, quoted as saying, \"We were replacing doors like we we're replacing our underwear. The planes come in, jacked up every day, every day.\" CNN aviation correspondent, Pete Muntean, has been following this hearing. That's quite the quote, Pete. What are your takeaways from this hearing?",

There's going to be plenty of time for that. We want to know the safety improvements. But what is very confusing for a lot of people who are watching, who are listening, is what was going on then. This is an investigation on what happened on January 5th - understand -- for everybody? Great. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now remember that Boeing factory workers of the Renton factory near Seattle took out the door plug but then re-installed the door plug without the four critical bolts. Then of course, the blowout took place on January 5th. Something else that has been interesting here is that Elizabeth Lund, head of Boeing quality control, insisted so many changes have been made. She says the changes have occurred not only in trying to hire new workers with more experience. But also trying to reduce something called traveling work. Something is that is at the center of these issues that have been on Boeing's factory floor. Still a lot to unfold here, Brianna. We are only at the first quarter of a two-day-long hearing. Very rare that the National Transportation Safety Board does something like this. And by the way, this is it's not about pilots or flight crew. This is not going to be pilot error. This is focusing primarily on what took place at Boeing while this airplane was still in the factory.",

People try to work too fast. I mean, I can't speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot,\" end quote. That's from one of the workers on the Boeing 730.

You're working for your own reputation, your own license because you're licensed to do that work. And you're working for the FAA as a representative of the regulatory environment. So you have to look beyond what you're doing right there and make decisions about what you do as a person, based not only on what Boeing is telling you to do, but also on what your reputation is and what you're going to do in the future.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So here's what we know right now. The Justice Department has charged a 46-year- old Pakistani man with ties to Iran for allegedly plotting to carry out a political assassination or political assassinations, plural, inside the United States.Now, according to the Justice Department, Asif Merchant, this Pakistani man, traveled to New York City where he met with purported hitmen to discuss carrying out assassinations of American political officials, potentially in late August or early September. Unfortunately, for Merchant, the purported hitmen that he we're meeting with was, in fact, undercover law enforcement officials and he was arrested trying to leave the United States. And he is now currently in U.S. custody and has been -- has been charged. Now important to understand here is that the charging documents do not actually name former President Donald Trump. But we do know from a U.S. official briefed on the matter, who spoke to CNN, that FBI investigators do believe that former President Trump and some current and former senior U.S. officials we're potentially among the targets that Merchant was interested in hiring a hitman to -- to potentially take out. Now, the FBI was investigating this plot in the weeks leading up to the near assassination of the former president by 20-year-old man at one of his -- at one of his rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI has since investigated to see whether or not there are any links in between this alleged Iranian plot and the effort by Thomas Matthew Crooks to take a shot at the former president. They -- according to a law enforcement source who spoke to CNN, they have not actually found any ties in-between those two episodes. The timing is believed to be a coincidence. But because the FBI was investigating this Iranian plot, this alleged Iranian plot, they did warn the Secret Service that there's some threats against the former president. You should maybe up your protection of him. And so it really underscores, I think, some of these questions that we're hearing from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill about the level of protection that the Secret Service was offering the former president on that day.",
