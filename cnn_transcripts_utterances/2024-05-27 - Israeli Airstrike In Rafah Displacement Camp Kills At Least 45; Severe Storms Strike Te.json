We are following major news from Gaza where local officials say Israel has struck a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people in Rafah. The video emerging is graphic. The Israeli military claiming, two senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike. Some 120 million people in the U.S. are facing a severe weather threat on the Memorial Day holiday. That's after, at least, 19 people were killed in bad weather across four states over the weekend. And in Papua New Guinea, as many as 2,000 people have been buried alive in a massive landslide that hits a remote region of the country on Friday. No one and no place is safe in Gaza. Those are the words coming from the U.N. Refugee Agency after a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was hit by an Israeli airstrike overnight.

The Israeli military's top lawyer, the advocate general, Yifat Tomer- Yerushalmi, announcing that she has directed an investigation of the strike. In a statement, the Israeli military said that it had assessed that there would be \"no expected\" harm to uninvolved civilians, but clearly, that was not the case, and that this incident will be investigated by the general staff's fact finding and assessment mechanism.

A deadly Russian attack on Eastern Ukraine was caught on security camera. You are looking at terrifying images of the moment of the strike on a hardware store in Kharkiv. At least, 17 people were killed in the attack on Saturday. Officials say, nearly 200 people were inside the building when it was hit. This, while heavy bombardment killed nine people across three regions in Ukraine on Sunday, and wounded another 15. The strikes come as French President Emmanuel Macron makes a state visit to Berlin. It marks an opportunity to show unity between France and Germany, Europe's two major economic powers, at a time when the continent faces challenges from the war in Ukraine and the possible re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. Meantime, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a weapons' deal for Ukraine worth $1 billion. It includes tanks and military equipment to reinforce air defense systems. President Zelenskyy arrived in Madrid earlier to meet with Prime Minister Sanchez, after previously canceling all upcoming international visits. I want to bring in CNN senior international correspondent Melissa Bell, who is in Paris for us. An important new deal that Zelenskyy has signed for more aide -- $1 billion.

Remember that the background to these both President Macron speech today in Dresden and President Zelenskyy's meeting with the Spanish prime minister is this renewed debate launched by Jens Stoltenberg on Friday about what he believes is the need now to give Kyiv the green light to use Western gifted weaponry on Russian soil. This, of course, already, leading to divisions inside Europe. And I think that is an important background to remember, even as we watch those images of President Macron. It's the first state visit to Germany by a French president in 24 years, and comes as you said, Eleni, at the time, not just when we prepare to mark in a week's time, the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but also that renewed pressure on the Eastern Front of the European Union and NATO. And that has been felt so keenly, of course, along Ukraine's front lives, and in her Kharkiv, even at a time when those divisions threatened that unity, we've been hearing from President Macron, a repetition of something he had said early last month that Europe, it should be remembered is mortal. And its future very much depends mainly on the decisions that are being made here now, and the need for Europe to remain united. Remember also, Eleni that in just a couple of weeks, European elections will be held where the far-right is threatening to do remarkably well in the polls, not least here in France, where the polls suggest the far right will come top, and President Macron's party may even come in and embarrassing third.

And I think that we have to be very clear, these actions that Israel has taken since the ICJ ruling last week, I think there are several dozen obstruct -- several government strikes that have taken place. So, Israel is completely ignoring the ICJ ruling or interpreting it in a way that does without any of its meaning, and unfortunately, visiting a huge amount of suffering on the people of Gaza.

And now this Qatar Airways story and here's, you know, and you hear of the stories of people flying within the plane and that the massive injuries, is this going to be more of a reality? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: I'm afraid that is the case, Eleni, the scientists will tell us that as the climate warms, it warms the planet in an uneven manner both by latitude and altitude. And as a result, the jet streams come in conflict with each other become stronger as well. And as aircraft are flying through the air, you have to think of it as flying through kind of a layer cake, through rivers of air which are going in various directions at very high speed. And they're very narrow. But if you hit the wrong one at the wrong time, and have a sudden change or a drop in lift on the aircraft, you're going to get that sudden departure. I will say this, listening to that passenger say she had her seatbelt on because of what happened with the previous incident, that does make heartened me a little bit that people are paying attention and understand that while you're in your seat, why not keep that seat belt at least loosely buckle because it's very likely you'll prevent injury when these unexpected things happen.",

I wonder what the correlation is here. Because when you hit turbulence of that nature, will the seatbelt fully protect you? O'BRIEN: Pretty much yes, I mean, we could I don't know the actual statistics, I will tell you this, that about 80 percent of the injuries associated with turbulence are for the flight crew. I guess that stands to reason. These are the flight attendants who are up and about serving meals. And it's a pretty hazardous job, obviously when you hit this so called clear air turbulence. So, I would suggest you greatly increase your chances of not being injured. And I will tell you this, Eleni, I've got a little airplane model here, if you're a little bit of a white knuckle flyer, sit near the wings, because think about it, it's sort of like a seesaw as it goes through the air. And if you're at the nose or the tail, you're going to get a little more of a wild ride and if you still sit near the kind of the pivot point, it's going to be a little smoother for you. So, buckle in tight. Make sure you are sitting near the wing and realize this, the turbulence is not going to bring the aircraft down and that's not what we're talking about here.",

South Africans were without power for at least some portion of the day last year almost every day. It's known as load shedding.

And it's really the black majority who are at the sharp end of the situation, they account for 81 percent of the population. And just to give a sense, the chart up now, the typical white South African earns 4.5 times more than the typical Black South African. So, poverty and unemployment really concentrated among the black population. So, many reasons for voters to be angry when they vote on Wednesday, and the ANC may be on the receiving end of that wrath.",

We had that unemployment graph up. And it basically shows it starts spiking at a certain level, because it actually wasn't always like this reality that you're describing. There were parts in post-apartheid South Africa, where you actually saw, you know, economic growth really moving upwards. So, tell me about what went wrong here.",

And then, in 2009, the now former president, Jacob Zuma came into power and corruption just exploded, that's been well documented by an independent judicial commission of inquiry into what's known as state capture. And that has really this kind of corruption and a capture of state institutions has been core to the infrastructure collapse.

Just to be clear, it was no utopia under Mbeki, there were still huge challenges to deal with Iran in quality around fixing public services, particularly education, which is so crucial to this whole discussion about unemployment.
