We're actually right in front of the Shrine of Imam Reza, which is the - one of the holy - most holy place actually here in Iran, and also the place where the president who died in that helicopter crash will be laid to rest very soon.There's a big procession that's happening right now with the coffin of the president making its way to that shrine, to the Shrine of Imam Reza. And as you can see there, Kate, on those images, and we're seeing it in front of us actually right now as well, there are literally, we believe, hundreds of thousands of people here on the streets that are chanting, that are pledging their support for the deceased president. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is we are in Mashhad, here in the northeast of Iran, is that in many ways this is really the political and also the spiritual homeland of Ebrahim Raisi, the president, who was killed in that helicopter crash. In fact, his father-in-law is actually still the prayer leader at the shrine that you see right behind me. And in 2021, when he was elected, the first place that Ebrahim Raisi went to was this very shrine that you see behind me. I was actually on hand back then to give a political speech there. So, if you look at the support for Ebrahim Raisi, and also for his conservative policies that we've seen towards the U.S., of course some of that very aggressive policy towards Israel as well, a lot of that springs from here and a lot of the support springs from here. We were out in the crowd a little earlier today and we asked people how things are going to move forward in Iran now and they say they hope that those policies are going to be continued. So, this is really one of those places where Ebrahim Raisi really had that very large support really throughout his presidency and now we can see those crowds turn out as his body, as the coffin with his body is making its way to that Imam Reza Shrine, the after that helicopter crash that, of course, killed not only the president of Iran, but also several others as well, including the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who, of course, also was absolutely instrumental in a lot of those policies again that were also very aggressive towards the U.S. as well. So, a big moment right now for this country and really the culmination point of those processions that we've been seeing over the past couple of days as those caskets have been going around the country here in Iran now the then Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, will be laid to rest in that shrine that you see right behind me. The Iranians have already said they're going to have presidential elections here in this country on June 28th to then pick a new president moving forward, Kate.",

It's part of an ongoing outbreak of the virus in birds and cattle nationwide, though health officials say the risk is still low for the general public.CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is joining us with more. Sanjay, so how serious is this second case? And do we know how he got infected? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, overall, they still say that this is of low concern for the average population, average people in the population. But what we know is that this person basically had the same sorts of symptoms as we heard about with this most recent patient. So, mostly just eye symptoms, eye redness, eye swelling, conjunctivitis it's called. People know it as pink eye. We know he's a farm worker and was being monitored because of exposure to livestock. There are monitoring programs that are going on to basically try and catch this sort of case. So, basically had an eye swab, which subsequently came back as having, you know, part of the bird flu. There are still some more additional testing going on. But this person is recovered. What we haven't seen yet, most importantly, Amara, is, is any kind of evidence of human to human transmission.

If you are exposed to infected livestock, for ten days people are observed to see if they develop any symptoms. There have been some 300 farm workers that have been observed, 37 of them developed symptoms, got tested. And, as we know, two of those tests came back positive.What you're seeing on the screen there is something that is relatively new. Something that really came about during the Covid pandemic, wastewater surveillance. So, looking in wastewater and seeing basically, do we see any signals of this particular flu virus? And several areas around the country, you do see some signal. If they see signal, that can be an early warning. They then go test that further to see, is that, in fact, H5N1 or not. Those are the sort of monitoring programs that are going on now, which are much more sophisticated, for example, than even a decade ago. There's also a push, I would say, to start monitoring pigs as well. Amra, I think it's pigs more than any other animal that really are the precursor maybe to what we would see in humans because they share many of the same receptors as humans.
