Joining us now to discuss is U.S. permanent representative to NATO, Ambassador Julianne Smith. Ambassador, I appreciate your time this morning. Can I ask just a basic question upfront? Are there any NATO members who are currently delinquent in payments to the United States? AMB. JULIANNE SMITH, U.S. PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO NATO: Well, thank you. I think what we need to be clear about is no one is delinquent. This is not a country club. There are no dues here at NATO. Instead, what we have all committed to do is to invest in our own national defense. All allies 10 years ago said that they would take steps to move to the 2 percent target, to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. And over the last ten years, the large majority of allies inside the NATO alliance have moved out an inch closer to 2 percent. We're going to hear, later this week, the secretary general come out with a number that is considerably higher from where we've been. So, we've seen nine years of consecutive increases in the defense spending among our allies. And we're going to be celebrating that at the summit this summer in Washington.",

And we have seen a steady progression upward across the alliance.Still, though, I think currently 11 of the - the alliance's members have hit that 2 percent threshold, but it has been a steady increase. Are there signs that the others will get there soon? That they're moving forward beyond just inching up, to use your words.",

This year at the summit, we think we're going to be close to two-thirds of the alliance spending 2 percent of their GDP on defense. So, that is leaps and bounds from where we started. And thanks to the efforts of President Obama, President Trump, and now President Biden, we are now seeing allies step up and do more for their own defense. This is really producing real results here. We're able to take those resources and do more to enhance our deterrence and defense across the alliance. We're able to do more to protect ourselves from cyberattacks. We're able to do more to work with our allies to protect critical infrastructure and do more to build resilience. So, each and every day here in the alliance, we're working with our allies together to protect our shared security. This alliance serves U.S. interests, it protects Americans, and it serves the interests of our allies as well. So, we're happy to see the increases. We'll continue to push those that aren't quite there yet.",

I see Democrats and Republicans largely on The Hill coming together to support NATO. Each and every delegation that comes through here from Congress, whether they're from one side of the aisle or the other, always expresses strong bipartisan support in this alliance. Americans know that this is a good value for America and that it brings security to us and to our allies. So, I put my faith in the American people.
