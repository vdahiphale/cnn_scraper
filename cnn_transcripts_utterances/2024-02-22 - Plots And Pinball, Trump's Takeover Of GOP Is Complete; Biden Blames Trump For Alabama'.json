The former president speaking tonight in Nashville as conservatives gather at CPAC where the deep state and Let's Go Brandon have taken on starring roles. Now, that event comes with souvenirs. As usual, there are bedazzled purses in the shape of a gun. There's a woke tears display made from, quote, melted snowflakes. There's even a January 6th pinball machine. Some of the game's features and modes include Stop the Steal, which is a debunked conspiracy that's resulted in arrests, indictments and defamation payouts. It's a setup that refers to another baseless conspiracy, Babbitt murder, referring to the death of one of the rioters who tried to breach the capital, fake news, predictable, of course, peaceful protests, which, of course, it was not, political prisoners, which they are not. And just to underscore that point, more than 1,300 people have been charged in nearly all 50 states, nearly 500 of them charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers, and more than 750 have pleaded guilty. Also on that pinball display, at least four don't tread on me symbols, at least three MAGA hats. And one of the objectives of this game, apparently, is to get the pinball to expose voter fraud via voting machines, mail-in ballots, or drop boxes, none of which occur on a widespread or election-changing scale. Also highlighted are logos of hated media networks. Surprisingly, it includes Fox, which found out the hard way and expensive way that promoting conspiracy theories has consequences. And, of course, one of the faces of the insurrection, the QAnon Shaman, a reminder he is now running for office after serving time behind bars. But the most glaring image is the one at the top of the machine itself. It's Donald Trump, who seems to be the pinball wizard, the machine's creator featuring a man who actually denies his role in the insurrection, and a man who is facing charges in part for his actions on that day. Now, the prop is just a small sign that the Republican Party is all about Trump right now. And even they don't question his centrality to what happened on January 6th. But listen to these bigger examples from just the last 24 hours. There's Governor Sununu, who has spent weeks trying to ensure that Trump is not the nominee. He says that he'll still vote for him.
