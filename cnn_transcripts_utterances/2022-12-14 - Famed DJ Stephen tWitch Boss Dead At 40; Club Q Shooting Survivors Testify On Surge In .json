He's now asking the Florida Supreme Court to greenlight an investigation into, in the way he put it is any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to COVID-19 vaccines.

It has been politicized and it has been politicized in a way that has actually caused lives.Because if people don't get vaccinated, which unequivocally is life- saving because of political ideology or because of misinformation and disinformation, that causes lives. And we've just got to get the American public regardless of whether you lean left you lean right, it doesn't matter at all, we're all in this together, we're all human beings, and we're all susceptible to disease that can kill us. So, if ever there was a time in society when we need to pull together and recognize that the common enemy is the virus, not each other, we've got to get people to appreciate that. You know, like I said, I don't have an easy answer to how we're going to do that.

We heard from experts who testified to that who talked about ways to reduce hate crimes with Republicans pushing back on the idea that their policies were in any way responsible for some of these horrific shootings and instead blaming the overall rise in crime. But aside from the policy debate, we heard about the real-life impacts. We heard from some of the survivors from that Club Q shooting where a gunman walked into a club that was a safe haven for the gay community and opened fire killing five people and injuring many others. One of those survivors, Michael Anderson, a bartender, talked about his horrific experience that night, and also advocated for a ban on assault weapons. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think just to put this on a rise of crime, takes away all of the attacks that have been coming at the LGBTQ community. Over 300 anti-LGBTQ bills proposed this past year, 150 attacks on drag events, and LGBTQ events this past year. And when you see what's happening with the political rhetoric that is then going on social media platforms, completely unchecked, it's turned into action, that boils over into our communities and ends up at the front door of places like Club Q. So, it's really -- it does a complete disservice to blame this or point this just on a rise in crime. This is targeted against our entire community.
