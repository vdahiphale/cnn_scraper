We're awaiting an official update on the shooting that killed three children and three adults.Also tonight, a key player in the Stormy Daniels hush money saga meets with the New York grand jury. What did former \"National Inquirer\" publisher David Pecker say as a potential indictment of Donald Trump looms. And after mass protests, a crippling nationwide strike and warnings of civil war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delays the judicial overall plan that's dividing his country. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get right to the Nashville school shooting and what we know about the woman who pulled the trigger that, according to police. CNN national correspondent Dianne Gallagher is working the story for us. She's on the scene. Diane as we await an update momentarily from police, what do we know at this hour?",

I want to read their names to you, Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, William Kinney, all of them just nine years old. Cynthia Peak 61, Katherine Koonce, age 60 and Mike Hill age 61.According to police, all six of them were killed by a 28-year-old woman who they say may have been a former student. They say they received calls at 10:13 a.m. about the shooting. And according to police, that woman was armed with at least two assault rifles as well as a handgun. They say that she entered through a side door they believe and got to the upper level of the school, which is inside Covenant Presbyterian Church there in Nashville. About 200 kids attend this school. It is preschool through sixth grade that they serve. According to police. The shooting happened in what they described as a lobby area. Now, they're still trying to determine exactly what happened here and, of course, why that 28-year-old woman targeted this school. They do believe that she may have been a former student. They say there is video at the school and that they are going over that. The police chief also said that the doors were locked, so they're trying to determine how she was able to force her way into that school. Now, again, some of the video we're seeing is unfortunately very familiar to us. Tragically very familiar to us, of small children holding each other's hands being guided out of the school to safety. The police noted -- saying that they, unfortunately, have experience with mass shootings in Nashville and we're able to use that to quickly respond, saying that the shooter was taken -- was killed by two officers on that upper level at around 10:27 a.m. so we're talking less than 15 minutes after they received the initial call about this shooting. They continue to investigate. We were told, Wolf, the daughter of a teacher in that school, said that she got a text from her mother who was inside at that time that her mother was locked inside her classroom with her students that she just wanted to tell her family that she loved them that she could hear shooting all over the place, according to the daughter, and that she thought someone had tried to get in her classroom. Again, Wolf, they're still trying to put all of this together. But in what is the 129th mass shooting in this country just this year, they are still trying to determine why someone would have targeted this school and again, exactly what happened.",

Our experts on law enforcement and gun violence are with us. Chief Ramsey, let me start with you.

Only four shooters since 1966 have been female in those circumstances. This is an incredibly rare situation to have someone like this target the school. Now, we're hearing she has a connection to the school. That's more common to hear in these sorts of situations.But the fact that she -- that this was a woman is something that will probably be an important part of how police follow this investigation and determine why someone would carry out an attack like this, which is -- it's probably not going to get any sort of satisfactory answer, but I think that's where they'll start.",

Why she didn't break into a classroom, perhaps she didn't have time to do that. But she came there with a clear intent to kill. And again, it would have been a lot worse had she been given more time. So, all that's going to be part of the investigation.Right now, I'm sure they're executing search warrants. They are going through social media. They're interviewing people who knew her. They're doing all the things that you would normally do in an investigation to try to get, you know to a motive or an understanding as to why. But this would have been a lot worse. Fortunately, the police response was swift. They were able to neutralize her very, very quickly, which is what you're trained to do. And as a result, I think they did save lives.

But one of the things that one, there was a vehicle there apparently that they're searching. There may have been something in the vehicle. Her residence, they'll search that. But more importantly, they'll go on social media because usually that's where in today's world, that's where you tend to find information that would indicate the why. If she was, in fact a former student, does she have some kind of grudge? Some kind of beef with someone who works there. I mean, she's 28-years-old, so, she would have attended 15, 20 years ago. So, I doubt if that's a connection, but maybe somebody who works there, something that drove her there in order to be able to commit a crime or the crime that she committed. Were these folks targeted? You know, when you look at the video, they'll be looking to say, one, how she made entry because the door was supposedly locked. But then did she go directly to a particular place? In other words, it looked like she was on a mission. She knew exactly where she's going. Did she pass anybody up that she did not injure? I mean, we don't know the answer to any of that. But that's all part of the investigation.",

They don't have a motive yet, but apparently, they're on track to find one through some of the writings that they found as they've gone through the home or the vehicle that she was driving at the time.

We're talking about babies here, children, according to the police.And I do want to read those victims' names one more time, if we can. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, William Kinney, these are small children. According to the police, two nine year olds and one eight year old who was about to turn nine years old. They said Cynthia Peak, a 61 year old substitute teacher, was also killed. Mike Hill, a 61 year old custodian, was killed. And then Catherine Koonce, who was also age 60, the police did not give what her profession was. But Wolf, this is a small school, we're talking about roughly 200 students, between 40 and 50 staff members in total. And so this is a very tiny, little close knit school. Now, look police said they do believe that the shooter at some point was a student here, although they are not sure at what grade level, when they actually attended this school. The school is located within a church. It is a small, private Christian school. Police have noted that there was no school resource officer here saying this is a small, private Christian school inside of a church. But we heard the chief mention that the shooter had basically had these writings that they have looked into and they said that there was at least one point where they thought the shooter was going to target another location, but did some investigating on that location, looked at it and determined there was too much security there and opted not to. Now, again, they talked about maps, they talked about surveillance that was done on by the shooter. So this is something that, as Chief Ramsey said, seemingly was quite planned out. Police hinting at the fact and teasing almost at the fact that they have theories as to what may have motivated this shooter. Saying as well, they've spoken with the shooter's father, they've been out to a home associated with the shooter, but says that they will not be able to divulge any of that until later on, Wolf.",

If anyone has a doubt whether or not that saves lives. Again, we talked about it earlier, think about Uvalde where officers did not take immediate action and literally were standing in a hallway as children were being slaughtered in that particular school.So that's why the training is what it is. You don't wait, you go in. We learned that lesson from Columbine years ago. You don't wait for SWAT. You know, you go in and you take out the person who's responsible. You go toward the gunfire and you deal with it. I know it's risky, but that's what you're getting paid to do. That's what policing is all about.",

Well, look at some of the mass shootings that we've had. These are people who legally purchase guns that don't have a criminal history. And so to try to paint a picture, this is just about criminals. It's not just about criminals. It's about mental health. It's about access to firearms.
