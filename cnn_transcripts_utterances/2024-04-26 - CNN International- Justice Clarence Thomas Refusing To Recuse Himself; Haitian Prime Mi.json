Release the kraken and save us from the left, taking America down.\" Mark Paoletta, an attorney who represented Ginni Thomas, wrote in a recent op-ed that her activities at the time were \"minimal and mainstream.\" Still, ethics watchdog say Clarence Thomas should at least explain why he's still taking part in a case involving Trump's actions surrounding the insurrection, while his wife was associated with the insurrection.

Kyiv has said that it needs at least an additional seven. But as part of that discussion, but also the latest tranches of aid, you're likely to see the focus not just on air defense that Ukraine says is so critical to its ongoing defense, and indeed, its hope of turning back the momentum of the war of the last few weeks. But also, long range missiles and of course, artillery. Just on long range missiles, first, Max, what we've heard from the United States over the last couple of days is that in fact, the delivery of the longer range attack and missiles that are launched from the HIMARS have already been making their way to Ukraine as part of a deal that was signed in March. And that (INAUDIBLE) what we hear from Kyiv, is that some of those have already been used in an attack on Russian forces in Crimea. And then of course, the ammunition. This critically is what the European Union and the United States needs to get to those Ukrainian front lines if Kyiv has any hope of changing their fortunes there, Max.",

This happened in Niger states, in north central Nigeria in a town called Suleja and we hear that this is a medium correctional facility. So, but we don't know much about the makeup of the inmates that have been held in this facility, but we do know it's a medium correctional facility. And the Nigerian authorities say that 108 of them are underground. They've recaptured 10. And they've asked the public to be on the lookout and they assured the public that they are on top of this situation. But residents have been describing how they heard gun battles between the authorities as they chase inmates. Now, this prison is in a residential area and residents have been speaking out, saying, that they're frightened for their lives. They don't know where these inmates have gone, they could well be in their communities. And they've asked the government to move these facilities from the area. And the correctional facilities saying that this is an old colonial era style building, and many of them -- there are many of them around the country. Prisons are often dilapidated and overcrowded. Nigerian's interior minister Tunji-Ojo has been speaking out, saying that he's looking to overhaul the prison facilities in the country. This one in particular is meant to have 250 inmates but was holding 499 people. So, you could just imagine the scenes of chaos inside there. And when the perimeter fences collapsed during the downpour and you could just imagine the scenes of chaos. And residents really putting pressure on the government to say, we don't feel safe, that we need action now to move this correctional facilities away from residential areas, Max.
