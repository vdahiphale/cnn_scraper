There are many moving parts of the story. Tonight, there is the logistics, the mechanics in moving someone under Secret Service protection into a Lower Manhattan Courthouse and through the process that criminal defendant's experience on arrival. There is the security preparations well underway there. There is a possible legal maneuvering and motions before and after the arraignment on both sides. And of course, there is how this shapes the future politically, not just in the middle of a presidential campaign, but also three other active criminal investigations of the former President. We have new details on much of it. Also, a conversation tonight with Ronan Farrow, who has done so much reporting on Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal, and how those aligned with the former President bought their silence. We've got reporters tonight on every aspect of the story. CNN's Jessica Schneider on the criminal justice process, Shimon Prokupecz on the logistics and security, and Randi Kaye on the machinery moving a former President. We're going to start with Jessica Schneider. What do we know about Tuesday's arraignment? What's going to happen?",

We know that former President Trump, he will arrive in New York Monday, that will be from Mar-a-Lago where he'll spend the weekend.And then on Tuesday, that's when he'll go to the Courthouse. He will be booked, that will include fingerprints, possibly a mug shot. We know actually that he will not be handcuffed. Then at that point, the former President will make his way into a Courtroom in Lower Manhattan. It's all set to happen around 2:00 PM on Tuesday. What's interesting here is that the media will actually be permitted to document Donald Trump's walk in to the Courtroom to face of course, what our team has learned will be more than 30 counts related to business fraud. That's because cameras will be lining that hallway outside the Courtroom, and then there's a matter of cameras in the Court. So the Judge in this case is still deciding whether to allow them. I will warn you though this is a Judge, Judge Juan Merchan, he has previously denied media requests in the Trump Organization trial last year, for example, he wouldn't allow cameras, so it is quite possible, Anderson will have cameras in the hallways, but not actually in the Courtroom.",

Trump.\" That's a little bit of a glimpse of how the indictment will be laid out. Or John Miller, of course, reporting specifically that there are more than 30 counts, all of them, likely relating to how that repayment to Michael Cohen, after he paid off Stormy Daniels was actually accounted for, and all the charges that may stem from that.

These barriers all across here, and all across the street here, Anderson, but what everyone right now is anticipating is whether or not the former President here will come through those doors. Ironically, Anderson, interestingly enough, these are the same doors that Steve Bannon, when he was under arrest and had to surrender, those are the doors he walked by, and of course, Allen Weisselberg, who was the former CFO of the Trump Organization.

We've seen the NYPD. They are out here as well, already anticipating providing security, really just wanting to take every precaution possible to make sure nothing is left here, in a sense of there is always this concern, as we saw post January 6, pipe bombs, things that people left behind. This is something that they're concerned about. So we're seeing already the NYPD out here. There are some cameras that the NYPD has been out here so they can monitor who walks into the Courtroom, but certainly, there will be more security as we approach Tuesday. Also the courthouse now under 24-hour surveillance. The 15th floor where the former President is expected to appear, that is shut off to the public.

If he doesn't walk through those doors, then it gives the impression certainly that he is getting special treatment. Of course, the Secret Service is concerned about his safety in getting him in.

There is one other way in there, Anderson, that's around the corner that he could possibly go in, but we would be able to see him there as well, and there may be one other way where he'd have to go through, but that's through the jail that's attached to the Courthouse, so we'll see what happens here on Tuesday -- Anderson.",

That is of course where the Trump plane is waiting on the tarmac for Donald Trump, and he will take the route very likely, the main thoroughfare would be Southern Boulevard and that is often lined with supporters when there is a big event for the former President.

I don't think they have much, if any chance at that. They also may argue statute of limitations. Normally five years. This conduct goes back more than that. But the problem for Trump's team here is there are laws saying that the statute of limitations is tolled, meaning put on pause during COVID, and while somebody is living out of the State, so I don't think they're going to win on that.

Now, we've also learned in recent days, that not only did David Pecker, the head of AMI testified twice before this grand jury, but jurors heard detailed evidence about the Karen McDougal situation, about that transaction. That's really significant, Anderson, because it means they are not just looking at one relatively small hush payment. They're bringing in evidence of a pattern of payments.

He'll bring us the latest on the damage and the injuries. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:51:59] COOPER: We touched on the destructive weather hitting Arkansas with former Governor Asa Hutchinson. Extensive damage now in the small city of Wynne. In the words of the mayor, the town has been, quote, basically cut in half by a tornado. Some of the early video of the devastation, which you see is considerable, shows the storm's path through one neighborhood. Heavy destruction as well to the local high school, we're told. You can see the entryway torn to pieces, large sections of roofing torn away. Similar damage being reported across the state. We have a video as well of what it looked like as the storm came through another part of town. And as you can see, the sheer size of it is punishing. The storm then crossed over into Tennessee, where a tornado emergency was declared north of Memphis. That's on top of a tornado that struck metro Little Rock, Arkansas, today, sending two dozen people to the hospital. CNN's Derek Van Dam is in the storm zone. He joins us now. So, what are you seeing around you?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, it's a very fluid situation. We are in Parkin, Arkansas, which is about 5 miles outside of Wynne, where the destruction you saw the high school on your screen splashing by just a few moments ago. We have seen police vehicles, first responders racing down the roadways.We stopped to come to tell you the story about what we've witnessed and just checking the trajectory of this tornado that moved through the area. This is the damage from the same tornado that moved through wind. So what you're looking at behind me was previously a church, obviously, unfortunately now in complete shambles. This is a rice and soybean farm and there have been multiple buildings that have been destroyed. I believe this is kind of the outer edges of this tornado damage. You can see all the debris on the ground here. We have to be careful of nails from the debris. And one thing's for sure, this storm is still taking advantage of this very volatile environment that happens to be in and around central Tennessee. So these storms continue to race across the Deep South. They still pose a threat. And it's not just here. This is a major, significant, widespread tornado outbreak that is unfolding across the nation's midsection all the way into northern sections of Illinois right now. Multiple warned tornado storms approaching that particular region. But when we show you just the devastation here, this, you know, from a trained meteorologist professional opinion has to be winds in excess of 100, 110 miles per hour. You're looking at minimum EF-2 damage. Of course, crews have to come out and confirm that, but we know about the injuries that have already been caused by the tornadoes in Little Rock. These again continue to press eastward across central Tennessee where we are and that's -- where we were earlier today, and obviously leaving the destruction that you see behind me. It is going to be a difficult night for people as they try to search for people who are perhaps trapped.",

So not as significant and as widespread as what we experienced today. But that storm system needs to be monitored across the northeastern sections of the U.S. for severe weather once again.And we need to take shelter as well, Anderson, because we've seen lightning flashing around us just prior to this live shot. There's another thunderstorm moving into this area, and frankly, it's probably best that we get indoors.",
