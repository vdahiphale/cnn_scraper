      "sentences": "Welcome back to our special coverage of former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.And right now, former Trump confidant, one of his closest aides and advisors, Hope Hicks, is back on the stand. And she's being asked specifically about Trump's campaign's reaction to the bombshell story published on November 4, 2016, just four days before the election. That story revealed the hush money payment made to playmate, Karen McDougal, by the \"National Enquirer.\" Hicks has been asked about the official response she gave to the paper at the time, which was, quote, \"We have no knowledge of any of this.\" She then went on to say that it was, quote, \"Totally untrue.\" You can see it right there. They've since moved on to more about the Stormy Daniels and the response to the Stormy Daniel stories as well. Let's bring in CNN correspondents, Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes. Paula, I want start with you because as this is continuing to roll out, we're seeing more updates on the left side of your screen. The jury has seen texts that Michael Cohen sent to Hope Hicks, the back- and-forth. Hicks, when it comes to Stormy Daniels, just few moments ago, saying she was explicitly told to deny that story and what it entailed. What are you seeing right now as the prosecution continues its questions?",

      "sentences": "So our colleagues in the courtroom are reporting that Hicks seems quite nervous, which she has been throughout her testimony, but especially here.She's sort of giggling through some of her answers, smiling nervously, wringing her hands. And part of the reason is because she knows that prosecutors are now going to walk her through a series of public statements she gave that we now know were false. Now, one text message between her and Michael Cohen reads, \"Call me,\" at 7:08 p.m. \"Any news,\" 8:50. \"Any news\" at 9:02. So this is going to be actually something to really watch, the communication between her and Michael Cohen as it pertains to this \"Wall Street Journal\" story about Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. I mean, this could potentially -- depending on what these text messages say, this could be helpful for the prosecution, but we'll wait until more comes in.",

Hicks sent the story to -- a link to the story to Cohen when it published. Cohen responding, \"Poorly written and I dot\" -- I think he meant don't there -- \"she is getting much play.\" Hicks, apparently, according to reporters in the room, laughing when she was reading the typo there. Now, Hicks saying, quote, \"I agree with most of that, and it will get play because the media is the worst. But we should just ignore and blow past it.\"",

But there is a heightened concern, a heightened vigilance within the campaign at this time, concern about any more damaging stories related to really any sort of illicit sexual behavior. That's why I think these text messages are significant. It shows that Cohen, and Hicks as well as the campaign press secretary, are watching this very closely to see how the story plays out.",

And also an update that -- from Hope Hick's testimony that Trump did not want the newspaper delivered to his house. He didn't want his wife, Melania Trump, to see this in the paper.

But it seems like Hope Hicks is also confirming that he also, we all were concerned with the campaign as well. And when you have a mixed motive situation like this, you would rather have it be clean, from the prosecutor's point of view. But the prosecutors can still make their case if they can show that a substantial motive, even if it's one of several motors, a substantial motive was the campaign, that's still good enough for prosecutors.",

She -- her office, as she's explaining, when she joined was in the outer Oval, which she says was right outside of the Oval. She was very much truly the gatekeeper.

The \"Wall Street Journal\" breaking this story. Eventually, more than a year later, they'll break the Stormy Daniels payoff as well. But all of this is -- all of this is happening. Obviously, they're not in the White House. They're on the campaign. But all of this is happening and there must just be chaos inside of the campaign as they're figuring out how to deal with this. AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: I'm also struck by what a time capsule this case is. I mean, there's so many aspects of it that feel like can't be replicated anymore. Just the fact that we're talking about the tape, right? We've just seen the advent of A.I. in the last year go mainstream. I don't know who is going to believe tapes anymore. And I know politicians of all kinds will be able to deny things that they say can be manipulated. The sex scandal, even for a politician, were in the end of shame. Nobody is going to say, I have a sex scandal, and therefore, I need to not do this job anymore. That's not been the take -- the takeaway from the last couple of months. So there's something about this case that feels -- it's historic for many reasons. But at this point, it also has a kind of like ancient element to it.",

And the prosecution's well aware that they're going to have to eat many bad facts, many previous lies, misstatements, inconsistent statements and all. And the question is whether they can overcome all of that. Also, the question is, to my mind at least, whether the defense is going to call witnesses like Bob Costello. You know, the judge found that they cannot put on evidence that the Federal Election Commission or the Southern District reviewed all of this and passed on it. But they could put on evidence from Bob Costello, who is Michael Cohen's lawyer, who told the defense and the grand jury in this case that -- that Michael Cohen told a completely different story. And that he told Cohen he had every incentive to bury Donald -- Donald Trump. Now is the time to do it. And Cohen said, no, there is nothing against Trump. Costello would be a compelling witness, as a former chief deputy of the Criminal Division in the Southern District of New York. And Cohen waived privilege with him.",
