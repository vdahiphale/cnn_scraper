But will Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss see any of that money? The attorney for the two women is OUTFRONT. Also breaking, Israel killing three of its own hostages, men that the IDF believes that actually managed to escape Hamas. And we'll talk to the father of an American hostage about whether he thinks his son may also be trying to escape. And the Democratic governor of Arizona calling up the National Guard for help at the border. We are live in Arizona tonight to show you the migrant surge they are seeing there. Let's go OUTFRONT.

That is what Rudy Giuliani has been ordered to pay Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss after accusing them of rigging the 2020 election. This was a jury verdict, jury of the peers. It is a jaw-dropping number. It is the actual verdict form that breaks down into numbers. Let me show. Ruby Freeman awarded $16.1 million for defamation, $20 million for emotional distress. Shaye Moss awarded $17 million and $20 million for emotional distress. And then the two women were also awarded $75 million in punitive damages. So, when you add that all together, that's where you get the $148 million number. That's the price that Rudy Giuliani now from a group of his peers, the jurors, will pay for his loyalty to Donald Trump. Now, Remember, Giuliani, of course, was at the forefront of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And he took no prisoners. He went after people pejoratively, personally, Freedom and Moss, accusing them of stealing the election from his client. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Presumably, Rudy was in the room when all of these conversations happened and perhaps thought it was being covered by attorney-client privilege.

This is according to the Los Angeles County medical examiner tonight. Other contributing factors, drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of an opioid.The report also revealing a live-in assistant found Perry's unresponsive in his Malibu home pool. Perry was only 54 years old. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is OUTFRONT with me now. So, okay, Sanjay, as we are learning more details here, at the time of his death in October, it was determined there were no drugs at Matthew Perry's house, yet he died of a ketamine overdose. So, can you tell us more about this drug and the effects of this drug that could have led to his either death and then, you know, drowning effects or his drowning. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, so there were -- it was a long report, Erin. It was about 30 pages. As you point out, acute ketamine intoxication was listed as the primary cause. And what they mean by that is that Ketamine that he had taken recently. They found remnants of this trace amounts in his stomach. So, it sounds like something that he swallowed. You can take ketamine in different ways. It can be injected, snorted, it can be swallowed. If it's swallowed, it takes usually about a half an hour or so for it to take effect. So reading through this report sounds like what happened is that he took some ketamine, he went into the pool, the ketamine is a dissociative. It disassociates someone from their environment. It can sometimes be used even under anesthesia. And to give you some context, when they measured the levels, they were quite high, in the 3,000 sort of range. Anesthesia levels can be 1,000 to 6,000. It was a fair amount of ketamine that he took. But it sounds like he became disassociated as a result of that, and because he was in a pool, he sort of probably kind of loss consciousness and fell into the floor or kind of put his face in the pool and that's what led to his death. It was not likely the ketamine itself that led to his death, but it made it more likely that he drowned.",

And to give you some context, typically the half life of ketamine is a few hours. Not a few days.So it sounds like in addition to that infusion therapy, he was taking ketamine recreationally, took it into his stomach. The other drug you mentioned, that that's a synthetic opioid that can sometimes damping the hallucinogenic effects of ketamine. But we don't know what -- why he was taking it, why he was taking them in conjunction. We just know sort of what sadly ended up happening.",
