I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York.U.S. airports are scrambling to get back on schedule this afternoon after another early morning glitch throws the nation's air travel into chaos. A key safety system for the FAA went down, forcing a nationwide ground stop on all departing domestic flights. Thousands have been delayed or canceled, and that's left travelers stranded in airports or trapped on board park airliners. The ground stop has now lifted, but the backlog, as you can imagine, of flights is still jamming airports across the country. CNN correspondents and analysts have been following all of these developments. Let's begin with Adrienne Broaddus at Chicago's O'Hare, one of the busiest airports in the country. So, Adrienne, are things getting back to normal there this morning?",

If they stop right here at the information board, they will see boarding. That's a nice sign for folks leaving the airport. But there are also other indications that there have been technology issues. Here in Chicago, there are about 500 delayed flights and cancellations standing at 109. That is according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. And this is a reflection of the big picture. If you take a look at what airports are experiencing across the country, according to FlightAware, there have been more than 7,300 delays and about 1,100 cancellations. We spoke with a father and daughter earlier this morning. They told us their flight from Nashville to Chicago was delayed by two-and-a-half- hours. They're traveling to Brussels. But he said, intentionally, he booked a 10-hour layover in case something were to happen. And this is based on things that we have seen happening with air travel, he says, in the past. But things are returning to normal here in Chicago. Travelers need to pack a little patience -- Bianna.",

And if all you have is assistant or temporary administrators in there, like Administrator Nolen right now is temporary, they don't have the ownership. They don't have the way to see this all the way through.

They have to take all of it out. And the neighbor here even has a sign that says, \"Welcome. Flooded.\" So, a little bit of humor in all of this. But it is very difficult for people who are having to deal with this. Look, they all put sandbags out, and so many of them telling me these sandbags did nothing because there was so much water. And, normally, in this neighborhood, when it floods, the water recedes very quickly. That's not the case this time around. That's why you're having to deal with all of the water in this neighborhood. In other neighborhoods, it is dealing with the mud and the debris, trying to get all of that out of the homes. And, look, they're trying to dry it out, but it is raining. Again, you see all of the sandbags trying to stop that water. But it is still so deep. We know authorities are telling people to continue to be extremely careful with all of this, because it could lead to a very dangerous situation. In San Luis Obispo, we know there's a 5-year-old who was swept away by the waters. He was identified as Kyle Doan. But he is still missing. Authorities are still searching.

That is something that he has not made -- not said one way or the other whether he will allow that to happen. Now, I am told that Santos actually made a request to serve on the House Financial Services Committee. It's one of the key committees in Congress. That will not happen, despite Santos' request.

I will not resign.\" And, Bianna, the real challenge for House Republican leaders is that, if he were to resign, that would set up a special election in a district that leans Democratic.

I think, when you talk to White House officials, Bianna, they look at this timeline right now. And I think they are cognizant of the fact people want answers, answers as to why it took two months for this information to come out, how the documents actually got there in the first place. But they also acknowledge that there is currently review under way by the U.S. attorney in Chicago. That U.S. attorney has been giving information to the attorney general. And there's a very real possibility hanging out there that the attorney general could decide to appoint a special counsel. That is something White House officials do not want, do not believe is merited, when you talk to them, based on what they know up to this point. That's in part why they have been so quiet about additional details. The president and his team have both pledged there will be more details once that review is complete and we hear from the attorney general. When exactly that will be, though, is still an open question. I will note the first White House press briefing since this news broke with Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, is in about 30 minutes.
