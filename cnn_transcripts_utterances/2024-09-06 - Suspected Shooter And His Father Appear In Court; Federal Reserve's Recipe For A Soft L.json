We know that a neighboring county, which this is a jurisdiction that is nearby here with alert to some online threats last year in 2023. It was May of last year. They went by the house. They had a conversation with the young man and his father. We actually have those recordings as well, but what we learned there is the father said yes, there are guns in the house, but he has no access to those guns. It is through our reporting that we figured out during the Christmas period last year, apparently the father went out and bought that AR platform weapon and that was given to him as a gift. This was only his second day of school according to the sheriff. The first day he went to school he had anxiety, went to a counselor. The next day he came to the school, this is according to the people here is when he went somewhere, assembled that weapon, came back and started firing. What's left here is just carnage and we know that when the arrest was made with that young man, it is especially after he was confronted by a deputy - - Richard.",

Across this state right now, both the GBI and FBI are getting calls that are flooding into schools all across the state that apparently are hoaxes and they're basically saying they plan to go after everyone who makes one of those fake 911 calls because people in this community and around this state are shaken by all the calls that are coming in.

It is not just enough for the father to being a bit weird about guns. They are going to have to prove that there was a causal link between what he did to face such serious charges. JOHNSON-NORRIS: You have to prove that and I don't think it is that easy. You know, we are dealing in this case with a kid who is 14-years-old. It is a little different than a 17-year-old in terms of that child's development, mental emotional development. Here we knew that this child had some -- had made some threats, though he denied it. His father said, I won't allow him access to guns, but strangely, then provided him a firearm after that. The question is, what this father, was he so negligent that he should be held responsible for the acts of this 14-year-old and don't get me wrong, what happened here is absolutely horrible. We just didn't see in the court of law one individual held responsible for the acts of another. So this parent-child relationship and how we view parents and what they are responsible in terms of what their kids do, that sort of the new question, the new frontier we are facing in the courts.",

JOHNSON-NORRIS: It is a great point because how the community feels when we are all outraged, saddened, and filled with emotion about what's happened here. But the law is supposed to be free from that emotion and look really at culpability and responsibility. And that is what lawyers do is we have to parse that out and ask courts to figure that out.

I assume it is because of thenumber of victims that you go by each number for the number of years for each victim and you multiply it out. What is the 14-year-old -- the 14-year-old is facing similarly, very large sentences if convicted. JOHNSON-NORRIS: He is looking at potentially a life sentence though his age would mitigate against that. But I will say, there is sort of incompatible theories of the case here that the prosecution has brought forward as it relates to this 14-year-old. You know, on one hand, they right away brought him to adult court, so he should be treated like an adult. On the other hand, they are saying his father should have recognized that as a child that he was responsible for his behavior. And so I don't know how the prosecution reconciles that, but it will be the job of the defense lawyers to come in and say those are untenable theories at the same time, you have to elect one and pick one, either treat him like a child or treat him like an adult.",
