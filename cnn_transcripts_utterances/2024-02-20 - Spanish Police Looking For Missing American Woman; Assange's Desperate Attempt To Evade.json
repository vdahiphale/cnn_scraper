She was last seen more than two weeks ago, and there's some strange details that are coming out.Around the time she went missing, a friend of hers said that they started receiving messages from her that read, I met someone wonderful. And also, right around her disappearance, someone spray painted the lenses of two security cameras at her apartment building. So, many questions as they urgently search for her. Al Goodman is tracking this from Madrid for us. He's joining me now. Al, what are you hearing from police about this?",

And then, as about the time that she went missing, as you just said, someone had spray painted the cameras at the entrance to that building where you could recognize to go in and also near the elevators, painted in black, that's according to building superintendent talking to CNN.Now, her brother told us -- CNN, that Ana Maria was supposed to take a trip to Barcelona on February 5th with a friend, but she never showed up at the Madrid train station. So, a missing person's report was filed later that day, and that gets to the details the police have been giving out about her. That she stands four feet, eight inches tall, that she's slim, that she requires medication and her face is on that poster and has now been on posters around town, Kate. The Swedish girlfriend that you're referring to, got the -- a friend of Ana's got this WhatsApp message talking about this encounter that she had the day before where she said she met someone wonderful. She was going to go to his country. Country home for -- near Madrid for the weekend and she would call when she got back. And she said this man had approached her the day before and it was an amazing connection. Now, Ana Maria's brother and that same Swedish friend both told CNN that they talked independently to Ana's husband. The couple, Ana Maria and her husband, have a computer services business in South Florida, according to the company's website. But they say that the husband told them that he is in Serbia. CNN has tried to contact the husband and police searched her apartment just down the street early last week. So, there are, right now, many more questions in this story than there are answers.

      "sentences": "All right. This just in, a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza has just failed to pass the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. was the only vote against the proposal. Instead, the U.S. has come up with its own resolution that would call for a temporary ceasefire. It would not be immediate, but would happen as soon as practicable.This as Israeli leaders warn they plan to expand their ground offensive into Rafah by Ramadan next month. That's if the hostages are not returned. It's something the U.N. warned could lead to a slaughter. And as CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, for Gaza's children, the situation is especially dire. And we do want to warn you, the images you're about to see are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One after another, after another, after another. The victims of the latest Israeli airstrike flood into this hospital in Central Gaza, they're mostly children. Some of them still clinging to life, others bloodied and limp. Without a pulse, the life gone from their eyes. Here, children comfort children, even as they are still trembling from the shock. MAYAS, INJURED IN AIRSTRIKE (through translator): I was on the rooftop and suddenly I heard an explosion. I flew away and fell down. My back hurts. I saw smoke and stones falling. Then I heard people screaming. DIAMOND (voice-over): A hospital spokesman said at least 18 people were killed and dozens of others injured Sunday in an Israeli airstrike on a home in Deir el Balah. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment about the strike. Witnesses say many of the victims had just arrived from Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city where fear and confusion have set in as Israel threatens a coming military offensive. But Central Gaza is no haven, a reality revealed in the cruelest of ways. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I can't speak. Innocent children were asleep (ph). They killed them all. They didn't leave a child alive. DIAMOND (voice-over): In the ruins of the Al Baraqa (ph) family home, the target of Sunday's airstrike, the desperate search for survivors is underway. As one-man dives into the rubble, another shouts, get out of there, you will die down there. IBRAHIM, NEIGHBOR (through translator): We could only pull two alive from under the rubble, and the rest are all missing. We don't see safety in a mosque, or in an UNRWA school, or in a hospital. The word safety is not something that exists anymore. They evacuated us from place to place, claiming it's safe. There is nowhere safe. DIAMOND (voice-over): Shouts praising God rise as a girl is pulled from the rubble. But her body is lifeless. Added to the list of more than 12,000 children killed in Gaza. Bystanders try and cover her body, but the man carrying her throws the blanket off. He wants the world to see what this war has wrought. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Santa Barbara airport, it reopened this morning after it was shut down yesterday because it flooded. We want to show you what happened in Northern California. You can see there, a part of a roadway collapsed into a creek, obviously because of these relentless downpours they have seen this month. CNN's Meteorologist Derek Van Dam, he's got much more on this. Derek, you have been tracking this. I mean, California really has not gotten a break to dry out. What are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "No, we're chasing, actually, the wettest February ever recorded in Los Angeles. I'll show you that in just one moment, but that's the concern about the state of California.What is normally very small creeks, tributaries can become raging torrents of water in a matter of minutes, especially when you get this type of water so quickly. Look at this vehicle, and all of the debris because of that raging river, which is normally just a creek, unfortunately, just too much rain too quickly. And talking about Los Angeles, we got another two inches to go before we approach and exceed the previous wettest February, which was set back in 1998. So, I think that really puts it into context of what we're dealing with here across the entire state of California, including the Central Valley under a slight risk. But let's focus in on what's happening across Southern California. That shading of red, Southwestern Bernardino County into Los Angeles County, this region under a moderate risk. It's a level 3 of 4 of excessive flooding that could lead to local urbanized flooding. Now that is because of this heavy batch of rain that's moving through on top of the very saturated environment. Remember, it was only, just under two weeks ago we had our previous atmospheric river event, so the ground is wet. Adding more rainfall could just add more misery to the situation, and that's what we're seeing here, unfortunately. So, there's the over 30 million Americans under these flood alerts from the Bay Area southward into Los Angeles. Some of the rainfall totals have exceeded a half a foot. Look at the Malibu Hills area, just a very populated part of Southern California, approaching five inches. Equally as impressive as some of these snowfall totals over a foot and a half. This is very heavy wet snow. A term you might not be familiar with, it's called West Coast Cement because there's so much moisture content to that snowfall. It sticks to the ground. It sticks to the electrical poles, the wires, the tree limbs. It can be very dangerous, not to mention the ongoing landslides and rockslides. We just saw, actually, a bit of a local storm report coming out of Pasadena in Los Angeles County, where a vehicle struck a rock from a landslide. So, with an additional one to three inches of rain locally, especially in those foothills across the mountainous regions just outside of L.A. could cause some more localized landslides and mudslides with this ongoing atmospheric river. So, when will it be done? Well, more rain through the day today, overnight as well, but we start to finally clear things out by late Wednesday and certainly into the day on Thursday. So, very active, Kate, to say the least.",
