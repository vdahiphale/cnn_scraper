It is coming no matter what. The problem is that China was able to build an advantage during the Trump administration because the last administration didn't take the steps that were needed in order to make sure that that EV revolution was American led. We're taking a different approach. We're recognizing that these technologies are coming, that there's no going back to the old technology, that you're not going to be the leading economy in the world depending on strategies from the '60s and '70s. Into the 2020s, '30s, '40s, '50s we've got to make sure that we build the advantage on electric vehicles and have the policies to back that up. The question is not whether cars are going to become increasingly electric. The question is whether those EVs are going to be made in America or whether they're going to be made in China. We are working to make sure they're made in America.",
