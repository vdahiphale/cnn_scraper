Just ahead, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Minister have just met on the sidelines of the G 20 summit. The first such meeting since the war in Ukraine began details on what they discussed just ahead.A double murder trial in the U.S. is reaching its crescendo. We'll bring you the twisted tale of the case that's gripped America. Alarm in Iran over reports that hundreds of school girls have been poisoned we'll discuss with our Chief Investigative Correspondent. Two of the world's most powerful diplomats sat face to face earlier on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russians Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met on the sidelines of the G 20 meeting in New Delhi. A U.S. Official says Blinken underscored U.S. support for Ukraine during the roughly 10-minute meeting. In prepared remarks earlier Blinken said the unprovoked invasion had marred the G 20 meeting of Foreign Ministers. He called it an attack on the core principles of the United Nations Charter. CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us from the U.S. State Department in Washington. Kylie, you've been speaking to your sources about what was discussed in that remarkable 10 minutes. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. So this was a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in India, as you said. And there were essentially three things that the Secretary of State addressed with the Russian Foreign Minister. First was urging Russia to come back into compliance with new start. Of course, that's the single lasting arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia that Russia suspended just earlier this year. Second, he urged Russia to release an American who was wrongfully detained in Russia, that's Paul Whelan. And third, as you were saying earlier there he also reiterated U.S. support for Ukraine. This is the first time that these two men, the top diplomats from the U.S. and Russia have met face to face and had a conversation since before Russia's invasion into Ukraine and they last met in early 2022. At that time, the Secretary of State warned Lavrov about the consequences that would occur if they did invade Ukraine. Obviously they went ahead with that and we do know that they had one conversation at least over the course of the last year not in person, but by telephone. That was this summer when they were discussing negotiations to release Brittney Griner who was American wrongfully detained in Russia at the time. But it's also significant, Max, that they've actually been in the same place at the same time, number of times over the course of the last year. You know, in Bali for another Foreign Ministers meeting at the United Nations. They've been in the same room. They haven't had discussion. So the fact that the Secretary of State approached the Russian Foreign Minister, according to a Senior State Department Official is pretty significant because he clearly felt that there were messages that he wanted to portray in person.",

Ukraine's Military says it's still holding its ground in the City of Bakhmut, but amidst its getting increasingly difficult. Ukrainian Officials report heavy fighting on the outskirts of the city and this suggests Russian forces have advanced within the city itself.About 4500 civilians remain in the city, as Russian troops do close in. Ukraine also reports a series of Russian rocket attacks on a multi-storey apartment building in the City of Zaporizhzhia. The attack killed at least 3 people. Emergency crews managed to rescue 9 people including a pregnant woman. About five kilometers from Bakhmut is the town of Chasiv Yar many Ukrainians fled there to escape the fierce battles in Bakhmut. However, the military fears if Bakhmut falls to Chasiv Yar will be next. Alex Marquardt is there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): This is the road on the way to Bakhmut, cars, military vehicles, bombing up and down this road going to and from the front. You see this armored vehicle right here? The V sign for victory there are still some people here not too many but some of these hardly residents have stayed behind. This is the shop of --, who is here grilling meats about --. He actually fled from Bakhmut two months ago and has opened up the shop selling basics like bananas, beet root and candles. There's another man who here who we just met whose daughter is still in Bakhmut one of the thousands of people there who have been asked to evacuate but are still in the city amid this incredible fighting. [08:05:00] MARQUARDT (on camera): You can see that they put up wood there to protect those windows so much destruction in this town. We were just farther in the center of town is called Chasiv Yar. This is one town over from Bakhmut with a large group of people at a bus stop waiting for a water delivery that never came. Every few moments, you can hear explosions, the sound of what we believe to be outgoing artillery fire, Ukrainians firing at Russian positions. We spoke with an older woman named Valentina, who said that there is so much flying over their heads, that she is scared all the time those they are so close to the Russian positions. That's more outgoing artillery fire. They're so close to the Russian positions that they can walk there. We also spoke with some Ukrainian soldiers like these ones who man one of those artillery positions. They told us that there has been no order to pull back from Bakhmut. That they're fighting because if they give up Bakhmut, then this town Chasiv Yar, this would be next. And that is what everyone is thinking now that if Russia were to take Bakhmut, that they would have another foothold in this region from which to try to push farther into Eastern Ukraine.

      "sentences": "Yes, and Max was adding to the controversy over Bezalel Smotrich's remark which I should note that Bezalel Smotrich himself is a settler leader. He has called for annexing the West Bank. It's that after those two Israelis were killed and who are out that is where Israeli settlers essentially went on rampages actually the chief, the top General, Israeli General for the West Bank calling them pogroms.They were setting fire to homes and cars with people inside one Palestinian man were killed, several others were injured and the Israeli Military essentially saying they weren't prepared for those levels of attack. So to hear somebody, a Minister in this government, after those attacks took place where clearly those settlers were essentially trying to do what he's calling for getting erasing this village off the map. That is why it got such a swift reaction from the Americans now Bezalel Smotrich in a tweet. And then a follow up statement kind of sort of tried to clarify, I don't know if I would call it a clarification necessarily. He says I did not mean to wipe out the village of Huwara, but only to act in a targeted manner against the terrorists and supporters of terrorism within it, and to exact a heavy price from them in order to restore security to the residents of the area. Max, I should note that he was asked specifically on stage. What did he mean when he actually liked a tweet that essentially said the same thing? And he said, well, because I think the town of Huwara needs to be erased. So I don't understand how this clarification says. Well, I didn't really quite mean that. Now, in terms of the reaction from the Israelis, the Former Prime Minister and Opposition Leader Yair Lapid called it essentially incitement to war crimes. We haven't heard directly from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu specifically condemning these remarks exactly. But there have been calls for the Attorney General to open an investigation to Smotrich because a different member of parliament actually had made similar remarks and they had a police file opened against them for incitement to violence. So now there are calls for this to be done against Bezalel Smotrich in terms of the internal politics. So you have to understand that Smotrich is far right wing party is essentially one of the reasons if not the reason that Benjamin Netanyahu is even in power because Benjamin Netanyahu needs the seats that Smotrich's party holds in order to stay in power. If they somehow have some sort of disagreements and sort of fight and Smotrich threatens to leave the government. Then the government collapses and Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer in power, Max.",

A security camera captured the moment when the passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided with a freight train on Tuesday. At least 46 people were killed and dozens more were injured. The Greek Prime Minister says tragic human error was the main cause of the disaster. Let's get more from the scene though from Nada Bashir outside Larissa General Hospital where many of the injured are being treated. I mean, a lot of people saying it can't just be put down to human error. There is a systemic problem here with an aging railway system.",

Why the system is so poorly equipped? And of course many of them and this could have been avoidable.Now we're outside Larissa General Hospital, many of the injured are here. Local Hospital Officials tell us that many of those involved in that deadly collision were young people and in fact, we were at the crash site a little earlier this morning. We were speaking to some of the volunteers they're working to support that recovery effort. Of course, no further survivors are expected to be pulled out from the train wreckage, but they are still recovering bodies. They're the first two characters completely engulfed in flames. The third carriage turned on its side and they are slowly working their way through that record for sadly, one of the volunteer's victims told us that they have to rely on DNA samples to identify some of the victims. Now at this stage, the investigation is still very much ongoing. Although one man has now been arrested the manager of a nearby train station believes to be responsible charged with causing mass deaths and grievous bodily harm through negligence and he is admitted to making mistakes and is still expected to appear before prosecutors. But there are of course, questions around the safety measures put in place across the rail system here in Greece. In fact, yesterday, the country's Transport Minister announced his own resignation. He said that this was a mark of respect for those who had lost their lives but also said in admitted that the rail system and the safety standards currently in place were not up to the standard one would expect in the 21st century. Despite efforts by the Transport Ministry over the last three years and there was going to be a continued focus on this here in Greece and while certainly the investigation is very much focused at this stage on that human error, the Prime Minister describing this as a tragedy. Questions around the safety measures put in place how stringently they are implemented are only going to continue to grow and there is a real sense of frustration anger here in Greece, growing towards the government too, Max.",
