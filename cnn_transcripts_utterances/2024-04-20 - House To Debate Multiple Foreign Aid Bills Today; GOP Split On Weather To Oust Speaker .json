Arizona Representative Paul Gosar signed on to Marjorie Taylor Greene's measure along with Paul Massie, Thomas Massie, but Greene hasn't forced a floor vote yet.The earliest we could see that happen is today. Joining us now is Tia Mitchell, Washington Correspondent with the Atlanta Journal- Constitution. Welcome to the studio. Thanks for coming in this morning. So, talk to us about what we're going to see this afternoon. So, Johnson's going to put to the floor these four aid packages. What's the strategy here? What makes it more likely that it will actually pass this time around? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Well, the strategy is that even though they're kind of one package, they're being separated into separate votes. And that is very important because I think all of them can pass individually, but when you package them together, there are so many different House members that dislike different portions that they -- it might not be able to pass altogether. So, by separating them to separate votes, for example, there are some hard right Republicans who've been very opposed to funding for Ukraine. Well, they don't have to vote for the Ukraine portion, but some of those same hard right Republicans might vote yes on the money for Israel. But there are some far-left Democrats who might not vote for the money for Israel. So, now, they don't have to vote for that part, you know, so they're going to take it in pieces and get it over to the Senate, but when it gets to the Senate, it will be kind of combined back into one big package, we think.",

Look at how they're losing a lot of ground in their own country. The military is to their fight against Russia, and that's due to the lack of funding. So, this would be what Biden considers a win because he's been pushing them to act. And he's also said that he wants to make good on his commitment to stand by these countries and provide the aid. This funding package would also provide at least $9.2 billion in humanitarian assistance. And that's another thing that the Biden administration has been pushing.

So, let's look at what's really happened over the past 24, 48 hours. I mean, that explosion in Iraq at the Iranian-backed military base of the PMU, that was interesting because we still don't know if that was an attack or if that was an accident.It wasn't at an ammunition depot, which is why we're seeing probably those dramatic images of the fire. Now, one was killed, as you say, but at this point, it was very quick that we saw both Israel and the United States deny responsibility for that. And that really just goes to show the level of tension in the region at this point. Israel is not in the business of denying responsibility for these kinds of incidents, but it felt the necessity to do that in the early hours of Saturday morning, an Israeli official saying they had no action in that. So, that's really very telling. We also had an Iraqi military official telling us that there were no drones or planes in the air at the time of the attack. But there does seem to be this feeling of a step back from the brink if you like. What we have been seeing over the past two weeks has been a significant escalation between Israel and Iran and there's certainly this hope that that has now dissipated at least to some degree and at least for now. You mentioned the Iraqi President Raisi giving a speech and the fact that he didn't mention Israel's strike on Iran at all. He was lauding the fact that Iran had carried out that attack just last weekend on Israeli territory. There's more than 300 drones and missiles, 99 percent of which were shot down by Israel and the United States and other allies. But the fact that he didn't mention it at all, the fact we haven't had Israel even acknowledging that they carried out this attack on Iran, really goes to show that there seems to be an effort to put an end to this, an effort to move on from what really was a significant escalation.

Moments after the full jury was picked, a bizarre and tragic moment outside court as a man set himself on fire. Authorities say he was previously known to the police, and while they are searching for any domestic terror connections, that is not believed to have been the motivation.In court, a handful of prospective jurors became emotional. One was excused after she told the judge she had anxiety and was worried as the trial goes on, more people could know she's part of the jury, saying, \"I might not be able to be completely fair and not emotional, so that concerns me.\" Another was dismissed after she began crying, saying, \"I'm sorry, I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either. I don't want you to feel I've wasted anyone's time. This is so much more stressful than I thought.\" A third was sent home after noting she was feeling anxiety and self- doubt as she listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses. At the defense table, Trump sat flipping through papers with charts, photos and graphics. He whispered in past notes with his lawyers and at some points was hunched over with his elbows on the desk. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger started off questioning potential jurors, telling them, this is not about Mr. Trump being a former president. It's not about his being a candidate for the presidency. It's only about whether the evidence proves he's guilty. During her presentation, Trump leaned back in his chair. At one point, his eyes closed. Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, focused on bias against the former president. She told those in the jury box, \"You all bring biases and you particularly bring biases about someone who is as publicly and outspoken as President Trump. There's nobody that doesn't know him in this room.\" In the afternoon, the court moved to a routine hearing to determine how much of Trump's legal history the prosecution will be allowed to ask him about if he testifies, which he said he plans to. Prosecutors argued they should be allowed to question Trump about the findings in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, among others, despite Trump's attorneys' strong objections. The former president shook his head as the prosecution spoke about how he defamed Carroll. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCANNELL (on camera): Judge Merchan said he expects to rule on Monday on what prosecutors could ask Donald Trump if he does take the stand and testify in his own defense. Prosecutors also said they expect to call their first witness on Monday. Trump's lawyers again asked if they could know the identity of that witness.

I think they are trying to trivialize and minimize the impact of what it was an extraordinary probably a missile strike launched from Iraq, with sparrow missiles against an S-300. Iranian radar system. The Israelis did this with an extraordinary degree of technical mastery, showing the Iranians that we can hit you. You do not have serious air defenses, and why your -- while your 350 missiles, most of which didn't even penetrate Israeli airspace, we the Israelis managed to do this.
