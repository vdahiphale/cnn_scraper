This is what we know at this hour.It happened in the first quarter after Hamlin tackled Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin got up and then moments later collapsed on his back. Within seconds, the Bills medical staff was treating him. Less than five minutes later, an ambulance was brought onto the field. The Bills say Hamlin suffered cardiac arrest and his heartbeat was restored on the field. Players on both teams were overcome with emotion, consoling each other and praying for Hamlin. At 9:18, the game was temporarily suspended, with the teams going back to their locker rooms to gather themselves. At 9:25, the ambulance left the stadium, taking Hamlin to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for further testing and treatment. And at 10:01 p.m., just over an hour after Hamlin's medical emergency, the NFL announced the game was postponed. So joining us now, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

But I'm looking for specifically, as you see the right shoulder there of the player go into the chest, is that right shoulder pad essentially acting as a projectile, like I showed in that baseball graphic. Is that the sort of moment of impact where basically you hit the heart and essentially cause that abnormal heart rhythm to begin, this ventricular fibrillation.Again, when I say it's rare, I'm saying maybe a couple of dozen times a year that this happens. And it's because the right -- the exact spot at the exact time. I mean, the heart is beating constantly, right? So to get it at the exact time when you could cause this sort of abnormality of the heart rhythm, again, it doesn't happen very often, but that seems to be what happens there. He goes to the ground. Again, that does not look like a significant event there. I'm looking for the fact that he then stands up after that, stands up, which is really important. Again, as a neurosurgeon brain surgery, I'm thinking, is there a brain injury, is there a spinal cord injury? Does not appear to be at that point. But at this point, as you're watching, when he collapses backwards, the heart rhythm is now abnormal, and he's not pushing oxygenated blood through the body, including the brain. It's going to cause render someone unconscious, obviously, and that's what causes them to fall to the ground.",

But if someone is at risk of cardiac arrest at home, a defibrillator is the way, the most efficient way to restart the heart, to restore that normal rhythm.I will say, though, everyone can learn CPR. I mean, I think -- don't know what the percentage is now, but there's a significant percentage of people who've ever gone through any sort of CPR training. Anybody could be a person who can administer CPR in this sort of situation. Call 911 first. Obviously, that's a football field, so it's a different scenario. But if you witness a cardiac arrest, call 911 first and learn CPR and administer that CPR. But, yes, I think defibrillators, having them more ubiquitous, more widely available, is really important.
