And depending on the outcome there could actually cut off nationwide access to the most common method of abortion in the United States. This case specifically evolved -- involves rather, a drug used in a medication abortion. As of 2020, research shows abortion pills account for more than half of all U.S. abortion and miscarriage health care in this country. The Trump appointed federal judge who's at the center of this battle already facing scrutiny. We're going to take you live to Texas. We'll tell you more about why.",

There is an injunction hearing that just started. It was scheduled to start at 10And what's happening right now is the plaintiffs, who are a coalition of anti-abortion groups, are asking the judge to block an FDA-approved medication called Mifepristone. This is a medication for abortions that has been approved by the FDA for more than two decades. Now, the plaintiffs are arguing here that this drug is not safe, that the approval process was completely flawed. The FDA, of course, argues against that, saying that that's not the case. But here is what is so impactful and so controversial here. And that is that if this judge rules against the FDA, this would be a judge, who is not a subject matter expert in this case, telling the FDA, who is the subject matter experts in this case, they are the scientists, they are the ones that Congress entrust in approving medication for use by the American people. It would be a judge telling scientists what to do, which would be unprecedented which rolls so many other questions into play here. Because then, what happens? How does that actually happen in practice? Because the FDA has processes, procedures, protocols to be able to do that. So now, does that then start which could take weeks or even months? Now, there are a lot of questions about what will happen today in the courtroom. Electronics are not allowed. So we can't give you a play by play of what is happening. Normally, we're able to do that in some cases, not in this case. We will not be inside the courtroom. So we will not be able to bring you those updates quickly. Now, one of the big questions is, could this judge rule from the bench today after this hearing is completed? The answer is yes. But will he? I don't know because of the secrecy around this case, I kind of doubt that that will happen, because the judge was worried about what he said. And what he told parties was a barrage of threats. He was concerned about security. And so we really question if he is actually going to make a decision today. But again, that is up to the judge. We won't know until that happens. Now, because of all that secrecy, there's been an outpouring of and an outcry by media and also legal experts talking about transparency here and judicial transparency and being actually having an opportunity for individuals and people to fly to Amarillo, which, guys, it's in the middle of nowhere, to be able to be present. Now, I should leave you with this. We're expecting protests here today by the Women's March. I talked to them yesterday. One of the things that they're very concerned about is if this starts with abortion medication, where does it end?",

And one of those impacts is simply that we will be confused, both doctors and patients, will not know if we can trust the national guidelines which tell us to follow the standard of care, the practice that has been set forth by our national organizations, or whether we need to listen to a judge who, as the previous reporter said, is not a subject matter expert.

But even in reading more this morning about certain studies that have been done, the reason that this combination is so important is because these two drugs, Mifepristone being one of them, work better together.If only one of the drugs then was approved, what does that mean for a woman who either chooses to have an abortion or may need one? I think we need to remind viewers constantly that often in the case of a miscarriage, a woman's body does not fully expel that pregnancy and they need either a surgical or a medication abortion.",

So this medication, Mifepristone, is not just used in abortion care, it is also used for miscarriage management, as you mentioned, and also in other medical settings. So taking away an approval for a medication because an extremist group doesn't like what it does is ridiculous.We know that Mifepristone is not required for abortion or for miscarriage management, but it makes it work better. And one of the things that it does is that it makes the whole process faster and more effective. It makes it so that fewer people will need to have procedural interventions or longer symptoms. What effectively taking away this medicine would do would be to make people suffer longer with consequences or with side effects of medications or miscarriages and increase the chances that those patients -- that those patients would need to be seen at a hospital or have interventions there.",

I mean, the U.S. issued a statement yesterday saying that the drone was essentially completely lost. But in other -- in other news, the Pentagon is also saying today that they believe that, you know, this is not necessarily -- that this was not -- that this was a reckless and dangerous act by the Russians. However, no one is vowing any real consequences for this. They have sent a very short message to the Russian saying that this is unacceptable, especially because the drone -- the Russian planes did clip the drone and did hit the propeller, causing the U.S. military to force to bring -- to be forced to bring that drone down. But the Russians also saying that they do not want confrontation with the United States. So while the two countries are going to continue to operate over the Black Sea and in the region, you know, raising the risk here of a potential confrontation in the future, does not seem at this point, like things are going to escalate very sharply from here.

It's very different, I think, from what we see a lot in the skies, particularly over the frontlines here in Ukraine, in Eastern Ukraine.Both militaries are constantly doing aerial surveillance and reconnaissance, trying to find targets on each side. In some cases, they're using -- they're using military unmanned aerial vehicles. But in a lot of cases, they're simply buying the kind of drones that you or I could purchase to fly around in our neighborhoods and doing things like in some cases, rigging them up with cameras to be able to get a live feed, but in other cases, to drop things like individual grenades on enemy targets with very lethal results. We know of more militarized, unmanned -- UAVs. We know -- it's public knowledge that the U.S. has provided these kinds of Switchblade kamikaze drones, which are designed to dive down and impact and blow up and cause as much damage as possible. The Russians had been using these Iranian made Shahed kamikaze drones, also. And we've also seen the usage of civilian unmanned aerial vehicles that can go far beyond the frontlines. Just a couple of days ago, I was given exclusive access to what the Ukrainian military says was a drone made by a Chinese company that was carrying a 20 kilogram bomb that was designed to throw shrapnel and that they were able to actually to shoot it down with rifles, with Kalashnikov assault rifles. And I'm working on that report right now. All of this just goes to show that there's a lot of stuff flying in the rounds in the air, some of it very lethal, and it's an integral part of this deadly, deadly conflict. Back to you guys.",

You know, despite these inflation numbers, it's so interesting that we've seen the market come down. But on the economic front, you know, producer prices unexpectedly dropped between January and February. Also, on an annual basis, it cooled off to 4.6 percent. If you look at the chart, this is a major improvement from early last year when this metric was nearly 12 percent. We've seen eight months in a row of cooling off. Now less encouraging were some of the retail sales numbers out that show that American shopping kind of slowed down a bit between January and February. Retail sales fell by 0.4 percent. That's significant -- been significant, because remember, consumer spending, that's the biggest driver of the U.S. economy, but I would note that that comes after a big increase in January.
