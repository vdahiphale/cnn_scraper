Importantly, he said, while the people who were occupying, who were vandalizing that academic hall occluded students, he - the mayor says it was led by individuals who are not affiliated with a university, not concerned about free speech, but concerned about chaos. External actors he calls them.Sara is at Columbia and has been standing by and listening into this as well. Eric Adams is putting his foot down, Sara.",

      "sentences": "Yes, she made clear that she plans to call for this vote next week. Of course any one Republican member, or Democratic member, could call for a vote to oust a sitting House speaker. And she plans to do that next week.But there's much difference than what we saw last fall in which Kevin McCarthy became the first ever speaker of the House to be ousted by the - by his own colleagues. At that point, all Democrats joined with eight Republicans to kick out Kevin McCarthy. This time, much different, because Democratic leaders are saying that they plan to essentially vote to kill this resolution to oust Mike Johnson as speaker. And I most Republicans plan to join it. So, this will overwhelmingly fail. But Greene says that she wants to put Republicans and Democrats on record about where they stand on this key issue as she railed Mike Johnson's dealmaking to keep the government open, to move forward on this surveillance law, and to fund - to provide aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia, all of which she contended was a, quote, betrayal of Republicans. But - so she made clear that she plans to force this vote. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): We cannot let people down again. We cannot fail President Trump. Next week I am going to be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative. I think that will play well. I'm excited about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's likely what will happen.Other question will be, how many Republicans ultimately join her. Right now there are only three Republicans, including her, who have publicly come out in support of her effort to oust Mike Johnson. Also one person who has not been in favor of moving ahead, former President Donald Trump. I pressed her about why she's going forward this with Donald Trump's opposition apparently to this effort. She contended that Mike Johnson is not advancing the Trump agenda and defended her support for the former president. Kate.",

I - and I - part of what he says is accurate there and we're going to see that in the arrest numbers. We saw them earlier. People unaffiliated with the school will - will - are arrested. They were there and part of that is what kind of access controls can these colleges and universities provide to ensure that the lawful student protests are able to go on.I do worry, however, that we're - this narrative of the outsider is a bit of a crutch. We - colleges and universities will be ill-prepared to do what they need to do, which is include, allow lawful protest if they think it's just a bunch of outsiders. Let's be realistic here. There's a group of students who lawfully and legitimately, in terms of the First Amendment, have things to protest against their colleges and universities. And us old people, who aren't used to this, we - you know, it's been a long time since we've seen these kinds of protests, dilute ourselves and dilute our planning and maybe aren't listening to what these students want. I have defended the right to protest. I do not defend and do think there is appropriate police action when that protest turns to unlawful behavior. And I also think, fortunately, what we're seeing is not really clashes. I think even Madison, Wisconsin, looks kind of hectic, but it actually looks like crowds are just moving in different directions depending on the control that the police want. And students who are willing to be arrested will be arrested as they continue to break the law. But I have been pushing back -",

I don't think anyone is expecting the Fed to cut rates this time. That had been the expectation over the last several months, but that has gone away.Now, what investors are looking for is what the Fed will say about what they will do about interest rates in the future. Will there still be cuts going forward? Might they even hit the possibility of raising rates if inflation remains suborn. So, stay with us all day. We'll bring you the Fed news as it develops.
