What a cutie. I'm Sara Sidner, with Kate Bolduan. John Berman is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Happening today, a defiant President Biden has gone back on the campaign trail in a key battleground state as public calls for him to step aside grow louder in Congress, but also seeming to grow louder in a new strategy. One where top Democratic lawmakers are able to say they still support Biden, but also leave plenty of room for him to change his mind. Listen to one of his closest allies, Congressman Jim Clyburn, who has been on the stump for him, said earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): Let Joe Biden continue to make his own decisions about his future. He's earned that right. And I am going to give him that much respect. If he decides to change his mind later on, then we will respond to that. We have until the 19th of August to open our convention. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He took a moment to praise his vice president, Kamala Harris, saying she could be president on day one, and also raised the potential that she could beat Trump too. Here's what he said.

No one can ever be sure that they're going to win an election, let alone a presidential election. So, I think that argument is probably not particularly persuasive to the Biden team. They are looking at the data. They are saying we see a path. They, youknow, went - many of his top aides went to the Senate caucus yesterday to make that case. I presume it looked a lot like some of what they put out in that memo yesterday, which I thought was quite good in illustrating where they believe there is room for Biden to grow and why they think he can win the election. So, I don't imagine that that is a particularly persuasive argument to them. I think you heard Joe Biden say quite clearly again last night, he's not getting out of the race. He doesn't believe that he cannot win this race based on what he's looking at. I think any person who is discerning and is looking at the state of the race today would say, yes, he has a hill to climb. But we also haven't seen other Democrats who have been floated as possible replacements poll much better. I think it is - there is simply an acknowledgement that we have work to do as the Democratic Party over the next four months to defeat Donald Trump. Everybody should be united behind that goal. And it's going to take everybody pushing hard to do that. And I think that's where Joe Biden's team's mindset is. And I think we heard pretty directly from the president last night that that's where his mind-set is.",

It's not like there's an open door or there's a vehicle.And I - let me just say this. A couple things. One is, Kate mentioned the Senate caucus yesterday. If you talk to senators who were in that caucus, yes, they made their case about the path that Biden has. Most of the senators would tell you, they didn't meet with a very receptive audience there. And that was a room full of people who love and respect and appreciate the president and everything he's done. But if you really look at the data, I mean the president's been behind for ten months consistently in this data. If you look at average polling and so on, and deeper data that the analytics people look at, he now is behind in all the battleground states, and in some cases well behind, beyond the margin of error. And so he really needs like a royal flush to win this race. So, yes, of course he can win. Anyone can win. But given the stakes, and I think this is what those Democratic officials are thinking, given the stakes, you know, the fact that he can win is not a persuasive argument. The question is, what are the odds that he would win, and would we have a better chance with someone else? And that's the question everybody is pondering.",

I mean we - just before we came on you guys aired a package where, you know, voters in some of these key swing states, particularly older voters who, by the way, are one of the most reliable voting blocs, said Joe Biden should stay in the race and he should keep fighting and we think he's our best chance.So, I think its - I think it is foolish - I think in all of this back- and-forth, it is foolish to assert certainty. I think there is data that makes the case either way. I think Joe Biden is taking a real - is going to take - I, you know, I think we saw flashes of it last night. I think we're going to see it when he's out campaigning. He's going to take the argument to Trump. And we have four months to make the case. I don't think anybody has a magic wand and can say with certainty which direction is the right one to go. Joe Biden has been very clear, he's staying in the race. He beat Donald Trump in 2020. He has an effective message against Trump. And he's going to get out there and deploy it. And so I think the question for Democrats is going to become, you know, this is the moment to look in the mirror and decide, do you want to win this election? Joe Biden has shown no indication he's going to step aside. He has a good case to make. And it's time for Democrats to go to the mat.",
