There's been all sorts of speculation that Viktor Bout, who, of course, ran a massive arms smuggling enterprise has closely been connected with inner circle of Vladimir Putin. He very much denies that. That he's got the dirt on Russian operations or Russian attempts to arm rebel groups around the world in 1990s and 2000s when he's arming smuggling enterprise was at its height.And so, look, it's a big win for Putin to get Viktor Bout back because if they were concerned about any of that information leaking, then making sure it's not going to leak because they've got him back in Russia where he's arrived over the course of the past couple hours. There's a broader issue as well, which is, you know, Viktor Bout is a pretty big cause celebre in Russia I'd say. Lots of people know his name. He's a figure on television. There's been  campaigning for his release for some time and this is the Kremlin able to say we don't leave citizens overseas. We get them back. And so, it's a big political boon for Putin.",

It allowed one state to deny another state's same sex marriage if they recognized it in that state.You can't do that anymore under this legislation. Each state would have to recognize another state's legally valid marriage. It does not set a national standard as some activists had wanted, but it does add that deals within on a state level. Now, it would also include some religious exemptions, for some churches who might not want to perform a same-sex marriage, they don't have to worry about their tax-exempt status revoked. That was necessary to get 12 Republicans to support it in the Senate. It ultimately passed there, today passing with bipartisan support in the House. I asked Mark Pocan, who's gay, who is married, about criticism from some on the left that this did not go far enough and provided too many exceptions, and he pushed back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARK POCAN (D-WI):  This bill goes far enough that if an activist Supreme Court decides to go after the law they can't anymore. We solidified federal law to make sure my marriage and other people's marriage can continue to be recognized. So, to me, that's a pretty significant accomplishment. We don't need fear of a direct attack from an activist court, and that's why it's a very important bill and I'm glad we got it done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Manu Raju on Capitol Hill, thanks.Now to the other major bill that just cleared the House of Representatives, the nearly $860 billion National Defense Authorization Act. That comes with significant changes to the military's policies and funding, and notably, a repeal of the military's COVID vaccine mandates. Let's bring in Republican Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida. He's on the House Armed Services Committee. He's also the first Green Beret to ever serve in Congress. Congressman, let's start with one of the biggest sticking points, which was just recently resolved. The COVID vaccine mandate has now been repealed for service members. Now, as I don't need to tell you, when you joined the Army, there were all sorts of vaccine mandates for other diseases. Those requirements still stand, why should COVID be any different? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  Well, Jake, I think this was a big win for Kevin McCarthy, who raise this as a key issue with the president and I certainly want to applaud him for that. Look, it was time for the vaccine mandate to go, Jake. The driving force for it was to stop the spread. Of course, you can't have members getting into a submarine or military members getting into a tank and affecting the other crew members, but it's not very clear that despite what we thought early on, or told early on, that vaccine doesn't stop the spread, it's going to spread whether you are vaccinated or not. That then makes it a personal health decision. The other thing that we were hearing from the Pentagon was that, well, you know, we can't have military members getting sick. It's a readiness issue. Jake, this is the healthiest population in America. If you actually look at the science, you actually look at the statistics, yeah, some people may get infected, but they weren't getting seriously sick, in 19, 20, 21, years old. In fact, the military's lost fewer members than they do in training or in car accidents. So, at the end of the day, when you weigh the risks, and we can talk about how it got politicized, but at the end of the day, if they were about to kick out over 20,000 national guardsmen and women, they had already discharged over 8,500 active duty members, that is a massive blow to our readiness that we can't afford in the middle of a recruiting crisis, in the middle of massive military buildup from China. We just literally could not replace those folks, so I think this was a common sense approach. It was time to go.",

Germany, in particular, has delivered a fraction of what they promised. Heck, \"The Wall Street Journal\" just came out of analysis from an economic standpoint, Germany's trade with Russia is down a whopping 3 percent. They are by far the most effective, their security is absolutely -- if Putin slices through Ukraine easily, he will move on. He has stated he will re-try to reconstitute the old Soviet Union.
