Dramatic scenes after torrential storms hit not only the UAE but also the entire region. I mean, you talked about how Dubai International has been impacted. All departing flights from Dubai have now been canceled until midnight on Wednesday, which is pretty significant, given the fact that most people can't get to the airport. You've got scenes like this, you know, a flooded streets. And specifically the main artery feeding into Dubai International completely shut down. We've got some of those images and you see cars submerged, people trying to get out. Frankly, people rallying together to try and assist each other. It's something that we haven't seen before 254 millimeters of rain hitting parts of the UAE. That is the highest that's ever been recorded since data began around 75 years ago, but this is also a regional issue. When we look at what happened in Oman, at least 17 people have lost their lives. Now, it is unclear where the people have lost their lives in the UAE. That data still being collected. But this is the day after these dramatic storms. It is a sunny day which is good news, but the cleanup begins. And you're seeing people working from home schools have been shut down as well. And, frankly, homes and infrastructure have been impacted. You know, me being at home yesterday, we had flooding in our house. We also had electricity outages. Our entire, you know, region section that we stay has been impacted and you've got incredible flooding. Now, one thing you've got to remember, this is a desert landscape. The soil is very different. It doesn't absorb as quickly. And also the infrastructure is not geared to handle this kind of rain. There aren't enough drainage systems around and most of that that does exist basically blocked by sand. Me getting to the office today took me around 45 minutes where it usually would take 15 minutes. It's eerily quiet. And from what we understand, hopefully, the worst is over. But, of course, the impact on the airport has been, I think, one of the most dramatic things we've heard where people were stranded. They weren't able to leave the people that had arrived, from what we understand, the connecting flights are still pretty much operational. But anyone wanting to leave Dubai or the UAE from Dubai International, that has been halted.",

Infrastructure that just can't handle the rain. You don't have enough drainage systems, frankly, on even buildings and residential buildings. And you don't have drainage systems in the streets as well. And specifically, that main road, Sheikh Zayed Road, where we saw some of the most harrowing pictures really -- people stuck for many hours. It goes to show that it's just not good. It is not that much rainfall. But as I say, the soil is very different. It doesn't absorb as quickly. And this is, of course, exacerbated the realities here. And it also happened very quickly, right? I mean, it's rained incessantly on Tuesday, absolutely non-stop. And you've just got this, you know, accumulation of water with no way to go, essentially. So I mean this is the reality. The cleanup is starting, as you can see. Fun in the sun, basically. A lot of people are swimming around. But, of course, it comes with a lot of damage as well. And, of course, people are trying to figure out what that overall number is going to be. Insurance companies also working through the clock to assist people.",
