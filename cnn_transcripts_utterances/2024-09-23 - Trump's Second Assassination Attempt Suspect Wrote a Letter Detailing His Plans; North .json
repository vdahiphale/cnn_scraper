This hour, a defiant Mark Robinson, the North Carolina Republican nominee for governor, returns to the campaign trail after that damning CNN report uncovering disturbing comments he made on a porn website in which he called himself a black Nazi and expressed support for slavery and much more. And now that multiple top staffers for his campaign have just quit, what comes next for Mr. Robinson?Plus, notorious anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who regularly peddles medical lies, says he's going to get to help pick the nation's top health officials if Donald Trump wins the election in November. I'm going to be joined live by one of the nation's top vaccine experts, who has directly spoken with Kennedy about these dangerous beliefs. And leading this hour, brand new details about the man accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump earlier this month, investigators say Ryan Routh left a chilling and disturbing letter detailing what he planned to do eight days ago at the former president's golf club, which he addressed to the world and wrote, quote, \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you. It is up to you now to finish the job\" unquote. CNN's Randi Kaye joins us now from West Palm Beach, Florida. Randi, walk us through what else was discovered.",

That came from a witness who said that Routh delivered a box to his home a while back. And in that letter, just a bit more on it, and he said, \"I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster.\" And then he went on to offer $150,000 to anyone who could finish the job.Also in court today, Jake, we learned that the defendant in this case, according to federal investigators, had a clear line of fire to the sixth hole putting green. And as you know Jake, Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green when this went down they said that that would have been -- would have put Donald Trump about 12 to 15 minutes away from that sixth hole putting green, behind the sixth hole putting green, so. There wasn't a lot of time before he would have arrived there. They also said that from where they believe Routh was, there was about a hundred feet in distance between where he was and that sixth hole putting green. We also learned that there was a piece of tape on the scope that they found on that rifle. It was a piece of electrical tape that was holding the scope to the rifle, and they found a, preliminarily at least, a fingerprint that they say belongs to Ryan Routh on that electrical tape, not on the firearm itself. Also, Jake, it came out in court today that there was a letter at the scene that was discovered that was addressed to the \"New York Times.\" They tested it for DNA. They looked at it for fingerprints. They said, as of now, they haven't found any of Routh's fingerprints or DNA on there. But Jake, interestingly, they did find a fingerprint belonging to somebody else. They did not say who that person is or what the letter said. Jake?",

Ayesha, North Carolina has not voted for a Democrat for president since Obama in 2008, and it was a long drought before that. Trump won there in 2020, but barely under 75,000 votes. A new \"New York Times-Sienna Poll\" released today says Harris is only trailing Trump by two percentage points in North Carolina, well within the margin of error. This poll was conducted before the bombshell report by K-File about Robinson. Do you think it will have an effect on the presidential?AYESHA RASCOE, HOST, NPR'S WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY:  I think that is difficult to tell, but I think because the race is so close, you don't want something like this dragging the ticket even further down, right? Like you don't want people who maybe are turned off by Trump and then also turned off by Robinson, who feel like, eh, maybe I just won't go out and vote, you know, maybe I'm conservative. And also, I think it's a missed opportunity. Because like I said, I was in North Carolina recently, I'm talking to voters. And what the black men that I talked to said was not that they're Democrats and they'll always going to be Democrats, but if the Republicans put forward a serious candidate that they felt like was serious, that they would consider them. But they did not feel like Robinson or Trump were very serious candidates. And so I think that it's a missed opportunity for Republicans when they have these types of candidates who are -- who have so much baggage and say all these outrageous things that it turns people off.",

Hezbollah fighters have been steadily firing rockets into Israel since October 7th, forcing more than 60,000 Israelis from their homes. We are joined now by former U.S. Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta. Thank you so much for joining us, Secretary Panetta.
