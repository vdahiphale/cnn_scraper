That hearing begins this very hour, we'll bring you all the details. Then, U.S. President Joe Biden set to deliver a major announcement that could protect around half a million immigrant families from deportation. We'll have more on that. Plus, Russian President Vladimir Putin has just arrived in North Korea, it's his first visit in more than two decades. We'll explain why this visit has the West worried. But first, this hour, Boeing's reputation hangs in the balance as it's outgoing CEO, David Calhoun faces a grilling from U.S. senators over the safety culture at the company. A new whistleblower, Sam Mohawk alleges the plane maker hid faulty aircraft parts. CEO Dave Calhoun took over the reins following two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. Today's hearing marks the first time Calhoun is testifying in the four years he's run the troubled company. And you may remember this mid-air emergency from back in January where the door-plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines flight, a Boeing 737 Max 9 for which Calhoun will also have to answer questions. And here's what the committee Chair, Senator Richard Blumenthal told CNN a little earlier. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  This kind of violation of trust is part of a pattern, a broken safety culture at Boeing. The company promised it would turn around. That safety culture after the two crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mary is also anattorney who represents families of airline crash victims and she has pending litigation against Boeing related to the 737 Max's eight crashes. Mary, great to have you with us this hour. We are expecting, Mary, I think it's fair to say quite senators to turn up the heat, I should say, on the seal(ph) of Boeing. Besides an apology, I'm not sure whether we're going to get that. But what we'll be looking for? What will you be looking for? What will they, the senators be digging into? We're just looking at images coming into us now. MARY SCHIAVO, CNN AVIATION &amp; TRANSPORTATION ANALYST:  Right, well, I think the senators are very interested in learning what is the path forward? What are they going to do to turn Boeing around? What is going to make Boeing the company that it once was? And how can so many things keep happening? How can they have this over and over again? How can they have so many problems? And how can so many whistleblowers have been -- according to the whistleblowers, ignored, told to be quiet, et cetera. The reports this morning or at least 12 have come forward, including one overnight with some very alarming details. So, I think the senators really want to know first and foremost, what is your path forward? Because I don't think anyone's really heard that, and no leader to take over from Calhoun is due to step down, has been even floated by names have surfaced yet. So, I think there's got a lot of questions to cover today.",

And of course, the United States Department of Justice, the criminal investigators are also involved. Boeing, if you recall after the crash of Ethiopia Airlines flight 302 back in March of 2018, entered into what's called a deferred prosecution agreement, and that left them off the hook for criminal prosecution if they complied with everything in the deferred prosecution agreement. Now, the Justice Department has said they did not. And the Justice Department will be closely watching to see what they have done, how egregious the violations were, and they will be making a decision whether or not to prosecute Boeing on or after July 6th.

He went on to say that Boeing should stop thinking about next earning call and start thinking about the next generation. He also said -- which was really interesting that Boeing's problems gone deeper, the one whistleblower, whilst also calling for other whistleblowers to come forward. But he said that, goes further, goes deeper than one aircraft. He mentioned this, directed of course this to the CEO of Boeing, Calhoun, who was brought in to turn Boeing around. And he said that shareholders deeply ill-served if it cannot fix what it says, the moment of reckoning for Boeing. Mary Schiavo has been listening in with me.

He didn't go so far as to say that they have decided whether or not they were going to prosecute him, but it's clear he was laying out for Calhoun and Boeing that he's done his homework. He knows they have an awful lot wrong, and a lot wrong the public may not even know yet by mentioning these 12 whistleblowers. And let me assure you, there are many others. Whistleblowers had been coming forward, not just on the 737, but also on the Dreamliner, the 787. So, there are lots of different lines and it had a number of whistleblowers come forward. The whistleblower mentioned, for example, from South Carolina was specifically whistle-blowing about the Dreamliner and many things that would if true cause planes to be grounded. So, it certainly set the tone for the hearing that they have grown weary on. You'll remember these hearings started right after the Ethiopia crash.

But also a strategic partnership treaty which would involve security. Now, the details of it haven't been made clear, but obviously, that's something that may be a centerpiece of this first visit to Pyongyang by Vladimir Putin for 24 years. It's well-known, Isa, that North Korea has been supplying Russia with ammunition, particularly artillery shells, the United States and other governments estimate that millions of rounds have already been sent to the frontlines in Ukraine for Russian forces to sustain their bombardment in that conflict. Although, of course, the Kremlin and North Korea deny that an arms transaction has taken place. Nevertheless, that's the international assessment.

My guess is you don't condone that kind of behavior. Have you looked at your incentives system within Boeing? And let's face it, there's obviously pressure on your sales -- you know, from your sales force to your manufacturing operation to deliver the planes that they've sold to airlines. Again, there's pressure throughout companies, you know. And I can just imagine that the pressure is being applied to Boeing associates throughout the company. OK. I get that. I've been in manufacturing.

We only have so much staff here at a subcommittee level or even a committee level. So, we really do need journalists going out there and digging up stories. But one of the ones I thought interesting before this hearing, I spoke to the very real problem, the difficulty you are having in finding -- well, first of all, your workforce -- manufacturing workforce is aging. You know, throwing COVID on there, early retirement, that type of thing, you lost a lot of experience. And in the past, it sounds like Boeing was able to tap into a workforce that was -- had experience in the aerospace industry, and you don't have that luxury anymore. I'm not exactly sure when that changed. I know coming from manufacturing myself, it's been difficult to hire people in a manufacturing operation because, let's face it, we tell our kids, you got get a four-year degree and you want to be in management. So, we don't encourage people to go into manufacturing, but can you speak to that issue or maybe Mr. MacKenzie can speak to that issue in terms of just your challenges in hiring people in a manufacturing setting for a very high quality, high demand aerospace industry.",

We have 10,000 suppliers. We put almost two and a half million parts into a 787. Boeing, because it's big and it has resources, even those were strained. We were able to keep more than most. But like you say, we turned over a lot of people. And yes, a lot of experienced people. Our supply chain experienced enormous turnover. So, as we try to respond to unbelievable demand for airplanes out there, we have a supply constraint that is very real and it is not resolved today. And I think one of the most important things we can do, we've done it in a few large instances, but now, we have to train ourselves to do it at small instances, meaning every employee. If a part's not there on time, if a part's non-conforming, we will stop the line. This -- so much of this relates to an untrained workforce. I'm going to tell you, it's all about that, honestly.",

And assomebody who -- you know, personally, I've testified before the Senate and the House of Representatives many times, and what you don't do is go into a hearing and attempt to think it's going to be, you know, a snow job, or you can soft pedal it. For example, he said, well, we took responsibility for Alaska Airlines door plug blowout. But then he kind of sloughed over the fact and he said he took -- they took responsibility for the crash of Lion Air and the crash of Ethiopia Airlines. Well, yes, technically, but many years later, they fought responsibility for about, oh, three years. At first, they said Lion Air was the pilot's fault and then they tried to do that in Ethiopia. And so, about three years later, yes, they admitted responsibility. There's going to be blowback on that one. To not be familiar with the documents that were produced to the Senate when Senator Blumenthal held them up, and he said, this is gobbledygook, and are you familiar with them? And he wasn't. Whoever prepared him for this -- and he should have been responsible for his own preparation, just didn't do it when he wasn't really familiar with the report that they scored a zero on quality control and said, oh, we don't really have a conflict in that. And then finally, I mean, if you're going before Congress and you know, they've got 12 whistleblowers, they talk to, you know, you ought to get out of the corporate suite and walk down and talk to them. Use a little wham, walk around management. I -- you know, Mr. Calhoun says he's going to retire by the end of the year.

What did you make of his response so far, Richard, on that? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  It was weak. But as Senator Blumenthal made quite clear, look, you told us you were going to change culture and do all these things after the two crashes that Mary is talking about. And you had several years, and then Alaska happened. So, in essence, Isa, what all the questions are boiling down to is, why should we believe you now? The whistleblower stuff is all, to a certain extent, you know, how you treated your whistleblowers. It's not on the main issue. The main issue is, how did you -- how are you changing the culture, which Calhoun admits is not perfect, but he hasn't told us how he's going to do it? He just continually says, he's going to focus down, laser like, this, that, and the other. Well, it all begs the question, but you promised us that before. And the truth of the matter is, Isa, he doesn't have an answer to it, because he can't prove it, because it's only a rear-view mirror proof that you'll take. It's only afterwards.

This is, of course, the Russian leader's first visit to North Korea in more than 20 years. As you can see their North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally greeting President Putin at the plane ramp there as he arrived in Pyongyang. We know that the two leaders -- very amicable greet there between both leaders. We know the two leaders can see their pause talking before then minutes later making their way to their motorcades. But this -- you know, this is a two-day visit that starts today. It is Russian president's first trip to the country in more than two decades. And it's going to be a trip, they'll be closely watch no doubt, because they will be trying to cement a burgeoning partnership between these two powers. Now, it is critically important, we were talking about this earlier with Matthew Chance who was telling us about what both sides are trying to get out of this trip. You can see there President Putin greeting leaders there, representatives from Pyongyang. But it is -- we're seeing a sign of deepening alignment. An important point, of course, for President Putin since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, who is, of course, been supplying weaponry, ammunition for the war to support President Putin.

But look, it is a moment where, no doubt, world leaders will be watching. We heard, of course, what -- from the United States, U.S. lawmakers saying, you know, the concern of this rapprochement between these two countries. But leaving that aside for just one moment, we are expecting, what, in the next 15 minutes or so, to hear from former U.S. President Joe -- from U.S. President Joe Biden. Talk to us about this announcement on immigration that could potentially protect around half a million immigrants from deportation. What are we expecting? What is the thinking here?",
