And this just in the last several minutes, a magnitude 5 earthquake has hit Southern California just as people are dealing with the effects of Tropical Storm Hilary. The earthquake was a magnitude 5 earthquake, happened in Southern California earlier this afternoon according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter of the quake was between Santa Barbara and Ventura, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. At least two aftershocks measuring 3.1 and 3.6 followed that initial quake. We are scrambling to find some folks on the ground in the region who felt this. So far we're hearing some anecdotal reports from some of our people in the field that they did not really feel at all that much. And so that might be because folks are really paying attention to this tropical storm that is making its way into the region. The rain is lashing Southern California as we speak. Hilary becoming the first tropical storm to hit the area since 1939. And the fears are historic as well. Some areas will see a year's worth of rain in just a day or two. Flash flood warnings are up across the region. We're still a couple of hours away from Hilary crossing into Southern California. Maybe a little bit less than that. But take a look at some of this video coming in just in the last hour or so. This is from our affiliate in Los Angeles, KABC. And some of those floodwaters starting to make their way on to the roadways, the freeways. People are attempting to drive around some of these floodwaters which is not advisable so that's why authorities are warning people to stay in their homes. As you can see, floodwaters, even small landslides starting to shut down lanes in parts of Los Angeles. The worst is likely yet to come. In the meantime this is what Hilary unleashed on Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. One person in this coastal town, we are told, died when their vehicle was swept away. Weather forecasters are warning those in the path of the storm be prepared for catastrophic and life-threatening floods. We're covering all of the angles of this storm from our CNN Weather Center to the cities in its path. First, heavy rains making the threat of flash flooding especially dangerous in desert communities. CNN's Stephanie Elam is in Palm Springs, California, for us where officials took the precaution of closing some roads hours ago. Stephanie, I'm not going to ask you, well, I guess I have to ask you if you felt anything from this earthquake. You're probably too far away. But in addition to that how are the roads doing?",

CNN's Josh Campbell is nearby in Oak Glen, California. Pardon me, Josh, as well, for asking if there was any feeling on your end of this earthquake? I know Stephanie Elam was saying a few moments ago this is not something that gets people all that riled up in Southern California. But I can see to the point of what's happening with Tropical Storm Hilary, it looks like you are starting to see the effects of that where you are standing right now. Give us the latest.",

I got a text from my husband who said they very much felt it in Los Angeles.Where we are now you could see here at the foot of the San Bernardino mountains. This area here is one of those areas that are now under mandatory evacuation. And the sign here over my shoulder tells the whole story. This area prone now to mud and debris. And that is because this whole area was subjected to recent burns. That changing the landscape here which is giving firefighters great concern as our photojournalist Chris (INAUDIBLE) walk over here you can see behind me some of those burn scars. This was all from previous wildfires. Firefighters tell us that these burn scars are throughout the area which makes, again, once the rain picks up and really starts turning into these flash floods, they soared down this area from the mountain down below. Now I spoke just a short time ago with the battalion chief who oversees this region here in San Bernardino. He talked to us about why this area is so concerning for them and why it's so important for residents here to listen to authorities. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right. You're not kidding. 5.1 quake just outside of Los Angeles. About nine miles deep. This happened just a few moments ago. So we have been talking about all of this rain that's pushing in. You add on top of that a quake. Good news is there is no tsunami threat. And according to the USGS it looks like there is not going to be widespread damage from the quake.It looks like quite a few people, though, felt it right around Los Angeles. So, of course, more details will come out in the coming minutes and hours. But, Hilary is really, the main topic right now that we should be focusing on because of this torrential rainfall that's been falling across Southern California all afternoon. We've seen rainfall rates at about an inch an hour. And it has is just been raining constantly across Southern California all afternoon. The storm has 60 mile-per-hour winds, should be making it into California in the next couple of hours. We've had almost four inches of rain. I bet it's already topped four inches right now in San Diego, San Bernardino County, about three inches so far. And this information is even an hour or two old so you can add rainfall to that. We still have flash flood warnings across Los Angeles. You can see all of these boxes of red indicate flash flood warnings. The topography here, the soil is not just going to absorb this rain. And like we talk about east of the Rockies we have thunderstorms or several inches of rain. It will happen in one afternoon, and it's not that big of a deal but when it happens here it is because it is not going to be absorbed by the soil. It's all going to be run off. You have all those burn scars we were talking about. You have very, very dry terrain. And so all of it just comes down the size of those hills and mountains as mud. And it also comes down very, very quickly so you can see riverbeds and creeks rise very quickly when you have rainfall rates at half an inch to an inch an hour. So this storm is going to continue to push to the north very, very quickly. But it is going to bring a lot of rain with it. Two to four inches, widespread amounts across Southern California. But, Jim, some of the National Weather Service offices are talking about we could see isolated amounts as much as 10 before it's all said and done.",

And the vast majority of folks are staying home. Many of our businesses, our tourist attractions are currently closed. That's giving us the space, really the grace to be able to do the work that we know how to do which is to keep people safe and keep the city running. I think if San Diegans can give us enough time, probably until about early morning tomorrow, I think we'll be squared away. Again, the message is very clear. The first of the rain is arriving right now. So for a lot of folks who are like, this has been much to do about nothing, I don't think we've seen just yet. We're predicting from about 4:00 p.m. until about 8:00 or 10:00 tonight is really the high tide of the rain and the wind.

There is a new twist involving one of Trump's 18 codefendants. His former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is asking a federal court to order all charges against him be dismissed. Meadows argues his alleged actions should be immune from state prosecution because he was acting in his capacity as a federal official at the time.His request for dismissal comes as Georgia authorities prepare for a historic and unprecedented event, the surrender of a former president at the Fulton County Jail. I want to bring in my next guest for reaction on the Fulton County case, former Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones. Senator, what do you make of this? What is it going to say to the world if we indeed see a former president of the United States surrender at the Fulton County jail, get his fingerprints taken, and have a mug shot put out there for the whole world to see? DOUG JONES (D), FORMER SENATOR OF ALABAMA: Jim, you know what, I appreciate the opportunity to be on today. You know what I worry about is that we just are getting kind of immune from any feelings about this. You know, it's just like the moonshots from years and years ago, after two or three of them people just, you know, got used to them. And I'm afraid that the American public is not really fully appreciating any more of the significance of what was going on. I think it sends a horrible message to the world, sends a horrible message across the country when the United States of America elected a person that is now subject to four indictments. Very, very serious indictments. Very, very serious allegations and statements, all coming from people in his inner circle. This is not some deep state indictment that you've got witnesses coming out of the woodworks from the deep state. These are Republicans. These are people in the Trump world and Trump's inner circle. So it's very serious. And I hope that we can see more people acknowledging that and quit talking about how the Justice Department and the law enforcement has been weaponized, and let these folks defend these RICO cases, these very serious charges.",

So when you've got his primary opponents, whether it's Governor DeSantis, Governor Haley, you name it, that are in, fact, supporting him and supporting his acknowledgement that this is more about law enforcement than him, you can't help but see a rise in his numbers and a support among the American public that are going to be voting Republican. It's just a real shame that these folks are not talking about democracy and then a threat to democracy that Donald Trump poses. Maybe we'll see that in the debate coming up this week.

The only thing that I can come up with is that Trump and his allies and to some extent those who were opposing him in the primary are repeating it over and over and over, and you see that on other networks that continued repeat. And at some point when you repeat something enough it becomes the truth.And it's very difficult at some point if you're not going to recognize the facts like the January 6th Committee really spent an incredible amount of time going over facts, putting facts in front of the American people. Now I think quite frankly we're going to see that as these indictments start coming to trial. Not just in the courtroom itself when it gets to a trial but in the pleadings that are going to come up, and the arguments and the motions that are going to come up. I hope that people will see that these facts that these indictments are based on, again, as I said a minute ago, are coming from Trump's inner circle, it's not the deep states, it's not Democrats, and it wasn't the D.A. who -- or Jack Smith who indicted Donald Trump. It was citizens. It was the people of a grand jury that had to return that indictment. And I'm hoping as we go forward you're going to see cracks in that armor.

As Larry knows, I mean, Trump has a lead in polls that we've seen very few primary candidates in either party reach on a national basis. Again, he did high 50s, much less 60 in a crowded field. You know, it's a statement of the breath of his support in the Republican coalition and his success in the Republican coalition at convincing them to view the indictments the way he wants them to see it as essentially an attack on them through him.Having said that, you know, like many other political reporters, I'm just back from Iowa this week and the State Fair, and there, there's passionate for Trump there as well. But, Jim, there was also a strain among many voters that I just kind of, you know, randomly talked to, it's not polled, at the fair. But there are voters who are exhausted with all of the controversy around Trump which is why I think it would be a really highway risk move for him to show up for his mug shot right when the debate is going on. It's not like there is, you know, that there is a coalescing around any single alternative by any means but there is still a universe voters who are not sure they want to sign up of five more years of the Trump show as it's been unfolding.",

He certainly will attack Kemp. And I think he'll find a lot of things he doesn't like about Glenn Youngkin, too. So this is so typical. Ghost candidates I call them.

I mean, the good news for Trump's rivals is that Iowa does have a modern tradition now where the Republican caucus has gone against the frontrunner in each of the last three races in '08, '12, and '16 that were contested. But each time, as you note, they picked an alternative who was not able to win the nomination overall. In fact, none of those three Iowa winners, Mike Huckabee in '08, Rick Santorum in '12 and Ted Cruz in '16 won more than a dozen states because the way they won Iowa was to maximize support among one group of voters, evangelical Christians.And you can win Iowa that way. But if you paint yourself into that corner, and have trouble reaching out beyond that constituency, there aren't that many other states as each of them demonstrated that you can win. And there are Iowa -- you know, the Iowa political leadership that is dubious of Trump has by and large settled on DeSantis. He has a lot of endorsements from local elected officials on many of these conservative power brokers and evangelical leaders are likely to end up in his corner. But I didn't really find a lot of interest about him among voters that I talked to. It almost feels like he's making a category here. I mean, his assumption was that Republicans would warm to an idea of Trumpism without Trump. So he's relentlessly portrayed himself as a fighter. I think the problem is that the voters who want a fighter in the Republican electorate, they like the fighter they had, Trump.",
