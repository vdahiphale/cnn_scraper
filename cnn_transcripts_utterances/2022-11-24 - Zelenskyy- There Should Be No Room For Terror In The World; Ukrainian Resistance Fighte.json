Well, at least seven people are dead after Russia launches a barrage of missile strikes across Ukraine, targeting the country's critical infrastructure. CHURCH (voice over): The large scale assault on Wednesday knocked out power to much of the country, including in the capital Kyiv. But hours later, a number of regions were reporting that repair work had largely restored the power supply. The strikes also caused a massive blackout in neighboring Moldova, where the prime minister sent a message of support to Ukraine after Russia's attack. CHURCH (on camera): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling the latest wave of strikes, \"The Russian formula of terror.\" CHURCH (voice over): His comments coming as he urged an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to support the Ukrainian peace formula. Saying there should be no room for terror in the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Energy terror is comparable to the use of weapons of mass destruction. When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH (on camera): Meanwhile, a senior World Health Organization official says Ukraine is in for an extremely dangerous winter ahead, not just because of fighting and power outages and shortages, but also because the fighting has devastated healthcare infrastructure across the country. Combined with fuel and electricity shortages, that could put more lives at risk in the coming months. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. HANS KLUGE, REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR EUROPE, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The winter will be a massive threat to millions of Ukrainians, due to the fact that maternity wards cannot function without incubators, Intensive Care Units cannot function without ventilators, and vaccine storages cannot function without fridges. It's that simple. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the football world is still in shock over Japan's upset of former champs Germany.CHURCH (voice over): Fans in Tokyo lost their minds, rushing into the streets near the famous Shibuya Crossing. Japan's 2-1 comeback marked the first time the Blue Samurai have beaten the Germans. CNN's Don Riddell has details on the match and the poignant protests that preceded it. DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR (on camera): Germany are one of the most successful World Cup teams ever. They've won it four times. But on Wednesday here in Qatar, they made a disastrous start in Group B. RIDDELL (voice over): However, before they lost their opening match against Japan, they staged a creative protest accusing football's world governing body FIFA of muzzling their freedom of expression. The players that hope their captain Manuel Neuer would wear the OneLove armband, a campaign that promotes inclusivity and is against discrimination of any kind. Germany's interior minister wore the armband at the game, and the German Football Federation tweeted a statement, saying that, \"Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice.\" FIFA say they will not take disciplinary action against Germany for the protest. Germany made a decent start against Japan, leading at halftime through an Ilkay Guendogan penalty. But it was very different after the break, when Japan equalized through Ritsu Doan, and then Takuma Asana settled it with a brilliant finish. A 2-1 win sparking scenes of jubilation amongst both the players and the fans. Germany's biggest rivals in Group B are supposed to be Spain. And the 2010 champions dominated their game against Costa Rica, thrashing them, 7-0. That is the biggest win of the tournament so far, and it was historic. Gavi, one of six different scorers on the night. He is the youngest World Cup goal scorer since Pele. And at 18 years, 3 months, and 18 days, he is also now Spain's youngest ever scorer in the World Cup. Spain completed their route with a couple of late goals. Carlos Soler on target in the 90th minute, Alvaro Morata then added another for good measure in injury time. RIDDELL (on camera): Wednesday's Group F match between Morocco and Croatia wasn't quite so exciting. That one finished in a goalless draw. RIDDELL (voice over): But there was plenty of drama as Canada made their first World Cup appearance since 1986. Arguably, their biggest star, Alphonso Davies had an early penalty saved by Belgium's Thibaut Courtois. And the Belgians took the lead on the stroke of halftime through Michy Batshuayi. And that turned out to be decisive in a 1-0 win. RIDDELL (on camera): The team that Belgium knocked out of the last World Cup, Brazil will kick off their campaign against the potential Dark Horse in Serbia on Thursday. And, of course, all eyes will be on Cristiano Ronaldo as his Portuguese side take on Ghana. Back to you.",

The company is offering those who are willing to quit their jobs and leave the Zhengzhou compound a $1,400 payout. And for more on this, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now from Hong Kong. Good to see you, Kristie. So, what more are you learning about these protests at the iPhone factory, and, of course, Foxconn's apparent back down?

Foxconn workers are fed up and they're furious about their pay, about the working conditions and COVID restrictions about the sanitary conditions inside the factory. In this day, we also learned that Foxconn is now offering $1,400 U.S. dollars to new hires to incentivize them to leave and to quit all this in a bid to somehow end the violence and restore order there. Now, if we look at the video that's been going viral on social media, you will see the following. You will see a tense standoff between the Foxconn workers and the hazmat clad security forces. You would see that workers tearing down barriers and throwing them. And also, in live streams have since been taken down, you could hear the workers complaining about the COVID restrictions, the sanitary conditions, the pay situation inside the factory. We have a fresh statement out from Foxconn this day. Let's bring it up for you. The company now saying this, \"Taking care of the health and safety of employees is the primary operating principle that the group has always adhered to. We fully understand the concerns of some newly recruited employees at the Zhengzhou Park about possible changes in the subsidy policy. Our team has been looking into the matter.\" LU STOUT (on camera): Now, CNN has also learned that Apple now has staff on site at the Foxconn Zhengzhou factory. Apple has issued a statement, saying the following, \"We are reviewing the situation and working closely with Foxconn to ensure their employees concerns are addressed.\" Now, the COVID-19 disruptions have been ongoing and Zhengzhou have hit output at Apple.

China carefully counts every COVID death but not the countless people who died because they couldn't get emergency care during lockdown. Authorities have acknowledged many of those cases, but they usually blame poor enforcement of zero COVID instead of the policy itself. Before his father's death, he fully supported the country's zero COVID policy. But the local governments execution of the policy is beyond reasoning, he says. It is inhuman.

PHILLIPS:  No, it's not just during the holidays, it's every single day for the rest of their lives. L. PHILLIPS:  Holidays makes it worse, of course. S. PHILLIPS:  And the one thing that we always recommend from the very beginning is that they get trauma counseling. Not grief counseling, not trauma-informed counseling, but trauma therapy. And there are so many new trauma therapies out there that they're having success with that treaty both the PTSD and the anxiety and the depression that everybody suffers from once they have had this happen to them. So, it's a long, long journey back to finding joy and the joy that they find eventually will be very different than the joy that they once had, but it is there. So, we always give them hope, we always tell them, we know exactly how they feel and what they're going through and that it does change in time. It doesn't get better. You don't move on. You don't forget what happened. You don't move -- you just move forward, and you move forward in a way that honors the person, the loved one that has been taken from you.",

We have winter weather advisories and winter storm watches in place for the Texas Panhandle.You can see of some of the snow that's already forming across the Northern Rockies. But this is the wet weather that could cause some delays. Dallas into Houston, we're getting a lot of Gulf of Mexico moisture here going forward. And just check out this forecast radar, time this out for you, Thursday, being Thanksgiving Day, you can see the wet weather starting to develop. But Friday, things are going to get messy across the deep south and southeast. We are anticipating one to two inches of rain just South of Atlanta as the system moves through. And you can just see this forecast accumulation going forward, Alisyn, things are looking a bit on the wet side. There is a snowfall for New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. Really kind of a wet looking forecast for this area. Again, for the second half the weekend. But in terms of today, getting out the door, at least, I should say, Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, forecast looking pretty decent. But Sunday, that's a whole another story. We're anticipating travelers for D.C. as well as New York City. And you can see a storm system developing across the Pacific Northwest. CAMEROTA:  So, Derek, basically is your advice that everybody should travel tonight or tomorrow for Thanksgiving and then get out of there before Sunday?",

That's when I anticipate the travel delays, as people head home from grandma and grandma's house, head home from family and friends.
