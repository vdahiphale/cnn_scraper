The Americans said the Israeli simply have not taken the necessary precautions, A, to avoid civilian casualties, the kind of which we've seen, more than 34,000 fatalities in Gaza since October of last year, and also the Israelis simply have not laid on the sort of shelter and food and sanitation facilities necessary, if all of these people are going to have to leave the Rafah area to safer areas elsewhere inside Gaza. Becky?(END VIDEO CLIP) B. ANDERSON: Ben Wedeman on the Rafah story and we'll get you up to date on where ceasefire talks stand in a moment. From Ben though, want to get to our next guest, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says that the Israeli capture of that Rafah Crossing in Gaza could bring humanitarian efforts in the besieged enclave to a complete standstill. Scott Anderson is a senior deputy director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza and he joins me now live in Rafah. As I understand it, you are in Rafah to the west. Do you have people on the ground in eastern Rafah, right now? What is the status from where you are about what is going on there?",

      "sentences": "Well, the White House so far has not commented on those suggestions that the U.S. has offered some guaranty relating to a more permanent a ceasefire. But what the U.S. has been trying to do is work with the Qataris to draft some type of agreement that might overcome those Israeli hurdles with a proposal, and something that Hamas might eventually be able to get on board with.Now, the hope is that in the coming days, they will be able to work towards an agreement. We saw a lot of optimism just last week from the U.S. side, as you heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that the Israelis had put forward a very generous proposal, but what remains unclear is whether they actually will be able to bridge the differences. But it comes as President Biden is facing significant pressure here at home as we've seen play out in those protests on college campuses in recent weeks, as we've seen this growing frustration with his steadfast support for Israel among key parts of his constituency, including young voters. And so, there is a lot of pressure for President Biden to act politically, but they also want to see some type of end to this crisis and their hope is that some type of agreement, even if it would just call for a temporary ceasefire in the time being, could pave the way down the road for having a full cessation of these hostilities. So, we will see what exactly Burns might be able to present in these talks. As you mentioned, he is not speaking directly with Hamas, but is speaking with Israel and the Qataris about some type of path forward as they are hoping to get these hostages out and also have some type of ceasefire in place for this war. B. ANDERSON: The restoration of sustainable calm is the phrase being used by the United States. And certainly, as we understand it from sources close to this matter, that was a phrase that was coined by the United States to ensure that some negotiations could continue around what is ultimately a ceasefire without actually using the term. Thank you, Arlette. Later this hour, I'll be back with much more on the crucial talks that are underway. They do continue. These could, of course, decide the fate of so many Israeli hostages and many more Palestinian civilians inside Gaza. For now, let's turn it over to my colleague, Amara Walker with the very latest on the Donald Trump trial. Amara?",

This is Vladimir Putin's fifth walk down the aisle at his inauguration. He won his last election in March by an overwhelming majority. Russia's top military and political bras showed up. But the U.S. and many European countries did not send representatives, claiming -- calling the election a sham. Clare Sebastian joining us now from London with more. Yeah, we talked about it in the lead up to the election in March. This was no surprise to anyone. What was the significance of Putin's inauguration today then Clare? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Amara, like this was a ceremonial event, very choreographed. It sort of lends the trappings of credibility, obviously, to Vladimir Putin who swept to power certainly as believed. Outside of Russia in an election that was neither free nor fair, but inside Russia, like nothing changes, if anything, there is a renewed sense of permanence around his rule. This is his fifth term, may not even be his last. He is eligible to run again in six year's time should he decide to do that. But look, internationally, obviously, many diplomats did not attend this event. But what we could glean from the very short speech that Vladimir Putin made is that the policy of confrontation with the West will certainly continue in his fifth time. Take a listen.

He goes on to say that a conversation even on security is possible, but not from a position of strength. It has to be on equal ground. The translation is that he will only engage in dialogue with the West if they stop supporting Ukraine, which of course is not happening right now. But significant also that Putin sees one key lever that he can pull and that is, of course, the nuclear threat just one day before this inauguration, Russia announcing that it is preparing drills, military drills that would simulate the use of a battlefield nuclear weapon, a non- strategic nuclear weapon.This was in response, they said, two comments from David Cameron, the U.K. Foreign Secretary and the French President Emmanuel Macron suggesting that the West's aid for Ukraine could go even further than where it is right now. So, you can see that this policy of confrontation, that nuclear threat that will be a key challenge for the West as it approaches Putin now in his fifth term.",

And so, what we are learning is that at some point, while he was there, he was detained by Russian authorities. This was last week, last Thursday, on charges of suspected theft and criminal misconduct.It is unclear what the details of his arrest actually are and what he is alleged to have done. U.S. officials have not disclosed that. But look, I mean, this is obviously a very, very tense moment for the U.S. and Russia and very delicate negotiations going on right now to get other U.S. detainees out of Russia, including Paul Wieland and Evan Gershkovich.

While the Israelis last night said that they're sending a team to continue negotiations, as your report has just pointed out, they did invade parts of Rafah that they didn't do so before.They took over the border crossing completely where they had partial control before, because nobody he could leave without Israeli permission, but now have complete and total control over Rafah and actually drove a tank around the border crossing with a massive, huge flag, which frankly strikes me as a provocation to the Egyptians because this all, of course, goes against the annexes to the Camp David Peace Agreement, the only peace agreement that actually ended a major conflict and state of war between Israel and its neighbors. So, a very dangerous escalation in that regard. The Israelis continue to engage in strikes and bombing campaign in Rafah. They've already told Rafah residents that they need to leave and I think it was UNICEF -- no, UNRWA who said yesterday that they expect anywhere upwards of 100,000 people already on the move. But on the move where? There is nowhere for them to go because there is no safe zone in Gaza. B. ANDERSON: Right.",

So, I'm not surprised that your viewers would be very confused because indeed the situation has been down to a lot of misdirection and conflicting signals to the point where D.C. itself is a noise that the Israelis are blaming them for how the negotiations have worked out. That was reported in the press earlier this morning.B. ANDERSON: That's right. And H.A. Hellyer, there is a sense certainly from officials that CNN is talking to and officials who are being reported on the Israeli side, a sense that friendly they feel -- the Washington has blindsided them with the latest offer which was, as they say, conceived by the U.S. and mediators in Qatar and then offered to Hamas. This is how Egypt has responded to what is going on in Rafah, this morning. I just want to get your sense of this. Egypt call on the Israeli side to exercise the utmost levels of restraint to stay away from a policy of brinkmanship that has long-term impact and that would threaten the fate of the strenuous efforts made to reach a sustainable truce inside the Gaza Strip. What's the Egyptian strategic thinking at this point? They are, of course, intrinsically involved as key mediators alongside Qatar in these ceasefire and hostage talks and of course, on the other side of this Rafah Crossing, and they fear a security issue building on their side of that crossing.",

And even so, Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by many, many countries, Hamas actually signed up to a deal to precisely that and it has been the Israelis that have be an obstacle in this regard.So, I think that Egypt sees all of this. The Cairo (inaudible) and is very concerned about what this means in terms of security for itself. The Philadelphi Corridor, which is along the border between Gaza and Egypt, specifically should not have any Israeli troops and that is in one of the agreements between the Israelis and the Egyptians. And here you have an Israeli tank parading up and down the border with a massive flag. So, I think that there is a lot of distrust here. I think there is a lot of suspicion that the Israelis are not interested in a deal. They are not interested in de-escalation. They are interested in going into Rafah irrespective of what D.C. says or what the European Union says, or what the international community says. And I am afraid, I think that they will unless Washington, D.C., which does have leverage over the Israelis, actually uses that leverage and that leverage I have to repeat is not about rhetoric, but actual leverage in terms of the provision of arms and support at the United Nations, not rhetoric, but actual leverage. B. ANDERSON: Right. The perspective of H.A. Hellyer. Good to have you, sir. Thank you. That's it from me in Abu Dhabi this hour.
