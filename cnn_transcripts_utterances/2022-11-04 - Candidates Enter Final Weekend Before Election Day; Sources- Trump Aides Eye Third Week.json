Only four days left for candidates to make their closing arguments to voters before Tuesday's election. More than 34 million people have already cast the ballot, far outpacing 2018 numbers at this point. The trend suggests the Republicans are well-positioned to take the House, but control of the Senate rests on a knife's edge which means every race is criminal. Democrats got a moral boost today with the new jobs report showing the U.S. economy adding 261,000 jobs last month. But a separate measurement of the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent. This is the last economic mood check before an election day in which voters say the economy is the top factor in their vote. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is intensifying his game of footsie with 2024. Sources tell CNN, his aides are eyeing the third week of November as an ideal launch for his run for president.

You can investigate, you can go to the grand jury, you can issue subpoenas, you can indict, all the things that we saw Robert Mueller do, who, of course, with special counsel most recently. There is a bit more separation and independence, however, if you get a special counsel who is free to operate without daily oversight from the attorney general.

And as Elie was saying, part of this has to do with the fact that the Justice Department knows that if there's going to be a political firestorm as they continue to investigate Donald Trump, particularly when he becomes a candidate. So they're looking at the possibility of the special counsel to say, you know, could this insulate us from some of the criticism that would for sure rain down on them if Joe Biden is the president, he's running against Donald Trump and Joe Biden's Justice Department is investigating Donald Trump.",

He said in his mind it was because the presidential election itself was unconstitutional and in his opinion, several state election laws were changed by executive fiat and they were not changed legislatively. So, he believed it wasn't a fair, free election because of the laws being changed. One last thing, now, Rhodes made clear that he's a Yale-trained lawyer and a graduate of Yale.

The Brooklyn Nets suspended Kyrie Irving after the basketball star shared a link to a widely anti- Semitic documentary last week. Irving followed that up with the week of non-apologies and after last night's suspension, Irving finally said he's sorry in a post on Instagram. \"L.A. Times\" opinion columnist L.Z. Granderson joins us now. L.Z., what do you make of the apology and timing only coming after the suspension? L.Z. GRANDERSON, OPINION COLUMNIST, L.A. TIMES:  Well, I think it's pretty evident to everyone that once his money got impacted in a significant way, all of a sudden, he had a different perspective in terms of whether or not to apologize. We're, I think, pretty used to Kyrie Irving being somewhat contrary to popular opinion, or better yet, facts.

And then after that, though, Durant tried to qualify and said I see some people are confused. I don't condone hate speech or anti- Semitism. I'm about spreading love always.

So I would like to see grace in terms of how they handle these complicated questions because in society, we have problems answering these complicated questions, and no one has a microphone asking us to answer questions right after we get done with work. So I understand people are maybe upset with Kevin Durant. I was too a little curious as to how he placed what he did, but I encourage you to go and read the story on ESPN.com and it gives you a background of what the organization is trying to do behind the scenes to get Kyrie to apologize.
