      "sentences": "You had Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle, SpaceX's Crew Dragon, and now Starliner. So, this is a relatively rare event in the history of spaceflight.And just listening to and Butch and Suni talk about how much being assigned to this mission has meant to them, but they have also had to wait a really long time to fly this thing. I mean, for Suni Williams, she was assigned to this flight nine years ago. She has been waiting nine years to fly on this mission. And then we had all those recent scrubs. First, there was that scrub, Alisyn, May 6, which was caused by a faulty oxygen valve on the Atlas 5 rocket here. But this scrub on Saturday had nothing to do with the capsule or the rocket. It had to do with an issue with the ground computer that instigates that automatic launch sequence. And, so, so much has to go right for the launch that we just witnessed here. The weather has to cooperate. Everything has to go perfect right up until the moment of liftoff. And so, right now, the Centaur engine, I believe, has ignited. So what we're seeing right now is these two stages still mounted together. So you have the bottom half of the Atlas 5 rocket and these two solid rocket boosters that have separated from the rest of the spacecraft and will essentially never be used again. They're totally expendable, but these two now continuing on into space and then just the capsule in about 24 hours, hopefully, rendezvousing with the space station, and that crew up there excited to finally see those astronauts and their friends in person, Alisyn.",

The prosecution's leadoff witness, an FBI agent, just finished her testimony. The jury heard opening statements yesterday, with prosecutors using Hunter Biden's own words against him.

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, right now, we're in a very short break, and we expect that Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden's ex-wife, will take the stand right at the end of this break this morning.And, look, I mean, the prosecution has an overwhelming amount of evidence, and they have displayed it. As you pointed out, they have played the audiobook, more than an hour of it. They have shown the infamous Hunter Biden laptop. They have shown pictures. They have shown video. They have shown drug paraphernalia, a crack pipe. They have shown text messages with people who the prosecutors say Hunter Biden was buying drugs from. And all of that is to show that Hunter Biden was struggling with drug addiction at the time that he bought this gun in October of 2018. What prosecutors do not have, though, is any evidence that on the day Hunter Biden bought the gun that he was on drugs that day. And that's where Abbe Lowell, his defense attorney, is focusing his energy. As I pointed out, there's a lot of evidence, including that from Hunter Biden himself, about his addiction struggle. So the government really has the upper hand here. And Abbe Lowell is working with the very little that he has. And that is to try to draw some -- at least focus some doubt on some of the transactions that the FBI agent who's been on the stand since yesterday was being used to sort of describe on some of those drug purchases and so on. What we expect, Wolf, is that Kathleen Buhle will take the stand. And she is the first of three exes, the women that were involved in his life, who will testify about that drug abuse, the drug abuse that they witnessed while they were with him, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "So it seems that the defense is trying to focus specifically on two things. One is the issue of timing. As Evan said, there was this moment in 2018 when Hunter Biden goes into a gun store, he buys the gun, he fills out forms, required forms, that ask, are you an addict? And he checked no.Now, I guess the argument is perhaps he wasn't addicted at that very moment. Now, he ends up possessing the firearm or owning it for a matter of days, for less than two weeks. So I suppose they're trying to argue that maybe, if he had addiction problems throughout the year, perhaps he wasn't an addict at that specific moment. Another thing that I think is coming through in the defense strategy here is the statute, the law only applies to people who are addicted to controlled substances, to drugs, but it does not apply to alcohol abuse. And so it seems like Abbe Lowell, the defense layer, is suggesting that, if Hunter Biden had problems at the time, they were more alcohol and less controlled substances.",

      "sentences": "Senate Democrats are today taking up the fight to protect birth control access nearly two years after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade.In a letter to his colleagues, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said lawmakers will vote some time later today on a right to contraception bill. Schumer called the overturning of Roe one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of modern times. He also warned that state abortion bans are just the tip of the iceberg and claimed the Republican agenda extends to contraception as well. Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts is a sponsor of this new bill. He's joining us live from Capitol Hill. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. I know you and your colleagues will soon be holding a formal press conference on the right to this contraception act. Tell us what's covered in this bill and what forms of contraception are included. SEN. EDWARD MARKEY (D-MA):  Well, obviously, in the Dobbs decision, Clarence Thomas made it very clear that he wants the Supreme Court to revisit contraception protections as well. In other words, Roe v. Wade in 1973 was not bad enough. Justice Thomas said the Supreme Court should go all the way back to the Griswold case in 1965 guaranteeing a right to contraception. So, for all those people who thought that a threat to Roe v. Wade was absolutely out of the question, it's real. And that's what Donald Trump's goal was in appointing three very conservative right-wing judges to the Supreme Court of the United States. So contraception is now in the crosshairs of the MAGA Republicans. And our goal is to put back on the books statutorily a right to access to contraception for all Americans and also the right for providers to be able to provide contraception without any threat or risk of legal action against them.",

This just goes to the right for someone to get it if they want it, the right for a provider to issue -- to provide a contraception if you want it.

That was the promise that Donald Trump made when he picked his three Supreme Court justices, and that's the promise that Donald Trump and a right-wing House and Senate Republican-controlled MAGA Congress will, in fact, begin to implement if they are successful. So that's why this election is so important. It's all on the line. It's on the ballot this year.

When I brought it out in 2022 onto the Senate floor, the Republicans objected. When I brought it out in 2023, they objected. So now here, in 2024, we're going to force the vote.

That would be Donald Trump. Here in Washington, meanwhile, a new piece, new article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" is dredging -- dredging up one of the president's most sensitive political liabilities. It alleges he is -- quote -- \"showing signs\" of slipping behind closed doors. \"The Journal\" says it spoke with 45 Washington insiders for the article, but acknowledged that most of those critical of the president's performance were Republicans. The White House is hitting right back, accusing Republicans of -- quote -- \"making false claims\" as a political tactic. And it's noting they have -- quote -- \"made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment.\" Let's discuss this and more with CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for the \"PBS NewsHour\" Laura Barron-Lopez, former RNC Communications Director Doug Heye, and CNN political commentator Maria Cardona.
