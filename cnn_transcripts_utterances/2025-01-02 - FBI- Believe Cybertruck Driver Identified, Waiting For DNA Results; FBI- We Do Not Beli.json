This is a very wide investigation, and it's going to take a while to get to the facts. But I do like what the sheriff had to say.

And that FBI bomb technicians recovered two improvised explosive devices in the Bourbon Street area. And this is coming as we're getting some new surveillance video of the attack. It shows a harrowing moment here. Just before, you see there, people barely getting out of the way of the truck. It's unbelievable.

That is the vehicle that we know came -- it was rented in Houston. He rented it on December 30th. The FBI said today at a press conference they had several hours ago, he then drove it New Years Eve. And while driving, made about five videos in which he spoke to camera, according to the FBI. They recounted a little bit about what he said. He said that he had -- you know, they were sharing the timeline. He rented the truck, drove it to Houston between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. He's seen now on videos planting explosive devices. Two explosive devices, according to the FBI, were found about, or in the area of -- of the French Quarter that initially they had thought maybe other people had planted. They have confirmed today, they said, at this point, they believe no one else was involved in the attack here in Bourbon Street on the ground, actually planting those -- those explosive devices. They were -- both those devices we're found and detonated safely. That is a picture of the actual vehicle. And you see it. It's the same vehicle that's in that security camera. This is after the attack. What you're not seeing there is that there's actually a person on the right hand side, lower right hand side of the screen, which we're not showing, a person who was injured. And you know, we are still now learning a lot more about those whose lives we're lost, about the people who we're wounded. Fourteen people now confirmed dead, as many as 35 sustained injuries, a number of them are still in the hospital. I want to play some -- let you hear from the FBI agent in charge of this operation. Some of what they have found from the phones and laptops that they have obtained. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was actually a very moving scene, this extraordinary band playing music.The officials in the city wanted first to open Bourbon Street to -- to religious leaders. So they've also had a lot of preachers here doing prayer circles. We've seen, saying prayers. And also music, which obviously is such a key part of -- of New Orleans. And then they closed the street down a little bit. It's all cleaned up. And now they've opened it to the public. And as you see, there are -- it's not obviously incredibly crowded, but there are dozens and dozens of people wandering -- walking up and down, just wanting to come here. Businesses have opened, the bars have opened. There's some music playing in a couple of bars down the street. The -- you know, the frozen drinks that are like purple and pink, they are in the slushy machines going around. So it is very important for city officials -- I talked to the superintendent of police just a short time ago, we ran into her on the street -- to get this street back up and running. Not just, not from a business standpoint, so much as just a statement about this city and the spirit of this city and the desire to -- to have the city not be, you know, on bended knee. This city has gone through so much with Katrina. I was here. It's crazy, Brianna. I was here almost 20 years ago when Bourbon Street first reopened after Hurricane Katrina. I remember it. City officials walked down the street, making it the official opening of it. And I remember the first bar that opened. So it's very strange to be back here 19 years later and see Bourbon Street once again reopening after a tragedy.",

I mean, obviously, everyone is happy, if you could call it happy, that this was not a coordinated attack with multiple assailants still at large in the city of New Orleans. But on the other hand, part of what caused the confusion, Brianna -- and that was in the press conference as well, as well as our briefings -- is that there were people who saw these packages and kind of prodded them and looked in them. And what's kind of jarring is that we've all grown up in an America post-9/11 TSA, if you see something, say something. And this was an instance in which these -- these improvised devices are incredibly suspicious. And the fact that there weren't people out there who, when they saw these - these -- these devices, which looked very, very suspicious, middle of the street, there were literally police officers on every corner of the French Quarter last night - sorry -- yesterday morning.",

They are -- they are diligently hunting to see if they're direct contacts. And that's part of why you're seeing this huge outreach to trying to find people who were in communication with him. There was this period after his divorce and after his bankruptcy where he was living in a trailer park or something, where they're trying to figure out what he was doing during that period, which is why they're doing so much investigation.
