The Trump campaign had thought his ability to take questions for an hour was a potent contrast with Biden. But does this dynamic work against Kamala Harris the same way? Plus the art of power. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joining THE LEAD here on set for her take on Trump's press conference, Biden's debate performance, the Harris campaign so far, and much, much more.

The former president, using the opportunity to announce that he has agreed to three debates with NBC and with ABC and with his friends at Fox. He spent 64 minutes speaking extemporaneously and taking 41 questions from reporters. He slammed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and even Hillary Clinton. Trump also criticizing the media's coverage of crowd sizes at Harris's rallies. He also continued to spread false claims about U.S. elections and January 6 and, wow, so much more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a rough debate but that doesn't mean that you just take it away like that. I think she's worse than Biden. She destroyed San Francisco. In South Carolina, I had 88,000 people, in Alabama, I had 68,000 people. Nobody says about crowd size with me, but she has 1,000 people, a 1,500 people and they say, oh, the enthusiasm is back. I just hope we're going to have honest elections. That's all. She doesn't know how to do a news conference. She's not smart enough to do a news conference. And nobody was killed on January 6. You know, with Hillary Clinton -- I could have done things to her that would have made your head spin its like a jobs program for fact- checkers Trump said he doesn't have to do rallies on the campaign trail because he's leading by a lot. That's not actually the case. The CNN poll of polls, which is an average of reputable polling, has the race today tied nationally at 49 percent versus 49 percent. In the battleground states, the race is also tightening significantly. \"The Cook Political Report\", which after the June 27, Biden-Trump debate moved a number of states towards Trump, today, moved three -- Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia -- back to toss-up status. Trump's only scheduled campaign rally this week is in Montana tomorrow. His Democratic rival, Vice President Harris, rallied in Wisconsin and Michigan yesterday along with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. She just spoke to the United Auto Workers union in Detroit and is flying to Arizona later today where she and Governor Walz will rally tomorrow.

He inflated the numbers that he says are coming across right now way beyond where they are now, and there have been declining. He also said something he said many times before that other countries all around the world are emptying their mental institutions in their prisons into people who are coming across U.S. border in the United States. Zero proof of that. We've never been given proof of that. He says it over and over again. He talked about the economy big issue for many people said, we're on the verge of a dip freshen, not a recession, a depression? Absolutely not true. A depression, the 19 -- the big Depression, 1920s, which he cited, unemployment down 25 percent. We're at 4.3 percent right now. So not even close. He exaggerated the role that energy prices had in the economic downturn in this country, saying that it was bad management of energy. This is false. Gas prices were part of the equation, but so was the backlog of demand and supply problems related to the pandemic that lead into it. So that's another thing. He threw in there as he often does, that if the Democrats take over, they're going to force everyone to buy electric cars. No, that also is not in the plans. And on and on it went, with many claims about this, but most of all, he kept circling around when he would come to one theme if there was a theme, it was to say, well, Kamala Harris is somehow behind all of this.

They do not speak and have not spoken.But I asked him if he had voted -- if he had voted for him in the Republican primary because Kemp had not answered questions from reporters in Atlanta about who he had actually cast that vote for. He told me that he did not vote for anyone and it was on top of his wife, Marty Kemp, also not voting for Donald Trump. Not surprisingly, I mean, Donald Trump tried to get her husband fired and once predicted that his political career would go down in flames. Obviously, we saw Kemp soundly defeat the primary challenger that Donald Trump had endorsed. And then went on to be re-elected as the governor of Georgia. And so, it's this remarkable moment, though, where you hear Trump's allies, people like Senator Lindsey Graham saying, it doesn't make any political sense for Donald Trump to go after an incredibly popular Republican governor and not just a popular Republican governor in a state that Trump lost in 2020 but also, he's got a potent political force around him. He doesn't really rely on the Republican Party of Georgia, which is spending a lot of money on legal fees for those who tried to overturn the election there. He's got his own operation -- something that can be probably pretty beneficial to Donald Trump, Jake, if he is trying to win Georgia which most Republicans thought would be pretty easy if he had not stoked his fight, again, with the Republican governor there who may not be as compelled to go out and campaign on his behalf or urge people who are skeptical of Donald Trump to vote for him. And Jake, you heard Trump during that press conference marveling at the fact that he can win Alabama and South Carolina by large margins and still lose Georgia. Obviously, Metro Atlanta would like a word on how that works and it's not similar when it comes to the electorate with the other two states, Jake. But it is a real concern that Trump could essentially get in his own way in the state of Georgia by trashing Kemp.",

You heard him saying that she only got 1,500 people. We actually heard from the Harris campaign yesterday that between Wisconsin and Detroit, it was closer to 25,000 people, 27,000 people that she had out at those rallies. And so that is something that Trump is seeing and he's very clearly, you know, ingesting that and worried about that and figuring out how to deal with that in real time. I think that's part of what led to today's press conference, which was organized just a little over 24 hours ago to have him come out and be taking questions.

It comes at a time when polling has actually shown that Harris has to improved her standing among Latino voters compared to when Biden had been in the race against Trump over the course of the past year and into the summer. This recent polling from New York Times found that Harris has 57 percent support of Latinos over Trump. So this will be a key constituency that the campaign is trying to woo over in the month heading into November.

Well, it's important to note at the outset that there's no indication that the shooter who fired at former President Donald Trump was acting based on politics, his own political leanings appear to diverge.Nevertheless, we saw spirit, theories start to spread online after that attack. And what law enforcement now is fearful obvious that you might have extremists that are seeking some type of revenge at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. I'll read you part of that intelligence assessment that we obtained. It says the FBI and DHS remain concerned about the potential for follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence following the 13 July assassination attempt on Trump, particularly given that individuals in some online communities have threatened or encouraged or referenced acts of violence in response to the attempted assassination. Now, it's worth pointing out this is one of several different types of threats authorities are on alert for. We know obviously that security officials have been saying the alarm about the threat of foreign terrorism as well. You just look to the Taylor Swift concert threats that shows us that groups like ISIS are still active and still plotting. And so, certainly, Jake, when this massive footprint of law enforcement there in Chicago greets visitors and just over a weeks' time, they will have a lot to grapple with, with many different threats that they're on the alert for.",
