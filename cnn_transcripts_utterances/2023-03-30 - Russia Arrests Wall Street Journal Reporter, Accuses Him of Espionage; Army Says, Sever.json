When that happened in 1986, that was Nick Daniloff had been arrested. And at the time, he essentially said he believed it was a tit-for-tat because a Soviet citizen had been arrested, he believed he was arrested. We should note that the Kremlin has been asked that last week, a Russian citizen was arrested in the U.S. and accused of being a spy. They're not commenting on whether or not that has to do with the arrest of this reporter, but I wonder what you make of that, as we are still trying to figure out more details here.",

But I think this is a very disturbing sign because, again, that date was Nick Daniloff was way back in the mid-1980s. And the problem right now is that the laws in Russia are -- even the ones dealing with information, period, let alone any alleged espionage, are already broadly worded so that a journalist doing his or her job could easily violate that, whatever the law is.But this is really -- I agree with Matthew. This is much more serious. I think it indicates that the FSB is really cracking down right now, and it presents true problems for the U.S., even the embassy in Russia right now, the American embassy has very little -- very few personnel and it's going to be very difficult to deal with this. But this is a sign. I was looking at the background of Evan Gershkovich. And he is an experienced reporter, relatively young, but he's worked for agencies in Russia for quite a while. I would presume that he speaks Russian, and he was probably quite effective in what he was doing in his journalism. But this is this is a real challenge right now. LEMON:  Jill, when you look at the Daniloff situation, that was in the Reagan administration in '86, at the end of the cold war. But we, listen, we can't forget, looming over all of this is the war in Ukraine, and, you know, the Americans, what America is doing in the west to help Ukraine, I wonder if that plays, if you feel this plays into that, how it --",

He tweeted, we've got some tough news out of Fort Campbell with early reports of a helicopter crash, and fatalities are expected. Now, unfortunately, these kinds of training accidents are pretty common. In fact, a congressional report from 2019 found that between 2006 and 2018, about 32 percent of active duty military deaths were a result of these kinds of accidents. And, in fact, just last month, a Blackhawk helicopter with the Tennessee National Guard crashed in Alabama and everyone on board was killed in that incident as well, Don.",

So, we're expecting that. But the fact that he was able to even do some work in his hospital rooms, which, by the way, are these five windows with the shutters down just behind me, when popes come to the Rome's Gemelli Hospital, that's where they stay. So, I would say a very encouraging report this morning from the Vatican. Of course, Pope Francis is 86 years old. He has a vulnerability to respiratory issues because when he was 21, he had part of his lung taken out due to a respiratory illness. So, obviously very important to monitor this moment with the pope, but I would say compared to yesterday, today, a bit of a sigh of relief that this update is indeed good. Kaitlan?",

We know the grand jury will meet today, but they're not going to hear evidence in the Trump hush money probe. Grand juries hear evidence about multiple cases. We also know that next week, they're expected to meet on Monday and Wednesday, as they usually do, but they are also not expected to her evidence on the Trump case. But I want to be cautious here. I mean, some outlets are reporting nothing is going to happen until the end of the month, but I don't think we should go that far. Because grand juries, this is a secretive procedure, this is also still a fluid situation. So, it's not expected that they'll hear anything on the Trump case next week, but we're going to continue to keep close to that and report it out, because we know that next Wednesday, they will start a previously scheduled break that spans across several religious holidays and school breaks. Now, that is something that was previously scheduled. But as I said, people are still going to speculate about what's going on behind the scenes. The former president really set a false expectation by saying he expected to be arrested last week, which was, as his own team said, not based on any facts.

This is exactly why we have called on Congress to create tougher fines and penalties and more authorities. There's bipartisan legislation that would do just that. And in the meantime, without waiting for Congress, we as a department has stepped up safety audits, taken other steps, so that we can hold railroad companies accountable.Now, the freight railroads often resist this kind of regulation and enforcement, but this is a big part of why we have far fewer derailments and accidents than we did 10, 20 or 40 years ago.
