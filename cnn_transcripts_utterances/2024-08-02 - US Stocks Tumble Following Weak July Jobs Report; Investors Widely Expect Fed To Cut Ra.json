Losses of up to 900 points at one stage, now clawed back somewhat still going to be very heavily off both NASDAQ and the S&amp;P and one, two, three, four, five -- oh there we go. One big one and several little ones. Trading is over for this day. These are the events: The disappointing Jobs Report that is fueling the anxieties and the market turbulence and tumbles. The accusation is the fed is moving too slowly. Evan Gershkovich and other prisoners are freed from Russia, now back with their families after the historic exchange. And a painting, one for the wall, you thought it was missing for centuries, spotted in the background of a photo on social media. The art historian who noticed it hiding in plain sight. We are live in New York, end of the week, Friday, August the 2nd. I am Richard Quest and whether it be Monday or Friday, here or there, I mean business. And a very good day to you. Wall Street has sold off for a second straight session and finished the week sharply down. Look at the numbers and I think it is important here, you see the Dow and the S&amp;P, sort of around even stevens, if you will, of around one-and-a- half, one-and-three quarters thereabout. The NASDAQ once again, bearing the brunt. It is the growth stocks that were down very sharply. The NASDAQ losing two-and-a-half percent. They got hammered. Now, the NASDAQ is from its all-time high, is pretty much at correction territory. The all-time high was less than a month ago and now we are just around ten, eleven percent off for the NASDAQ, which is a technical correction. It was the weekly jobs number, the weak Jobs Report that is fueling fears of a large slowdown, which could lead to a recession. The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month. That's far fewer than economists had expected. The revisions on previous months were also lower. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest it has been in nearly three years. It is the economy starting to feel the cumulative weight of higher interest rates. The monetary lag as it is known, it can take months for monetary policy to ripple through the economy. Just look each one of those bars, those lines represents an interest rate rise. Think of the monetary lag being nine months to 12 months, and you can see this ever-increasing, more powerful slowdown coming down the road. The last time the Fed raised rates was a year ago, which means the full effect of this medicine is taking hold now. Matt Egan is with me and that is really, Matt, what this is all about, isn't it? You know, it is not -- this is not a surprise. Have they tapped the brakes too hard? That is an interesting debating point, but this is the sine qua non, if you will, of what they were doing.",

It istoo soon though to say whether or not this is just a slowdown or something more severe. Let's look at the numbers from the Jobs Report. We saw that the unemployment rate unexpectedly went up to 4.3 percent. That's the highest level in almost three years -- 114,000 jobs added, that was a big miss. If you look at the trend, you can see hiring has clearly slowed down as recently as March, we were adding 300,000 jobs. Even in May, we are at 200,000. Now, as you can see, much closer to 100,000, still adding jobs, but not by enough given all of that supply of workers and that is why we've seen the unemployment rate start to creep higher. You can see, 4.3 percent still low, still much lower than during COVID, but moving in the wrong direction. Listen, one bad Jobs Report is not going to be enough to say that there is going to be a recession and Moody's Analytics, chief economist, Mark Zandi, he told me the odds still favor no recession -- Richard.",

Consumer sentiment, for example, it is a very important bellwether. It has eroded from the first quarter. You can see the numbers there. High prices chipping away at confidence. Factory orders is also -- particularly the factory gate, it can indicate where the economy is heading, manufacturing contracted in July for the fourth straight month. And there is little doubt the economy is slowing. The Fed is certain almost -- well, just about to cut rates. It is whether it is going to be hard -- 50 basis points or 25 basis points and whether or not it is going to have a technical recession on the way as well. Randall Kroszner is a former Fed governor, now a professor at University of Chicago Booth School joins me now live from Munich. All right, let's take this bit by bit.

So they didn't want to -- they want to take out that risk, so they were willing to take a little more of a risk of the snowball coming down and I think now what is going to happen is, later this year, people say, oh, the Fed was much too slow, but if they moved too quickly, then inflation could have come back up.",

Nasrallah talked about the possibility of a coordinated attack. And that's why you're seeing Israelis being urged to start to take preparations not to change their daily lives, per se. But for example, the municipality of Jerusalem has told people, make sure that your bomb shelter or your shelter rather is clean, it's prepared, that you can get to it within 90 seconds. And tellingly, they're also warning people to make sure that they have provisions or supplies that could last for several days if there were to be power outages, for example. So, the Sabbath here has just started. Nobody knows when this attack might take place. There hasn't been any clarity on a timeline. And while it's not panic stations, yet, it is definitely a tense waiting period. now, Richard.",
