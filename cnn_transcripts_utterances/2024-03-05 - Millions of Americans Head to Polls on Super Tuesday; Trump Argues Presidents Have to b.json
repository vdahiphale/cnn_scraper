      "sentences": "Good morning, everybody. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now, voting is underway in nearly all 16 Super Tuesday states of what effectively could be the beginning of the end of the 2024 presidential primaries. The American people will make their voices heard, and barring a major upset, the country will be one step closer to the prospect of former President Donald Trump being the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. For the GOP, more than one-third of the total nominating delegates are at stake. Trump maintains a commanding lead, on track to win more primaries and caucuses than any non-incumbent candidate in history. All of that raising the question, could this be the last stand for Nikki Haley, who clings to a single primary victory? CNN has correspondents coast-to-coast on what voters are saying as they head to the polls. CNN's Stephanie Elam is live in St. Ana, California, and CNN's Alayna Treene is live in Richmond, Virginia. Stephanie, I want to remind our viewers, brand-new show out on the West Coast starts at 7:00 A.M., please tune in, pardon me for putting in that plug, but there's also an election going on today, Stephanie. I saw Taylor Swift in the last several minutes has put out a statement encouraging people to vote in her state of Tennessee. What's standing out to you out in California right now?",

And what's happening here in this primary, there are three U.S. representatives and one Republican who are going after Senator Dianne Feinstein's seat, remember, she passed away in September. So, Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, Barbara Lee, all going for that position as well as Steve Garvey as well. He is best known for being a baseball player, played for the L.A. Dodgers and the San Diego Padres here. Adam Schiff, far and ahead, winning as far as money and support from his party as well. He's really hoping to make this about Democrats versus Republicans because, in November, what they do here, the top two people who win this primary vote today will go on to that main ballot in November. So, he's trying to make this contest about Democrats versus Republicans because in California, Democrats outweigh Republicans two to one here. So, that would ease his chances for likely winning come November. But that's what happens here is we see a few voters are making their way in here now, Jim.",

Now, we also know that, for Nikki Haley, this is one of few states where it's an open primary. That means Republicans, Democrats, independents. They can vote for whichever candidate they want.

That's what he's exposing to us right now, that he feels very threatened by Nikki Haley's peeling off 250,000 voters in Michigan. I mean, that's a sizable number that could really tank his general election. So, that's sort of how I see it. But you're right, the campaign and the White House is frustrated by this issue.

That said, look, I mean, I want Donald Trump to be afforded every legal opportunity to defend himself because it needs to be fair, but if he -- if the election happens and he wins before these trials take place, rest assured America, rest assured, he will demand the DOJ, he'll compel the DOJ to drop these cases.
