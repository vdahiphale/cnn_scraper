And today that man, the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, was cornered by the President of the United States and his fellow top congressional leaders at what is being called by the Senate majority leader of one of the most intense meetings he's ever been to in the Oval Office. We'll have more on that. Plus, it was the site of one of the most brutal atrocities of the Russian invasion. Bodies tied up and shot, rapes, mass killings. CNN's Christiane Amanpour returns to Bucha, Ukraine, two years later. Leading this hour, we are very close to learning whether President Biden has a major problem in a crucial battleground state. The final primary before Super Tuesday is underway in Michigan, and there is a movement against Biden within his own party over the ongoing war in Gaza. Joining us now from Waterford, Michigan, is CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez. Omar, what are you hearing on the ground from voters, especially any voters who are going to vote uncommitted to protest Biden's policy vis-a-vis Israel and Gaza?",

Biden voters, it seemed the economy and human decency in the White House was top of mind. And for some of those voters who, one in particular we spoke to who didn't exactly take the step to vote uncommitted but he voted for Marianne Williamson, who, of course, announced she was suspending earlier this month, but for the very reason that he did not agree with how President Biden was handling the Israel Hamas war. And this voter told us that he voted for Biden in 2020, but that this was too far and that the civilian death toll in Gaza was where he drew the line.Now, as we know, there is a major movement from the Listen to Michigan campaign as it's been put out to vote uncommitted again to protest that very same thing. And what's significant about here in Michigan is this state has the largest Arab American population of any state in the country, just under 150,000, which is significant because that's the margin that Joe Biden won the state back in 2020. Now, it spoke about the range that we've been hearing from, folks. Obviously, we're not expecting any surprises as far as who's going to win the primary on the Biden side or the Trump side of things. But those general election clues are what people are looking for. Take a listen to some voters that we spoke today about how they felt about Biden and Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm joined now by two member of the House who say they no longer are willing to wait for Speaker Johnson and they're trying to force a vote themselves through what's called a discharge petition. With us are Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Democratic Congressman Jared Golden from the great state of Maine.Congressman Golden, let me start with you. You're both pitching this pared down proposal for Ukraine aid, border security and Israel aid also, right? Forty-nine billion instead of 60 billion. And this move is a discharge petition. Just to explain very quickly, you need 218 votes to pass something on the floor of the House. In this case, you need 218 signatures even to force it onto the floor for a vote, even if the speaker opposes it. How many votes do -- how many signatures do you have on the discharge petition right now? REP. JARED GOLDEN (D-ME): Well, right now, I think I would actually leave it to Brian to answer that question because he submitted the discharge petition itself. But I think the answer is we don't necessarily have any because we haven't been back in session and we should be in session given the twin crises that Brian and I are trying to deal with, which is the crisis at our southern border and, of course, the crisis on the battlefield in Ukraine that we're trying to avert. So, you know, I think a key point here is the Democratic minority has often tried to use the discharge petition as a tool for trying to pressure, you know, the majority, no matter who is in the majority. And as a way to try and force things to the House floor, I've yet to see any members of the, you know, Republican majority sign any discharge petition. So what's significant about this is the fact that ours is led by a Republican, Brian Fitzpatrick, who's trying to do the right thing here out of an acknowledgment of the importance of these issues and how timely they are.",

And that is a major issue in today's Democratic primary in Michigan where there is a movement underway on the left to have Democratic voters go uncommitted, instead of for Biden. This would be a protest against Biden's refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire without conditions in Gaza. Let's bring in our political panel. We have with us Republican strategist Alice Stewart, Former National Coalition's Director for the 2020 Biden Harris Campaign, Ashley Allison, and CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein. Ron, let me just start with you. So after that tense meeting, House Speaker Johnson told reporters at the White House, he thinks that Congress, quote, \"must take care of America's needs first, before any agreement on Ukraine aid can get through\". America's needs, I guess defines the border.",

And just to reiterate, for those just joining us, a Republican and a Democrat have a pared- down aid bill $49 billion, aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan and aid to the border. It is more conservative than the bill that they were working on in the Senate because it has no humanitarian aid for Gaza. And it has the remain in Mexico policy at the border. But Fitzpatrick is saying it would be an open amendment process. So people, the will of the people could actually work its way. Now for some reason, that's not how our Congress functions. But in mymind, what's the problem with getting it out on the floor, having people vote for amendments, make it better make it -- make it a better bill, I don't care, but have something happen?",

Let's move something forward.But they are obstructionist. They want to campaign on the issue of the border. And then when Democrats said and gave great concessions to Ron's point on the immigration bill, they stopped it because they want it to be red meat to their base. They are not interested in governing. They are not interested in protecting democracy here or in Ukraine. And they are really playing gambling with this the stability of America's role in the world, and also our stability as a country. And it's unfortunate. And to my final point is, you know, Ron was said that it's a book into a 70 year. But that book and had a massive whiplash just about eight years ago. And that became because of Donald Trump, who is taking this party into a direction that doesn't want democracy.",

And Republicans could get what they want on each of these issues. And Democrats could also get what they want. But that doesn't happen in Washington anymore.And not only is it disingenuous in terms of getting things done, it's dangerous, because now we're having the crisis at the border. And we have the escalation of the crisis that we have asked in Israel and Ukraine.

And Johnson and many of the House Republicans anyway want more of a version of H.R.2, which is what they put forth, which they see as a better way to secure the border and limit the asylum process.But again, their desire to stick with H.R.2 or nothing gives us a situation where we have no progress at the border, and they're letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.

But both Israeli and Hamas officials are casting doubt on that. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:50:08] TAPPER: In our world lead, negotiators working on a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza and Israel are cautioning against President Biden's optimism that a deal could be reached by next Monday. And Israeli official tells CNN that Israel was surprised by Biden's timeline, while a Qatari official said that disagreements remain over how many Israeli hostages will be exchanged for how many Palestinian prisoners and whether Israeli troops will withdraw entirely from Gaza during the ceasefire. President Biden last night also outlined that idea that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has all been rejected. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And he basically told by the look, the majority of Americans are with me, and not with you.
