The school's Jewish Center for Jewish Student Life is named after him. And now, Mr. Kraft says he has lost confidence in the university.Coming up, his strong reaction to Columbia's handling of tents and at times harassing protests against Israel, prompting questions about the safety of Jewish students on campus. Plus, investigating how Hollywood production work ended up on Internet servers that belong to North Korea. Did someone at a U.S. studio unknowingly outsource animation work? CNN is following the trail. And leading this hour, opening statements and testimony from a key witness today in the unprecedented criminal trial against a former president of the United States, Donald Trump. The prosecution's main message, that Donald Trump and his allies were involved in a criminal conspiracy and cover-up. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse. Paula, how did the prosecution and the defense lay out their cases today before the jury?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, we heard dueling interpretations of events roughly eight years ago. Prosecutors said, look, this is election interference, plain and simple. They alleged that these payments to Stormy Daniels were part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.Then they walked through, step-by-step, how they allege Trump, Cohen, and the then-publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, worked to suppress negative stories. And then in the opening statement, they briefly referenced the paper trail that will be at the heart of this case. But when it was time for defense attorneys to get up, they insisted their client is innocent. They said, look, there is no crime here, because Trump wasn't involved in this kind of paperwork. He is not involved with things like the 34 documents that constitute each of the counts he is charged with here. Now, they also emphasized that nondisclosure agreements are not illegal. And interestingly, they took aim at Michael Cohen. That's very much expected. They went after his credibility. They suggested that this is someone who is, quote, \"obsessed with getting Trump.\" But it was surprising, Jake, that they also went after Stormy Daniels. Now, it's not a guarantee that she will testify in this case because her testimony is not essential to proving the charges that prosecutors have filed here. But it's clear the defense team expects her on the stand, which is part of why they decided to target her in these opening statements. And then the jury heard briefly from the first witness, David Pecker. It was pretty lighthearted testimony, questions about his age, his occupation, even got a few laughs. That will continue tomorrow. It's unlikely, though, either side will be laughing for long.",

So, the judge found that they can ask Trump about the recent civil fraud trial against the Trump Organization, Trump and some of his adult children.Then they also said they can ask about violations of the gag order in that case. They can also ask about the Eugene Carroll defamation cases, but they cannot ask about a totally separate line of inquiry, lawsuits related to a, quote, \"frivolous lawsuit\" that Trump filed against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. So that can't come in, but the rest of it can. So that's certainly not the way the Trump defense team hoped that would go. And it may give them pause about putting their client on the stand. But I'm not sure, Jake, in talking with my sources, it does appear this is something they're seriously considering, having Trump testify at some point in this trial.",

The complexity of this case, the way it's being charged right now, Jake, this is going to be something that the defense will seize on.

Is it really going to make a dent in Trump's bank account?A lot of issues here, but I think the most significant one for the judge to weigh is any impact of statements like that on the jury. Because we know that these people, they're doing their civic duty, but they are taking on a significant risk for themselves and their families. And if we get into a situation where those people continue to feel under increased threat or they are outed online, that is something that if they go through the alternates and start to get too fewer than 12 jurors, that could create a mistrial.
