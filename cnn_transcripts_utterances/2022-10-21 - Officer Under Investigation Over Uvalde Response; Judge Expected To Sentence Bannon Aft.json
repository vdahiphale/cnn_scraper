As a tactical team was ready to breach the classroom, they were ordered to stand by.CNN Shimon Prokupecz has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amid the chaos at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas where nearly 400 law enforcement responded to a deadly school shooting last May, CNN has learned commands by a high-ranking state police officer may have contributed to the broader failed response that day. While a gunman sat in a room full of dead, dying and traumatized children, new police radio transmissions obtained by CNN show Texas Department of Public Safety Captain Joe Betancourt given an order to stop police from entering the classroom. And one internal memo describes him before he arrives telling officers to stay away from the school and remain on the perimeter during the initial response to the shooting. Captain Betancourt was one of 91 DPS officers on scene in Uvalde. We are now learning he is one of the seven referred for further investigation over his actions. After lionizing the police response in the initial days, the Texas governor and state officials have pushed the blame for what has since been acknowledged as a failure on the local and school police. But CNN has now reviewed memos written just two days after the shooting. The detail actions by the DPS that allegedly went against protocol for mass shootings. [10:35:06] One lieutenant wrote, \"I heard someone shout out, Captain Betancourt said all DPS personnel need to be on perimeter. Do not enter the building. And a sergeant reported he knew this was clearly against established training. And so he entered the school anyway.\" By the time Betancourt says he arrived outside Robb Elementary, students and teachers had already been trapped for more than an hour.",

In an interview with investigators that has been detailed to CNN, Betancourt said he did not know there were any children in the building until after the breach. That's despite 911 calls from children inside the room. Betancourt says he was relying on information from Uvalde Sheriff Ruben Nolasco that the gunman was a barricaded subject and no longer an active shooter. And that a better SWAT team was on its way. He admits he never spoke to former school Police Chief Pete Arredondo who has been labeled the on-scene commander until after the shooter was killed. The memo referencing Betancourt's actions and another corroborating it are some of the clearest evidence that questions are being raised internally at the Department of Public Safety about the actions of its officers. His orders over the radio contradict the official narrative that the state police were never in command of the scene and never issued substantive orders. When questioned by CNN in September, DPS Director Colonel Steve McCraw confirmed the investigation into Betancourt and promised to resign if his agency was shown to have culpability for the botched response.

The latest twist that Bloomberg News is reporting that Biden officials are discussing whether the U.S. should subject Elon Musk ventures to national security reviews including this Twitter deal. Bloomberg says officials have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Musk-Russia friendly stance.Twitter shares plunged on this news. They have since pared back some of their losses only down around 4 percent. Now, we asked the White House about this and they're pushing back. National Security spokesperson told me that they don't know of any such conversations over a national security review here. And this is a big deal because this takeover is supposed to close in about a week. And the only way it falls through is if, one, the financing falls through which seems unlikely or, two, if regulators somehow block it. So we have to watch this closely. Meanwhile, if this deal does get through, Musk has signaled deep job cuts. The Washington Post is reporting that Musk has told investors he plans to get rid of almost 75 percent of Twitter's workforce. That would leave it with just the skeleton staff of around 2,000 people. Now the Post is citing corporate documents and people familiar with the company's deliberations. We haven't heard from either Twitter or Musk on this.

This means that buying the same home today costs much more than even just a few months ago. For example, if you bought a $390,000 home today and put 20 percent down, that same home cost an additional $700 more every month, and that is causing viruses set up this market.New data this week shows that sales of existing homes in September fell nearly 24 percent compared to last year and are down 1.5 percent compared to the previous month. So why are mortgage rates rising so much? Well, like many things in this economy, the answer lies with the Fed. As the Fed tries to cool inflation by slowing spending, it's been raising its key interest rate. That then impacts borrowing costs for us consumers, including mortgage rates. And in the housing market, we're absolutely seeing a slowdown in spending. Existing home sales have fallen for eight months in a row. But what about home prices? Well, supply is still tight, so prices have yet to slow in a meaningful way. Prices are still on average higher than they were a year ago, although slowing on a month-to-month basis. So what's the buyer to do in this market? I talked to Dottie Herman, she's a real estate pro with Douglas Elliman who said, if you can still afford to buy, you might have better luck negotiating with a seller.
