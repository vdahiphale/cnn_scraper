The expectation was closer to 2.3, 2.4 percent, so some of the largest contributors to the upside were things like net exports. So essentially, we Americans just didn't buy as much things from overseas, from outside of the US so that helped on the net exports front.Government spending was pretty strong at every level, federal, local state every level government spending was strong. Business investment, also positive, so not for things like structures or buildings, but other things like equipment, intellectual property, and consumer spending. Still positive, but slowing, not for, again, physical things, but services, hotels, restaurants, that sort of thing. But it's a consumer spending that economists are spending a lot of time looking at today. Not necessarily just that headline number but what's happening with consumer spending. Because that's two-thirds of the U.S. GDP and it continues to show more slowing. So Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's, he put it to me this way after the report. Essentially, the report showed fundamentally there's nothing really going on here to indicate that things are really improving at a fundamental level. He said we're basically just going sideways.",

So, mortgage rates, now topping 7 percent for the first time, really, on average in 20 years, since 2002. So, this is part of the reason why, by the way, and the GDP report, we saw housing construction, really collapse. This is part of the reason why right because mortgage rates continue to go up.Remember earlier this year at the start of this year, the average 30- year was closer to 3 percent. This time last year was actually closer to 2.7 percent. So, the Fed has said -- Jay Powell has said several times now he wants a more balanced the supply and demand of homes right now. So, this is part of the plan, right? The mortgage rates are going up because of the Fed. So, this is part of their plan, but prices are still higher so it's not happening soon enough.",

And it's interesting because just a few months ago, you had Democrats really touting him as a modern-day FDR, LBJ pushing all this legislation through, and now many that are up on the ballot are pushing away from some of this legislation because Republicans have effectively in many ways, viewed this as an entryway to inflation and how we got here. What can the president, what can Democrats do to turn that messaging around right now?ADRIENNE ELROD, FORMER SENIOR AIDE, BIDEN 2020 CAMPAIGN: Yes. Well, Bianna, I think it is a mistake that a lot of Democratic candidates on the campaign trail are not talking about some of the accomplishments -- as you lay down historic accomplishments by President Biden. Four major economic bills in the first 20 months of his presidency, two of those bipartisan, you know, those bills do everything from lower the prescription drug costs for American families to create clean -- create clean energy jobs, so why candidates are sort of backing away from this? I mean, I guess to an extent that they think that some of these bills effects inflation, that's one thing, but they don't. So I think it's incumbent upon Democrats, anybody who is running for office, the cycle, anyone who has a platform to talk about these accomplishments. Because again, when President Biden ran for office and won, he said that he wants to -- you know, he made all these promises, and he's actually kept those promises. So I think it's incumbent on candidates to talk about these things. But I also think the president is being very smart right now by helping you know, the overall cycle of Democrats to close on the economy. He -- I just wrote a really great piece on cnn.com where he talked about, you know, the record unemployment rate under his tenure, creating, you know, 700,000 manufacturing jobs, over 10 million jobs that he's created. So he is effectively closing on the economy because he understands that still with all the (INAUDIBLE) from abortion to democracy protection out there, that is still the issue that is going to ultimately be the driving force this election cycle.",

Their debate just a couple of days ago focused on crime.Olivia, let me come back to you and -- on the topic of crime. This break-in at the Katie Hobbs headquarters in Arizona. She called out specifically Kari Lake in her rhetoric and the rhetoric of her supporters. There's no evidence that there was a Lake supporter involved. There's been an arrest.

And so I can see, you know, the saying that Kari Lake has played a role in this, she certainly has. She's an election denier. She's one of the worst of the worst.And I'll say this. I think it was incredibly just sort of disgusting, honestly, to have Kari Lake out there as a candidate to say and kind of blowing it off and say, well -- making assumptions and making statements that would lead people to believe like perhaps this didn't happen. I think that undermines local law enforcement as well, who responded.

But to not give these families any information throughout all of this time, and for these families to be learning of any developments, largely from our reporting and Shimon's great reporting there and other reporting, do you think somebody should -- somebody should lose their job at this point, should Colonel McCraw lose his job?",

But I can say this, you know, people have to have confidence in your ability to lead. And that's been shaken. Now, I know, he certainly has been shaken the Uvalde. Whether or not that extends to Texas as a whole, I don't know. But I would think that it would give people you know, pause to think that this is the individual who's leading DPS, and should a similar situation occur, you know, will they get the same results?I mean, you know, accountability is something is very important to have. And right now, I -- you know, I just don't think you can trust what's going on within DPS right now. And that's just should not be me. He's still in denial saying there was no failure. Well, yes, 21 people killed. They didn't all die in the first couple of minutes like was normally the case in an active shooter situation. 77 minutes, standing around while kids are being slaughtered? If that's not failure, and I don't know how to define failure in Texas, but that is -- that doesn't fall within anything I've ever heard to be anything other than failure.",
