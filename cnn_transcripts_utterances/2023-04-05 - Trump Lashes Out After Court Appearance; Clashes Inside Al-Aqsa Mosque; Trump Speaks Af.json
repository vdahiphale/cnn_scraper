We're live in Jerusalem with the latest. And severe weather rips across the U.S. Midwest, bringing the threat of deadly tornadoes and widespread hail storms. A defiant and defensive Donald Trump spoke to a roomful of supporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence just hours after he became the first current or former U.S. president to be charged criminally. Then arrested and arraigned. Trump spent much of the speech in fact on Tuesday night, airing his grievances and making false claims. But he also lashed out at the justice system, the judge and the district attorney who he called a criminal. Trump began his day in New York where he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records in an historic and unprecedented court appearance. The former President heard the charges against him for the first time Tuesday. Prosecutors allege Trump sought to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election through a hush money scheme with payments to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with him. Now the indictment says for all 34 accounts, Trump had the \"intent to defraud and intend to commit another crime.\" Prosecutors alleged the unlawful plan to suppress negative information that would hurt his campaign, including an illegal payment of $130,000 to an adult film actress. Yes, I'm sure you're asking what comes next. Now, prosecutors say they expect to produce most of the discovery in the next 65 days. That's when Trump's team will learn whether details of this indictment. Trump's team has until early August then to file any motions and the prosecution must respond by mid-September. The next in-person hearing is set for December 4th. CNN's Kristen Holmes was there when Trump addressed his supporters in Florida. She has more now from Mar-a-Lago.",

He talks specifically about the Department of Justice's investigation into classified document handling at his Mar-a-Lago club.Now, he had a crowd here full of supporters, everyone here was a -- what I would say is a mega fan. You saw a members of bikers for Trump. Members of club 45, as well as supportive lawmakers, allies, advisors, family members as well. Now I am told that after he made those remarks, he went up to the patio where he often eats dinner at Mar-a- Lago. And during his time there they actually started playing the J6 song that he had recorded with the J6 choir who were men that had been incarcerated for their alleged actions on January 6. He did the Pledge of Allegiance the entire patio stood, and then he sit back down, sat back down and then continued eating dinner. Now I am told that he afterwards DJ'd with a laptop, something he is want to do when he is at his Mar-a-Lago club. So, clearly a very long day. He is now surrounded by some people who adore him the most. We obviously are just starting this process with this arraignment.

He walked very slowly down the center aisle, was scanning the aisles that were filled with reporters, but taking this walk very slowly.Added to kind of the weight of the moment and the anticipation in the room, you know, then he was at the defense table. It was actually off to a pretty quick start. Once the arraignment began, the judge asked him how he pled to those 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree of felony. And Trump said himself not guilty. You know, then they went on to deal with some other legal issues. The prosecution also raising some of these questions about Trump's rhetoric. The threats, the verbal attacks that he's made against the judge and against the district attorney, Alvin Bragg. Trump's lawyer saying that he's been frustrated because the D.A.'s witnesses, including Michael Cohen have been on television in print stories talking about the case. They said that Trump felt like he couldn't say anything. The judge said that the frustration did not justify these tweets. He asked everyone, both the prosecution witnesses and the former president to dial down their rhetoric, to not say anything that could be viewed as inciting violence or civil unrest. You know, interestingly, Trump was flanked by his legal team, including his new attorney Todd Blanche, who was added just yesterday to this legal team. But he had no family members in the courtroom. The only other associate with another attorney, although he's not working on this case. Boris Epshteyn, but someone who's worked with Trump and as a close advisor. Otherwise, he was flanked by the Secret Service too as he exited the courtroom. And it was only after he left that we were all allowed to leave the building.",

But Paula, to your point, 60 percent of Americans think that Trump should have been indicted.But if you look at Republicans. This is actually making them love him more. About 75 percent of Republicans want to see him back in the White House. And when he tweeted last week, that he was probably going to be arrested when he put that on social media channels, his holes went up, he actually eclipsed DeSantis.

It's something that the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg yesterday described as a historic step not only for Finland but before the Nordic Region and for the NATO alliance as a whole. But as anticipated, Moscow has not taken too kindly to this development saying that NATO is once again posing a threat to Russia security and national interest.

He said that last week, he had intensified talks with President Putin with a particular focus on the deployment of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons from Moscow to Belarus.And this is something that Alexander Lukashenko has been asking President Putin for for a while now. He claims that Belarus needs these weapons in order to defend itself from what he alleges to be with no evidence of an attempt by Ukraine's Western allies to launch a coup against him. And he has in particular called up Poland on this one. He alleges that those Western allies of Ukraine are attempting to invade Belarus. Again, baseless allegations through Polish territory.

Mark, really good to see you. And have you weigh in on this story. Now, China, of course objecting to this. It's a reflex, right? This is what they would normally do.

In fact, we heard from a French presidential source who gave some indication that this is not necessarily going to be a case of Emmanuel Macron pointing fingers at China saying, this is where you're wrong, this is where you've strayed away from peaceful potential with directing Russia, on China. Expect to see it to be perhaps a little bit more friendly or I mean, there's going to be a state dinner.So, by nature, perhaps, that will cool the tone the atmosphere and allow for some thoughtful discussions. We know that President Biden, we are now reporting President Biden and President Macron had a conversation about this. So, perhaps charm offensive is what's going to be at play. And then too, we have a lot of economic issues at stake between China and really all of Europe. Those are two big economies that really need a boost and are at a really pivotal time. So, sometimes economic interest also have an impact seeping into diplomacy. Paula.",
