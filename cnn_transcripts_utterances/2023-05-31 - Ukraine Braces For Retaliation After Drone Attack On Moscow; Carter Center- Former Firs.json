Ukraine has denied any involvement. This also follows an overnight bombardment on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, killing at least one person.Here is some new video just in to CNN. So you can see here missile debris falling from the sky nearly hitting a bus. Joining us now is the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. Good to have you with us this morning, Mr. Mayor. You know, we've been speaking with our correspondent Fred Pleitgen. I know you know -- you know Fred as well -- who is saying it's been a somewhat quiet night in Kyiv, the first in several nights. The Kremlin spokesperson has said that look, they're now trying -- that these drone attacks in Moscow are trying to provoke Russia. Ukraine has denied involvement. But basically, there's some reassessment happening on Russia's part. Are you concerned about what that could mean for your city? MAYOR VITALI KLITSCHKO, KYIV, UKRAINE (via Skype):  I am concerned because last week it was a terrible week. The last four days -- every day, Russia send rocket missiles to our hometown -- kamikaze drones -- and two people died and almost 20 people injured. And a couple of buildings -- apartment buildings were destroyed. And people spent many, many hours in shelters -- in safety place and right now, actually, people are nervous. But, thank you. You know, it was -- the attack was not successful for Russia because we should almost everyone -- the kamikaze drone air one missiles. But some part of rockets fall down and struck the buildings.",

But if you look overall, once you get beyond 65, that's when the likelihood of being diagnosed goes up. It's not inevitable by any means, but about one in 10 people over the age of 65 are ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer's-type dementia, for example. But as you can see there, as you get older than that then -- 75 to 84 -- it's a higher percentage. And then the highest, 85-plus. She's 95 years old. It sounds like she was doing pretty well until at least (INAUDIBLE) so I don't know how precipitous a decline this was. But age is the biggest risk factor overall, especially for Alzheimer's dementia. There are other things as well -- family history, race. If you've had poor heart health, which sounds like she did not. Traumatic brain injury in the past. Again, it sounds like she did not. But those can be risk factors.

I mean, one of the -- one of the first things -- and I say this as someone who is a -- who is a brain doc -- you do want to be certain of the diagnosis, and it can be challenging. But there are many things that can mimic dementia as well.People who have hearing loss, for example. Many times that is confused with the dementia diagnosis. It's not that they're not remembering things, it's that they didn't hear those things in the first place. It may sound very obvious but you want to rule out other things first. You also want to make sure someone stays in familiar surroundings. And you can look at the benefit of medications. There have been a couple of new medications that have been approved. For more than a decade, we went without new medications so that's kind of a pretty big deal. But there's also certain medications that people take that may be worsening their symptoms as well. So think about adding certain medications but also eliminating certain medications. I think in terms of the interactions that someone has with someone who has dementia now that the diagnosis has been confirmed and you're doing everything you can to try and slow down the progression, these are simple things. I wrote about this in my book. It comes from the Alzheimer's Association. But you've got to have patience. Don't interrupt. Try and ask yes or no questions more than anything else. And again, give visual cues -- things that keep someone in familiar surroundings. As soon as the surroundings become less familiar it's going to worsen, often, the symptoms that someone might be experiencing.",
