The real question now is what happened before, during, and after as part of a broader investigation that, as you mentioned, will involve American investigators as well as those from Singapore.And among the questions that these investigators will likely ask, one, what was the weather like? But they'll also talk to the pilots to find out exactly what they were doing at the time. It could also include flight attendants, passengers, also the individuals from Singapore Airlines who helped plan the route of this particular flight. You know, investigators will tell you it's not only about figuring what happened in this particular case, but also if any lessons can be learned from the future to prevent such widespread chaos from happening again. And chaos seems to be the appropriate term to describe what happened in the cabin. As you were hearing from that passenger, we're getting some more insight. We are told that the seatbelt light was turned on before all of this happened. As -- despite these -- you know these movements, a man, a 73-year-old man sadly passed away in this incident. We are told that CPR was performed for about 20 minutes. In addition, as we have seen, there are -- scores of people are still in the hospital with some very severe injuries. But for the passengers who were able to travel, a special flight was chartered by Singapore Airlines that brought them back this morning back to Singapore, Jim.",

So, the jury will now move forward without hearing directly from the former president. Joining me now lawyer and jury consultant, Linda Moreno. Linda, thank you so much for being with us. I guess, first of all, what would the jury make of in your view? I mean, I suppose it could be all over the place.

These jurors have been faithful and diligent and all the court observers have said they've been quite committed to their role. And that's a lot of pressure on a juror who sits in a drug trial or any kind of criminal trial, let alone a trial of this historic significance.So, I think they might welcome the break, quite frankly, to be with their families in some restorative kind of family setting. And don't forget, the holiday that they're going to be celebrating is Memorial Day, which is the day that we honor those who died to protect our country, our constitution, and those principles that are implicated in the very trial that Mr. Trump is in. They may be pondering that as well. And frankly, I think that the time break (INAUDIBLE) to the benefit of Mr. Trump, especially after the last witness with the drama and the disruption.",

That chancellor out of Shelby County, Tennessee, issuing a stay, essentially blocking the sale of Graceland temporarily.So, let me take a couple of steps back into what is happening in this bizarre legal case. And that is, according to a lawsuit filed by the heir of the king of rock 'n' roll, Riley Keough, the company behind this sale, Nausanny Investments, presented documents saying that Lisa Marie Presley, before she passed had taken out a loan with them of $3.8 million and used Graceland as collateral. Well, when she defaulted on that loan, the company says, that property belongs to us. We're allowed to foreclose on this and get our money back. Well, Riley Keough stating in court and in the lawsuits that the documents are fake. Her mother never agreed to this. She never used Graceland as collateral and that the company is fake. She's accusing the company of being fake. Well, the judge is specifically pointing in this under 10-minute hearing today to an issue of the notary. The person who signed off on this paperwork claiming that this is all legal, they filed a signed affidavit saying they never met Lisa Marie Presley. They never notarize any documents for her. The chancellor is saying that this brings into question the authenticity of Lisa Marie Presley signature. And stating that Graceland is a very unique property. It's important to the history of Tennessee and it would cause irreparable harm under Tennessee law for this estate to be sold. That chancellor saying he wants to wait for adequate discovery to come about for the merits of the case to be argued in court before a sale happens. And, Jim, also wanting to let you know that this estate, according to a Presley executive talking to the Rolling Stone back in 2020, is worth $400 to $500 million. And beyond that, behind the mansion is the final resting place of the king himself, Elvis, and other family members. So, that's an important and tricky detail and in this entire story.",
