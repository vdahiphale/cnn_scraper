And this is an interesting trajectory, just kind ofthis geometry of where that energy was lying as it just kind of raced along that fault line. And this is one of the most active seismic areas in the entire world. That`s because we`ve got a lot of tectonic plates moving around across this region, we`ve got a lot of rift zones, and this is illustrative of just how devastating these earthquakes can be. Now most of these earthquakes are not major earthquakes. But this one 7.8. It rivals one that occurred in northeastern Turkey in 1939. There were 16,000, 17,000 fatalities associated with that. It was at the same magnitude. This earthquake was shallow that means the effects are going to be felt much more severely than if it were much further down into the core of the earth. All right. Here are these tectonic plates I was talking about essentially these are constantly shifting. There are always earthquakes somewhere in this region being reported, but this one happened to be a major earthquake and devastating. This is devastating, one that will be in the record books. We`ll remember February 2023 for this massive violent earthquake that took place in south central Turkey that has interrupted so many people`s lives, but not just in Turkey, in Israel, in Jordan, in Syria where so many displaced people are currently located.

The results showed far more jobs added than expected and the unemployment ratefell to 3.4 percent, the lowest since May of 1969. With America adding more than half a million jobs last month, we`re getting more surprising clues about the overall state of the U.S. economy, and it comes as the country grapples with the impact and usefulness of new artificial intelligence platforms. Some worry that one day sooner than later a plethora of jobs could be taken away, from real humans and given to robots and computers that could presumably do the work faster, cheaper, et cetera. CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich sat down with an expert to discuss whether this threat is real or imagined.
