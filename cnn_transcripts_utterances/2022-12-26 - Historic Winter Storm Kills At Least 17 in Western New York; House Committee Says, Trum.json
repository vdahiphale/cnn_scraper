And I said, don't worry, man, I promise we won't leave you but we have got other motorists we have to attend to.So, I walked down to the other end of the tunnel and I think about probably 20 or 30 more motorists were at the other end. So, we scooped them up and organized a plan to come back, get all these people back to our firehouse. And we tried to get like a convoy back to the firehouse with pickup trucks in front and SUVs in back, piling everybody in vehicles. We got about probably 40 feet out of the tunnel because that was our safe haven at the time underneath the runway and we were stuck. So, I was at the back of the pack walking behind the vehicles to make sure we didn't lose any. Unfortunately, the first half made it back and we were stuck in the back, so it was time for an audible. So, again, Demetrice was pretty shaken up, and he said, just please don't leave us. I just told him, I said I'll never leave you. And at that time, it was time to get some resources to help us out. So, I requested from one of our local volunteer agencies, Hy-View Fire Department. They have an off-road vehicle, so we got a hold of them and they got to us. They said we'll be right over as fast as we can. About 45 minutes later, they were there. And we had to walk them back just so we could see. I mean, the visibility was zero. The drifts were four or five feet high at the time. So, we made it happen. We were just super fortunate to be able to help people and kind of make their Christmas.",

It's suspected that underwater main lines have ruptured.So, on Christmas Day, people had to line up to get water that was being delivered in a number of places within the city. Water pressure dropped, that meant the filtration plant suffered, as a result, a boil order in effect. You'll remember back in August after heavy rains, the system went into a partial collapse due to problems that they have. And these are systemic problems that are going back decades of neglect, of improper funding. There are a number of investigations under way. That budget bill that was just passed by Congress, I believe there's $600 million they're focusing on repairing the Jackson water system but the city believes it will take well over a billion dollars to do that.

This has been a four-year-long legal battle but we did learn some key information last week because Democrats did release two reports about their investigation into the IRS presidential auto system.And what we did learn is that the IRS did not audit President Donald Trump in 2017 or 2018. In fact, the IRS did not start auditing Trump until April 2019, the very same day that Chairman Neal asked for Trump's tax returns. Democrats also revealed how much or how little Trump actually paid in income tax while he was president in 2017. For example, he only paid $750 in income tax. And in 2020, he paid $0 in income tax. And, finally, Democrats also revealed this pattern that Trump had of generating huge net operating losses, carrying those forward for years, so that essentially he could zero out his tax liability. But there's still a lot more we could learn from those tax documents. The committee is just taking time to redact them. We should learn more about Trump's finances, how wealthy he is, how much he gave to charity.
