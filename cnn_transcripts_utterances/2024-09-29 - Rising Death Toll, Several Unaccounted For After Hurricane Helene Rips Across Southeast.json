I'm Kaitlan Collins in New York.And we start with breaking news this hour as the death toll from Hurricane Helene has now climbed to at least 93 people as officials are warning us that number is only expected to grow. The North Carolina governor I just spoke with him in the last hour. He says over a thousand people have filed reports that loved ones they're unable to reach them as of this moment. Several areas of his state are still in search and rescue mode. President Biden has been briefed by FEMA. He is planning to visit storm-ravaged areas later this week, we are told, and what he'll see is nothing short of devastating. Sides of mountains have collapsed, sliding down into towns overwhelming communities with mud and debris. Entire roads have crumbled, meaning that survivors have no way out and rescue crews no way in. CNN's Rafael Romo is live for us in Asheville, North Carolina. And Rafael, obviously, the question here of what this looks like, the biggest concern is for people's safety. And where do the rescue efforts stand right now from what you're hearing from officials?",

WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER: Yes, that would appear to be necessary. If that's the goal is to push them back 10 miles, yes, you're going to have to have ground forces in there. Really depends on how Israelis read the results of the airstrikes and their first moves that the ground forces. If they hit a lot of resistance, their objectives may be flexible, but I have to believe that the Israelis right now see nothing but weakness. Iran is weak. Iran doesn't want to intervene. Doesn't want a war. And so I think the Israelis are going to do to maximum damage they can right now to Hezbollah. And that means ground forces.",

Voters, these undecided voters don't like how Donald Trump talks but they do agree with him on many of the most important issues.They approve of Harris' approach of focusing on the future, but they question her on issues like this, whether she's strong enough and tough enough. So the rhetoric is not effective, but focusing on the issue is, and that's why there's still undecided voters. Because quite frankly, they don't want to vote for either candidate. What I tell people in speeches is the good news, I' m going to be done with all of this in less than 40 days. The bad news is that one of these candidates has to win. This is the frustration for undecided voters. They like the policies of one candidate and they prefer the persona of the other candidate.",

So, let's see what happens. The JD Vance campaign situation has been interesting. He's been in some weird situations. He is in like a donut shop or at a bakery goes, I'm JD Vance, I'm running for vice president and then like no one wants anything to do with him. So hopefully there's a little more charisma and Tim Walz will be moving his hands and going crazy. I'm not sure what he is doing. He's got a lot of -- he's got a lot of handwork going on.
