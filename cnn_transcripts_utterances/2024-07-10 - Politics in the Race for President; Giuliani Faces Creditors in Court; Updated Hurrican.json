Joining us now, former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh, and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. Thank you, gentlemen, for coming in this morning with us. Joe, I want you and Shermichael to listen to the first senator to go ahead and break with Joe Biden. And I know, as a Republican, Joe, you have been very vocal about not letting Donald Trump back into office. But listen to what the senator has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win the election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House. I think that we could lose the whole thing.

Look, from the very, very beginning Donald Trump hasn't had anything to prove in this campaign. Everybody knows who Trump is. Everybody knows what a horrible human being he is. We just have to decide if we want that back in the White House. But Joe Biden has always had one thing to prove. He's not too old. Well, he didn't do that nine, 10 days ago. In fact, he proved the exact opposite. So, right now, all we're talking about is Joe Biden's unfitness. If that continues, Sara, Donald Trump will win. If we talk about Donald Trump and how unfit he is, Trump will lose. But that's not the case right now with Biden in there.",

She's younger, and so that's certainly something that benefits her.And she's been on the campaign trail for a couple of months now talking about the reproductive issue.

Now, Trump has said he has nothing to do with Project '25, but it is made up of those several prominent former Trump administration officials. You see some of them there. Peter Navarro, for example, on that list. Here are some of the things that are said in Project 2025. And I want you to just go through this with me. First of all, it promotes - promises to eliminate a bunch of terms from all laws and federal regulations, including eliminating the terms for protected classes, including getting rid of the word \"sexual orientation,\" \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" \"gender equality,\" \"abortion,\" and \"reproductive rights.\" It labels the FBI as a \"bloated, arrogant, increasingly lawless organization,\" calling for it to be overhauled. Replacing federal civil servants jobs with political appointees. And calling for the elimination of the Department of Education. It cuts climate change research funding and eliminates the use of the abortion drug Mifepristone. I know that is a long list. We will try to keep it up for a bit. Shermichael, which of these things do not represent the platform for the Republicans and Donald Trump himself, because a lot of these things he has talked about in the past. SINGLETON: Yes. I mean, look, I think in many ways, Sara, it's almost like a wish list. I mean I'm very familiar with the Heritage Foundation. Every four years, when the parties select a nominee, the Heritage Foundation typically has a wish list of things that they would like to accomplish over the term of that Republican presidency. The reality is, it doesn't always happen. And I think one of the reasons why you see Trump attempting to pivot away from this is, one, they recognize that there's a sliver of potentially movable voters in some swing states where a lot of this does not register very well with them. They're keenly aware of that. And I know some voters are saying, well, look, I don't trust Donald Trump on this issue. But I can tell you, as a strategist, it will be suicide, Sara, to stick with positions that you know turn voters off. You have to accept reality and say, look, maybe this is what some guys may want to do. We cannot accomplish just because we need to not only win, but we need to govern effectively.",

If you read all of it, Sara, it's all about strengthening the president, giving the president control. Complete control over the Justice Department and the FBI. Most every aspect of the executive branch. It is utterly un-American. But, no, this isn't the Heritage Foundation. This is exactly what Donald Trump has promised that he wants.

The marshal drew his service weapon and fired several shots. Flowers was transported to the hospital for non-life- threatening injuries and faces charges for armed carjacking and other crimes.

That's the sign. F-em both. We got it blurred because it uses an expletive to display her feelings on the upcoming elections. She put it in her yard in Lakeland in January.

As you look at Beryl's track, as it formed in a part of the - the tropical Atlantic that normally doesn't produce these kinds of storms until September. So, Beryl thinks it's late August or September, even in early June, as it wound its way through the Caribbean, past Jamaica there, of course, up into the Houston area, and now is spinning wild weather in the heartland of the country here.

But these drugs are in shortage, and they're probably going to be in shortage for the next maybe couple of years even, amazingly.So, what they are, are basically taking these - these active ingredients that are FDA approved wholesalers, they're going to a compounding pharmacy and they're essentially mixing the drug themselves. And then they're taking that drug and they're basically making it available. They are not required to provide safety and efficacy data. So, it's really hard to know how effective those compounded drugs are. What I can tell you, what's really interesting. First of all, they're a lot cheaper. So, if the drugs cost $1,000 a month, that compounded version may cost $250 to $500 a month. It's not cheap, but still a lot cheaper. What is interesting, Kate. You know these pens.

I think around 79, 80 percent. But there's a lot of these prescriptions coming from online as well. So, I think the message here is, beware of the online prescriptions, number one.
