It seems that this may be just a case that Reuters got wind of it through Egypt Air and put it out and then everybody got spooked because they were thinking that possibly this pertained to direct knowledge of an imminent attack or retaliation. And needless to say, Richard, the entire region has been on a knife-edge just waiting to see when that retaliation might take place. It is interesting that nothing has happened eight days after the assassinations of both Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas and also Fouad Shukur of Hezbollah, but keep in mind, the last time Iran had telegraphed it was going to launch a major attack in mid-April, it was also almost two weeks after the attack on Revolutionary Guard Corps men at the Iranian consulate in Damascus. So, it is possible that we are in for a longer wait. It is also possible that the diplomats are making some progress, that there is some headway and that potentially if all parties could come together and agree on some kind of a ceasefire resolution, that may be this retaliation could be averted, but that is a lot of maybes -- Richard.",

One really telling thing that I found interesting, Richard, was a readout of a phone call between France's President Emmanuel Macron and Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, according to the readout of this call, Pezeshkian basically said, listen if you want to restore stability to the region, the number one thing you need to do is put pressure on Israel to accept a ceasefire. That is a slightly different tone or rhetoric than we have seen before, calls for an imminent and harsh punishment and maybe it is opening the door that if someone or some actors possibly and most probably the United States and others could push Israel to agree to some kind of ceasefire that again, as I said before, maybe could persuade Iran not to go ahead with this retaliation -- Richard.",

Now, the region's acting governor has declared a state of emergency. The Russian National Guard has beefed up its security to a nuclear plant roughly 50 kilometers from this shelling. A mayor of one of the towns just inside the border described the situation there as very tense. The town is home to a key natural gas transit there. Nick Paton Walsh is with me. Nick, when the Russians described this as gross provocation, major provocation, are they using a term of art that they are trying to signal somebody has crossed the line here, and therefore, we will do something that we weren't going to do before?",

So, no, Russia is deeply struggling inside Ukraine on multiple fronts to make the head way that it wants, so it is moving slowly forwards. The major and provocation line I think is a reflection of the Kremlin being caught off guard. A bid by Moscow, Vladimir Putin to sound like they are the ascendant power here, although quite clearly Ukrainian forces, although they have not confirmed this on the record themselves, moved in yesterday, and I've seen significant headlight towards a town called Sudzha. Now, we don't know the entire significance of this onslaught. It is going in multiple different directions. Video show clashes inside that city. You said the mayor there calling it very tense side. Evacuations possibly of thousands of people from the area around. This is probably the most trenchant move we have seen by Ukraine into Russia since the war began. There have been Russian citizens forming groups, doing various militant operations in border areas in the past, but if we believe what the Russians are saying, this seems to be Ukrainian regular troops, despite silence, complete silence from Kyiv before. Why here? Well, certainly it is a rare occasion of us talking about good headlines for Ukraine in this war. Certainly, it embarrasses the kremlin and there's also the possibility that a gas terminal on the border area there that gets gas from Russia to Ukraine, to Europe maybe now in Ukrainian hands, unclear, but many asking what the real goal here has been -- Richard.",
