China's got a growing nuclear portfolio. Speak to that and Japan's feeling on nuclear issues. RAHM EMANUEL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: Yes, well, I had visited that museum early in my tenure back in March of 2022. I've been there a number of times. It's a very powerful experience. It's a reminder to everybody the responsibilities that we have, especially as you have President Putin carelessly and cavalierly talking about the use of nuclear weapons. You have the threat from North Korea about a seventh detonation of a nuclear weapon, and China's rapid build-up. So the importance of dealing with the issues of not only the spread of nuclear weapons, even in the worst moments of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union make progress. And the President yesterday talked about the importance of getting back on track and nonproliferation and progress on containing and restricting on nuclear weapons, nuclear testing in that area. And I think there's no more powerful example than to have a conference on a summit, which is what the Prime Minister wanted right here in Hiroshima, given the consequences of actors like President Putin, and the head of the DPRK.

Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy says Ukrainian offensive units are still preparing ahead of their expected counteroffensive.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Russia has continued its aerial campaign against Ukraine with yet another intense wave of missile attacks including cruise missiles. Now the Ukrainians say that they shot down 29 of 30 missiles that came into their airspace so one appears to have got through but we've got no confirmation as to where that landed. The Russians claiming that they have destroyed an ammunition dump, no confirmation of that flow from the Ukrainians. One person was killed in Odesa, apparently by falling debris when one of these missiles was intercepted. But the overwhelming target was again Kyiv. At the same time, there's been continued fighting in the east of the country in the city of Bakhmut, where the Wagner mercenary organization is claiming that it is making progress in its terms in the house to house or building to building fighting in the very bloody battle in the interior of that city. But simultaneously with that, Ukrainians are saying that they are making gains in the northern southern flanks of that eastern city in what may in the end evolve into something that they could use or possibly exploit as part of a forthcoming ground offensive. But whilst the Ukrainian president continues to say that the offensive is imminent, there is no sign and no dates for where this may be conducted. Sam Kiley, CNN in southeastern Ukraine.

For these marchers, this is a celebration of when Israel took control of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 War, giving Jews access to their holy sites in the Old City. For Palestinians, it marks the beginning of the occupation of East Jerusalem. But in recent years, the march has also become more like a right-wing nationalist rally, and a pretext for violence between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians who make up most of the population in this part of the city. While most marchers were peaceful, some groups sing songs about getting revenge on Palestinians erasing their names. Others going even further chanting (INAUDIBLE) burn. They were emboldened by the presence of right wing government ministers like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who marched alongside them through the Old City into the Western Wall. Thousands of police showed how tense the situation was even before the marchers started. Using heavy handed tactics to clear the route, including on senior CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman. The marchers to targeted the press during rocks, bottles and cans at our position, forcing reporters to cower for cover. But Jerusalem day has seen much more serious violence than this. It was in 2021 as the thousands of Israelis made their way to the Old City but the Palestinian militant group Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem, setting off an 11-day war. Hamas and Islamic Jihad threatened the march again if any of their unnamed red lines were crossed. But this year, most of the drama stayed on the ground in clashes and scuffles and not rockets in the sky. Hadas Gold, CNN Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But many wonder which of his five children will take the reins one day. CNN's Melissa Bell takes a look at the family dynamic and why it bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain hit TV show.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CLIP FROM TV SERIES \"SUCCESSION\") MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A magnate and patriarch. (CLIP FROM TV SERIES \"SUCCESSION\") BELL (voice-over): Preparing his succession as carefully as he built his empire. Not Logan Roy but the real world's richest man. 74-year- old Bernard Arnault worth more than $230 billion having built the world's biggest luxury goods company, all the while very personally raising, educating and evaluating his five potential successors. BERNARD ARNAULT, CHAIRMAN/CEO, LVMH MOET HENNESSY: I think my group is controlled my own family. So instead of looking everyday at the stock market, I look for the next 10 years. BELL (voice-over): All five Arnault children work for their father. 48-year-old Delphine, the chair of Christian Dior, her brother, 45- year-old Antoine, who is CEO of the holding company of Christian Dior, and the three children from Arnault second marriage 31-year-old Alexandre, who's an executive vice president of Tiffany's, 28-year-old Frederic who runs TAG Heuer, and the youngest 24-year-old, Jean, the director of Development and Marketing at Louis Vuitton's Watches Division.

He has a fairly clear idea of their qualities and their weaknesses. And when the moment comes, we'll be able to choose. BELL (voice-over): The $500 billion dollar LVMH dominates the world of fashion, with some of its biggest names like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton. It was built through ruthless acquisition and like Waystar is diverse with vineyards, hotels, restaurants and newspapers. But it isn't a treatment of their children, that the fictional and real characters diverge far from fostering discord, Arnault ensured harmony, but with a cold eye on business nonetheless. The stakes are huge, the value of the company but also the power that it brings. Like Logan Roy, Bernard Arnault has cultivated his relationships with the powerful acquiring, a vast media empire, and making LVMH a symbol in France. Its headquarters stormed by protesters only last month. But while Arnault has sought to protect his children, he's also made it clear what he expects of them.",
