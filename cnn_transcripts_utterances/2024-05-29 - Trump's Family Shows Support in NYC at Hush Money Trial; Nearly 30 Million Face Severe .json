A live look at New York City, the town that is going to start deliberating Donald Trump's fate here later on this morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. The arguments have been made, and now it's time for 12 ordinary people from Manhattan to decide whether or not Donald Trump is a criminal, a decision that might shake up the race for president, or might not. It was a long and often tedious day for the jury on Wednesday. The defense went on for nearly three hours and the prosecution nearly five hours. Trump's attorney tearing into star witness Michael Cohen, telling jurors he's quote, \"the human embodiment of reasonable doubt, literally. He lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many, many times before you even met him. Have you guys heard of a GOAT? Like GOAT, the greatest of all time? Michael Cohen is the GLOAT. He is literally the Greatest Liar of All Time.\" The prosecution getting the last word, telling jurors, quote, \"We didn't choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn't pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer, because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf.\" The prosecution insisting the evidence against Donald Trump as, quite, \"literally overwhelming.\" But also it was what went on outside the courthouse that turned heads yesterday and underscored just how tense things are in this election year, and how explosive this verdict could be.

And I think the Biden campaign essentially admitted this yesterday. So if you want to break through, you want to reach, if Mohammed can't go to the mountain, the mountain must come to Mohammed. So there -- there you go. Right? And one of the other things, too, politically. This tells me -- it was the first scrappy move we've seen from the Biden campaign in a while. There was a pretty good piece, I believe, in \"The New York Times,\" really saying that the Biden -- a couple weeks ago, saying the Biden campaign is acting like it's winning, but it's not. This was one of the first acknowledgements that's like, you know, we need to do something a little different. We need to think through. We can't play all conservative with a small \"C.\" We have to be a little bit scrappy. This was one of those times. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I mean, I still -- I think when you look at at -- at a focus group like that, it's somewhat why you can still expect the Biden campaign to focus on abortion and democracy even more so, regardless of what happens what this trial, really. There also, even with the de Niro appearance yesterday, there is still really just a cautious approach when it comes to this trial or really any of the legal proceedings for Donald Trump. When it comes to the Biden campaign, they are very concerned, as well as other Democrats, about sort of pouring the fuel on the fire when it comes to Donald Trump's claims, false claims that Biden has sort of directed prosecutors to investigate Donald Trump. And they fear that sort of comments about the trial will sort of feed into that. I mean, and it's interesting. There was even caution, caution yesterday, with de Niro's appearance. He kind -- kind of went off- script when, at the end of those remarks, he said that, yes, he did believe that Donald Trump should go to jail. The Biden campaign, I think to your point, more so was looking for that sort of New York moment of that.",

The former first lady, there has been no sign of Melania standing by her man in public. Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka; her husband, Jared Kushner, who played key roles in the Trump White House, have not journeyed to Lower Manhattan for the trial either. Zolan, I can't say that this is surprising to me, the Melania not showing up, considering the topic at hand. Do you think it hurts Donald Trump in any way? Does it matter? KANNO-YOUNGS: Well, I mean, look, this is -- legally, this is to the jury at this point, so I'm not sure if it doesn't really matter. But politically, look, my colleague Katie Rogers wrote -- wrote about this dynamic a couple of months ago and wrote a book on first ladyship. And what she was saying is that Melania has always seen this as Donald Trump's -- this trial as Donald Trump's issue, not hers. That being said, it -- it obviously has made her angry at times, going back to January 2018 when reports of this hush money payment were -- were still being revealed. One thing that I think you should watch is will this impact the public support Melania Trump has for Donald Trump moving forward as the campaign rolls on? We've seen at times when there's been tension or disapproval that Melania has had signs of showing public disapproval of Donald Trump, going back to something completely different, but even with the border and wearing a shirt that it showed some disapproval. So you know, that could be something to see.

Parts of Texas, 95 mile-per-hour wind gusts in The Colony, Texas; 80 miles per hour for parts of Texas. And that has knocked out power still about half a million people in the dark this morning as power crews try to get that power back on. Here's a look at radar right now. We do have a couple of storms with some lighter showers and rumbles of thunder from Houston down towards Corpus Christi, nothing severe right now. But as we go into the afternoon, we might find an isolated storm and damaging winds and large hail. Not as destructive as it was yesterday, but we still have to keep an eye out for some storms to develop from Shreveport back down towards Houston.
