The monster Category 4 storm set to make landfall just south of Tallahassee, Florida at any moment. Nearly a million people are already without power across Florida and also Georgia.And the impacts, they are far reaching. This is new video tonight of rescues that are taking place in Fort Myers Beach in Southwest Florida. We've got local deputies using boats to rescue people who called for help. Streets there, turning into rivers. The warnings are dire. This is a catastrophic storm, packing winds around 140 miles per hour. And the storm surge, forecasters say will be unsurvivable 20 feet in some parts. Helene is one of the biggest storms to ever hit the Gulf Coast. It's about 400 miles wide, absolutely massive. And making matters even worse, all of this is happening in the dead of night. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is set to hold a press conference just a few moments from right now, and he has been urging people to evacuate all day. But now, the time is running out. We'll bring you his update live as soon as it begins. Our team of correspondents and meteorologists have been fanned out all along the storm's path all night long and are with us as we approach this historic landfall. John, we'll begin with you right in the bullseye there in Tallahassee. What's it like there right now?",

We'll come right back to you, John Berman, in the bullseye of the storm.Let's go right now to CNN correspondent Carlos Suarez in St. Petersburg, Florida just southwest of Tampa.

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Laura. So, we began the day out in Gulfport. That is about 20 minutes from where we are. But because of the storm surge there late this afternoon, anywhere between four to six feet of it, we had to find higher ground. And then from there, we tried to make our way back to Hillsborough, which is the Tampa area.But because several bridges have been closed because of the storm, we decided to stay put in St. Petersburg. And the flooding here is just as bad as it was over in Gulfport. If you can kind of make out where I'm at, because much of this neighborhood is without power, you can see just how much of the bay has pushed into this one street out here. The white stuff that you might be able to make out in some of this water here, some of this bay water, we believe to be a part of some Styrofoam, a part of a concrete dock that was broken in half that sits just behind me. But it's really difficult for you to make out just because, again, there is no power out here and it's really difficult to put a light considering the amount of flooding that is going on at that place there. Going into the storm, the concern from emergency officials in Pinellas County was the fact that even though the hurricane was going to track north and west of us, and so this area was not going to get a direct hit, the concern was that these low-lying areas would flood no matter what. We have pre-positioned in Pinellas County, the last 2 years in a row, to cover two other hurricanes. One hurricane was in two years ago. That hit to the south. And then last year, we were in Pinellas County to cover Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall to the north. And in both of those hurricanes, this part of Pinellas County flooded, and it flooded pretty bad. In fact, last year during Hurricane Idalia, which again stayed off the coast, stayed to the west, went to the north, did not have a direct impact on things out here, Laura, more than 1500 homes here in Pinellas County were damaged in the flooding.

That's when we started getting those strong gusts of wind. That's when we started seeing that storm surge just pushed all of this water from the bay onto this one neighborhood where we rely from. It's also where we saw the heaviest rainfall throughout the day. And so what John is experiencing is, obviously, a magnitude that we did not see here.But the fact that we were on the western, the eastern side of the storm rather, is because -- part of the reason why we saw some of the worst weather even though it was about 100 miles to the west of us.",

And what I mean by that is when the rainfall hits and then you've got the storm surge hitting, and then you add to that high tide, there's absolutely no where for this water to go. And, in fact, this does seem pretty high already. It's well a little bit below my knees here. But we're being told it's probably still got a couple more feet because high tide is around the top of the hour, and 1So even though the storm is all the way up by the panhandle several hours from where we are, we're still not only feeling the effects of the storm surge, which again is pushing all this water in, we're still seeing some of that rainfall, we're still seeing some of that strong wind, and yet we still have to deal with the fact that we have high tide, which is going to hit tonight, which is why we don't expect a lot of this flooding to recede until tomorrow morning when low tide comes in.",

Once the storm makes landfall south of here, it will really speed right over at Tallahassee.In Tallahassee, while there have been named storms that have passed over the last several decades, none that seem like they're going to be as strong as Hurricane Helene is, with sustained hurricane force winds over this city of some 200,000 people. This city has got the beautiful live oaks everywhere. And what they're most concerned about here in Tallahassee isn't the storm surge that's going to happen 25 miles south of here. They're concerned about the winds bringing the trees down, knocking power out, closing hundreds of roads, they're concerned, over the next day or so. And then, of course, there's the rain also. I mean, it has rained in parts of this county, eight inches already, and I don't think the worst of it is going to come down for the next hour or so. So, it's just so wet. The ground is so saturated.

And this is important because it effectively begins the process of taking away its energy source, which is the abundantly warm, record-breaking warm ocean water. So, this is going to stop its strengthening process, which it has been doing for several days and rapidly here within the past 24 hours, two different rapid intensification cycles before its final approach to land. So, we are just seeing what's happening and unfolding as this storm makes its imminent landfall in the Big Bend region, not only with the record-breaking storm surge coming out of Cedar Key, eclipsing Hurricane Idalia, that's happening as we speak, but there is this extreme wind warning. I want to talk about how important that is because the National Weather Service reserves that warning for only the most extreme events such as this. And they asked the residents who decided, Laura, not to actually evacuate, that they need to treat this -- where they're under this extreme wind warning, Taylor County, for instance -- treat this as if a tornado was barreling down at your house.",

And I think it's really important to note, too, if we do have viewers that are tuning in, in and around the eye or will receive the center of Hurricane Helene as she works her way inland, this storm will go calm for a period of time. This is the nature of hurricanes, especially when they're this powerful.And you may get curious, you may want to go check out your property, your business, your home. That is not the time to do it because what will happen on the backside of an eye will be a change in wind directions and winds just as fierce as what you were struck with on the northern side of the eyewall. So, I think it's really important that people understand that this extreme wind warning, the most intense part of Hurricane Helene right now, is not that time to go outside and check on your property. This is the time to bunker down and really just ride this storm out as best as possible. You know, Apalachicola here, I think we've been spared the worst, but we are really going to be thinking about the people to our east who are taking the brunt of this storm. And as a meteorologist here, I'm fearful what sunrise will bring for the Big Bend area and so many other locations that are being impacted by this. You know, there's no doubt in my mind, Laura, that this will be another billion-dollar disaster to write in the history books.",

Here, it made landfall about 10 miles southwest of Perry, which actually puts it east of Tallahassee and maybe on a path to skirt Tallahassee instead of going right over it, which might be a little bit of a relief for the people here. That said, this is a huge storm in terms of how wide it is. So, the hurricane force winds and the tropical storm force winds will spread over a huge part of the panhandle, the upper panhandle, and into Georgia.But this storm made landfall with 140-mile-per-hour winds. And it's moving very quickly, which means that it will maintain its hurricane force as it moves over Northern Florida and into Georgia, and that's where it will bring the trees down, the power lines, and create even more problems. The storm surge numbers that we are going to get from the Big Bend area in Florida, I can only imagine what they will be. If that storm made landfall with what they're saying, 140-mile-per-hour winds, it must have put so much water up into those areas. I suppose the only saving grace is there aren't too many people who live along the coast in the Big Bend area. Hopefully, most of them were able to get away. But now that the storm has made landfall, it's all about watching where it goes and the damage that it leaves behind. Perry, which is just 10 miles north of where it made landfall, already experienced Hurricane Debbie, which was a month ago. And then last year, I was driving, trying to get through Perry, Hurricane Idalia, and you couldn't get through because there was so much tree damage there. So, it's going to be very difficult for that town over the next several hours, Laura.",

And what we're experiencing right now is just an enormous amount of rain, an enormous amount of wind. And it was a very powerful storm --",

And here, I think we really spared the worst because we're about 50 miles to the west of where the most powerful part of major Hurricane Helene made landfall. They're in Taylor County, again, just to my east, and they're getting the brunt of the storm, the most intense part of the storm.Just to put it into context, give you a little bit of idea how powerful the storm was upon landfall. Hurricane Ian back in 2022 made landfall near Fort Myers Beach. We remember the devastation that came in there. COATES:  Uh-hmm. That came in at 941 millibars. Millibars, this is the central pressure of a hurricane. A lower number means a stronger hurricane. This storm came in onshore with a low pressure of 938 millibars. So, in essence, a stronger, more powerful, deeper, more intense hurricane than Ian actually was. So, I really do fear what the daylight will bring tomorrow morning, just seeing some of these nighttime shots on social media, you know, dimly lit photos of some of the devastation that we're seeing coming out of the coastline there. Steinhatchee, Perry, you know, it is going to be quite a sight tomorrow morning, and I'm concerned about the people who are enduring these very, very moments because we here in Apalachicola were spared. But, you know, right now, we've got this extreme wind warning, and this extends from Taylor County through Madison County northward into Georgia now. Valdosta under the extreme wind warning. I've talked about this quite a few times tonight, but it's important because these are only reserved for the most extreme moments of a storm of this magnitude. So, you know, the National Weather Service when they talk about these extreme wind warnings, they're asking residents who decided not to evacuate to treat this as if a tornado was approaching your house, and we know how damaging tornadoes can be. So, that is really the extent of what this storm is bringing to a vast, vast area here in the Big Bend of Florida and quickly racing inland as well. I think this part is extremely important as well for people to understand. This storm is moving at roughly 25 miles per hour inland. And yes, now it's on shore, effectively losing its energy source, which was the warm Gulf of Mexico waters. But now, it's going to move inland so quickly that before it even has time to collapse on itself, before it has time to really weaken, it's going to bring these hurricane force winds Category 2, Category 3, even up to Category 4 well inland. We're talking not 10 miles inland, not 50 miles inland, but several hundred miles inland. I mean, just as a meteorologist watching the hurricane alerts, the tropical storm warnings and hurricane warnings that extend as far north as Macon, Georgia, the southern metropolitan of Atlanta, Georgia, I can't even recall the last time that we saw those colors of warnings on the National Weather Service maps. So, it astounds me to see that. And take it from me, my family, who is bunkering down tonight in our home in Atlanta. We're taking this storm really seriously because that's the next chapter of this storm. As it moves inland, it's going to bring those powerful winds to large metropolitan areas. It's going to knock over trees. People need to be prepared to ride out several days without electricity. And then we talk about the unprecedented and historic nature of the flooding that is ongoing right now across the mountains of North Carolina, South Carolina.",

So, that hill is about probably 35 feet, um, up to the top of it. So, they -- they have an elevated place they can go when that surge started coming in. Um, so I'm sure most of those probably collected up at the community center or the city hall up at the top of the hill. But, yeah, I mean, there are structures and a lot of stuff there. They're going to be lucky to see if any of the structures are still there, especially someone closer out to the Dock Street. But that 117 number, that was the whole coastline coastal community. We've got another small coastal community called Yankeetown, which is on the south end of Levy County on the way to Withlacoochee River. That one is most mostly residential.
