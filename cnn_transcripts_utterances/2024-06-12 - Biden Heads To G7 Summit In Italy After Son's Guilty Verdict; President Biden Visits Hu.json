We'll look at the fallout for the first family and the Biden campaign.Plus, David Axelrod is here to talk to him about whether his party needs to do more to reach out to disaffected Republicans, especially with so many progressives turning away from Biden over the war in Gaza. And the rent is too damn high. The cost of housing is still soaring. And that's a big reason why so many Americans feel badly about the economy, despite Newsday that overall inflation is slowing down. I'm Mana Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. First up, we're tracking the fallout of the Hunter Biden guilty verdict. President Biden is on his way to the G7 summit in Italy this morning after a last-minute trip to Delaware, last night to huddle with his family. The president's son was found guilty on all three federal gun charges he was facing. CNN's Kevin Liptak is tracking it all from the White House. So, Kevin, the White House press secretary just addressed the issue of a possible commutation for Hunter Biden for the first time. What did she say?",

      "sentences": "Well, she didn't rule it out. She also didn't rule it in. And what Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One was that she hadn't spoken to this -- to the President about this idea of commuting Hunter Biden sentence. She did point out that sentencing hadn't happened yet. And she pointed back to the president's very definitive comment from last week, when he said that he had ruled out a presidential pardon for his son. So, this is still a question that I think is hanging over this verdict a day after it happened. You are seeing the Biden family starting to sort of pick themselves up from this very dark moment and return back to work. We just learned in the last hour that the First Lady Jill Biden, who had been attending this trial for the last week or so will resume her campaign travel beginning tomorrow to a number of battleground states.But you know, I think if you want to see what's in the president's head. If you want to get a sense of where his mind at the best place to look is those images from yesterday in Wilmington, Delaware. As the president was stepping off, Marine One greeting his son Hunter for the first time since that verdict was rendered with a smile, with a hug. This is really the strategy that the president has employed for so long. When it comes to his son's legal issues is to draw him close, not push him away really kind of banish the sense of shame or stigma. And that does, I think, speak to some of the anguish that the president has been feeling behind the scenes for his son's wellbeing, for his whole family's wellbeing. And now the president is on his way now to the G7 in Italy. He is joined on Air Force One by some of his granddaughters, those would be Hunter Biden's daughters. So certainly, that family dynamic, very much at close hand, even as the president continues his day-to-day job as president. This is quite a stacked summit. There are a lot for these leaders to address principally among them, the war in Ukraine. But of course, the looming potential return of President Trump to the G7 if you were to win in November, I think is at the back of everyone's mind as they gather there on the Italian coast. Manu?",

So, the politics of this, they also think while it may not move voters. They -- I have talked to several sources inside the campaign, inside of the Democratic Party, who think it is good politics or better politics for the president to be seen as a supportive father. To be there supporting his son, who has dealt with these issues of addiction, like so many Americans have dealt with issues of addiction. And that he will get credit in some voters' minds for showing up in that way. So, I think it is both personal. But also, of course, as you point out political.",

Donald Trump has been very public about that.And so, in some ways, I think the former president is a bit sympathetic toward Hunter Biden. However, that doesn't mean he's going to stop attacking Hunter Biden overall for what the Republican Party has really made a target to show that the Biden family is corrupt.

So, well, I think, you know, Miller statements will help rally the Republican base -- in the MAGA base who are with Trump anyhow.

I think that's why you're seeing the silence. While you're not hearing much on this because we know Donald Trump is going to continue to run on being a persecuted political opponent.

That is what we expect GOP leaders to do however.Majority Leader Steve Scalise said this morning, this was something that Republicans need to get off their docket. And I will tell you, I was talking to a number of Republicans across the ideological spectrum. After that last vote series, Marjorie Taylor Greene said that if Republicans vote against moving forward with this contempt resolution that they're going to have to explain themselves to GOP voters. I also talked to Anthony D'Esposito, who is a moderate Republican from a swing district who told me that he does plan to support it. So that gives you some indication that even people who have tuff reelections coming up in November. They are leaning to vote and support this bill, Manu, obviously, we'll be watching at 3:30.

That includes South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace. She overcame a primary challenge backed by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who of course she voted to depose. Some other big wins last night, Sam Brown secured the GOP nomination in the Nevada Senate race. And Trump sided with GOP leaders to support the army veteran in that marquee race. And in a ruby red district in Ohio, Republican Michael Rulli won a House special election, but he did far worse than Trump did in that same district four years ago. Democratic Strategist Simon Rosenberg tells POLITICO, quote, when the choice of MAGA and other alternatives are presented to voters, MAGA underperforms public polling. So, let's dig into that. Is that actually accurate? So, this is how what happened here last night in this Ohio special election. It's a red district -- a very red district. Trump won it by almost 30 points in 2020. Last night, the Republican candidate just 10 points. So, what does it tell us? One thing that it could tell us is, Trump does better with voters who vote infrequently than voters who vote frequently. This is what registered collar voters versus people who did not vote in 2020. Donald Trump, up -- in battleground states up six points among all registered voters up 17 points, among people who did not vote in 2020, meaning they're not voting so frequently.

McCarthy wanted her out. He also backed William Timmons, who is a -- this is an interesting race too, because right wing members of the House Freedom Caucus tried to oust Timmons. He said he was not conservative enough, but Trump copy on Timmons that he won, and also Trump won against Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor.

And that was a very interesting race because the GOP was really split and particularly people in Trump's orbit were very split about what to do there.

It was very embarrassing for Donald Trump. That's why you're seeing such -- so many fewer endorsements this cycle. They argue it's because he's preoccupied with his own election.
