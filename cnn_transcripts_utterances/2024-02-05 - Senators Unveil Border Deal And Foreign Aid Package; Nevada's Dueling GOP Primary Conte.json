It is 5And after months of talks, Senate negotiators finally released the text of a long-sought bipartisan border deal overnight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Senate has seen in years and years and years, and we cannot let politics get in the way of passing this legislation. I am proud leader McConnel and I, who disagree on many issues, have never worked so closely together on legislation as we did on this because we both realize the gravity of the situation.

The House Speaker, Mike Johnson, posting this. \"This bill is even worse than expected,\" and he called it \"dead on arrival\" in his chamber. But Republican Senate negotiator James Lankford told reporters Sunday that support will only grow not that the deal's text is public. Lankford says, quote, \"Some House Republicans texted me saying they are going through the bill and that makes -- this makes very real progress. So there's not unanimity. This is a member-driven body.\" Let's bring in Tia Mitchell. She is Washington correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Tia, good morning. It's always wonderful to have you. Let's talk about what's actually in this deal because there are some really very conservative policy changes that have been agreed to here. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot in the deal but I think the parts of the bill that were drafted to address concerns raised by conservatives are the parts that deal with how to seek asylum. Requirements about what kinds of asylum seekers would be welcomed at the border versus those who will be turned away. The same for just general migrants. The same for the number of which they can shut down the border after a certain amount of crossings happen on a given week. So this is a border measure. In the past, Republicans have complained that all of the conversation focused on immigration policy and not addressing the border itself -- the crossings at the border itself. This does that. This doesn't talk about pathways to citizenship. This is -- well, from -- in general, it doesn't. This is more focused on how to address the influx of migrants at the southern border. How to reduce the number of people and disincentivize those people who pass through multiple nations to arrive in America hoping to seek asylum. Again, this is something Republicans have asked for in the past but now that it's here, as you mentioned, there are a lot of Republicans who are saying it doesn't go far enough.",

I mean, the fact sheet that they're circulating making the argument that hey, conservatives should support this says right at the top there is no amnesty. That is, of course, what -- the word Republicans use to say people that are here already in this country illegally should be declared legal. That is something that was potentially on the table in previous immigration negotiations. It's not this time. Same with a path to citizenship. This really is focused on border security.But the reality is that former President Donald Trump has gotten involved here. This is going to have a key test vote in the Senate mid-week this week. It's going to need 60 votes to move forward. With the way that the former president is out there talking about this and considering he seems to be on track to win the nomination, is there a sense that there are going to be enough Republicans willing to defy the former president's wishes on this and actually move it forward in the Senate? Forget about even getting to the House?",

Lankford has invested so much in this process already.Tia, can we talk for a second about Ukraine and Israel aid because even if it does -- you know, they managed to bring it to the floor in the Senate. We have the House Speaker already saying it's dead there -- it's not going forward as it is. They came up with this convoluted set of policy priorities. They put them all together to try to cobble together a coalition to move all of these things through the House and the Senate. If, in fact, the border stuff is going nowhere, what are the options for people who support Ukraine funding going forward?",

Again, this was conservative Republicans who said we're not willing to discuss money for Ukraine and Israel without a discussion about addressing migration at the southern border. And it took months of negotiating but we finally got here.And now that some of those same Republicans are saying this immigration -- this southern -- this border security policy doesn't go far enough. So if they take it off the table, they're the ones that put it on the table to begin with, which takes us back to square one, Ukraine and Israel. Now, we know the House is ready to pass Ukraine's standalone funding but I think if it gets to the point where the support of Democrats is necessary -- and what we've seen recently is that the support of Democrats has been necessary for just about anything to pass in the House. So once you bring in Democrats saying we need to -- your support on this clean Israel funding bill, I think there's a chance that Ukraine funding does get added. Because there are plenty of House Republicans who support Ukraine funding. I don't necessarily think it's all. It may be just half, but that's enough to vote with Democrats to pass Ukraine funding if the bill is brought to the floor under suspension of the rules.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, basically, you could only participate as a candidate in the caucus or the primary. That's by the state GOP's own rules. They said if you want to participate in our nominating contest where delegates are, you cannot participate in the primary and vice versa. However, voters can participate in both.So, for example, one prominent voter, Gov. Joe Lombardo -- he's a Republican. He said he's going to caucus for Donald Trump and he's going to select none of the above in Nevada. So instead of having a write-in option, we have a \"none of these candidates.\" So there's a possibility that Nikki Haley, right, could lose to none of these candidates. I think what's ironic, and as you mentioned, I think the Trump campaign is realizing they could have participated in the primary and very well won. Nikki Haley has made no visits to Nevada. She's invested no resources. She went to a town in Iowa called Nevada but has never once come to Nevada. And so I think the reason that they had a caucus in the first place is that we know from reporting that the Trump campaign has been coordinating with state parties around the country to try to create a set of rules that are most favorable to them. And this is a Nevada state GOP that's deeply entwined with Donald Trump. You have the state party chairman who has hosted Trump at several rallies recently and has encouraged people to caucus for Trump. Has said we're going to win this caucus for Donald Trump. And so, you have a situation now in which, like you said, Trump, barring a political miracle by Ryan Binkley, who I think is the only other candidate left in the caucus, he's going to wrap this up and he's going to win the Nevada caucus. But it's going to create a confusing media narrative if Nikki Haley wins the primary ostensibly with more votes.",

JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning. You know, I think, self-deprecation usually brings big points for Haley.

Between that -- even her speech the night of the New Hampshire primary really just trying to get under his skin. And this is something that, frankly, usually works.
