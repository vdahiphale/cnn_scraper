Momentum in some key states, the new numbers out today showing Kamala Harris gaining ground while the Democratic ticket is trying to ride the wave of enthusiasm now into the Democratic Convention. And new overnight, the United States now sending a guided missile submarine to the Middle East as Israel braces for an attack by Iran that new reporting suggests could be large scale. And so long Paris, hello, Los Angeles. Wrapping up the Summer Games and laying out the red carpet now for its next stop in L.A. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. With the Democratic National Convention just a week away, can Donald Trump curb the Kamala Harris momentum? Can Harris keep it going? Key questions as new polling over the weekend finds a transformed 2024 race. Harris is now leading Trump among likely voters in three key battleground states, states that just weeks ago Trump was leading President Biden. In the coming days, we will see Biden make his first joint appearance with Harris since he dropped out of the race. We will also see Donald Trump do something he has not done in weeks, host a midweek rally. CNN's Isaac Dovere is leading us off. Isaac, Harris is sort of hunkering down today with her team after a cross-country blitz that we saw them go to many different important states. How are they going to keep this, or how are they planning to keep this momentum going? Because it certainly has shifted.",

And so the goal here is over the course of this week to tee up what will, they hope, be a strong Democratic convention next week to continue this momentum. She's got that event with Biden on Thursday where they're going to talk about lowering costs and really connect her both politically to Joe Biden, but also to what they feel or the successes of the administration in making the economic case to Americans that they can feel in their lives directly.But at the same time, the Harris folks are not getting ahead of themselves. Just yesterday, she was in San Francisco for a fundraiser, and she said about all these poll numbers that are coming out, she said, \"I've never been one to really believe in the polls, whether they're up or they're down. What we know is the stakes are so high and we can take nothing for granted in this moment.\" Of course, with all of this, most people believe that this election will, no matter what happens with the popular vote, come down to at most a couple of hundred thousand votes between a couple of states as it did in 2016 and in 2020. That may be enough to decide the Electoral College one way or the other.",

Now Iran has denying this, but they say that a high-ranking official, hackers broke into their accounts and took some emails and communications.This all came to light because \"Politico\" reported it had received emails including internal communications and a research dossier on J.D. Vance that the campaign had put together. The campaign saying these documents were obtained legally from our foreign -- from foreign sources hostile to the United States. And they are saying if you use them, then you are helping foreign adversaries. Again, as you said, John, though, back in 2016, Donald Trump was encouraging Russia and others to go after then candidate Clinton's emails, and he actually, during the race often talked about those emails even after it had been reported that they were the subject of a hack.",

Let me play this for you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I believe that Kamala Harris is whatever she says she is, but I believe, importantly, that President Trump is right that she's a chameleon. She pretends to be one thing in front of what audience, she pretends to be something different in front of another audience. Look Dana, she's not running a political campaign. She's running a movie. She only speaks to voters behind a teleprompter. Everything is scripted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are all things that are going to be very difficult to explain away to independent voters in a state like Pennsylvania, right? It was very clear where she was going with that policy flipflop. And I think right now, Kamala Harris could do the American people a huge benefit by actually sitting down and answering tough questions. She's obviously running from the fact that she inherited this ticket from Joe Biden. She's responsible for a lot of the disruption that we've seen here in America, 20 percent cumulative inflation, a porous southern border that's bringing fentanyl into the communities across the country. She has to answer for all of these issues because, as she's always said, she was the last person in that room with Joe Biden.",

Fold this idea in to also with the momentum we're seeing in the polling coming out from \"The New York Times\"-Siena College polling, showing the race is tight. There's no clear leader, but very clearly Kamala Harris has momentum in the polling, especially in battleground states. If she's not sitting for interviews, does that reflect that she is -- what do you think that reflects? Do you think this as, I know, Jesse has called it a sugar high is what he thinks he sees in the polling, but how do you see that playing here?",

So there's a lot of subtle sexism and nonsense within these kind of comments. She's the vice president. She was elected that if something happened to the president, she would step up. This is the reason why there's such support around it. And because of the supposed sugar high and the things that they say that are so concerning, as your own screen is indicating, she's up in the three battleground states.So the reality is they can continue to have their nonsensical answers, and we will continue to see that people will stand in support of Kamala Harris. If the election were today, she would be elected president. And so the comparison is that they will say she hasn't rolled out policies. Not true. When she was in Las Vegas, she talked about what happened around tips for workers. When we talk about the vision of it, it's the reason why she stood up when it comes to maternal health. They don't have a vision while she does. And they should also probably be concerned when J.D. Vance continues to talk. The other Vance being Chris Vance, the one who was the former chair Washington state who said Republicans with any conscience for the country would stand with Kamala Harris. If you actually want to do what's right, you have a vice president that is ready, who could probably protect her passwords, probably protect our national security, as opposed to the opposition who don't have a vision, don't have a policy, and don't have a platform.",

And the way they are doing that is by really increasing the number of assets that they have in the region right now, including as you mentioned, by signalling, that they are sending this guided missile submarine, this nuclear powered submarine to the region, something that is extremely rare for the Pentagon to actually announce.Usually, these submarines operate in relative secrecy. And so, to announce that this submarine, which is armed with dozens and dozens of cruise missiles, is going to be deployed to the region really is sending a very loud signal here to Tehran and its proxies that the US is prepared to act on behalf of the Israelis to defend the Israelis if Iran decides to launch an attack on Israel. And, in addition to that, the US has also announced that it is going to be speeding up the deployment of the USS Lincoln carrier to the region which is set to replace the carrier that is currently in the area, the Roosevelt. It has been operating elsewhere; now, it is going to move quicker to the region following this call that Secretary Austin had with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. All of these deployments were made public last night following that call in which Austin reiterated to the Israeli defense minister that the US is prepared to do whatever it takes to defend its ally. Now of course, this all comes as the region is bracing for this retaliation by Iran following the Israeli or presumed Israeli assassination of Hamas' most senior political leader in Tehran earlier this month. It has been really widely expected that Iran was going to retaliate somehow. Really, no one knows exactly when or how that is going to happen. But the Pentagon now, placing a number of very strategic assets in the region to try to calm tensions, but also of course, be prepared to help Israel respond if necessary -- John.",

We'd go around the country and try our best to inspire people over the course of a three-day training. And every now and then, we'd meet a participant who inspired us and there was this guy named Tim Walz at the training almost 20 years ago, who just was one of the most incredibly authentic people we'd ever met. Had a story just that they worked really, really well and came across really, really well. He was running in a district that we all knew he couldn't possibly win.
