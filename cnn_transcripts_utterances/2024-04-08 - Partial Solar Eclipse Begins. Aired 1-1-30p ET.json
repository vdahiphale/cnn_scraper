But they just say -- you know, for everybody asking, why is this a big deal, why do we care, why are we here, they just say, you can't -- it's hard to put it into words.

There is a hill about 20 kilometers from where we are. They have a big sculpture of Jesus Christ. It's the second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro. And they're also expecting a big crowd. And then there's a university. And the reason Torreon and this part of Mexico, in Central Mexico, is a good spot to see the eclipse, it's because it's a deserted area. And in a lot of places, there are no -- there is no urban pollution. There's no artificial lighting. So it's going to be really, really dark. So that is what's helping also the scientists track better the eclipse. So, you can see the families are getting together. So there are -- there's a lot of excitement here and for a region of the country that perhaps a lot of people don't know about. I have talked to scientists who said they have traveled the world to see other eclipse. They have come to Cancun or Baja California and to -- for different events. But they said this is the first time they get to experience real Mexico. This is not a tourist destination. It's an industrial agriculture area. So the people here, as you can see, are very excited to have people. We saw at the hotel, which was sold out months ago, two busloads of British people who were going to the university to be part of that experience there, so a lot of excitement, people ready.

And you look at all the people kind of looking up at the sky and checking the weather and hoping that the clouds are going to clear in time for their few moments of totality. As we watch this, I'm struck by this interview that I did recently with a member of the Navajo Nation. And we come out here,and part of our culture and what we do is, we like to come out here and get together, and we have race cars, and there's bands playing. And when totality happens, we're all going to go stand in the middle of the racetrack and look up And, who knows, there's probably going to be some cheering, some moments of silence. But as we watch what's happening in Mazatlan, Mexico, I'm starting to -- you feel that gravity of the moment almost. And the Navajo Nation, what they believe is that this is actually a very spiritual and sacred time. It's a moment when, instead of going outside onto a racetrack and looking up, you should actually go inside and meditate and pray. And it's just so fascinating how all these different cultures view a moment like this, a total solar eclipse. But the one real unifying factor here is the fact that, throughout millennia, throughout centuries, throughout all different cultures all around the world, whatever you think a solar eclipse is, whatever you believe, it's a moment when everybody does something, right? It's a moment when you stop what you're doing and you take note of this incredible celestial event that takes place. It will not take place here in Indianapolis for over 100 years. It's been over 800 years since we have gotten totality here.",

So there will be some really interesting things. We have also reached out to a number of zoos in the path of the total solar eclipse. So, throughout the day, we will be monitoring that and hopefully being able to capture and show you as much of this reaction as possible. And a lot of this is a little bit of crowdsourcing as well. Here at the zoo, they're giving people pieces of paper, so they can write down their observations and kind of feed that back into them, so they can capture and recording it. I mean, almost everybody's like a little bit of a journalist capturing this almost four minutes of totality here and what they might witness in the animal reaction. So, it'll be really fascinating to see. The partial eclipse has started. It has been cloudy throughout much of the morning, but there's been some nice breaks in the clouds here so far. Hopefully, that holds for the next hour-and-a-half or so, so that people can get a good, clear view. And we will monitor what this little fellow thinks -- not little fellow. He is a tall fellow.
