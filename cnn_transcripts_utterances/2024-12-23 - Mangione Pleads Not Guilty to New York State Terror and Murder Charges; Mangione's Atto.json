      "sentences": "And good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York. Jim has the morning off.We are following two breaking stories at this hour. Moments ago, Luigi Mangione pleading not guilty to the charges against him in New York State, the key piece of evidence helping prosecutors build their case. And CNN has obtained a final draft of the ethics report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz, more details of the allegations involving drug use and sex with a minor and the response from Gaetz this morning. But right now, Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has just left a New York courtroom after his arraignment on state murder and terror charges. He faces 11 counts in New York, including one for first-degree murder and two on second-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Now, if found guilty of the top charge, Mangione could get life in prison without parole, but he also faces a federal murder charge, which means that the death penalty is on the table if he is convicted. CNN's Kara Scannell just got out of the court. We're going to get to her, but we also want to bring in CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller and CNN Legal Analyst and Criminal Defense Attorney Joey Jackson. Welcome to you all. But, Kara, let me start with you. Walk us through what happened in court today.",

      "sentences": "So, Luigi Mangione came into the courtroom wearing shackles. He had them around his waist. His hands were cuffed. His ankles were cuffed. He was escorted arm and arm by two plainclothes officers.Now, the hearing itself took all of just about 20 minutes. He very quickly off the bat entered a plea of not guilty to these charges. But his lawyer wanted to make a few points. His attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, pointed out the perp walk on Thursday, where Mangione arrived by helicopter on the pier, was escorted down the pier, followed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. As she put it, Mangione, she said, is treated like a human ping by two warring jurisdictions because of the federal charges that were announced that day that had thrown up in the air the plans for Mangione to be arraigned on the state charges on Thursday. That was now postponed until today. Now, she also took issue with New York Mayor Eric Adams attending that perp walk and giving a press conference saying that he should know something about the presumption of innocence since he is indicted on federal bribery charges and is due to go to trial early next year. Now, the hearing itself was pretty brief, but in a first in about a decade, we were -- the media were allowed to record the hearing and it will be able to be broadcast. That has not occurred, according to some folks that I've talked to in the court system, since the Dominique Strauss-Kahn was indicted and charged with sexual assault. Those charges were ultimately dropped. But that has not occurred for a long time. So, we will be able to see Mangione being escorted into the courtroom and seated there with his lawyers. Now, there wasn't much else discussed at this hearing. There was an issue about these warring jurisdictions and exactly who would have custody of Mangione because, for now, he's in federal custody held at the federal jail in Brooklyn, New York. The judge saying who has primary custody of this defendant. One of the prosecutors said that they believe that the state does because the prosecutors last week had -- the federal prosecutors last week said that the state case would be expected to go first. So, the judge saying, well, then he thought that Mangione should be in state custody. But, ultimately, there seemed to be no one really knew what the answer was. And the judge telling the prosecutors they needed to work this out with the federal prosecutors and figure out who should be housing Mangione. As for now, he was going back into custody, and, for now, it seems potentially returning to federal custody, but this is up in the air right now of exactly where he is going to be. But I don't think you can hear it or see it, but there are a number of people here saying, free Luigi, with signs up and supporting him. And interestingly in the courtroom, there are about 30-ish members of the public who were allowed in the courtroom. More than about two dozen of them were female, young females. No one made a sound in the courtroom. The court officers very affirm that they wanted order in the courtroom, no use of phones or any other devices by members of the public. So, there were no visible statements or reactions inside the courtroom. But we did see pretty full line of people here to see Mangione make his first appearance in state court, where he entered that plea of not guilty. Rahel?",

Lots of people had lots to say about it. I'm curious what you think about whether that has the potential to backfire against prosecutors and perhaps make Mangione sort of fuel this belief by some that he is some sort of folk hero. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "It's a really interesting question, because when you look at the overwhelming show of force around that perp walk, you know, Mangione looks somewhat small and quite captured. On the other hand there is this countervailing force of his extreme popularity among people on the internet, among fans who show up in court, among people who put things into his commissary fund when he was in the jail in Pennsylvania. So, these are two forces that are playing against each other.As far as the perp walk goes, if you get down to the rules, the NYPD policy is that the department neither encourages nor discourages the photographing of defendants in public areas. That is just kind of the rule as written. The idea that there was this massive crowd behind him, the FBI showed up to claim custody of the prisoner, the mayor showed up to make the statement that, you know, you can run but you can't hide when you commit an assassination on the streets of New York City. So, there was a lot to this perp walk in terms of symbolism and meaning, and we're going to see that footage many times in the future.",

And, Joey, I actually want to ask you, you know, we heard from Kara's reporting there the concerns from Mangione's defense attorney about his ability to get a fair trial, she also pointed out the fans that are outside of the courthouse. I mean, does his defense attorney have a point that with the publicity that we've seen thus far, that will obviously continue, it's going to be a challenge. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "So, Rahel, this is a very unique circumstance and certainly defense counsel wants to ensure that their client is tried in a court of law and not in a court of public opinion. But it's a unique circumstance in as much as you don't have a public who is scouring him and scorning him and saying, we can't wait, right, until you're convicted. We have in this instance, Rahel, a public who seems to be saying that he's a saint, seems to be saying that what he did was justified, seems to be connecting with him, free Luigi, St. Luigi. So, it's kind of different. And it's different in as much as certainly you want to preserve and protect your client's right from a defense attorney. This might be a rare instance where you have the prosecutor saying, can we get a fair trial?And so as the case proceeds and we look forward and we see social media blowing up with stories about the healthcare industry and how they're unfair and they're greedy and they favor profits over people, right, the dynamic as we get a jury at some point in the future, should this go to trial, to see whether that jury could be fair and impartial and could really met out this case on the facts and the merits, not in their political positions in terms of what they believe about the healthcare system in America. So, it's a really a dynamic unlike one, Rahel, that we haven't seen in the longest of times, if ever.",

So, she's asking for immediate discovery. She says that her client is being treated like a ping pong between the different courts and that she has concerns about him getting a fair trial. And she pointed out as one reason that the perp walk that was, in her words, highly choreographed with lots of law enforcement, but also lots of press. Your reaction?",

      "timeStamp": "10:15:00",
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "So, in terms of immediate discovery, I think that's very important. We don't play hide the ball in New York State, nor should any state. The fact is is that if there's information, if there's evidence, it should be turned over to the defendant and the counsel immediately so that it could be reviewed, evaluated, scrutinized, and so that he can begin to get a fair trial.On the issue of being a human ping pong ball, also a very important point to be made, I think what they were doing, not as a matter of justification, but observation, is that law enforcement was sending a message that, hey, if there is a crime that's committed allegedly by you, by him, that we will go out, we will look for you, we will get you, we will bring you to justice. What that justice will be is an open question, because, yes, he deserves the presumption of innocence and certainly a fair trial. However, last point, and that is, this is a very unique circumstance. In this particular case, it looks like he has very much gravitated in the public, gravitated towards him. Usually, as defense attorneys, you're concerned that your client gets a fair trial. You don't want pretrial publicity to take away detracting from that. Here, you have people who are saying, he is a saint. He is a person who did something that we believe in that should be done. As crazy as it is for me to be saying that, this is what I'm listening to, this is what we're all listening to on social media. So, to that extent, where you have the public that's really for him, it begs the question of whether what does a fair trial look like? Does it look like a trial that inures to the benefit of the prosecutors, or does it look like a trial that inures to his benefit? And that, at this point, it seems that the defense has the upper hand with respect to public perception and people justifying and saying this murder was appropriate because of a healthcare industry that doesn't respect the public, that denies claims, and that is out of touch and out of step with what people are looking for. And that is adequate quality healthcare that they deserve, right, we all deserve. And so we'll see how it plays out.",

I mean, on the one hand, it seems sort of logistical in terms of how they plan to physically hand over some of the discovery, some of the evidence. But on the other hand, I'm curious sort of what you think about his point about just how much evidence they have in their possession, especially you think about the notebook that was found in Mangione's possession with his own writings about the event, about the alleged event. I mean, what are your thoughts?",

      "timeStamp": "10:20:03",

      "sentences": "So, what happens, Rahel, is that in New York State, you have to file a certificate of compliance. What that means in English is that the discovery laws were changed recently to provide all discovery. It's open file discovery. Everything you have in your arsenal, if you're a prosecutor, has to be presented. That could be challenging and that could take some time.It's not unique, right, where you can have the data transferred technologically, right, whether it's on a portal or any other type of device. But, yes, in this instance, it'll be as the prosecutor noted, voluminous. There's a lot there. But it should be turned over and it should be turned over forthwith. And so, you know, once that happens, ultimately, the state, once everything is provided, will file that certificate saying, we're ready. The reason that's important, Rahel, is that there'll be various motions that are made. I'm assuming that the defense will make motions to preclude certain evidence from the jury on various grounds. The judge will have to make rulings on that. And it's only after that process occurs that the case can then go for trial. But that'll happen, I think, in the ensuing weeks. And I think the prosecutors may ask for extensions of time because there's so much information to gather and to provide.",

I mean, one how rare is it for the prosecution to have, in their own words, this voluminous amount of evidence, at least for now, creating some sort of practical complications in terms of getting it over to the defense.

Prosecutors are always required to turn over evidence that may come up at trial, evidence that may be helpful to the defense, things that are exculpatory that may be helpful to their client. But in this case, they have to turn over everything that ever came into this case, rvery tip they got on another name, every other suspect they looked at. And the voluminous part is going to be all the hundreds of hours of -- thousands of hours of videotape that they collected in the process of this investigation. So, it's a lot.The real trick here is going to be, are they going to be able to enforce that level of discovery on the federal government, which doesn't necessarily fall under this New York State requirement.",
