      "sentences": "These are live pictures of Bourbon Street, which has now reopened in New Orleans. Some foot traffic, maybe not as much as normal, but a lot of people flocking back to the area about 36 hours after the New Year's Day attack there, after 14 innocent pedestrians lost their lives. Before the reopening, city and community leaders performed a second line, and they placed 14 yellow roses at different spots along Bourbon Street to remember the victims.With us now is Democratic Congressman Troy Carter of Louisiana. I will tell you, that is something, Congressman, that you will only see in New Orleans, a scene like that. But I also want to ask you, you received a briefing from the FBI this morning. We did see this press conference, but as a member of Congress, you received an FBI briefing as a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. Can you share anything with us? REP. TROY CARTER (D-LA): Yes, thank you, Brianna, and thank you for giving the level of attention to this horrific act. We had a briefing this morning for the entire congressional membership. We were delighted to find out that this individual apparently did, in fact, act alone, that it appears from all evidence that's been collected that there were no co-conspirators, which gives us a great sense of relief that there's not some other actors that are out there that may still be up to nefarious acts. This gives us an opportunity to at least close this chapter of this particular villain, coward, and move forward into providing the kind of sense of security for our citizens and residents as we prepare and build on what we've learned from this breach.",

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: As the congressional Republicans, we here in the House and the Senate, have repeatedly asked the DHS under the Biden administration about the correlation, the obvious concern about terrorism and the wide open border. The idea that dangerous people were coming here and in groves and setting up potentially terrorist cells around the country, we have been ringing the alarms. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you are well aware, Congressman, it reopened here about an hour or so ago.I do want to ask you, though, just back to what we were talking about, which is that you have President-elect Trump and Speaker Johnson talking about open borders in some sort of proximity to what happened in New Orleans when we need to be very clear that this suspect was an American citizen born in the U.S., an Army veteran from Texas.

This is an attack on our democracy. This is an attack on our freedoms. This person was radicalized, but it was an American citizen, a citizen of Texas and someone who was honorably discharged from the United States Army.Now we should not play games with the American people to try and imply that it was something that it wasn't or to somehow suggest that this was a Democrat or Republican issue. We have to be more mature and more direct and fair and honest with the American people. This is not the time to play political brinksmanship or gamesmanship. This is a time that we should be united as Americans to push back against terrorism, push back against terrorist threats, and to demonstrate to the American people that we will use every resource that we have to combat these kind of hateful and heinous acts. No time for political games or trickery to suggest somehow that one party or the other may be responsible. The families of the loved ones who have died and those who are in the hospital fighting for their lives and our law enforcement agents from the federal, local, and state deserve better. And I would call on all of our leadership to stand firm and recognizing that we are Americans and we are better than this.",

They've also placed heavy trucks in the way of that opening on the street. It's going to get a little messy right here, Brianna, but we wanted to show you this. As our photographer Manny and I walk this direction, this barricade was not up during the attack, and you can see that has now been put in place. They wanted to make sure this was here as well.And then there's 14 flowers that were placed right here to remember the victims of this attack. But take a listen to the police chief who I had a chance to walk with and talk about some of these new security measures that they put in place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And those are the changes you'll see. (END VIDEO CLIP) YOUNG (on camera): And something else they've already done is they've added these metal barriers right here because they wanted to make sure that if a car tried to get up on the sidewalk, it would not make it. But, of course, there's going to be a lot of concern about these barriers. There are supposed to be repairs put in place for that as well because they want to make sure those are upgraded before the Super Bowl. We know the Super Bowl's head of security was here as well today. They talked about the plan moving forward. But they want to make sure all these steps are put in place for a long-term security plan so something like this can never happen again.

But notably, both men at the center of these incidents have served in the military. The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Trump Hotel in Vegas was actually an active-duty elite special forces soldier, a Green Beret, with the Army's 10th Special Forces Group.The 42-year-old Texas man identified as the suspect in the Bourbon Street attack was an Army veteran. With us now is Casey Jordan, who is a criminologist and behavioral analyst. We notice this. I think a lot of people have. They both have military backgrounds. There are also significant differences in their military service. There are also so many people with military service who would never think about doing something like this, who would never become radicalized. What do you read into this?",

Right now we're focusing on the military service, but it really doesn't have anything to do with the attacks.The one thing that the men really have in common is clearly their lives were decompensating. Our New Orleans attacker had a lot of financial woes, a lot of family problems, had posted in just the hours before he went with his truck into Bourbon Street the idea that he had wanted to gather his family together and kill all of them, but then changed his mind at the last minute. We know less about our Las Vegas bomber, but we did just find out in recent hours that he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The one thing they have in common, Brianna, is they were decompensating, and both decided to take their lives. But interestingly enough, and in entirely different ways, send a message while they were doing it. The messages have nothing to do with one another, though.",

But in the years following that, the two divorces, three children, custody issues, you know, lots of payments due, failed businesses.His military identity was in the past, and he had no new identity to really absorb and validate his worth in this world. And that leaves people open to seeking solutions and comfort, if you will, validation, and if you will, rabbit-holing sometimes, into something that makes them feel like they belong and can be successful. By his own admission, he only really changed his name and, you know, kind of got radicalized. He said before summer is when he really joined the ISIS mentality. Other than that flag on his hitch, there really is nothing to suggest that this was a terrorist attack. It was more of a man suffering from severe mental health problems, we would guess, who decided to take his own life and take out as many people as he could along the way. I really think that the ISIS flag was an afterthought. It's kind of amazing that it wasn't a family annihilation because that was his original intent.",
