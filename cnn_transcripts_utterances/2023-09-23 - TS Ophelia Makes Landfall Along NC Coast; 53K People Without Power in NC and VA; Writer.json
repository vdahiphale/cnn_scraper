Now we just got the latest update at the top of the hour. Winds now dropping back down to 65 mile per hour but they're still gusting up to 85 miles per hour. So you still have those wind gusts that would be hurricane force equivalent. The sustained winds still at tropical storm force.Now again, the storm itself moving to the north at 13 miles per hour. You've got a lot of rain bands, even rain bands as far away as New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. But the focus of the real heavy rain is still going to be across North Carolina and Virginia for much of the morning. We also have that tornado warning just to the west of Elizabeth City there and we will likely see some more tornado warnings pop up as we go throughout the rest of the day. There's also the potential for damaging winds and even some large hail with some of these storms. Now, as the track continues to move off to the north, it's eventually going to start to veer back towards the east and out over the open Atlantic as we wrap up this weekend. But in the time between, you're still looking at very heavy rain bands that will spread from North Carolina and Virginia today, more so into places like Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia by the time we get to the evening and then tomorrow, the focus really becomes the Northeast. Places like New York, even as far away as Boston, likely to pick up some rain showers. Flooding is going to be a big concern. You already have the James River in Virginia, the location at Jamestown already at major flood stage. Now we're headed towards low tide, so that number should drop back down into only minor flood stage over the next few hours. But by 6:00 o'clock this evening, tonight, when high tide returns, that number is expected to go back up into major flood stage, and that water will flow over into the roadways and unfortunately, likely maybe into some homes and businesses. That's not the only case or location where we have the potential for some flooding. You can see that spread out over Virginia, North Carolina, even into places like New Jersey and Delaware.

Now, they issued that guidance on Friday as we saw many House Republicans leaving Washington with no clear plan in place. So the White House Office of Management and Budget issued guidance to federal agencies, effectively telling them to get ready their plans and procedures if a potential shutdown were to happen, what they call mandatory, but standard practice. When we get to about seven days ahead of that shutdown guideline, when we know that his deadline, which we know that is September 30.So that includes things like how many employees would have to be furloughed. Wwhat employees would be deemed essential, and therefore have to work through the shutdown. Now, we know that was happening on the White House side. But on the Capitol Hill side, we know that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the House Rules Committee were preparing a set of individual long term spending bills that Kevin McCarthy would want to put on the House floor by Saturday, hoping that they would garner enough GOP votes to pass. That work is continuing throughout the weekend, but there are some problems with that. First of all, we don't even know if those long term spending, those leaner than what we expected, would actually get enough votes to pass on the House side. But we do know that they have basically no Democratic support. Take a listen to the White House really describe their reaction to Kevin McCarthy's plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Now, the question for House Republicans is very simple. Do they continue to pursue increasingly extreme bills that would hurt their constituents by slashing education, slashing health care, Meals on Wheels and much more? Or do they keep their promise and abide by the bipartisan agreement two thirds? Two thirds of House Republicans voted for this bipartisan agreement just four months ago, back in May.

That is a market increase from late May when there were about 3,500 daily encounters. Those are numbers that held for much of the summer. But this latest surge is causing strain on federal resources and fueling concern within the administration.Now, Homeland Security officials are monitoring the situation. They can't quite say what exactly led to this surge, but they do cite economic conditions in Latin America as well as the climate crisis as drivers of migration. Now, the administration took steps this week to try to alleviate some of the burden along the U.S.-Mexico border and in communities, including, for example, sending 800 new active duty military personnel to serve in a supporting role. That is something that they have done before, as well as adding capacity to border facilities. Those facilities are ill equipped to care for people long term, but this is to build out capacity so that they can at least accommodate those who are arriving to process them through. And the officials also said that they are continuing to conduct deportation flights. But all of this really underscored and the images underscored the immense humanitarian, political and logistical challenge for the administration as they face unprecedented mass migration across the Western Hemisphere. Now, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will be visiting the border today, where he will be joining the President of Honduras. The two will be in the Rio Grande Valley, another area of the border that has been seeing an increase in border crossings. And they're expected to talk about cooperating to try to stem the flow of irregular migration and how the two can work together, along with partners to address what is an immense challenge across the Western Hemisphere.

And in this hypothetical matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Joe Biden wins New Hampshire pretty handily, 52 percent to 40 percent. 8 percent are unsure.Remember, Biden did beat Trump three years ago in New Hampshire. So this may be a blue leaning battleground state, but if you look at the results here by party, I think this is interesting. Trump actually is beating Biden among independents by six percentage points. So why is Biden leading the state? Well, take a look. He's at near universal support among Democrats. 94 percent support him, whereas Donald Trump is only at 79 percent support among his own. Republicans that is helping Joe Biden get over the hump there. But both of these guys are widely unpopular in the Granite State. 56 percent of New Hampshire voters tell us they would feel negatively if Joe Biden was elected President. 62 percent worse tell us they would feel negatively if Donald Trump was elected President. And it's the same story with their overall favorability numbers. Joe Biden's upside down, 35 percent favorable, 53 percent unfavorable, a net negative of 18 points. But Donald Trump is even more unpopular in New Hampshire. 30 percent favorable, 62 percent unfavorable, a net negative of 32 points. Overall, Joe Biden's approval rating in New Hampshire is well above what it is on the national scene. 46 percent of New Hampshire voters approve of the job he's doing. Nationally, he's hovering around 39 40 percent, so this is friendlier turf for him. I should also note in the Democratic primary, Joe Biden's crushing it. 78 percent of likely Democratic primary voters are with Joe Biden, and only 9 percent for Kennedy Jr. 6 percent for Williamson. And remember, Joe Biden is trying to change the order of the primaries. He wants South Carolina to go first. If New Hampshire ignores that and they go ahead, they may be penalized, and therefore Joe Biden may not appear on the ballot. But 69 percent of primary Democratic voters tell us they would still write in Joe Biden, so that would not be much concern. We also tested Kamala Harris's standing in New Hampshire. Among likely Democratic primary voters, you see here about two thirds of them, or 63 percent if you add these together, are enthusiastic or satisfied with Harris as Biden's running mate. But a quarter of likely Democratic primary voters, 26 percent, are either dissatisfied, satisfied or angry with Harris as the running mate. As for her overall standing of popularity in the state of New Hampshire, with the broader electorate, she's underwater like her boss 23 percent favorable rating, 54 percent unfavorable. And about a quarter of New Hampshire voters are either neutral or unsure. David Chalian, CNN, Washington.",

We know on the political side, as here we are a few months from getting into a very important election year, that government shutdowns don't play well with the electorate and we can often have a debate about who is responsible for a government shutdown. Both sides can be intransigent, but in this case, it is a certain portion of the Republican Party that is telling everybody we're the reason there's going to be a government shutdown.Luckily, there's some saner heads prevailing in the Senate and if they can get the process moving, of course, constitutionally it's got to begin in the House.
