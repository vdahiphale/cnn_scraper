The parents were called to schools earlier in that morning to see a math worksheet, and I think we have that. It shows drawings that Ethan was making two hours before the mass shooting, a stick figure, blood, bullets, the world is dead, my life is useless, blood everywhere.Prosecutors really honed in on that James should have taken his son out of school right then and there. Maybe he had to do DoorDash. Put him in the car with you and do DoorDash. He also drove by his house four times doing DoorDash before the shooting, never went to check on the gun. Another piece, very important evidence, will be when the parents were called to the substation shortly after the mass shooting. They go into that interview. They are talking a lot. James Crumbley talks just all the time. If he doesn't testify, this will be such important evidence for the prosecution and the defense. For prosecutors, James Crumbley said, I hid the gun in the armoire in our bedroom, under some clothes, and the bullets were hid under jeans. There's no mentioned of a lock on that gun at all. But the defense also can focus in on the fact that James Crumbley was talking about that he was trying to teach his son gun-safety. That's what he said in that room. Listen to how the defense cross-examined that video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Delta has invested a lot in this, also United and other major U.S. airlines. Hard to say about LATAM, but it is something that airlines are really, really concerned about, especially with climate change and global warming. Things get hotter, the surface gets hotter, rising currents of air can cause turbulence as well. So even the United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has warned that we may see more and more weather-related delays because of climate change, although he's not really specifically commented on turbulence incidents, although it's something the industry, industry wide is concerned about, that turbulence could be a more prevalent thing with climate change, John.",

So look, Americans have been warning for some time now that an incursion militarily into Rafah they would only support if there was a credible plan to evacuate the 1 million plus Palestinian civilians who are sheltering there with, frankly, no other safe place to go. And frankly, American officials had cautioned that they don't even believe that that kind of a plan is realistic or even possible. Israel, though, has long said that it would go ahead.And despite the fact that President Biden in an interview with MSNBC on Saturday said that an Israeli invasion into Rafah would be his red line, well, it didn't seem to matter much to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who in an interview yesterday indicated that he would go ahead with that military incursion. And perhaps that's because Biden never actually set out what the possible consequences would be of crossing that red line. In fact, Biden went on to give some comfort to Israel, saying that, look, he would never leave Israel on its own, he would never cut off all weapons to Israel, the Iron Dome, things like that. And so clearly not much of a threat to Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister also addressed Biden's criticism that he was doing more to hurt Israel than to help it, insisting that most Israelis are behind him. Now in terms of any kind of ceasefire talks, hostage talks, I'll let you listen to the prime minister himself, but things do not look good. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So imagine this, President Biden and his allies are having to go around the Israeli government, which is meant to be a critical ally, in order to either air drop or send a maritime aid convoy to the Gaza coast. This is extraordinary. This is usually what happens between hostile states in a terrible situation like this. So that's one thing. Israeli former prime minister Ehud Barak has told me, and he's written a major article in \"Foreign Affairs,\" is that the most urgent thing now is to get the hostages back. He says it may not be the most important because defeating Hamas is very important. But the most urgent thing is to get the hostages back. And he says that Netanyahu thumbing his nose at President Biden is bad for Israel, obviously bad for the Israeli-U.S. relationship upon which Israel depends for its survival, and that there must be, says Barak, elections to get rid of a historically unpopular government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.

AMANPOURAnd it's not just the production that Russia has ramped up. It's the firing of shells according to this CNN reporting that Russia appears to be firing some 10,000 shells a day. Ukraine only two because it's having to ration. And this is directly linked to what the Congress has done, which is to block any further military support to Ukraine while the E.U. is desperately trying to fill the gap, at least financially. So it's really tragic. And this was brought up even at the Oscars.
