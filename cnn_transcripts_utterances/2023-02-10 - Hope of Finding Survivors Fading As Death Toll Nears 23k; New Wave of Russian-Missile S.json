And now, a Russian blogger who, you've got to take with a pinch of salt, has said that the Russians have suffered significant losses there. It appears that the town is still under a great deal of fighting, of course, but the control has been overall maintained by the Ukrainians in much of these areas, digging in with what appears to be an increased assault on their positions, particularly in the east and the northeast in recent weeks. But that video they are showing their dramatic losses, those armored vehicles at a standstill, almost being picked off by Ukrainian forces. This -- Ukrainians have been saying that the Russians have taken severe losses, but there have been also losses of course, in the Ukrainian side, and they say in certain areas, they are running low on ammunition. Again, the renewed calls from President Zelenskyy, asking for arms and ammunition, for it to be brought into the country more quickly and for more advanced weapon systems to come in, in the face of that potential Spring offensive that everyone is anticipating in and around or beyond the first anniversary of this conflict.

Of course, that anniversary is on the 24th of February, you are seeing John Kirby there who is addressing the media, we are listening to what he is saying. Of course, as soon as we have more details, we will bring that to you. But from what we understand, that President Joe Biden will visit Poland from February the 20th to the 22nd. So, that's not this week, it's next week from what I understand. The White House has said that he would meet Poland's President Duda while he's there, and other leaders from the region. And he will deliver remarks ahead of that -- of that anniversary, official anniversary on February 24th, when of course, Russia invaded Ukraine. As we've been hearing of course, from our correspondent, McKenzie, we are hearing that Russians are preparing for an offensive. And so it's an important time of course, to get allies together, and it's something we've seen of course, with President Zelenskyy as he visits the U.K., but also Brussels, we'll stay on top of the story for you. Now, Israeli police are investigating a deadly attack in east Jerusalem, calling it terrorism. They say a Palestinian man rammed his car into a group of people waiting at a bus stop, killing two including a six-year-old child. Police say the attacker was shot dead at the scene.

And on the scene, killed was a six-year-old boy as well as a 20-year-old man. At least, five others were injured, including another child who was reportedly, critically injured. And according to Israeli police, an off- duty police officer from video they have released shot the man while he was still in the car. Police have identified him as a 30 or 31-year-old man from east Jerusalem, from a Palestinian neighborhood in east Jerusalem. As you noted, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately calling for the man's home to be sealed and demolished. Although, we are hearing just in the last few minutes from the man's family, one of my producers speaking with the man's uncle who actually says that the man was released from hospital just about a day ago. It's not clear for what, but that could of course play into what happened here. Regardless though, Israeli officials as you've noted are calling this a terror attack. And the National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for roadblocks to be set up in the man's neighborhood. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ITAMAR BEN-GIVR, MINISTER, NATIONAL SECURITY (through translator): I instructed the police to set up roadblocks around Isawiya and stop one by one, and to simply check every vehicle. I wanted to do a full closure, but there is a legal question about it and we will discuss it.

We're not even fully into the second month of the year, and already it's been one of the deadliest periods in sometime.

And the President told Mrs. Alkonis, we're going to get this done. I wonder if you can tell us if the Alkonis case figured in the conversation that the President had with the Japanese Prime Minister when he visited here last month and if you can flesh out the President's promise to Mrs. Alkonis.

Now, what we know was that it's a size -- it was roughly the size of a small car, flying over 40,000 feet. So very different from the balloon, of course, the U.S. shot down, if you remember, last Saturday, that was hovering around 5 65,000 feet, and it was shot down over a sparsely populated area.
