The timing has to be right. He was talking about, can you believe, it is 500 days into this war. President Zelenskyy, a more conciliatory tone that we are hearing coming through today. He thanks the people of America and he says you're spending the money on saving Ukrainian lives, that it is very vital.

Across the continent, stifling heat is giving way to torrential rain, swollen rivers and mudslides. In northern India, dozens of people have been killed in raging floodwaters. Bridges, cars and homes crushed in Hamatru Pradesh (ph). Roads flooded and washed away; survivors left to pick through the wreckage. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  There was so much rain and flooding, it was hard to evacuate our families to a safe place because this area was inundated with water.

The U.S.consumer price growth sliding to its lowest level in more than two years. Those inflation numbers are making a splash on Wall Street and on the European stock markets, as you can see. We are firmly in the green. But what will the Fed make of it?

      "sentences": "Yes, I think if you're sitting at the Fed right now, you're thinking, this is good but not goodenough. But it does show yet another month of cooling, as you pointed out; the 12 consecutive month of annual inflation cooling on a monthly basis. Prices increased 0.2 percent; on an annual basis, prices increased 3 percent. The index increased 3 percent. I want to put this in perspective and we can talk about the concept. If you look at the last few years this line chart of CPI, you can see a year ago exactly, the June report of 2022 is the peak there. That is 9.1 percent. So part of what we are seeing in this 3 percent figure, Eleni, is the base effect. So we are coming off a really high level from a year ago, so the price increases appear to be marginally smaller. Nonetheless, moving in the right direction. We also got some help on the monthly basis from price declines in areas like airline tickets. Those declined; furniture, used cars, all of those declined. On the flip side, almost all of the increase in monthly inflation, Eleni, was shelter or accommodations for our international viewers; 70 percent of this increase was shelter. So still some work there. But one thing that seems to be unfolding, this has to be great news for Americans watching this and for people at home, at least the American audience, is that we are now starting to see a trend unfold, where wages are actually outpacing inflation. And Eleni, as you know, this is something that we have not been able to say and it has been a real serious part of this inflation story, which is that even folks who received pay rises, they were actually going home with less. Or they felt like they were going home with less because of the price increases. So that is really something for at least the American audience to celebrate. But it is investors as well, as you said, making a splash on Wall Street and around the world. And economists, that's said, when the Fed meets in exactly two weeks from now, when we hear from Jay Powell in exactly two weeks what do we expect? Well, we have heard from Fed officials as recently as this week. Before the CPI report but as recently as this week, that they are still planning to raise rates, because we are still a ways away from 2 percent, which is their target.",
