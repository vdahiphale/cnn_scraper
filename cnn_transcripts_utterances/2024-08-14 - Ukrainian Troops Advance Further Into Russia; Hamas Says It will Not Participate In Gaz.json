Coming up, Ukrainiantroops claim more ground inside of Russia after a surprise cross-border attack that has Moscow scrambling to respond. Then Hamas says it will not participate in high-stakes ceasefire talks in Doha this week as the U.S. and its allies press for a deal. Plus, are Americans getting sick of alcohol? A new study suggests they might be. We will have those details for you. Well, Moscow says potential peace talks are on a long pause as Ukraine looks to push even further into Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine wants to expand its buffer zone. Officials in Kyiv say this will keep towns in northern Ukraine safer. Take a look at these images coming into us. Ukrainian truck carrying blind- folded men in Russian military uniforms away from Kursk and towards Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 100 Russian servicemen have been captured. Well, in the air, Russia says it destroyed more than 100 Ukrainian drones overnight, adding that 37 of them as well as four missiles were destroyed over the Kursk region. Well, CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is following the developments and joins us now from Berlin. Good to have you with us, Fred. So, Ukraine has conducted what it says is its biggest attack on Russian airfields since this war began. Just explain for us what you're learning about this drone strike, and how much damage there's been.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, the Ukrainians said there was damage that was caused. They believethat there were several hangers that were hit, possibly also some aircraft that were hit as well. But I think one of the things that Ukraine has definitely wanted to point out, Lynda, is how complex of an operation this is, because it wasn't just the biggest strike on Russian airfields. It was also on-air fields in various regions of Russia. You have some that are fairly close to the border with Ukraine, like for instance, in the Belgorod region. But then also for instance, as far east as the Nizhny Novgorod region, which is actually even east of Moscow or the Voronezh region, which is also in the south of Russia as well. So, certainly something where the Ukrainians claim that this was a successful operation, but also one where the Ukrainians show that they are able to project that power that they have with those drones that they use into various areas of Russia. But of course, all of this is also meant by the Ukrainians to degrade some of Russia's airpower that Russia is now trying to use to stop those Ukrainian offensives in the Kursk region. There was a lot that happened there today. A lot of movement that went on there today. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You asked that question because we have been monitoring Russian state TV throughout the entire day today. The thing that we keep hearing is that the Ukrainians are running out of steam, is what the Russians are saying. But of course, one of the things that's actually pretty remarkable about the Ukrainian offensive is that the Ukrainians are still making progress eight days into this offensive. And if you look for instance, a comparison to the recent Russian offensive into the Kharkiv region in the northeast of Ukraine, that came to a standstill about two to three days into the offensive. Of course, never went so far into that region as the Ukrainians are now. So, the fact that they are still making progress certainly is something that must catch the Russians or must have caught the Russians by surprise.

But they can afford them, at least, that is according to their vision and so on. So, for us, it was very clear we needed to do something out of the box.

So, I don't think -- I don't think anybody seriously thinking that to keep it like forever. But at the same time, at the same time, even if it distracts the forces already, and I think that's a minimum operational goal. If that operation distracts the forces from Ukraine, so Russians are failing in Ukraine offensive, like trying to get success in Ukraine. That already would be a good result.

So, in terms of these pieces to the puzzle, both Iran and Hezbollah have said that their military actions all along have been based on supporting the Palestinians. So, the premise is, get a deal or advance a ceasefire and a hostage release in Gaza. So, Palestinians stopped being killed in Gaza, then that can deflate, de-escalate the tensions that Israel currently has with Hezbollah. That is an utter over-simplification, I absolutely admit to that, because the tensions there are deeper. Israel's evacuated almost a 100,000 people from its northern -- from its northern border. They haven't been able to get it back to their homes for almost a year. They want Hezbollah to retreat back deeper into Lebanon and away from the border. And that hasn't happened. But the sense is, the principle of all of this is, if you solve Gaza, then that very thorny issue on Israel's border becomes slightly easier to solve, not because the mechanics are easier, but because the temperature behind the debate and the hostility and the tensions in the region are slightly lessened.",

The Consumer Price Index, a key indicator of the American economy rose 2.9 percent last month, the first time it's been below 3 percent since March of 2021. That keeps the door open for a possible interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve when it meets next month. Well, the U.S. economy is the focus of both the Republican and the Democratic presidential campaigns this week. And in the coming hours, Donald Trump will be in North Carolina to give a speech on his economic plan. And then, on Friday in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris will roll out her proposal for the economy. Her campaign is spotlighting the fresh numbers on inflation, saying the economy is strong and wanting that Trump's agenda will drive it into a recession. And right now, Republican VP nominee J. D. Vance is in the critical swing State of Michigan where he is expected to discuss economic issues. Well, let's break things down with CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten, who joins us from New York.

In July, what did we see in this University of Michigan poll? You saw a 41 percent of Americans said they trusted more -- trusted Donald Trump more on economic issues than Joe Biden at 35 percent down here. Now, let's jump ahead to this side of the screen and let's take a look at August. That Republican advantage that Donald Trump had, adios amigos, goodbye, see you later. Look here, Kamala Harris, 42 percent more trust in the economy, Donald Trump at 41 percent. Look, that's no clear leader, that's within the margin of error. But the bottom line is, at least according to this one particular poll, this advantage that Donald Trump has had on the economy nationally, his top issue, along with immigration, that advantage has gone.

The states that we've been talking about so often, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. And I want you to take a look here. Trusted more on the economy. Now, you can see that Donald Trump still holds an advantage in August. But it's a six-point lead, right? 52 percent to 46 percent. Look at where we were back in May. Again, it's the trend line that is so important here. Back in May, Donald Trump held a 14-point advantage on the economy over Joe Biden. And so, what we're seeing both in the national numbers as well as in the swing states on the economy, in fact, on pretty much every single issue, where Donald Trump was prior to Kamala Harris getting into the race when the likely Democratic nominee, the presumptive Democratic nominee was going to be Joe Biden, Donald Trump is flailing. His advantages are receding. The issues in which Democrats lead becoming wider. And you see it right here. Because the fact is, if Donald Trump is up only six points on this issue that has been such a key issue for him, that is likely not going to be good enough if he wants to win.

Look at that, 21 percent who say that is their top issue in terms of determining their vote. And this is, again, among the undecided voter, that critical small block of voters. And look how much higher that is than abortion, which is the number two issue. That comes in at only 7 percent. So, the economy inflation, three times as important to voters as the number two issue. If you can tell me what the economic numbers are going to look like on election day, that is who is going to be more trusted according to the voters, I can tell you who is going to win that election. Of course, I'm not Nostradamus, so I can't tell you how those numbers are going to look on election day, but I can tell you that's where we want to look.",

She, after all, has been in the administration for four years. She is complicit, as the Republicans would say, in all of the decisions that took place on the economy. I think there's a few clues in what she's been saying. She seems to be talking more about high prices, which have been haunting Americans, especially in the grocery stores ever since the pandemic, more so than the more longer-term factors that Biden has been very interested in, for example, boosting manufacturing, trying to transform the economies of those Midwestern states, which are important issues, but they tend to take a longer time to deliver. So, that's the vice president. As far as Trump is concerned, I think the thing we're looking for is to see whether he can stick to his script. He's been flailing ever since Harris came into the race. And a lot of conservatives and Republican strategists are very frustrated with him and want him to narrow down on that issue of the economy that Harry was saying is going to be decisive in November.",

It only takes 10,000or 20,000 votes, say, in Wisconsin to shift that state from one side to the other. We've seen that in the last two elections. So, if there is concern about Donald Trump's economic policies, I think that will have an impact. The one thing I would add to that however, is that lots of Americans appear to be quite nostalgic for the pre-pandemic economic conditions of Trump's term. Prices in the grocery store were much lower, and that's what a lot of people remember. So, I'm not sure that a lot of voters are going to start getting into the nitty gritty of whether his policies would cause inflation because he's going to slap big tariffs on Chinese goods. A lot of people would perhaps like to see him getting tougher on China. So, that may be the way they process that question. But as I said, this is going to be a very close election.

Younger Americansin particular, those under 35, are the ones leading their way on this healthier habit. A new poll finding that young people are more likely to think that throwing back a couple of drinks is bad for you. More than half of those polled said adults should reduce how much they drink, and 22 percent said they should stop drinking entirely. Well, joining us now is CNN's Meg Tirrell.

That is the highest number since they started doing this poll in 2001. It's up six points since last year and up 17 points since just 2018. And as you pointed out, that really is being driven by younger adults. 65 percent of adults in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 34 say that alcohol negatively affects health, compared with just more than a third of people over the age of 35. And in terms of drinking behaviors, you can see that younger people, although, they do still report drinking in fairly high numbers, under the age of 34 down to 18, 59 percent report drinking alcohol, but they are declining the fastest. Whereas, people over 55 or just about at that level, people 35 to 54 report the highest levels of drinking, 69 percent of folks in that age group say that they have occasion to drink alcohol.

And some residents have returned to see their damaged properties, hoping to find any belongings to salvage. I want to bring in CNN's Eleni Giokos, who joins us from just outside Athens.

However, tomorrow it is expected to pick up. And if it does, that is where the threat comes in. The heat coupled with any kind of winds will, of course, cause major risk factors playing out. But what we saw today was really interesting. We went to ground zero where the fire started in Granada (ph). And this was just incredible to see. Firstly, a small hill where the fire began and then spread 50 kilometers long. We saw a plethora of planes, of aircraft, as well as helicopters dropping water on this region. And the reason they're doing this is, firstly, when the fire goes out, it still remains burning. And we were talking about major forest area that will burn probably not only for weeks, but probably as well for months. And you see these plumes of smoke and that's where the risk sort of comes in. You've got heat and you've got a lot of wind coming in tomorrow. We spoke to the fire departments a little earlier and they said that they aren't high alert, but they believe that the effort that they've put in the past few days is enough to mitigate any further risk and spread. The other thing I have to mention is where we are right now is Penteli, where we were this morning, ground zero, it took us about an hour and a half to drive to where we are, and we just saw so much land that was burnt and forest areas as well as homes. So, it gives you a sense of just the scale of this. Authorities say 100,000 acres of land has been destroyed. We've seen so many homes that have been completely engulfed by flames. We spoke to many residents. In fact, today, we spoke to one sculptor whose workshop was completely decimated. The pain that comes with that. To having to rebuild their homes as well as rebuild their livelihoods is something they're thinking about right now, Lynda. And that is the scary reality, because once the fires go out, then you've got the residents and the victims dealing with the reality.

Some of the people we spoke to say it was -- it happened so quickly that was what's so shocking about it. And it moved into suburbs very close to the Athens city center. We're around 11 miles away. So, that gives you a sense of the proximity. But what I also did today, I went to an area that we covered last year. It's called Bagmifa (ph). It's sort of the lands (ph) of Athens, which is a very beautiful forest area. I wanted to see what the forest would look like a year after fires. And I actually couldn't tell the difference between some of the forests that we saw in the last few days in the live active fire areas versus a forest that was burned one year ago, and that is the scary reality of how long it's actually going to take for land to be recovered and for forest to be recovered. But also, we also saw homes that were burned one year ago that have not been rebuilt.
