I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin this hour with the latest from Gaza, where the US has carried out its first humanitarian aid drops today.White House officials calling that operation a success, describing it as a welcome sign that they can continue similar drops in the days and weeks to come. At the same time, a senior US official now says, Israel has \"basically accepted\" the terms of a ceasefire deal release more hostages, and that it is now up to Hamas to agree. Priscilla Alvarez joining us now live from Washington. Priscilla, what's the White House saying about today's drop?",

In total, it was 38,000 meals though it did not include water or medical supplies. Now the location was chosen because US officials assessed it was an area where people were sheltering and in need and after the air drops happened, they did see that civilians approached the assistance and also began to distribute it. But what administration officials have been saying is that they want to flood the zone, that includes these humanitarian airdrops, while also exploring other avenues like a maritime corridor to get even more assistance in. But none of this is a substitute to the land crossings and making sure that humanitarian aid can also come through there. So while they are touting today as a success, they're also making clear that a lot more needs to happen to address this dire humanitarian situation that is unfolding in Gaza. DEAN: And Priscilla, we are also getting word today from a US official on progress toward a  ceasefire, a hostage deal. What can you tell us about the latest on those talks?",

Senior administration officials expressed some  optimism in the direction of these talks that have been ongoing for weeks and they said that Israel has \"basically accepted\" a framework.Now, this framework includes a six-week ceasefire. Over the course of those six weeks, a couple of things would happen. There would be a surge of humanitarian aid that would go into Gaza the also would allow for the release of the hostages that are deemed most vulnerable. That's women, the elderly, and the wounded. Now, it would also allow for officials to work on some of the stickier points over the course of that time. That includes the release of hostages who are IDF members, while also trying to work through a \"more enduring\" plan. That's how a senior administration official put it. But all of this is going up against the clock. They're trying to reach this deal before Ramadan and all parties have said that this is a sensitive and delicate opportunity and also that they have to just work around the clock until they can finish the deal and it is not a done deal until it is all the way to the finish line. I will also say that this is happening when Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday. That is a conversation the two will have that will touch on the hostage deal, the humanitarian aid to address the crisis in Gaza and also the day after planning. That's a priority for the vice president going in the weeks to come, and that's something that the two will discuss. Benny Gantz will also be meeting with national security adviser, Jake Sullivan while he is in town -- Jessica.",

And joining me now is Aaron David Miller. He is a former State Department negotiator and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, and Hagar Chemali, she is a former spokesperson for the US mission to the United Nations and the host of the YouTube who show, \"Oh, My World.\" It is great to have both of you. Thanks so much for coming on this evening. Aaron, let's start with you and this potential deal that we seem to be inching closer to. It is now on Hamas to  agree. Do you get the impression that we might get to a finish line here? Unfortunately, I cannot hear Aaron, so were going to see if we can work that out, but Hagar, let's go to you for a second. We will work on that audio as well. I want to ask you about these aid drops and what do you make of the aid drops from the United States today and them happening now.",

To your point, is it somehow getting more trucks in which is what it sounds like in order to meet the need, really needs to happen.But obviously, regardless of how you're delivering it, the safe delivery of this aid is really front of mind right now, after the deadly disaster around that convoy last week. Do you get the sense that this is changing aid groups' approach on the ground? It certainly, as you said, we did start to see these airdrops from the US almost immediately after. CHEMALI: Well, there is certainly going to be thinking of more creative ways, but when you're talking about maritime corridors and airdrops, obviously, these are really only things that can be done by governments. It is not that easy for international organizations to come up with a maritime corridor because that's not something that -- it is something that the government has to allow, that's something that Israel has to permit. And so that's something that's better done between the United States and Israel, for example. But the fact by the way that the US is rushing to do this as quickly as it can highlights what an emphasis the US is placing on the need for humanitarian aid and how much they're willing to carry on themselves. And it also highlights most critically the need for a ceasefire and the fact that the US is saying they seem very hopeful that a ceasefire is close. We saw that Israel has accepted the latest terms and that now the ball is in Hamas' court . It is hard to say how Hamas will react. They rejected the last two proposals and so it is hard to say, but at the same time it is not in Hamas' interest to have this kind of fighting during Ramadan. But I'd also argue, it wasn't in Hamas' interests to pursue the terrorist attack of October 7th and sacrifice their entire people in what was to be expected to have an Israeli bombardment. But that said, to answer your ultimate question, there will be more governments looking at creative ways, but for international aid organizations, unfortunately, they're going  to have to continue focusing on the border over land.",

Hamas needs to re-up and rearm. They want to defer or delay what is going to happen. Israel is going to mount a considerably heavy ground campaign into Rafah. So Hamas needs to buy time. And also, the advent of Ramadan and the prisoner releases will boost Hamas' stock among the local population. And I think, the Israelis too are under greater pressure from hostage families, from the War Cabinet, Benny Gantz, the former minister of Defense, and a putative successor to Benjamin Netanyahu is doing Washington on Monday.

Palestine Islamic Jihad, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the government of Iran may have some. And there were reports that clans and families, perhaps even criminal elements ended up taking several.So despite the best intelligence of the Israelis and the Americans have, part of the problem here is verifying that Hamas has all of the hostages that they want to trade, and I think this is going to prove to be a serious issue for negotiation. One final point. I am not sure they've reached an agreement on how many Palestinian prisoners and of what type and character are going to be exchanged. And for this Israeli government, the most right-wing and extremist in the state's history, a large prisoner exchange, including high-quality prisoners in Hamas' eyes, those who have Israeli blood on their hands, who have either been charged or convicted of killing Israelis, Hamas is going to demand substantial number of those. So again, I am hoping that in fact were close to an agreement, but, you know, as you know, nothing is done until it is done. DEAN: Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.

I think these polls give the campaign the indication and the time that they need to go and build with those coalitions. That's what the uncommitted vote was for and a primary in Michigan, in order for the campaign to understand the gap that they have to make up. And so while those polls may seem discouraging and I feel like we've been talking about those polls for over a year now, election day is still very far out. We've got to get through Super Tuesday and then we've also got to get through the Democratic National Convention, where the party build a platform on all of the pieces of the coalition that makes up the Democratic base.

He's going to make that case to the American people. And I actually think the State of the Union will be watched by a lot of people because we have so many ways of getting information, not just cable news, the rise in social media.

So that's going to leave us with a critical fire weather outlook for today and tomorrow in the areas that have already had devastating wildfires the last couple of days. So again, we've got the wind, we've got the dry air, and we have these temperatures that are much above average. Highs will be in the 80s for a lot of this area through the next couple of days, which is a good 10- to 15 degrees above normal. So with the warm conditions, the wind, the dry air, again, going to make it difficult for firefighters.",

Now, FBI officials will meet the fishing vessel when it comes into a port, expected to be sometime this weekend. The bureau will then take possession of the object, transport it to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, and analyze it, as has been done with previous surveillance balloons. Now, all of our sources emphasized that it wasn't clear exactly what the object was, and that it may not be a surveillance balloon at all. But the concern for officials is that it could be another foreign government-operated balloon similar to the Chinese surveillance balloon that blew off course and transited across the continental U.S. in February of last year before being shot down off the Atlantic Ocean. That balloon entered U.S. territory through Alaskan airspace. After that episode, though, the U.S. widened the aperture of its radar system so that it could better detect objects traveling above a certain altitude and at certain speeds. Now, these more sensitive radar systems have allowed the U.S. military to spot more unidentified objects in U.S. airspace, not all of which are surveillance balloons. There were three additional shootdowns of unidentified high-altitude objects in the weeks following the Chinese balloon incident, and just in the last couple of weeks the North American Aerospace Defense Command or NORAD, sent fighter jets to intercept and examine a small balloon spotted floating over the southwest, drifting east. NORAD later said in a statement that the balloon was \"likely a hobby balloon\" and that it posed no threat. We will continue to watch, of course, to see what the FBI is able to learn about this mystery object now bobbing across the ocean on a fishing boat on its way to port. But right now, it's just the mystery catch of the day. Katie Bo Lillis, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
