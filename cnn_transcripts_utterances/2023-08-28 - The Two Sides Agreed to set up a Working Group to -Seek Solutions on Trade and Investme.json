      "sentences": "A warm welcome to the \"First Move\", great to have you with us. We begin a new week together lots to get to todayincluding U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is in Beijing looking for a trade relationship reset. China has a key stock trading tax. But hopes was sweeping new stimulus still unmet. And Fed Chair Jay Powell warns his inflation fight is far from finished yet a further rate hike therefore remains I think a fair bet. Meanwhile on global markets, no need for the bulls to fret U.S. Futures pointing to a positive start to the week Europe mostly higher too with UK investors on holiday. It's a long bank holiday weekend there. Wall Street closing out last week's trading in the green that despite the Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell's tough talk on rates during his keynote speech Friday at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium Powell not ready to pivot on policy given the still murky inflation outlook but his promise of continued data dependency means I think little visibility over where rates are headed, and that perhaps might limit some stock buying exuberance we shall see. In Asia, the major indexes closing sharply higher as you can see there too, Beijing's move to boost investor confidence by making it cheaper to trade stocks helping boost sentiment there although Chinese markets finished the session substantially off their highs that's worth noting. All this after shares have failed property developer Evergrande resumed trade for the first time in 17 months and take a look at that. Shares promptly tumble almost 80 percent not really a great surprise given all the bad news in the property sector and of course its own bankruptcy filing earlier this month. We'll discuss China's multi-pronged economic dilemma and how best to battle the crisis of confidence facing both Chinese consumers. But also more importantly the private sector businesses later in the show, with Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution. For now, let's bring you the latest from Beijing as the U.S. Commerce Secretary wraps up her first day of talks with Chinese officials. Raimondo saying stable relations between Washington and Beijing are \"Profoundly important\", but also admitting the difficult path ahead given the growing national security friction between the two nations? Raimondo focusing on the positives however, on Monday showing off U.S. made personal care beauty products sold in China, that she says represent the promise of trade between the two nations. Steven Jiang joins us now from Beijing. Steven, the U.S. Commerce Secretary keen to point out that the vast majority of trade between the United States and China doesn't touch on the sensitive technologies and future technologies in particular too. The question is can they grow the rest of it despite the tension over those critical smaller elements?",

But the problem for this economy, of course, is not just one sector but multiple sectors, multiple problems and challenges. You know, burgeoning local government debts, plunging direct foreign investments, not to mention youth unemployment, consumer confidence numbers as bad as you know, the government has stopped releasing these data. So that's certainly not a sign of confidence. So I think the problem right now is, you know, the confidence is not back from consumers from businesses after three years of brutal lock downs and all these crackdowns on the private sector, Julia.",

She has used the words, she is protesting against the inhumane bloodthirsty hunt of her son. And I think it speaks really to the emotion and the divisions that have been caused Julia by what has played out over the last few days. You know, there are on the one hand players both men's and women's in Spain and around the world who very much backed Jenni Hermoso and the Spanish players and spoken out against Rubiales.

But says Ukraine would need more financial support. Let's get the very latest from our team on the ground in Ukraine. Melissa Bell joins us now from Zaporizhzhia. And Melissa I mean, we could talk about any of these elements.

Essentially, what'sbeen happening since the Russian invasion of last year is every 90 days martial law has to be reinstated that is the way the law works here in Ukraine under martial law, which is reinstated for 90 days. Of course, no elections, no political activity can take place at all. And so until now, the position had been that it seemed very difficult to see how Ukraine was going to be able to hold the parliamentary elections that are due for this autumn, or indeed the presidential elections that are due for next year. What President Zelenskyy has been saying is that whilst there are difficulties, obviously, not just because of the martial law, but because 20 percent of the country is currently in Russian hands, because so many of its young men and women are currently serving on the frontlines, or actually living abroad because they fled the war. All of these logistical difficulties will have to be looked into will have to be addressed. But what President Zelenskyy said was that he would not want to seem to be the one holding democracy back and that he is wholeheartedly behind the idea of the holding of these elections if the financial help can be given. His point is that he doesn't want valuable resources to be taken away from the front line and the counter offensive that's now going on to try and reclaim some of that territory from Russia. But with the financial help from other countries from allies, he said it might be possible to consider holding these elections, Julia.",

That has not been the case for the last few years, when the bilateral trade tensions between the two sides has been ramping up to some extent, because the U.S. feels that China is not playing by the rules. In addition, there is now, what is almost an existential battle for supremacy in terms of the industry so the future especially the higher tech, greener energy sort of technologies where both countries want to establish dominance. So right now, we seem to have the national security imperative, which Secretary Raimondo has been talking about, and other U.S. officials have been as well, taking precedence over these economic issues. So that's behind what Washington has been doing in terms of restricting technology transfers, investments in China. All of which are seen as conduits for China to get access to technology that might allow it to compete in a way with the U.S. that the U.S. cannot stay in front of these technologies. But I think there is a way that both countries could in fact benefit from sharing this technology, so long as there is a clear set of rules that both countries play by, and that's what they seem to be talking about now.",

You were recently in China and you were certainly getting a sense of confidence, both of consumers, I think, an ordinary citizens, perhaps even more importantly, at this moment, the private sector, and companies, businesses operating there. And that was something that you wrote an op-ed about, and it caught my attention.

There was a techcrackdown, where many high flying tech companies were, you know, cut down to size. In addition, there was a crackdown on other parts of the private sector, including the medical sector, the education sector, and so on. And coming on top of a variety of short term concerns such as the property market unraveling, youth unemployment rises and deflation beginning to set in, there is a real concern right now that the private sector may not be confident enough either for businesses to invest or for households to go out and consume. So right now, I think what is really crucial for the Chinese government is to be able to indicate that, in fact, private enterprise is something that it views is playing a very important role in the economy, because the reality is that for all the China wants to accomplish, you know, moving up the value chain, which essentially means moving up to higher technology industries, which will mean more domestic innovation as well they need the private sector. The private sector, especially small and medium enterprises have been crucial in terms of employment growth. So unless they fix that and send a clear signal, and also some actions to indicate that the private sector is seen as playing a very important role in the economy. I think private investment will continue to fall, household consumption will not pick up and that's going to make even the short term recovery very difficult to engineer.",

And it accounts for by some estimates, nearly 1/3 of household wealth. So when the property sector is not doing well, the economy does not do well. And households feel that their wealth is declining, and that affects their consumption levels. Now, the real challenge for Beijing is to make sure that it managed the property sector in a more sensible fashion. The reality is that some of the measures the government took to rein in the property sector in 2021 were perhaps desirable, because there was a lot of speculative activity in that sector. But what some property developers told me was that those steps were taken in a very abrupt fashion without much notice. So the property sector did not have time to adjust. But more broadly, the economy is going to have to adjust to a period where the property sector simply cannot be such an important driver of growth anymore. Things are stabilizing right now. But the problem is that, as you mentioned, there are some property developers left Evergrande that have taken on huge amounts of debt. There are some banks that are exposed to the developers. So we're going to see some volatility in property markets. But Beijing is trying to take back some of the restrictions on the property sector to give it something of a boost. But again, unless they take broader measures to instill confidence that policies are going in the right direction, I don't think it's going to have much of an effect in terms of boosting household consumption.",

I don't think that denying people, denying analysts the information they need to analyze where the economy is going, is the right way to build confidence. But you know there is another perspective worth keeping in mind. This is now an 18.5 trillion dollar economy is the second largest in the world. It's about two thirds the size of the U.S. economy. So the 8 to 10 percent growth rates of the past are really going to be difficult to sustain. The big issue is whether China can get good high quality growth in the next few years, at least in the range of 4 to 5 percent inflation adjusted terms that would be pretty good for an economy of this size. But even that is going to be a challenge if you have household consumption staying weak, private investment falling, and that's going to make all the economic objectives of the Xi Jinping government very difficult to achieve.",

So associated a freight rates for a key route from Far East into U.S. Gulf Coast that all goes through the Panama Canal is up by $1,000 since in June and more essentially also the long term contracts have just inched up also in the beginning of August by $250. So it's crunch time. And this is definitely a wake-up call for those shippers with cargo that needs to go through the canal in the coming well a month and quarters.",

So what we're talking about is containers that can only carry 10 to 15 percent less thanthey were so that raises the amount of container ships that are required because that has to be redistributed. Obviously, people are also looking I'm assuming other options too. But if prices are elevated, then there's going to be a reluctance to sign contracts, longer term contracts, at least in case those prices adjust. Just talk to me about the freight rates that you mentioned? Put that into perspective of the kind of levels for freight rates that we saw during the pandemic at the worst points of the challenges that we saw in global shipping. How do the prices compare to what we're seeing today, just even in percentage terms that might make it easier?",

I saw the CanalAuthority said that these restrictions could be in place for another 10 months. And I know I was looking at it over the weekend that the water level in one of the two lake ways that supplies water to the canal is at a seven year low. So even when the raining season starts, that it's not enough of a compensation, how high might these rates get and what's going to be the knock on impact Peter, perhaps to deliveries, as we head towards the holiday season, I mean, we're close enough now perhaps for that to be a worry free inventories.",

So there's definitely a squeeze on rates right now spot as well as long term. And they may go well it's anybody's guess, right? But we've seen an additional $1,000 being put on them right now we could definitely see another 1000 there in a few weeks or months and then coming back to the second half of the game because the problem is really that the water reservoirs are not being filled during the wet season of this year. And they basically arrives them with too little water to basically for the dry season in the first half of 2024. So that's why the Panama Canal Authority is announced 10 month of these restrictions. So obviously, all shippers are looking towards alternatives, as they fear rates may go even higher, as alluded to also, the long term contract rates are now also reaching up for those that seek to make use of that service. But in the end, there are only 10 big container ships that can transit, the canal every single day for the next 10 months. So if anything in terms of demand will go up from here. Alternatives will be deployed, whether that's the Suez Canal transit, or whether it's air cargo if you're really in hurry and the meet.",

Now the United Nations General Antonio Guterres says he's concerned amid reports of voter intimidation and suspicious arrests. In Zimbabwe's recent elections, opposition and civil society groups seize the vote was marred by voter intimidation, threats of violence, harassment and coercion. On Saturday, the Electoral Commission announced the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa won with nearly 53 percent of the votes cast. David McKenzie joins us now live from Johannesburg. David, but how important are these concerns from international observers saying they're concerned about voter delays, particularly in the capital city and the second city where the strongholds are of the opposition there?

With all the elections right you have to look at the before, during and after the voting. But before of the story has been wrongly criticized by outside observers as being marred by violence and intimidation. The during when people actually voted in Zimbabwe, as you say it was beset with significant delays the opposition saying that the voters role wasn't up to date on the eve of the voting they didn't receive as they are due to receive the information that allows them to check their tabulations with the official tabulations. And that voting was stretched on to a second day. And relatively quickly, we got the results, which said that the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa had one another term. The Zimbabwean President saying that it was peaceful, transparent and in broad daylight, and I'm paraphrasing here. The after of the vote is where we are now. And at this stage observer missions, the limited observers who were there say that there were significant problems. The opposition is saying that they had different tabulations from several stations and constituency. They asked him for clarity from the Zimbabwean Electoral Commission where it happens now here's the Leader of the Opposition Nelson Chamisa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think this isn't necessarily a magnanimous move. I think this is an assessment of the reality of the situation. You mentioned the debt issues of Zimbabwe. That's one issue. Zimbabwe is still under multiple different sanctions when it comes to political individuals. And the government is hamstrung because of the way that the country and its resources are managed in the eyes of the world. I don't think anyone will change the way to deal with Zimbabwe unless there is a significant power sharing or at least the time between the leadership and the opposition, but we're not there yet. It's too early to speak about because at this point, I'm sure the opposition will be taking this to court. And the latest I hear from sources there is we could expect more information on the perceived irregularities coming out tomorrow, Julia.",
