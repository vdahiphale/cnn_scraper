But first, your headlines this hour video showing of Chinese fighter jet cutting in front of an American spy plane and maneuver the U.S. says was unnecessarily aggressive. Beijing responding by saying the U.S. is endangering China's national security. Ukraine takes the fight to Russia. A day after a joint attack on Moscow, a massive strike in the Belgorod region has wounded a number of people but Kremlin has called the attacks alarming. The U.S. House of Representatives will be taking a key vote today on the debt ceiling bill that needs to be passed to avert a catastrophic U.S. default. Top lawmakers are confident the bill will pass and be signed into law. And happening right now NASA is holding a public meeting evaluating data of unidentified anomalous phenomena or observations in the sky that cannot be identified. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\". Experts are warning that artificial intelligence poses an existential risk to human life does is of scientists, researchers and industry leaders are voicing concern that the revolutionary technology could lead to extinction. Yet, even as more voices join that chorus warning of the risks Nvidia, a chipmaker that builds products powering the AI boom briefly became a $1 trillion company. So tonight we ask well, greed from profit mean the risks are ignored. I want to bring in CNN's Technology Reporter Brian Fung for more on this. Great to have you with us! Look, I tell you I read that release and it's absolutely scary. I want you to tell me about who's signed this who agrees with it, and just some of the scary threats that humanity is facing.",

Let's just take a very quick look first at what the statement actually says. And it's very short, it says, \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\". Now to see, you know, some of these researchers and experts and executives comparing AI to the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear annihilation should probably, you know, get anyone's eyes and ears to perk up here. And some of the biggest names, as I said, are signed along onto this statement, including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI which is behind the ChatGPT tool that took the world by storm last year, as well as anthropic another major AI company that, you know, all of these companies have met with the White House and the Biden Administration to discuss how to regulate AI. And, you know, with this statement coming out, it's clear now that, you know, the issues extend far beyond things like misinformation, or algorithmic bias and decision making, which to be clear these companies are also concerned about but they're trying to elevate the potential risk of, you know, AI driven annihilation as an equal priority, if not greater here and, you know, this is something that is not currently capable --",

So from writing poetry, to doing mathematics, to doing physics problems, to creating images, all with the same system doing all of these different things. So it's a general system that is competitive with humans now. And this is something that didn't happen before. This is something that really has only come to light in the last few months.

But the change the sort of step change in how we consider the world, I think, is similar in that sense. I think it's easy to compare these two other technologies now when they feel like tools. As these systems become more and more advanced, they're going to feel more like other fellow beings in the world other intelligences that are in the world.

The ones that are having new capabilities that we don't know what they will be, as they are developed, are that things are just happening too fast. These technologies are being rolled out in a race much faster than we are able to govern them, or regulate them or understand how to deploy them safely or societies able to absorb them. So I think we've called for a pause, and many, many 30,000 people have signed the letter now, including many technologists calling for a pause. Because we need to give a chance to our, you know, systems and processes to understand and deal with new technologies to catch up. So if the companies can't do that, and it's very difficult for them to because they are in a race with each other and the stakes are very large financially. If they can't, then I think that's the role of government to step in the interest of public safety to really force the companies pause if they can't do it themselves.",

And that the U.S. aircraft was operating in international airspace, but really underscoring the fact that this is exactly why the U.S. wants to keep those military to military channels open with the Chinese to avoid this kind of confrontation. And something of course, that could lead to a dramatic escalation between the two countries. And he's saying that because just this week, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to set up a meeting with his Chinese counterpart and that was summarily rejected by the Chinese. One of many meetings that the U.S. has proposed in recent months that the Chinese have rebuffed as a result of these heightening tensions between the U.S. and China, stemming from, for example, Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi his visit to Taiwan last year. The incident where the U.S. shot down as a speck of Chinese spy balloon earlier this year and other episodes where the U.S. has been operating over the South China Sea in a way that China perceives as violating its own territory. Now, of course, the U.S. does not accept that. They do not believe that the South China Sea is controlled by the Chinese. But all of this is really contributing to this tension between the U.S. and China is pushing back. Of course this morning with the Foreign Ministry releasing a statement saying that the U.S. was acting in a provocative way and the Chinese military releasing a separate statement, saying that the U.S. had actually interfered in their training exercises so all of this really underscoring for the U.S. why it's important to have this dialogue so that as two major obviously military powers, they avoid some kind of collision that could then spark a broader conflict between the two countries, Eleni.",

And there isindeed widespread irony and delight over the fact that now the Ukrainians are beginning to show the Russians what being at war really feels like. Now, the downside of that, obviously, is that inevitably the number of people being injured and killed is civilians. But the Ukrainians do appear to be trying at least to focus their attentions on strategic targets like the oil refinery down in Krasnodar. But local authorities much further north, just on the northern border between Ukraine and Russia in the Belgorod region, have said that six people there, all of them civilians have been injured. Their children have to be evacuated from alongside other civilians from border villages as what is now becoming almost routine cross border shelling by Ukraine into Russia, the other way round, had become dangerously routine. And throughout this war on an almost daily basis, northern villages are getting shelled by Russia. So we're seeing this as part of I think the early stages or perhaps even the main focus of Ukraine's counter offensive. Adviser to President Zelenskyy has said on National TV, that there's going to be an exponential increase in these sorts of attacks. The problem for the international community is that there are undertakings from the Ukrainians not to use the weapons donated by foreign powers for attacks inside Russia. But James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, given a bit of top cover, or even a green light for the Ukrainian saying that attacks against military infrastructure inside Russia, was consistent with Ukraine's right to self-defense, and were therefore legitimate targets. And as a consequence of that he's been added, or rather the Kremlin via Medvedev, the former president, prime minister, now deputy head of the National Security Council in Russia has tweeted out saying that members of the British government now considered legitimate military targets by Russia, that is part of the sort of public relations tit for tat.

And there is kind of this unofficial rule in the house that a speaker won't bring a measure to the floor if it can't gain the support, at least of the majority of the majority. And so that is really the effort now underway up on Capitol Hill is to try and consolidate the centrist coalition of moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats around this package. Because you do hear bulking from both sides, the far left and the far right about what is included in this measure. But certainly, Kevin McCarthy is confident and they will hold a procedural vote later this afternoon before that final vote in the House. There is this massive effort underway. Now White House officials are up on Capitol Hill trying to persuade Democrats to come along with this deal. And you also saw Kevin McCarthy trying to explain some of the finer points of disagreement to members of his caucus late into the evening last night. I think the issue for some of these most more conservative Republicans is that they don't think that this necessarily cut spending as much as they would have liked from here bulking from what's known as the House Freedom Caucus, which is this ultra-conservative, a faction of the party that has dozens of members. So potentially dozens of Republicans could vote against that that will have to be backfield by our moderate Democrats. But we also heard from the leader of the progressive Democrats earlier today, Representative Pramila Jayapal from Washington State who said that she would be a no vote and that many members of the Progressive Caucus would vote no as well. So it does expect to be passed later today. But certainly the margins will be very closely watched here in Washington and then it's on to the Senate. One senator could hold this up.

I mean, from the beginning of the war, there have been certain moments, not permanently but there have been momentswhere the issue of nuclear weapons have the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons has been evoked. Of course, this should be avoided, it is obvious that here we have a nuclear weapons state, the Russian Federation, and a non-nuclear weapons state, which is Ukraine. So there shouldn't be any use of those. What we from the perspective of the IEA, we are looking at is to avoid that there is an amalgam that there is a mixing up of the militarization of a nuclear power plant as a justification for the use of nuclear weapons or -- into the possibility of nuclear war. So we are following that, of course, very, very carefully.",

A big agreement, you may remember that Iran and a numberof countries, including the United States had struck back in 2015. In 2018, the United States, under the previous administration in America withdrew from that agreement, considering it flawed. What happened there is that Iran, as a form of reply, responds, retaliation, however, you may wish to describe it decided on its side to cease implementing it since they said well, the Americans have ceased implementing it, we do it. So what in real terms, what they are doing is they are not observing anymore, an agreement that they feel is not in force. So this is the discrepancy that we are having.",

So you can say that guy could not handle rejection. So the upbringing, the kind of mindset, we bring up the boys with, I think that's the bottom line, and it needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, everything else has been done; the so called CCTV cameras or other security measures have been taken. But nothing has been done on insight, like how to change the behavior of the men and the boys how to, you know, deal with adolescence, I mean, this guy just crossed teen and entered into his 20. And this is what he has done. And he has no remorse. And he has I mean, you could not see even 1 percent regret on his face. So what must be brewing in his head for years or for months? And what kind of outrage he must have had that he could just butchered that girl, not he went back and then came back again after a few seconds. So kind of mentality, we have to deal with the mental health issues which we are ignoring as like, as society, we also need to address that. So really, so many things have to be done.",
