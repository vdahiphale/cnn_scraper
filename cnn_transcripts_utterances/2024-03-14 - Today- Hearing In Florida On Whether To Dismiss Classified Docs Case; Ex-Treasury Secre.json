It's a strategy we've seen the Trump legal team use in practically every case -- delay, delay, delay.CNNs Katelyn Polantz is outside the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida.

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, we're on a lunch break, but there has been a lot of arguments made already in court this morning. So far, Trump's lawyers are arguing that these are his personal records that he kept after the presidency, that Joe Biden had national security records too and was not charged with a crime.But the morning's arguments were focused around one question, is the law clear enough about protecting national defense information? Trump's lawyers are saying to the judge, it's too vague. This case should be dismissed because Trump couldn't figure out that he would be breaking the law. Now, Judge Cannon, she did respond to this argument at the very end of the two hours of this morning saying finding a statute unconstitutionally vague as Trump's team is asking, that would be an extraordinary step for her to take. So she is indicating a little bit there of what she thinks on that particular argument. But there's more to come this afternoon and the Justice Department, Dana, is digging in here. They're pointing that Donald Trump should have known what was going on and what the law was not only because he was president, but also he acknowledged it on tape. Here's him at Bedminster audio that the Justice Department also has and is using in this case.

And every hearing, every filing, every motion delays things a few days, a few weeks.So the fact that Judge Cannon is taking time to hear arguments on this case helps push it back. Though Judge Cannon has surprised us a few times. It's not expected that she will dismiss this case. This is all about timing, which isn't why another thing we're looking at today is any clue that she gives about when she's going to put this case on the calendar. It's currently penciled in for May. About two weeks ago, she heard arguments on how far she can push it back. The Special Counsel is asking for July. She said that's unreasonable. So August is the earliest but even having these arguments, delays getting it on the calendar. Delay delay is the name of the game.",

And, you know, it sounds like we all like to read tea leaves when we listen to what judges say and don't say in these cases. She certainly seems open to the arguments that Donald Trump's lawyers are making.JEFF SWARTZ, PROFESSOR, THOMAS M. COOLEY LAW SCHOOL TAMPA BAY CAMPUS: She seems to be open to them but I don't think she's going to go anywhere that close to dismissing the case. That's not something that she's already been spanked a couple of times by the 11th Circuit. I don't think she wants to face that a third time. The real concern that I think she's going to look at is the trial date, the idea of occupying the space in the late summer and early fall, so that when the immunity case comes down, there's no room for Judge Chutkan to be able to set the D.C. election interference case for trial. This is really the strategy that is to eat up the space and leave no space for anybody else.",

Federal election case, trial date decision waits for Supreme Court action in early July, the action about whether or not he will or won't be granted immunity. And then, of course, the Georgia election case, the trial is delayed because the judge is considering disqualifying Fani Willis to lead prosecutor.

And you see right now the only one that we're confident is going to go for the election is the hush money case.The district attorney is framing that as the 2016 election interference case, but it is arguably the runt of the litter when we talk about the seriousness of these four cases. And the charges there allegedly falsifying records over hush money payments made to an adult film star, it's not clear that even a conviction there would change the hearts and minds of voters.

And what that means is that even though it doesn't go away from your phone, you can't update the app.So in the short term, you would probably be able to use TikTok. But in the long term, if you can't update it, the app becomes obsolete. You can't get product features, new security things. But also in the short term, remember, TikTok will likely file an appeal. They can ask for a temporary injunction to stop the law from going into effect while it gets sorted out in the courts. And if that's the case, then they wouldn't even have the power to immediately stop it from being downloaded in the App Stores. So people are wondering about the political implications of this ahead of the election. I don't even think that's a possibility at this point that we wouldn't get TikTok on our phones by them.",

And that's so ironic, Dana, because the whole point of these social media platforms is to democratize power, right, to democratize voices.But I'm glad you brought up Steve Mnuchin's bid, because the key thing here is that what this law says is not that TikTok is banned, it said it will get banned if they don't sell it to a U.S. company or U.S. owners. And selling to a U.S. company would be really hard. Today's antitrust climate makes it really tough to imagine that a company like Microsoft, or Oracle or Meta could just outright buy TikTok. Small companies wouldn't have the capital to do it. So you're looking at private investment groups being the most likely case. Now, can Steve Mnuchin rally enough American investment dollars?
