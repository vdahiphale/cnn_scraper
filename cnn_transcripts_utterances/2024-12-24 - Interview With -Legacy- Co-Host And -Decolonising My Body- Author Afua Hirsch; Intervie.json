CNN's chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, shares lessons from years of traveling the world. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As the year comes to an end, many people like to look back and reflect. But the legacy, so to speak, of 2024 will look different to everyone depending on their experience. How we understand the past often shapes the present. And tonight, we begin with two guests who think deeply about that process itself. Historian Peter Frankopan and writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsch co-host the podcast \"Legacy,\" which questions the way we remember some of history's most revered and feared figures and everyone in between, from Napoleon Bonaparte to Marilyn Monroe, Picasso to Cleopatra. When the pair joined me here in London, we discussed whether it's time to rethink the way some of our historical perspectives and maybe even prejudices. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You know, whether you look at race, class, education, our sense of our identity in the world, you can trace much of it to the ideas we have about these people.

In today's world of politicians shouting each other, you know, having different perspectives is not just OK, it's a really good thing.

So, some of the people we've looked at so far, like Napoleon and Cecil Rhodes are hugely complicated, but history is always about legacy. I mean, here, you know, that better than anyone, Christiane, here on CNN, when we think about, you know, how do we evaluate any personal event from the past, those things start to shift over time. So, after we did something, we -- the first event we did many years ago was about whether statues should be taken down. And, you know, I learned a lot, actually.

They're not some kind of perfect, pristine monument to history. And Cecil Rhodes, and the reason why it's great to do a podcast like this, he was actually profoundly controversial in his time. Many of the most imperialist patriotic Brits at the time thought he was ruining the name of imperialism through his corruption, greed. But he was also a very complex and flawed person. And I think it's in the nuance that it's actually useful. And it's not just to remember the past, but it tells us something about society today, who gets a platform to speak, who gets silenced, and I think the way many of these protesters were actually attacked by the institutions that should have been looking into the claims they were making is an example of how unresolved a lot of this is, and that's something we discuss in the episodes.",

No one bothers to pay any attention to them, including really important ones, right in front of the Bodleian Library. Most of the students who go in there will never think twice about who that might be. And so, we kind of -- so statues only become important when we need them and want to become important.

But also, for somebody like me with African heritage, it had a very deep psychological effect because I was growing up in a world that told me that my African indigenous history was savage, was backward, that becoming more European and colonized was progress. And that legacy is so powerful. Britain couldn't have maintained its empire through military might. It relied on programming and brainwashing colonial subjects into believing that being British, being Christian, being European, being capitalist was better. And we're so far from having unpicked that brainwashing and being able to see objectively the choices that we've made as cultures and communities. I think the climate crisis is one of the ways we're waking up to the fact that many of those choices were bad, were catastrophic.

Because, Christiane, we were the only ones left in the locker room every Sunday during the finals. And we would look at each other and we finally figured out, you know, we're not only competitors were people. And Martina had feelings and Martina had a private life and Martina had emotions and so, did I, and we were very vulnerable with each other those last Sundays that we played in the final. So, I mean, I think that's what started the ball rolling. And then, ironically, you know, Martina got -- had -- got cancer first. But I mean, I can only tell you about my journey was having ovarian cancer. My sister, Jeannie, died from it. And I found out that I had the BRCA gene. So, you know, I went in for preventive surgery to basically get a hysterectomy because I had a 40 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer. And they found out that I did have ovarian cancer and I didn't -- wasn't feeling anything. I mean, that's why this ovarian cancer is so insidious and so sneaky because you don't feel anything. But I was stage one. I was lucky. So, I went in, had the hysterectomy. They had to go in more to see if it had spread. It hadn't spread. So, I had my chemotherapy. And unbeknownst to me, two years later, Christiane, it returned into my pelvic area. So, I had to go through the whole thing again, the surgery and chemo. And meanwhile, Martina was fighting her own battles with breast cancer twice, I believe, and throat cancer. And so, we were going through -- you know, she was going through radiation and chemo, I was going through chemo, but we were staying in touch and just thinking about how ironic our life has been, where things are happening to us, the same things are happening to us simultaneously and that's really how we got so close.",

Texas, maybe the reddest state United States, leads the country in green energy way more than California and Florida. They're putting more solar online because the economics just make sense. For the first time in human history, our cheapest fuels are not the ones we have to burn. The cheapest fuels are now solar plus battery and onshore wind. And the economics trumping the ideology and sort of political resistance in places like Texas right now.

It is those grannies turning their anxiety into action in a peaceful systematic way. And we'll see if that catches fire anyway. Ultimately though, Christiane, they're up against the richest companies in human history who not only are enjoying the most -- the biggest profits in human history, but are still getting billions and direct and indirect subsidies. So, the social license of our fossil fuel lives very few people pick at gas stations, they go after pipelines, but until the consumption piece of this is sorted out, but ultimately, the decision makers who could shift their business model to a much more sustainable direction has some, as some in Europe have done, you could fit these guys the C-suiters is in a few big buses.
