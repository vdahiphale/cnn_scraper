Her boyfriend is going to be public and say that right before the election, Stormy Daniels was on the phone with me saying that I need to get this deal done because otherwise she was worried Trump was going to lose the election and she was going to lose her leverage.And so the Trump team is trying to turn the tide of this election on its head and say that that is why they were pushing to get this done and go back to their extortion argument. That is the whole point here. I will note that call between Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson was on April 4th. Five days later is when the federal agents searched and raided Michael Cohen's apartment and office and home, just to speak to the chaotic timeline of when this was all happening.",

So, they're going through a timeline and going to show the inconsistencies in her statement.Again, this is significant for her credibility if she has not always been consistent in her statement, but it's also something that they can highlight that she is perhaps a liar. She will have explanations for why she lied. She argues that she believes she didn't have a choice. She was worried about being threatened. That'll make the client feel good, too. COOPER:  Yes. I asked her that question back in 2018 when I interviewed her for 60 Minutes about, well, you lied in a document. You signed a document saying that there was no hush money and that there was no agreement. Daniels said she signed a statement denying a sexual encounter with Trump two days earlier, which she did. Necheles asked Daniels to confirm, she knew the article was coming out before it was published because The Wall Street Journal had reached out for comment.

You can't go out and say, oh, yes, I can't talk to you because I've signed up six-figure sum and I also have a penalty of a million dollars if I violate this.So, the question is all how this resonates with the jury. And this is a statement where she said, I'm stating with clarity that this is absolutely false. The question about all of this is how it resonates with the jury. How did they see this? Yes, there are two lawyers on this jury, but most of them are regular people.

So, a lot of this goes to the court of public opinion, potential reputational damage, both trying to inflict damage on her and try to remedy what she may have done on the stand.Now, Necheles is reading from the agreement saying, quote, rumors that I received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false, again, trying to catch her in contradictory statements. But Kaitlan makes an important point, right? You have this client -- we all have to manage up, right? We've all had difficult bosses. This is probably the most difficult one you could have, but at what cost, right? You don't want to engage in the kind of theatrics that we saw. Daniel says, correct, because it wasn't a rumor. It was the truth. You don't want to engage in the kind of theatrics that we saw in the civil litigation where Trump and his attorney, Alina Habba, were antagonizing the judge constantly, constantly disruptive because that hurt them in the end when there was eventually a verdict. So, here is a fine line. You want to get your message across for your client and for the jury, but you also don't want the jury to think that you're not focused on the case. COOPER:  And Necheles is showing Daniels' January 30th, 2018 statement saying, again, denying a sexual relationship with Trump. She actually signed two documents denying a relationship in 2018. Necheles reads the statement out loud. Stormy Daniels pointed out just a short time ago that she didn't actually write those statements, but she did in, in fact sign them, per the confidentiality agreement.",

So, previously, she was saying she wanted to get the story out before the election, that that was her motivation, not money. And they're basically trying to paint her in a corner by highlighting all of her denials and saying, well, it had nothing to do with the election after that because it's 2018 and she's still denying it, and essentially trying to say to the jury that she was motivated by money and nothing else.She's talking about how she signed her name differently than she had before. That's in that agreement where she was about to go out and do the Jimmy Kimmel interview. I will say there's an interesting tactic, and I'm sure Paula has picked up on this, that Susan Necheles uses, where she seems to ask a question that she know there will be an objection to, and it'll potentially be sustained by the judge. But it doesn't matter because, yes, maybe in the court transcript, it's not in there, but the jury still hears it. They still hear her say, you're an extortionist, you were doing this. And even if she backtracks, which she seems to always have a substitute question ready to go, the jury has already heard that. And she's saying that she was pushed to sign that statement by Michael Cohen via Keith Davidson before she went and did that Jimmy Kimmel. And there's Susan Necheles saying, well Donald Trump wasn't running for election at that point, saying of course, it's 2018, he's already in the White House.",

Laughing, Daniels responded, brand? Yes. And I think that is also something important that you can't always see from reading these updates and not being in the room, Anderson, is that her tone, as she's been talking about Trump, is dripping with condescension.

So, they're saying no one would ever want to publicly say that they had sex with Trump. She's saying she just wanted to defend herself.What's important is whether the jury believes she is credible in her account of what happened in Tahoe.

That's why they had to get all those details because they wanted to establish that she remembers this and she is credible. You wanted to make more money, right, Necheles is asking.

Daniels acknowledges that Avenatti arranged for her appearance on CNN and The View, but said he took himself along for her. He took everything else for himself. And, of course, that's a nod to his embezzlement. Now, you have been paid almost $930,000, almost a million dollars. You capitalized by doing a strip club tour. That was the tour I was just talking, again, called Make America Horny Again. Daniels said she fought against the name on that tour, but they're showing the ways that she profited.I'm assuming on redirect, prosecutors will also show that again, as Kaitlan just said, she owes Trump hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The only thing that matters is this date, when the Access Hollywood tape came in, I'll use yellow and set October 7th, when she was paid, October 27th, right, then Election Day. That is what matters here, nothing else. I was not signing myself to anyone. She said I was performing at clubs and whoever wanted to pay admission. If everything is true and that she is, in fact, somebody who was trying to shake him down, somebody who wanted money from Donald Trump, somebody who would -- yes, who would stop at nothing to get the money or have this story come out, well, guess what? That paints the picture of somebody who was incentivized, who's running for president and says, I got to pay this person so it doesn't come out before the election.

She's being called Stormy Daniels. She's talking about all the things that she does and doesn't do. And by going and doing this cross-examination, in some ways, I think it can backfire because they're going to feel sorry for her. She owes this billionaire a half a million dollars. Look what he's done to her life. I mean, in some ways, yes, she made some money, but also her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, he's in prison for stealing from her.

We're talking about who has already been on the stand and thinking about what you actually need, because what you have to prove is the intent, the intent to actually commit another crime here, the idea of the timing of here, the falsified business entries here as to why. She's only on the stand to suggest not whether or not she actually had sex with Donald Trump. It doesn't even matter if she did to this jury. What matters, it should matter to the jury, is whether he thought she would expose that allegation before the actual election. She says, look, pretty sure this is hyperbole. If somebody is going to call me a toilet, I can say I'm going to flush the guy. She is going right back addressing the fact that she was no shrinking violet when it came to Donald Trump. I can only imagine right now what Donald Trump is doing in the courtroom. is he's slapping the elbows of attorneys saying to just do more?

We're told she had the glasses on her head. She's now wearing them looking at evidence. I want to also bring in Brian Stelter.

What is the proper way to deal with a bully? What do you do when a politician or a president is bullying you on Twitter? Well, we know what Stormy Daniels did. She punched back. She came up with the orange turd. I mean, these are lines that a Hollywood writer's room couldn't come up with, Anderson, but that is exactly what Stormy Daniels did, and she's proud of it. And I'm struck by how she's had so much time to prepare for this, right? She last talked to Donald Trump in 2007. Here we are in 2024. She was able to talk to you. She was able to write her book.

I know a lot of commentators have said that this went into graphic detail on Tuesday, maybe more detailed today, but she was actually very restrained on the stand compared to what she put in the book.And there were times she was quite sympathetic to Trump. It is striking the client maintenance point, to your point, Anderson.
