You can also see a very long table that I think everyone had hoped might have people having their picnics, their cream teas. Of course, it's not quite the weather for that. However, you can see lots of people are enjoying themselves. They're out here, there's some celebration, the champagne has already been popped. And I've been asking people what they felt about the ceremony. Many people watching of course in the pub undercover.And it was sadly something that the people I've spoken to really enjoy, they did join in with the homage to the King. They found that some of the moments particularly I think Prince William kissing his father was a very poignant one. And there are huge hopes that they will see a bit more particularly with that balcony scene coming up. Mixed feelings on whether they want to see more than just the King and the Queen and how extended that family is going to be. Now, we've just had a parade of the Chelsea Pensioners, who are the Army veterans. We're having another parade, Anderson, in the next hour. I do hope I can show you the next one.

We just saw King Charles and Queen Camilla greet the crowds from Buckingham Palace's balcony joined by many members of the royal family including Prince William, Princess Kate and their three kids.I want to bring in India Hicks who is second cousin and goddaughter of King Charles III. Her mother, Lady Pamela Mountbatten, was a lady in waiting to Queen Elizabeth II. Thank you so much for joining us on this day. Watching all this what are your -- what are your thoughts?",

We heard words that hadn't been said before, I am here to serve you. That's never been said in a thousand years of coronations. He is setting a different tone. So, my mother not being there but giving a seat to someone who's done unbelievable good because of the merit of their behavior rather than the rank, that's wonderful. That's how it should be.

Nobody imagined her father was going to die. She inherits the throne very, very young, very inexperienced, very naive. My goodness, what a reign that followed. But at that moment my mother described it as a romance and tragedy together. Today, it we saw very different. I thought we saw a man who is very recognized for who he is, what he said, his principles with a very strong wife behind him, 74 years of working off an apprenticeship to come to this role. So, we're seeing such, such different dynamics between mother and son already, as it should be. As it should be. And I think we should be feeling very confident about the king we have today.
