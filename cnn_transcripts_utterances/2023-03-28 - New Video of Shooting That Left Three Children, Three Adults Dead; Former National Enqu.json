Nothing seems to change except we keep getting more shootings and more students and innocent people just continue to die, children.So, we are tracking, obviously, what we saw what happened overnight, these developments in the Nashville school shooting. There is new video, new dispatch sound, new information about the minutes leading up to the murders of three children and three staff members inside their school. What you're about to see is disturbing. It is surveillance video that shows the shooter identified as a 28-year-old former student arriving at Covenant School, which is a small private Christian elementary school. The shooter had a handgun in two assault style weapons blasting through the entryway glass doors. That was at 10:10 A.M., and then climbing through -- that was just one minute later, okay? The shooter roamed the hallways, eventually taking six innocent lives. The first 911 call came in at 10:13. And 14 minutes later, the shooter was dead, also getting brand new information about the moments before the shooting from our affiliate, WTFV, a former middle school teammate says that the shooter reached out to her on Instagram minutes before the rampage. The shooter wrote about a plan to die by suicide and said the classmate would see it on the news. Part of the message here, okay, and I quote, one day, this will make more sense. I've left behind more than enough evidence behind, but something bad is about to happen, end quote. The teammate says that she called police at 10:13 A.M. At that point, the shooting had already begun . The teammate will join us live in just minutes here on CNN This Morning.",

He is the lead pastor here at the Covenant Presbyterian Church, that according to his former church. You're taking a look at a photo of young Hallie along with her father there, just an incredibly difficult photo to take a look at. As for the other victims in this shooting, we are talking about Evelyn Dieckhaus, nine years old, Hallie Scruggs, again, nine, William Kinney, nine. The three school staff members that were killed here have been identified as 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, she was a beloved as substitute teacher here, 60 year-old Katherine Koonce, she was the head of school here and 61-year-old Mike Hill, who was a custodian at the school. It appears, according to authorities, that the shooter here targeted these victims at random. We believe, at least according to some of the surveillance video, we have seen that it appears that the shooter may have encountered some of these folks as the shooter walked up and down the hallways at this school.

Now, with a potential indictment of his former client, former boss, former President Trump looming, David Pecker, who was one of the key players in this entire Stormy Daniels hush money case, testified for 90 minutes before the Manhattan grand jury on Monday. That is according to a source familiar with the proceeding.Pecker is the former publisher, of course, of The National Enquirer. He's a longtime Trump ally who helped broker the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Back in 2018, Pecker's company, American Media Inc, admitted that it did participate in what Cohen was referring to there, these catch and kill schemes to suppress damaging stories about Trump. Pecker has been granted immunity in the federal investigation in return for his grand jury testimony. He has now testified twice. Joining us now to talk about this is former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and former deputy attorney general for New York, Danya Perry, who previously represented Michael Cohen. All of those qualifications, of course, make you the perfect person to weigh in on this. You think it's significant that David Pecker went and testified for a second time yesterday. What do you think the significance of that is? DANYA PERRY, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  I do. He had been one of the first witnesses in this grand jury back in January, no doubt provided substantive testimony about the machinations between himself and Cohen, members of the campaign team. So, why did they bring him back is obviously the question on everyone's mind. And my assumption based on years of experience is that it was as a rebuttal witness following Cohen's testimony, Robert Costello, a former attorney for Cohen, testified.

So, I do think the prosecutors will put this to a vote.You know, it's anyone's guess when. The grand jury is meeting tomorrow, it could be tomorrow, because there's really nothing more to do. So, as long as they have a quorum of 16 grand jurors tomorrow, they can and I believe likely will put that to a vote. The only caveat to that is, of course, the unusual logistics that are involved in indicting and arraigning, arresting a former president and the security issues that go with that, in large part of Trump's own doing. So, I think, as soon as they can arrange whether arrest or it seems self surrender, I think that this indictment will come down.",

It's pretty one-sided presentation, generally, where the prosecutor puts on their best case. I think in this case, they put in a defense witness at the defendants or the targets request. And so they -- you know, it's a little more nuanced than usual, but everyone is familiar with the expression that, you know, prosecutors could indict a handstand sandwich, that's not too far from the truth. It's quite simple, you know, to get a true bill. And so I think all signs point to that. If a prosecutor has some premonition, some sense whether from juries, the jurors' questions or because the case didn't come in right, they don't have to put it to a vote. They can actually try and put in more evidence. So, that is why, you know, there are a bunch of baked in reasons why it's quite an easy matter to have a true bill returned.",
