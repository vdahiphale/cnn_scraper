Your answer here is Marie Curie. The Polish and French scientist was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in 1903, and played a major role in the discovery of radioactivity. Now, our next story is about a young woman who, when studying at MIT, noticed there weren`t a lot of women of color in her mechanical engineering classes. Then she realized the same was the case for the number of people working careers in STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. So she decided to do something about it, combining her passions for STEM and dance to intrigue and inspire the next generation and help them literally light up the stage. Yamilee Toussaint is one of our CNN heroes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
