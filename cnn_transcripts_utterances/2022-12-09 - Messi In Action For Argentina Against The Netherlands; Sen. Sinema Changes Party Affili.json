Croatia is now off to a semifinal for the Second World Cup in a row. Now, there was another game going on right now to determine who else will meet them in the next round. Argentina is up against The Netherlands and it could be the last time we see one of the game's greats, Lionel Messi an action at a World Cup.

Brazil heavy favorites not just to win on this day, but win the whole thing, win it for a sixth time. That was meant to be the storyline. The Croatians though, a population of less than four million, they did not read the script. This is how it all unfolded on a day of high drama in this one. All things looked rosy for the Brazilians when superstar Neymar goes in there in extra time. This, after the initial 90 was goalless and Neymar there with a play equaling 77th gold for his country, an all-time equaling mark. At this point, now, we didn't know that Croatia had it in them to get back in the game, but they do 117 minutes on the clock, their first shot on gold by my reckoning and what a moment for Bruno Petkovic there. It goes to the dreaded penalty shootout. You can see the anguish there on Neymar's face and so, it would prove as Rodrigo, crucially misses there for Brazil. His effort is saved and then utter despair at the end for Marquinhos, his effort hits the post. This is really, really sad scenes for the Brazilians there. But Croatia, wow. Croatia, what a moment for them. Neymar fighting back the tears. We would see -- you can see the tears there streaming down his face as he gazes upward. These are the scenes then, as we extend the big picture to Rio de Janeiro a short while ago, they are stunned there -- stunned and crying. This was not meant to be the day that it all panned out like this for Brazilian football. They can't believe it, you know. They can't believe it. But the other side of the coin, these scenes, Rahel, in Zagreb on Friday. We shouldn't be too surprised though. This is a nation that got to the final of the Russia 2018 tournament four years ago. Simply put, those Croatian players never know when they are beaten. They have a will and a resolve. They never give up and so it will prove, and we've been looking at the stats. We've been looking at exactly the mental fortitude that they display when it comes to penalty shootout. If we can put that graphic up now, I can show you exactly what I mean. They won two shootouts at Russia 2018 on route to getting to the final. And in this tournament so far, they've won another two. That's four in total across four calendar years. They also beat the English after extra time en route to getting to that final in Russia four years ago. But this is a historic moment, and I'll tell you what, food for thought for Brazilian football because now there will be no Argentina-Brazilian semifinal.",

It was a goal about 10 minutes or so before the halftime break, and it was brilliant from Lionel Messi, who we now know, Rahel, is most likely playing in his last ever World Cup at the age of 35. A stunning assist, almost a no-look pass, as they like to say, using American sporting parlance. He threaded it through the eye of a needle to Manuel Molina, a defender, a defensive player by trade who loves to get forward. He had a stunning finish and he puts Albiceleste, one nil up, as we speak against Holland at the moment.",

In the US meantime, Senate Democrats can no longer count next year on a 51- seat majority. That's after Krysten Sinema of Arizona said that she is registering as an Independent. Senator Sinema has been known to defy Democratic leaders. She put the brakes to their push for higher corporate taxes, for example, and saved the tax loophole for wealthy Americans. Now in an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, she said she is leaving the party, but that won't necessarily change much. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ):   I know some people might be a little bit surprised by this, but actually, I think it makes a lot of sense. You know, a growing number of Arizonans and people like me just don't feel like we fit neatly into one party's box or the other. And so, like many across the State in the nation, I've decided to leave that partisan process. While I intend to maintain my position on my Committees, and keep doing the work that I've been doing for Arizona. So I don't think that things will change in terms of how I operate or the work that I do in the United States Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Still, Sinema's departure adds a bit of uncertainty just days after the Georgia runoff that gave the Democrats a 51-seat margin. Melanie Zanona is on Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Well, I would say practically, it doesn't have all that much of an impact for Senate Democrats. That'sbecause Sinema is keeping her Democratic Committee assignments. She has also said, she is not going to change the way she votes, and even though she has been a wildcard in some instances, in important instances, she is a reliable Democratic vote most of that time. So what that means is that Democrats are going to maintain a mathematical advantage when it comes to both the floor and when it comes to Committees, and that is really important, because under this split 50/50, Senate GOP has to sign off on subpoenas, they can slow down nominees. And so really, with Sinema, she is essentially going to be caucusing with Democrats. But it is a big deal symbolically for Sinema to sever ties with the Democratic Party, and it is especially a big deal politically. Sinema was likely going to face a nasty primary challenge. She has been under a lot of pressure from the left. Now, this essentially eliminates the threat of a primary challenge because she's going to be running as an Independent. And I think right now, the question is for national Democrats. Are they going to line up behind Sinema and risk angering the base who wants to see a Democratic candidate in Arizona? Or are they going to line up behind the Democratic candidate and potentially risk this messy three-way primary -- we have a Democrat, a Republican, and an Independent. And so there are a lot of concerns that that could really essentially hand the seat over to Republicans, but those questions will come in due time. Right now, this conversation is definitely dominating the conversation in Washington. But we'll see how this plays out in the months and years ahead -- Rahel.",

U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner is back home. A state department official told CNN she landed in Texas earlier today after her release from Russian custody in a high-profile prisoner exchange. Griner was then taken to an Army Medical Center for a routine evaluation. Now in return for Griner in the U.S., the U.S. sent back Russian arms dealer Victor Bout. The Kremlin says that the exchange is not a sign of improvement in U.S.-Russia relations. U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk now says the situation in Ukraine is a \"human rights emergency.\" He added that almost 18 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance as Russia attacks the country civilian infrastructure.
