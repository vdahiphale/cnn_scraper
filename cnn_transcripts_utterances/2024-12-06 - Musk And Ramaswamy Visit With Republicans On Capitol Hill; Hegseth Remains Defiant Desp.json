They met with lawmakers Thursday. They, of course, have been tapped by Donald Trump to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE which, of course, isn't actually a government department at all. The initiative will sit outside the government. They won't have any actual power to make changes. Instead, they're going to make recommendations to the president. But that, of course, hasn't stopped the duo from proposing a totally overhauled federal budget. It's still unclear what might end up on the chopping block but according to Republicans who were in yesterday's meeting with Musk and Ramaswamy \"everything is on the table.\" Following the meeting CNN's Manu Raju tried to ask Musk whether certain social programs would be safe.

Sabrina, good morning. It's nice to see. What's your read on where this nomination stands? Because the reporting seems to be that Donald Trump isn't going out of his way necessarily to push him forward, but he's willing to let -- to watch him fight to see if he can do it. And there aren't very many senators right now who are coming out -- straight out saying they're going to vote no on Hegseth but there is a lot of concern behind the scenes. What are you hearing? SABRINA RODRIGUEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  I think right now we're in some level of a standstill and Trump is not going out of his way here. It's not that we're seeing Trump come out defiantly in support of Pete Hegseth. He's clearly letting him kind of have to navigate and do the jostling on Capitol Hill. We've seen him throughout this week meeting with senators across the board -- across the Republican Party but especially some of those who he knows have reservations about him. We haven't heard those senators come out either saying that OK, he sold me. OK, he talked about the allegations of misconduct against women or the drinking, and just all of those allegations. And we haven't heard people come out and say OK, no -- now I have no reservations. I'm ready to support him. So really, the reality is we've had the reporting earlier this week about Trump have conversations about potentially replacing him with Ron DeSantis and potentially replacing him with Congressman Michael Waltz. So it's clear that Trump is kind of letting this simmer, letting this see how this plays out. But it's clear also that Trump is not above moving on to someone else if need be.",

But the rocket launches we were able to see were all SpaceX launches. And we saw a number of them in just a week's time when we were down there.What is it about SpaceX and the things that they have to deal with that make it different from what NASA is able to do? COWING:  Well, what you're seeing with the SpaceX rockets, it's a consumer product. Elon Musk came from the Silicon Valley world. He -- it's a continuous improvement process. These things are designed to be upgraded and reused, thrown away, and improved. And they put some thought into how that -- what the customer needs and how to adapt it. NASA's rockets have one use and one use only. You don't get them back. They cost far too much and the more they cost and the more they're delayed, the fewer they can launch. So you have to completely opposing takes on how to launch things into space. And again, those of us in the space community are saying well, can I have some of that Space X stuff and I maybe don't want that other stuff that NASA's been building.",

And they don't know any better than to try to make this fantasy reality, and we're seeing that every day. So you have that new space, as they call it, trend going while you have the old way of NASA doing things, and there is a conflict. And NASA has sought to take a new approach to a lunar lander from SpaceX and one from Blue Origin. That's just the beginning. But the real question now is with a new administration coming in with Mr. Musk having some influence and somebody he knows well as the nominee to be NASA administrator, I think you're going to see some changes.
