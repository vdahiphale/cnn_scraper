I think that you could see this coming as of a couple of weeks ago. At the convention, there should have been, if they were a party that was hedging bets, a lot more talk about Kamala Harris. They should have probably been ready with ads. This is not hard blocking and tackling to see what was coming down the pike here.The idea that the Democratic Party is not respecting the will of its voters, its voters in July of 2023, a plurality did not want Joe Biden to run again. I mean, that was one of the things I was talking about in those initial essays. Democratic primary voters like all voters felt Joe Biden was too old to be an effective president in a second term and have said that repeatedly for a very long time. It was Democratic elites who are very slow to coming to this conclusion. They sort of supported Biden in running unopposed and not doing interviews and not doing debates. That's not a coverup. His team thought he was stronger than he was that's why they accepted and negotiated for the early June debate. But I mean, if you are looking at Democratic polling right now, if you are following Democrats on social media, the outpouring of like actual passion and enthusiasm for Harris is far beyond what the top levels of the Democratic Party were expecting. I mean, I can tell you for a fact that really a week ago, I mean, you know, the Sunday morning that Biden end up dropping out later that day on, Democrats are still very worried about Kamala Harris, still very worried if she could step into his shoes, still very worried about how she played in the Midwest. That last one is still an open question for them. But in terms of how the party is feeling, because that's an attack aimed at the Democratic Party's base, the party has a kind of enthusiasm and verb, and a vibe shift that I don't think I've ever seen the structure of political sentiment change with this rapidity, within 48 hours in my entire career as a journalist.",

I mean, as you know better than anyone, this is a race that's going to be decided in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, potentially she might expand the maps on to Arizona, to Georgia, to North Carolina, right? That's where this race is going to happen. And so far Biden has been a little bit further down in the battleground states than he is nationally.That has looked very similar in polling of Harris. Again, like I want to see how that looks from the next two weeks. But Harris is now going to have a series of opportunities to introduce herself to the public as a function of timing or a strategic question of timing. The fact that the shift in the Democratic Party happened after the Republican convention, after they had sort of taken that opportunity and used what they had on Joe Biden and not her. It puts Democrats in a very advantageous position. They're going to be people to have this whole convention introducing her and where they want to go to the entire country with the entire lineup of national Democrats behind her, Obama, Biden, Clinton, et cetera. And that's going to be significant. The question is, what foot she puts forward, who does she want to be? What is the version of Kamala Harris she wants people to know? And where does she break with what has been coming before her? In terms of what it's going to reshape the race, I think that's really the core set of questions.",

But that the Biden ministration's record, and Democrats don't always like to admit this, is not popular. So she needs answers I think on both how to sell the Biden administration's record better than Biden himself has been able to do. I think some of that will be there in her communication skills.But there are actual difficulties there, particularly I think around inflation and immigration. And then she's going to need the question of, well what would she do first? My suspicion from how she's running right now is the first defense is going to be Roe and abortion, right? If she had the trifecta that she will restore the protections of Roe, the place where she really found her footing in the administration was around that, and as much as Donald Trump will try to make this election about immigration, she's going to try to make it about Dobbs. But there's also the question of her as an economic messenger and people do vote heavily on the economy, on their own personal situation around affordability. And that I think is the biggest weakness for her. The Biden administration has really suffered from inflation, from an affordability crisis that has been building for a long time behind inflation, and housing and elder care and childcare. And she's going to need an answer and a policy set for why people should believe that a future with Harris is going to be more affordable than the past has been in their experience with Joe Biden.",

And they only became full believers in globalization as in free trade, free capital movements and free population movements after the Cold War was ended.

Because there ought to be some given what's happening.Since China joined the World Trade Organization, which was 2001, it was after that that you had this tremendous decline in manufacturing jobs in the American heartland. Plus, you had the population rising, rising, foreign born share of the population rapidly rising towards its previous peak, which was back in the late 19th century.

It's a protectionist one. He argues that tariffs are a good thing as a source of revenue and as a negotiating tool with trading partners.He's very clear that he sees currency wars as the way in which Asian countries, not only China, but before that Japan, have been able to compete successfully against American manufacturing. And so, it's a quite sophisticated argument and it shows that Trump is more connected than people realize to that 19th century tradition. He explicitly says, I see myself as being like President William McKinley. And I think the tariff of 1890 is what I'm all about. Now, this is definitely not the Donald Trump of social media. This is a quite serious attempt to recast Republicanism in its 19th century form. So, nobody should underestimate that Donald Trump has a serious ideological vision of a conservatism, Republicanism rooted in the 19th century tradition. And I think it's quite an appealing kind of Republicanism for a substantial number of voters, particularly in the heartland state. ZAKARIA: And in picking J.D.

This will enable users to create custom emojis, find a photo by describing it, and communicate with Siri more easily. Google recently introduced A.I. Overviews to produce a concise answer to a search query rather than just a list of links.There really are endless ways A.I. could make our lives easier but the massive expansion of A.I. has a hidden cost. It uses massive amounts of energy. Everyone knows that when machines do task for humans, they use energy. If you ride an elevator instead of walking up the stairs, that takes electricity. A farmer who uses a combine harvester instead of picking crops by hand has to burn fuel. But people seem to forget this obvious fact when it comes to labor saving devices of a less tangible kind, consider A.I. image generation tools. You type a prompt and it produces an image something that would take much more time and effort for a human artist. But off at some data-center computer chips are chugging away to create that image, consuming electricity in the process. One study found that generating four of the images you just saw takes as much electricity as fully charging your smartphone. Producing texts like ChatGPT takes less energy than producing images, but consider the scale. Last year, researchers said ChatGPT was receiving hundreds of millions of queries daily. Filling all those requests consumed enough electricity to power 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. households for an entire day. Google's new A.I. summaries are thought to use 10 to 30 times the energy of a normal search. A.I. drinks up energy because it's essentially an electronic brain. You may be surprised to learn that the human brain, despite its small size, consumes 20 percent of a person's energy load. Tech companies' voracious appetite for more energy is already putting strain on the grid. One utility reported bidding wars over data center sites with ready access to power. Wells Fargo estimates that A.I. will use less than one percent of all U.S. power this year but projects that could grow by more than tenfold by 2030. Earlier this year, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI which makes ChatGPT, said this to Bloomberg. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
