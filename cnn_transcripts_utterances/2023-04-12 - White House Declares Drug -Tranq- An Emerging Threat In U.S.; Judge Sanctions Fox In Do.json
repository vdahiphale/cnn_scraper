I'm standing outside the Delaware Superior Court here in Wilmington, where a judge just imposed a sanction against Fox News and its attorneys. This is all about whether the right-wing network withheld evidence from Dominion in its defamation case.Now Dominion accuses Fox of misrepresenting to the court the true role of Rupert Murdoch within the company and of withholding key materials as part of the discovery process. The judge was not happy, and he seemed to agree with some of Dominion's arguments. He imposed this sanction against Fox. That's going to allow Dominion to take additional depositions of Fox witnesses if they want to. Fox is going to need to make those witnesses available and pay for the depositions. Not only that, guys, but the judge said he's going to appoint a special master to investigate Fox, to look into the possibility that they have misled the court and withheld key material like emails or text messages that Dominion is legally allowed to get as part of the case. For its part, Fox denies that it did anything wrong. Fox says they didn't defame anyone, and Fox says that they never withheld anything from anyone. But guys, this is all unfolding on literally the eve of the trial. Jury selection is supposed to start tomorrow morning. So, there's a tremendous amount of drama. It has not been a very good day for Fox, and there is much more to come here in Wilmington -- guys.",

But you've seen Elon Musk effectively spit in the face, if you will, of news organizations, not just NPR, other news organizations. And they've acted a lot differently. It'll be interesting to see whether this sort of is the first domino to fall now and whether other news organizations follow suit.

His wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will remain in the U.S. with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.Now, we don't know why Meghan isn't attending. But we do know that she was invited. But she has the excuse that it's Archie's birthday. It falls, in fact, on the same day as the coronation. One thing is certain, though, without Meghan here it will be less of a media circus at a moment of such significance for the royal family and for the King. But it does show, doesn't it, the rift within the royal family and the unresolved issues as well as the tensions. And for Harry, well, this will be the first time he will be seeing the royal family since his bombshell memoir \"Spare,\" and its spectacular fall out and the interviews that followed because of that. And in that memoir, if you remember ladies, he talks about a desire to sit down with senior members of the royal family. We don't know whether that's going to happen. We also don't know what role Harry will play in that coronation. Where he will sit. Whether he will appear at the balcony after the coronation. And all this is important because it will tell us whether the differences are being put aside. For now, perhaps it's not being seen as a family reunion, but as a moment of reconciliation. Of course, to see his father crowned as King Charles III -- Erica, Bianna.",
