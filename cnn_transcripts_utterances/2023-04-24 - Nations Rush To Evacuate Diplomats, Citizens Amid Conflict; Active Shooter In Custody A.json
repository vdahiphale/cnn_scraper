The Biden administration says that U.S. special forces have now carried out a risky rescue operation, safely getting embassy staff and their families out of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. This is a photo of Secretary of State Antony Blinken monitoring that operation unfold from the White House.As the violence escalates in that country, the U.S. government is warning an estimated 16,000 Americans remaining there, many if we look dual citizens, in a large-scale operation to evacuate the ones who want to leave is not happening for now. But the U.S. says \"actively facilitating the exit of Americans in other ways.\" More from the White House in a moment. But first, CNN's Sam Kiley, he's in Djibouti, where this operation originated. Sam, this seems like a global retreat. SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): A global retreat, I think it's exactly the right way to put it. And if you see behind me here, we have a French Air Force, long-distance cargo plane. That has been, we understand, on about four rotations into Khartoum. The French have evacuated close to 500 people. In the distance beyond that, that is an RAF aircraft. Similarly, the British have -- they joined the Americans indeed. British Special Forces were taken in by Americans during the American evacuation of their diplomats at the beginning of the operation at the weekend, taking out about a hundred people. Both the United States and the United Kingdom though, being criticized quite bitterly by their own citizens, for what in their words, has been something of a failure to get those other people out. The people who are not diplomats. The people who are not lucky enough to be wealthy are able to get a vehicle out to a mustering point. Now, over in this direction here at Djibouti International Airport, down you can see what a major hub for military it has become. There are five or six Hercules and similar aircraft, the kind of flying trucks of the military world, they're parked over there. They're part of this a multinational evacuation effort that has included Special Forces from Japan, South Korea, all the way through the Middle East, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and of course, the United States. The problem is now that with the escalating fighting in Sudan, how do you get all of those other foreign nationals out? That would be a land move. And there's no yet -- there's not any clear planning as to how they're going to manage that or even if they're going to.",

The administration's decision-making and next steps.CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now. I wonder what the administration thinks happens now in particular. You've gotten the government personnel out, it's about a hundred people. But you got 16,000 U.S. citizens, many of them dual nationals, are there plans for that? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. That's the big question right now, Jim. As you said, the U.S. government estimates that there could be around 16,000 American citizens in Sudan, but the Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, said that there are dozens of Americans who have expressed an interest to the U.S. government in getting evacuated. Now, the National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, he just briefed reporters moments ago and he said that the U.S. is actively facilitating the departure of Americans from Sudan not however with any kind of military operation. That for now appears to be off the table. But he says the U.S. is facilitating the evacuation with overhead intelligence and some other means. Listen to him just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Noting, of course, that the situation in Afghanistan was very different with the war ending there and U.S. military already on the ground.Now, there is an ongoing calculation -- calculus on a daily basis here from the White House in terms of what more the U.S. could do. Sullivan said that President Biden has asked for every conceivable option to help Americans get out. For now, it appears that it -- that role is limited to overhead intelligence and also working with other countries that are having some of these land base convoys leaving Khartoum and heading to the port of Sudan. Also naval assets being positioned there. Now, the White House says that this is a very dynamic situation here and that they are holding out hope that there could eventually be a protracted ceasefire. But they also know that there is a real risk of a protracted conflict on the ground in Sudan, Jim.",

SANCHEZMcCarthy is ready to hold a vote on his plan which would raise the debt ceiling for a year but it's paired with spending cuts that would take a hatchet to Biden's domestic agenda. That is a non-starter for the White House. And Biden is refusing to negotiate. Part of his reasoning is that the debt limit has been raised dozens of times under Republican and Democratic presidents over decades with zero conditions. Just this century, it's been raised or suspended 20 times, including three times under former President Trump and once already under Biden. Let's take you live to Capitol Hill now with CNN's Manu Raju. Manu, this is shaping up to be a major moment for McCarthy. He's vowing that there is going to be a vote this week and that his Republican caucus is going to send the budget over to the Senate. MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. And he does believe that he will eventually get the votes for that this week. At the moment though, it's unclear if they have to earn 18 votes yet because, behind the scenes over the last several days, the House Republican leadership team led by the whips operation have been reaching out to all corners of the House Republican conference to get them in line, to get 218 votes to pass the House. That means Kevin McCarthy cannot afford to lose more than four Republican votes. If he does that, this won't pass because Democrats are opposing this measure in lockstep. Many of them say -- agree with the White House's position saying that the debt limit should be increased without any conditions attached. But the Republicans have a lot of conditions as part of their plan, including spending cuts across the board and federal agencies, new work requirements on social safety nets programs like Medicaid, as well as key Republican priorities such as pulling back funding for the IRS as well as trying to stop President Biden's student loan forgiveness program, all part of an effort to entice conservative members to get on board. I am told though, Boris, there have been concerns voiced behind the scenes including pulling back ethanol tax breaks, which is part of the plan. And some conservatives wanting to go further on those proposed Medicaid work requirements. But the Republican leadership is saying they are not going to change this bill as they tried to push their conference to fall in line, Boris.",

What are you learning?ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, this situation is still developing. But right now, officials in Midwest City which is just outside of Oklahoma City, just east -- just east of the city say that there is one male victim that has died and that the shooter is in custody. Within the last hour, Rose State College officials have been urging students on campus and administrators to shelter in place while police are on the scene there. From aerial footage from that campus here in the last few minutes, we've seen a heavy police presence there on the campus. One of the aerial shots also did capture what appears the body of a person laying on the ground next to a campus building.

American Airlines flight 1958. It was on its way to Phoenix from Columbus airport in Ohio. And they experienced this really, really low. And so, that really adds a whole another layer of risk here. Passengers heard the pulsing sound of the backfiring right engine there. They also heard it on the ground. The aviation enthusiast even captured this from the ground up as one was out on a jog.
