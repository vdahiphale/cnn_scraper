It's also known as the extreme risk protection order. It was passed just a few years ago in 2019. And what it allows is it allows family members, roommates, friends or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily take away a person's firearms if they are deemed too dangerous to themselves or others. And if a judge grants that petition, a court hearing will be held before decision is made to seize those weapons.As we first told you yesterday, police arrested the Club Q suspect in connection with a bomb threat that he had made that led to a standoff with his mother just a year ago. But there's no evidence that the police, or any family members, or anyone surrounding the suspected shooter attempted to use this red flag law that could have temporarily stripped him of his weapons. So, we asked the Colorado attorney general, you'll remember, yesterday morning, about why. And this is what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet, according to Kaiser Health News, as of last June, 20 of the 37 counties in Colorado that publicly took a stand against this red flag law actually used it, El Paso County being one of them.

This is the father of the suspect's mother, Laura Voepel.Randy Voepel attracted attention when he compared the January 6th attack on the Capitol to the revolutionary war. Where is what he said. He said this is Lexington and Concord, first shots fired against tyranny. Tyranny will follow in the aftermath of the Biden swear-in on January 20th. Now, he later tried to walk that back, saying he didn't condone the violence that took place that Wednesday at the Capitol, and it's not clear at this point what kind of interactions this 22-year-old suspect had with his grandfather, but we are learning a little bit more about his family.",

And his father, Gregory, was charged with conspiracy. But a grand jury just indicted both men on attempted murder and conspiracy charges. Gibson spoke to CNN about the incident back in February comparing his case to that of Ahmaud Arbery that was in Georgia, the 25-year-old black man who was murdered by three white men nearly Brunswick, Georgia in 2020.

Most people will get it at some point in their childhood, and many people that causes very mild symptoms of cold. But in some cases, it's more severe. There is no treatment for RSV. There's nothing that makes it go away faster. The treatments are aimed at dealing with the symptoms.And so the main reason that children would need to come into the hospital, if the symptoms are severe enough, as you saw in the video, they're having respiratory distress that they might need extra oxygen, for example. So, the kinds of things that you saw here, this baby whose belly moving out when they breathed, head bobbing, pulling in their muscles, those are signs that a parent would need to seek medical care. The first step might be their pediatrician's office or an urgent care or emergency department to get checked out to see whether or not they actually need to go into the hospital. Our hospitals, we are operating at capacity, but we do -- are able to accommodate those babies. Sometimes they have to wait a while. Sometimes we're treating patients in the emergency department for a longer period of time. We are opening up alternate areas within the hospital that might not be used on the nights and weekends to accommodate those babies so we can take care of them, but those are the kinds of things that a parent would look for to indicate that, yes, maybe I should go in.",

So, look, just to put this in context, it was Sunday night that the staff learned that the old Bob, Bob Iger, would be coming back. By Monday evening, there was a memo sent to employees essentially announcing changes. So, one of the big changes is that one of the top executives, Kareem Daniels, he is going to be stepping down. He led the median entertainment division, who is also a Chapek ally, Chapek being the new Bob.We also learned in that memo that over the coming weeks, there will be more organizational and operating changes at the company, i.e., more to come there. And we're also just learning that streaming will likely be much more of a focus heading into this Disney+, of course. So, earlier this month, Disney reported that they lost $1.5 billion in the quarter, still adding subscribers, but those type of losses, there's not really an appetite for that in this investing market.

And then just in November, they made this sudden 180.What we're now seeing and reporting from the Financial Times this morning is that, apparently, there was a staff rebellion from top executives over the summer who were Iger allies. And so it seems to make sense because just within the last few months, things took a real sudden shift.
