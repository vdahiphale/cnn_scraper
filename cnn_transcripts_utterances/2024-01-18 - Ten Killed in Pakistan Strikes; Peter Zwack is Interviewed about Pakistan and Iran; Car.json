And it totally shocks the Pakistani ruling establishment, which calls it basically a disruption of Pakistan's sovereignty, says at least two children were killed in the strikes.And there are calls for retaliation. And that's what a number of hours ago the Pakistani military basically claimed responsibility for, saying that it fired, quote, \"killer drones, rockets, loitering munitions and standoff weapons\" into Iranian territory after targets that it claimed were ethnic Baluch separatist militants who they accuse of having operated from across this very long and porous border. So, it's a messy situation. The Pakistanis seem to be leaving the door open to some kind of de-escalation right now. And the ball does appear to be in Iran's court, though Pakistan has withdrawn its ambassador from Tehran and it has said that Iran's ambassador to the Pakistani capital is not really welcome at this time. So, this really is a diplomatic crisis between these two neighbors who basically didn't have any beef more than 48 hours ago.",

This is the video. This is the Pakistani strike inside Iran. And then the Iranian strike inside Pakistan was about here.With us now to discuss is retired General Peter Zwack. He is a global fellow at the Wilson Center and served as U.S. senior defense attache to the Russian Federation. Again, Pakistan is a nuclear power, General. Iran, frankly, about to be a nuclear power. An exchange of fire back and forth here, what's the U.S. interest in this? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, the U.S. interest in this is tremendous. Obviously, we will - we will watch closely. Our diplomats certainly are working behind the scenes. Certainly with Pakistan. Remember, Pakistan and India had a near miss potentially nuclear wise in 2019. But when you look, John, at the whole aggregate of the Middle East and now central Asia, from the Mediterranean all the way to Iran, Pakistan, Baluchistan, almost the Afghan border, and then strikes and hits in Beirut, in Damascus, in Kharman (ph) in Iran near the Pakistani border, and now you have Pakistan and Iran. Yes, this is really, really dangerous. Not to mention Yemen and the ongoing horror in Gaza.",

They're still going after installations. They're going after the anti-ship (ph) missile launching sites and drone locations. So, it's been measured in that way.Yet the Houthis go out, they've hit a couple of container ships recently, including a U.S. flagged one. And I worry that a lot of -- you have a lot of stuff flying in the air. Something eventually hits. And what happens when one of those missiles hits a U.S. or coalition ship or entity or base and people are killed in this level of tension all around that I've described in the whole Middle East and now central Asia.",

And while the Houthis have their own mind, they probably would slow down. But they're not getting that guidance from Iran and other nations, bigger nations.Why doesn't Russia put pressure on Iran to put pressure on the Houthis to knock it off if they really, really believe there should be peace in the region?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so shortly E. Jean Carroll will be back on the stand today, resuming cross-examination by Donald Trump's attorneys. And as you say, he won't be in the room today, so that will be a different dynamic than yesterday. It was -- Carroll was testifying when questioned by her attorneys she was explaining the impact of the statements that Trump made when he denied that he raped her, said that she was a liar, and made up the story to sell her book.And that's when we saw Trump beginning to react to that. He -- she said that he had shattered her reputation. And he was shaking his head side to side. And then he continued during her testimony to look toward his lawyer, whispering to her, as Carroll was explaining as a result of his statements she received numerous threats. Some of them, she said, she felt that her life was in danger. She said at some point that she thought that she was going to get shot. And she increased her own security members buy buying bullets for a gun that she kept by her bed and letting her Pitbull roam her yard to serve as sort of a patrol for her. So, she was explaining all this. Trump commenting often to his lawyer. Then, when the jury had left, Carroll's attorney brought this up to the judge saying that they - where they were sitting could hear Trump saying words such as witch hunt and fraud and they were concerned that the jury would be able to hear that as well. And at that point the judge had said to Trump, you know, he had a right to be in the courtroom, but he could forfeit that right if he didn't behave in the decorum that's expected. Trump saying at that point, I would love it. The judge saying, I know you would. Eventually, they took a break for lunch, and Trump came back and there were no additional challenges to that. But even Trump's attorney was asking the judge to recuse himself from this case, saying that there was general hostility toward the Trump team. But the judge, Lewis Kaplin, said in one word, denied, and the testimony continued. So, Carroll will be back on the stand. Just expected to be for about a half hour this morning. And then her lawyers will call their other witnesses. They intend to call an expert in reputational harm to testify about the money amount that she could potentially receive from this jury in damages as well as Carroll's former editor in chief at \"Elle\" magazine, where she wrote the column for so many years.

That did not occur.\" All right, we are still, obviously, poring through the details of this report, but the conclusion, again, this was a federal investigation into the state and local response. It seems to be this was a clear failure of law enforcement. A failure to react to what was happening on the ground instead of going in, straight in with force, they waited outside, treating this as an individual barricade who would not do more harm in that 77 minutes.
