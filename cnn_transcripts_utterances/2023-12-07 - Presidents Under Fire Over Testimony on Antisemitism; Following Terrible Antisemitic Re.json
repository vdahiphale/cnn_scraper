From alumni, from donors, from current students, political leaders on both sides of the aisle, including Pennsylvania's Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro. CEO of Pfizer Albert Bourla called it, one of the most despicable moments in the history of U.S. academia. But listen to this from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Calls for genocide are unacceptable. It's vile. And it -- it's counter to everything this country stands for. I can't believe I even have to say that. I can't believe I even have to say that. I shouldn't have to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The president of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill, put out a video on Twitter. Harvard's president, Claudine Gay, put out a statement. MIT's president has not yet responded.But take a listen -- take a look at what they had to say in brief. Let me be clear, calls for violence are vile, that coming from Claudine Gay at Harvard. We are combating such hate with immediate and comprehensive action, said Liz Magill from University of Pennsylvania. She also said that the school's policies need to be re-evaluated and reviewed. What this really came down to was a fight over speech and whether speech alone is or should be punishable. And these three presidents declining to directly answer whether calls for genocide against Jews would amount to bullying or harassment. Under the university's codes of conduct angered a lot of people. They thought this should be an easy answer. They instead wanted to focus a good deal on free speech, and the constitution, and these First Amendment issues that have certainly been riling college campuses for several years now. But that is not what people wanted to hear. They said they missed the moment here and they needed to have a definitive response to this, this question about whether genocide is bullying or harassment.",

I just came back from a trade mission to Australia where the Australians would gladly trade for our economy, and this is true across the world. But people did see prices rise and they don't necessarily decline. You don't see deflation. So, I think that's a part of it.And I think a lot of times the data, whether real wages are up, which they are, it's hard to see that immediately. But it will become clear. I think folks recognize the high unemployment rates, the inability to deal with the COVID pandemic that we saw under the previous president. We're not going back to that. So, I think it's just more messaging. I think there's a drumbeat. I see it here. We have positive economic news. We see a Mayo Clinic invest $5 billion and Republicans try and find a reason that that's a bad thing. So, I just think this is the nature that we're in. We're going again, as I say this, it is not going to be an imaginary. You know, it could be better, or we could have this special candidate who would do it. It is going to be Donald Trump and the dysfunction and the things that they did versus Joe Biden's positive vision to help the middle class. So, I'm confident it'll get there. It's not that unusual.

What was the motivations for this? So, the investigation is going to take multiple aspects, multiple areas. They're going to look at everything. They're going to interview all of this -- all the persons that he talked to within the last one, two years to determine was their signs? Where their red flags? Whether this -- you know, why he was not accepted to work there at the university at UNLV. Determine -- they're going to look at all his electronic devices, his phones, his laptops. Try and get into his mind the days before, the hours before and see if there was some sort of motivation to this.
