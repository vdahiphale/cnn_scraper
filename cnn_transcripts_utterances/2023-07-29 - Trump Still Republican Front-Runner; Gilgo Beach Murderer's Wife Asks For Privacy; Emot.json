Kyiv say it is has also repelled Russian attempts to regain some of the lost ground in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON (voice-over): This is part of the footage that reportedly shows Ukrainians clearing Russian positions near Bakhmut. Kyiv is continuing its push north and south. It says the situation is very tense. Salma Abdelaziz joins us now. You have been talking for days now about Ukraine's counteroffensive and how it is going. Secretary of state Antony Blinken has weighed in again today with blunt language about Russia searching far and wide for new weapons of war. What more are you learning?",

The Africa-Russia summit is taking place right now.Actually just a short time ago, President Putin was meeting with Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, as the Kremlin tries, again, to hold on to any friends, any allies across the globe. It is, of course, a country that is increasingly isolated and this week the other country that President Putin reached out to is North Korea. A delegation, a Russian delegation including the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, was in Pyongyang to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War. President Putin sent -- delivered remarks to North Korean officials on, that thanking them for their firm support of what he calls is special military operation in Ukraine. As you said, the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, saying that these are desperate attempts, again to hold on to friends. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I strongly doubt he's there on holiday. We're seeing Russia desperately looking for support for weapons wherever they can find them to prosecute its aggression against Ukraine. And we see that in North Korea. We see that as well with Iran, which has provided many drones to Russia that it's using to destroy civilian infrastructure and kill civilians in Ukraine. China has assured us repeatedly -- and not just us, many other countries -- that it is not providing material lethal assistance to Russian use in Ukraine. And we take those assurances very seriously.

And, of course, Beijing remains, although it has, as you heard there, promised not to provide material support to President Putin.

As I have written before, Odessa basically has two industries. One is the port and the other is the tourism industry, the night life, restaurants, bars. Both are suffering very, very badly. You can see it on the faces of neighbors walking down the street. You can especially see the pain on the faces of the owners of small- and medium-sized businesses. I have a lot of friends in that sector. Some of them have left. Some of them are saying we can only hang on a few months longer because the economy has been so battered by the threat of Russian strikes. And then the port, aside from being a huge channel for Ukrainian grain exports, the noises from the port provide comfort to people because it's such a big industry here. It's spread across educational institutions. People come here to learn how to work in the maritime sector. So it's had huge ramifications.",

Same thing is happening now but on a much more physical scale. I just walked through that neighborhood yesterday, Paula. And, for example, I will give you a real, tangible example. There is a music school that has been there forever. Students actually board there and it was very badly damaged. And music is a huge thing here in Odessa and people being denied access to that. Also, many places you go in Ukraine, now the statues, the monuments are shrouded or taken away. So that also denies people access to the culture and history. And finally, of course, no lack of stories of Russian troops looting museums and other cultural places on a scale of the Nazis in the previous war. And so it is really damaging.
