Of course, as you noted, he will be in Nevada later, which is considered a battleground state. But when it comes to Aurora Colorado, this has really been the epicenter of some of the disinformation around migrants that we have heard from Donald Trump over this campaign cycle. He has said repeatedly that Aurora is an area that is overrun by Venezuelan gain, something that we have heard an enormous amount of pushback from local officials on, including the governor of Colorado, who say that's just simply not true. But obviously he is using this as an opportunity to amplify this rhetoric about migrants. And as these local officials have -- there's been an enormous amount of backlash to Trump coming here today. We also are following an event where local officials in Michigan were criticizing the former president after he was in Detroit yesterday and decided to criticize the city of Detroit. Take a listen.
