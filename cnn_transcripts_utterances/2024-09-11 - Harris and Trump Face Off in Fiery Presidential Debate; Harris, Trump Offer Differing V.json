It's Wednesday, September 11th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have wrapped up their first presidential debate. And the Harris campaign is apparently so pleased with her performance, it's calling for a second debate next month.The vice president surprised her Republican rival by walking over to shake his hand at the outset. Harris repeatedly baited Trump on issues like crowd size and the January 6th insurrection. Trump tried to score points on the economy and immigration, but he's being widely criticized for a false and outrageous claim that Haitian migrants in Ohio are catching and eating family pets.

In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating, they're eating the pets of the people that live there.

What do you make of her strategy and of the performance of both? THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Christine. I think you're absolutely right. What most struck me is that Harris was almost always on offense. Trump was almost always on defense. Harris made the debate a referendum on Trump in his first four years in office, which is exactly what she wanted to do. I mean, there were no shortage of opportunities for Trump to call out Harris's evolution on policies, whether that was on immigration, on fracking, on health care. But he was never able to pin her down on those issues. Instead, he let Harris dictate the tone of the debate. He spent his time on irrelevant issues, as was mentioned, like defending the size of his crowds at MAGA rallies. I think he let Harris get under his skin.

I don't think she talked as much on policies as maybe she could have, but at the same time, maybe that's not a bad thing for her. She released on Sunday a set of policies for the first time on her internet site, basically saying where she stood on immigration, on healthcare, on climate, on education, and so on. And I think Americans do have a better sense of who she is now than before. I mean, of course, she was in a very unusual position insofar as she didn't have to run a typical primary campaign.

Do you feel that anything has been fundamentally altered by this debate? GIFT: Yes, I mean, that's a non-trivial number that you just cited. At the same time, you know, Americans have really short attention spans and something could happen today, something could happen tomorrow that really shifts their attention to some other issue. This race is so close. I mean, if you look at the polls, 47, 46, 46, 48, just depends on kind of what poll you're looking at. On the margins, pretty much everything matters. So this debate definitely could matter, could give Kamala Harris some momentum going into these final weeks of the campaign, but I'm still not sure if this fundamentally changes the landscape of the race.

But we do also notice a marked difference in Ukraine's foreign policy posture. If we look back to this past week, the Rammstein meeting where, of course, new weapons packages for Ukraine were decided upon. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine went to that meeting personally to try and lobby the allies to give not only more weapons, but specifically also lobby the United States to lift some of those restrictions. And that's definitely something that Secretary of State Blinken can also expect so when he comes here to Kyiv, for the Ukrainians to say, look, we need to be able to strike deeper into Russian territory. We need to be able to hit some of those airfields from which the Russians are launching frontline bombers that are so devastating right now to Ukrainian frontline positions, and also to be able to hit some of those Russian frontline troops that are staging in the areas on Russian territory. So all of those things are definitely things that the Ukrainians have on their mind and something that they've already put to the Biden administration, for instance, in Rammstein, but also when Ukraine's defense minister went to Washington DC a couple of weeks ago to provide the U.S. with the targets that the Ukrainians want to hit and ask for permissions to be able to use those longer distance weapons to do exactly that -- Christina.",

And what we heard from the former president, Donald Trump, was really an attack.We didn't hear what he would do to push forward a ceasefire in Gaza. He didn't actually ask the question, but he did attack Vice President Harris by saying she hates Israel, by saying that Israel could collapse within two years if she was president. And you could see, even though the mics were muted, which was part of the rules of this debate, you could lip read the vice president saying, oh, come on, when he said that, trying to dismiss that. It worth pointing out that Trump didn't actually offer any evidence for what he was saying there. He then went on to say she hates the Arab population, saying it would be disastrous and the whole place is going to get blown up. So what we saw from Trump was a complete attack without evidence and some baseless accusations, but he didn't actually say what he would do to push the ceasefire forward, saying that it would never have happened in the first place if he were president. When it comes to the Vice President, Kamala Harris, we heard something that she has been saying for some time now that it is Israel's right to self-defense. They do have that right saying we would, insinuating that the U.S. would do exactly the same had it come under attack the way that Israel did on October 7th, but also saying there has to be a ceasefire deal. There's very little space between her and the U.S. President Joe Biden when it comes to this. Although with this ceasefire hostage deal, we have heard from Biden administration officials recently acknowledging that they're not as close as they would hope to be at this point. And she then pushed on to say we have to chart the course for the two-state solution. Now we have had one response from Israel, from the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, and he said what he saw was two leaders on stage arguing about who was more pro-Israel.
