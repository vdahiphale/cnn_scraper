And she spent a lot of time at the Carter's house, as you can see here, because she was friends with Carter's sister. Their first date was back in 1945, and Carter told his mom that Rosalynn would be the woman that he was going to marry, all the way back then. She didn't accept his proposal at first. She wanted him to graduate from the Naval Academy, but she says he was persistent. Here they are on their wedding day, this is 1946. Just look at those smiles. She was by his side throughout his political career. Here they are dancing at the inaugural ball in 1977. Rosalynn once said she couldn't imagine her life without him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
