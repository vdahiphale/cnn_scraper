The problem is many people in Gaza don't have electricity to power their phones and, secondly, oftentimes, the internet connection is very spotty. And, certainly, what we've seen is a mounting death toll in Gaza. According the Palestinian Ministry of Health, in a 24-hour period between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon, 316 people were killed, 664 injured. Now, of course, they always say it's the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, but these are numbers that are widely recognized as fairly accurate. And what we know is that over the weekend, the death toll from the 7th of October in Gaza has now exceeded 15,000. In fact, this morning I was speaking with a Gaza resident who told me at the beginning of the war, the Israelis were warning people to leave a building, then that building without be struck. He said that that's no longer the case, more or less, and that when the Israelis strike, they don't strike one building, they take out an entire block. And that's certainly what we've seen in places like the Jabalya refugee camp, which is north of Gaza City, and the Shuja'iyya District, which is just to the east of Gaza City. Phil, Poppy?",

General Hertling, I think one of the parts of the pause in the hostage exchanges that maybe didn't get the appreciation was that the hostilities and possibility of an expansion and escalation also simmered for that moment. That's changing now. What's the risk here? GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  And what's interesting about this is it seems that someone, perhaps Iran, told the various rebel, wow, let's see what happens and let's see how long we can keep this pause in place. What we're seeing now is an increase in firing of rockets and missiles from both Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen. You know, the incident this weekend with USS Carney, the Carney is one of multiple ships and one of two carrier strike groups, and they happen to be positioned and have maneuvered in probably one of the hottest spots around the middle of the Gulf of Aden. They are intercepting, they have a lot of air defense capability on board, that Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, and they are doing a great job.

Investigators say that in July of 1969, he ended his shift, he walked out of the bank with $215,000 in a paper bag, and he vanished. For context, that's the equivalent of about $1.7 million today.
