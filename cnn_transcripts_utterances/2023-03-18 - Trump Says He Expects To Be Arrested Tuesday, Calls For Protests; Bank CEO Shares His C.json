      "sentences": "Former President Trump says he's about to be arrested and calls for protests. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. In a post on his Truth Social account this morning, former President Trump announced that he expects to be indicted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in the investigation examining hush money paid to women who alleged sexual encounters with him.He wrote in all caps, \"The far and away leading Republican candidate and former president of the United States of America will be arrested on Tuesday of next week. Protest, take our nation back.\" His legal team has been anticipating this and preparing behind the scenes. Trump is expected to present himself in Manhattan following the formal charges and has expressed interest in making a speech afterwards. A source familiar with the situation says that Trump has complained privately that he believes he is only going to be indicted because he thinks that Bragg, quote, hates him. Some of Trump's advisers had urged him privately not to call for protests concerned about the optics of a mass protest in the streets of Manhattan growing out of control or resembling the January 6 attack on the Capitol. CNN's John Miller has reported about meetings between city state and federal law enforcement agencies in New York City about how to prepare for a possible indictment. We'll bring you more on this story as details become available. Now to the guns of war, this week came several significant and troubling developments with regard to the war in Ukraine. The latest the news that next week, Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin. A Putin adviser told Russian state media they plan to discuss the war in Ukraine and will sign documents attesting to their closer ties. China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion or even call it such, instead echoing the Kremlin stance of blaming it on the advance of NATO. U.S. officials are monitoring the meetings as China considers sending weapons to Russia and are working to get Xi on the phone with President Zelenskyy. The Biden administration also warning that Xi could call for an unconditional ceasefire, which the U.S. says would legitimize Moscow's hold on the estimated 17 percent of Ukrainian territory that it's taken by force. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for both Putin and Russia's Commissioner for children's rights over an alleged scheme to forcibly deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia, which does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction, called the warrants outrageous and unacceptable. This followed on the heels of Tuesday's Russia-U.S. encounter in international airspace over the Black Sea, in which two Russian fighter jets harassed in American MQ-9 drone. One of the Russian jets dumped fuel on the drone disabling its cameras and then hit the drones propeller, prompting the drones remote operators to bring it down in international waters. Before that video was released by the U.S., Russia had claimed its jet, quote, did not use airborne weapons or come into contact with the drone. Then on Thursday, Poland announced that it would be supplying four Soviet made MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the first NATO member to do so. On Friday, Slovakia followed suit, saying that it was sending 13 more raising pressure on other member states to do the same. All this while fierce fighting continues in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with Russian forces reportedly exhausted and low on munitions. A Ukrainian Lieutenant Colonel known as Kapul (ph) told the Washington Post of his struggles leading a unit composed entirely of inexperienced troops. In Kapul's (ph) couples battalion of about 500 soldiers, he said, roughly 100 were killed in action and 400 wounded. The sum total of these developments seems to be a ratcheting up of the conflict that's now in its 13th month, and it comes amidst evidence of growing divide in the United States on support for Ukraine. According to Axios and Ipsos, just 42 percent of Republicans say they support sending U.S. weapons and money to Ukraine, compared with 79 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents. And this week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a presumed GOP presidential candidate, answered a Tucker Carlson questionnaire by referring to the war in Ukraine as a territorial dispute. He said, quote, \"While the U.S. has many vital national interests, securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy, security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural and military power of the Chinese Communist Party, becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\" This earned him a rebuke from even the right leaning editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. The Journal called DeSantis' words his first big mistake and wrote, \"This is flirting with GOP isolationism that has emerged from time to time in history, and has usually been an electoral cul-de-sac. The party's isolationism in the 30s consigned it two decades in the wilderness, and that naivete was on national display when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.\" President Trump also weighed in with his take.

Writes Bolton, \"Mr. Biden wants Russia to lose, but seems afraid of Ukraine actually winning.\"\"Today, White House policy is essentially, we support Ukraine defending itself, but not enough to be too effective.\" I want to know if you agree, go to smerconish.com now and vote on this week's poll question, \"Is the military support being given to Ukraine by U.S. and NATO intended to defend against Russia or actually to win the war?\" John Bolton joins me now. He served as National Security Adviser to former President Trump and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He's also the author of the book, \"The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.\" Ambassador, thank you for being here. What have we not done that we should be doing according to you? AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON, FMR. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER TO PRES. DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think the administration or NATO as a whole have really declared clearly what the goals in Ukraine are. The stated position of every NATO member is Ukraine should be restored to its full sovereignty and territorial integrity, all right? If that really is our position, let's say so and then having stated the goals, determine a strategy that will get us there. And we've had no strategy. I think people are familiar with this long series of debates about this weapon system, that weapon system. Do we supply, MiG planes? Do we supply HIMARS? Do we supply ATACMS? Do we supply Abrams tanks? That reflects the absence of a strategy. The strategy is assembling the assets you need to achieve the goals and then going and doing it. And that's not what we've done. The effect of that has been to prolong this war, increase the casualties and damage to Ukraine and give Russia more of a chance over time as the much larger power in the conflict to make up for its appalling performance in the opening months of the war.",

So again, people -- law enforcement in New York obviously has to be concerned the safety of the citizens of New York. But if something happens in this, that allows Trump to make it into a campaign issue, it's going to be very serious. I know this must be galling to many people.

This week as regional bank stocks plummeted and First Republic was in peril, there were emergency phone calls among the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Jamie Dimon.The result, 11 mega banks pump $30 billion into First Republic to keep it afloat, 5 billion each from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citi. 2.5 billion from both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and another billion each from U.S. Bank, BNY Mellon, Truist, State Street and PNC.

The idea behind the recommendations and this partnership with the city and county of San Francisco is to work towards repairing the harm in the five areas that we have called out. And there is no timeline on how long it takes to repair centuries of harm. We have a saying, centuries of harm should be met with centuries of repair. And that extends beyond financial compensation.",

The other being that the outmigration of Black San Franciscans over a short amount of time has been drastic and significant.But in terms of the traction that the conversation is getting, I think leaders in San Francisco, community members in San Francisco and California overall have been open to the conversation about reparations for Black San Franciscans and Black Americans because the harm is so clear and so apparent, and been documented. And so, we have an opportunity, and I'm glad to see the government is being responsive to that opportunity.",
