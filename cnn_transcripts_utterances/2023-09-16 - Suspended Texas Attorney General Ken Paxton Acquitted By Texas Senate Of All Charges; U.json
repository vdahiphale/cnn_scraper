There was also alleged misconduct in an affair that he had with a woman who was also employed by Nate Paul. So a rather large list and litany of accusations that Ken Paxton has found.We should remember, this is a political trial, not necessarily a traditional criminal trial, even though it very much looked like one at many points of all of that. But despite all of the evidence that was presented in this case, and all these articles of impeachment were brought by Republicans in the House of Representatives -- remember, Republicans dominate every level of government here in this state. And now here in the Senate, Republican senators siding with Ken Paxton to return him to office. And just now in the Senate chamber they are beginning to wrap things up. And obviously, many senators will be asked to kind of defend these votes and explain exactly how all of this unfolded over the last day- and-a-half.",

A source with the union telling my colleague Vanessa Yurkevich, quote, \"We had reasonably productive conversations with Ford today,\" reasonably productive. Of course, no deal. But any sign of progress you've got to take as extremely positive, because in the last couple days we heard Ford CEO say that if they were to give in to all of the union's demands, it would bankrupt the company, something that the head of the auto workers union told me directly was a joke and a lie.And we know that the union said yesterday that they had sent counteroffers to each of the three, the big three automakers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis, and they were now waiting for a response. We understand there were going to be negotiations with Stellantis and GM today. We don't know what the progress is like on those. But as of yesterday, the head of the auto workers union said that up till then, 80 percent of the members' demands had not been met in any of the offers from the automakers. And so we're just waiting to see if there can be progress throughout the day. In the meantime, I want to show what we're seeing here in Toledo, Ohio. This outside a Stellantis factory where they would typically be making more than 1,000 jeeps every day. But right now we are seeing people picketing at each gate to enter the complex. It is shut down. And this is where they'll be 24/7, each running a ship. These people, these workers are making $100 a day in strike pay, paid by the union, because they're not making a salary. And so many of them have told me they are ready to strike for as long as it takes. I want to bring in Chris. Chris, can I grab you a second?",

We are not talking about comparable things here. Look, I think most people in the political arena think the main event in the Jack Smith trial against Donald Trump for attempting to -- for allegedly attempting to overturn the 2020 election, all the evidence that was shown by the January 6th committee, that is now on schedule to begin in March. That is the one thing that may be the most likely to reach a resolution before Election Day in 2024. And I think that is the one that people are looking at in terms of the potential electoral impact.

Her place in history and her underground railway among other things have been told in history books and movies, on the big screen and small.Well, now a version of her life and bravery is being told in graphic novel form as \"Harriet Tubman the Demon Slayer,\" a graphic novel portraying Tubman as a ninja warrior who battles vampires, witches, and demons, representative of slave owners and other bad actors. And now the hope is to, at least by the creators, to hopefully put it on TV. Joining me right now to discuss is David Crownson. He is the CEO and founder of Kingwood Comics, and creator of \"Harriet Tubman Demon Slayer.\" David, good to see you. And oh, my gosh, you've got to unpack all this. (LAUGHTER)",

Well, we are going to try and do this another time, maybe, if we can't get him within seconds. I think we're not going to get him back in seconds.OK, well, that was David Crownson, and you can see how enthusiastic he is about his venture, and he is hoping to take that graphic novel form to the television screen. But of course, you've got the Screen Actors Guild and the writers guild in the middle of a strike right now, so there are obstacles in which to make it happen. That was also part of our conversation, but at some point, we will try to finish our conversation with him. But all the best to him on this new very creative venture at the same time paying homage to and celebrating one of the most prolific and important heroines of this country and beyond. All right, David, we will try it again. Still to come, thousands of people paid hundreds of dollars to see him play, but Lionel Messi, guess what. He's now going to be a no-show at Inter Maimi's game in Atlanta this afternoon. We will go live inside the stadium and see how many tears there that there are flowing, next.

      "sentences": "Yes, the fans are not going to be happy, even though Messi not playing for Inter Miami presumably gives Atlanta a better chance of winning the game. We all know why so many people bought tickets for the match, because of course they wanted to see the GOAT, they wanted to see the greatest of all time. And since Messi has arrived in this country a couple of months ago, he's just been electrifying. He's been absolutely brilliant, and Inter Miami have been transformed as a team.So everybody wanted to see him. People have been paying hundreds upon hundreds of dollars for a ticket. Now you can get one for about $40 bucks. We kind of got an idea that he wasn't coming last night when he posted this video of a pizza that he had just ordered in Miami, and he was presumably was about to feast on, and this was happening when the team were on their way already here in Atlanta. So we kind of got a sense that he wasn't coming. And today we've seen absolute proof that he's not coming because he's been out there enjoying his kids' soccer match. He's been literally just sat on the grass by the sideline watching his kids play a game. So Messi enjoying a break. I think people who have looked at his workload over the last couple of months will say he was due one. He was basically playing a game every four days. And he's about to enter a period in which Miami could win their second trophy of the season where he will potentially be playing every three days. So this break afforded him the opportunity to basically not kick a ball for a couple of weeks. That's probably pretty good for him. Remember, he is 36 years of age. There's all the talk about the astroturf here. He said he would play on turf. This is a turf stadium. He's not here, but they've said it's nothing to do with that. It's literally about giving the man a break.",
