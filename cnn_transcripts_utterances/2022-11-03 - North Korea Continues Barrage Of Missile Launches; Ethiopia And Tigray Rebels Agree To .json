Never before have North Korean missiles (INAUDIBLE) or what's known as the Northern Limit Line below which North Korean ships are banned. According to officials in Seoul, around 7:40 a.m. local time, North Korea fired what is believed to be an ICBM from an area near the Capitol, followed up an hour later with two short range missiles by CNN's tally, that makes 30 missile tests this year. Tokyo initially feared the ICBM was on track to fly over its territory issued alerts for residents in the north to take shelter. It's now believed the missile failed in flight. All this coming a day after the North Korean fight an unprecedented barrage of at least 23 short range missiles, a move triggered air raid alarms on an island of South Korea's east coast. Blake Essig is live this hour in Tokyo with the very latest. So Blake, I'll bring you up to speed, where does -- where is Tokyo right now in all this? What is the tensions in the region like at the moment too? BLAKE ESSIG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, John, I think Tokyo and the rest of the region is still trying to really figure out exactly what happened this morning. What kind of missiles were fired. The reality here is what we're seeing from North Korea is unprecedented. Earlier this morning, South Korea's military says Pyongyang fired another three ballistic missiles with a government source saying that one of them could have been an international or excuse me, an intercontinental ballistic missile that's believed to have failed. Now, the U.S. and South Korea condemn the latest launch calling it a serious provocation. This most recent launch comes just one day after North Korea fired a record 23 missiles in a single day, a combination of short range ballistic missiles and surface air missiles, along with 100 artillery shells that fell into the waters around the Korean Peninsula. Now, today marks the 30th time this year that North Korea has launched missiles, this is the most missile launches conducted by North Korea in a single year in the country's history. And we still have almost two full months to go. And it's clear that this region right now is on edge. As you mentioned, Japan actually thought that the missile had flown over the top of Japan. In a series of tweets this morning, the prime minister's office sent out a warning to the public that a missile had been launched, urging the public living in Miyagi Yamagata and Niigata Prefectures where sirens were heard to evacuate inside a building or underground. And just a few minutes after that, follow it up with another tweet saying that the missile had passed into the Pacific Ocean as it turns out. As you mentioned, that was not the case. And the missile did not fly over Japan. Perhaps it's because it failed in flight. Here's Japan's Minister of Defense addressing what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YASUKAZU HAMADA, JAPANESE DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We detected that the missile that was launched around 7:40 a.m. might fly over Japan. So we put out a J-Alert. But later, we have confirmed that the missile did not fly over Japan and disappeared in the skies above the Sea of Japan. So, we would like to rectify our announcement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier this year, a ceasefire fell apart within months and there are many reasons why this one could as well. The human toll in Tigray and elsewhere has been staggering. But with a pause in fighting, it seems critical shipments of humanitarian aid might just be able to reach those in desperate need. We have more now from CNN's Larry Madowo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): These talks in South Africa achieved a lot more than was expected and in a much shorter period. It's a new dawn in Ethiopia, a silencing of the guns after exactly two years of the Tigray conflict. But there's a big if, if it can be implemented because it's a big one, a permanent cessation of hostilities, and also, a smooth, orderly disarmament. This means every single member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front has to down their tools, down their guns. They have to agree to reintegrate into Ethiopian society, there was a greater restoration of services and hindered access for humanitarian supplies and protections for everybody who has been involved in this conflict. So, essentially, letting bygones be bygones. So far, the mood music is promising. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, in the weeks and months ahead, the implementation of this peace deal will be so critical to making sure there can be some semblance of normalcy in Tigray, that the people who have suffered so much can finally have some peace and that Tigray People's Liberation Front says not because they're weary of fighting, it's because the people deserve peace.

Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the Fed may slow the frequency of interest rate hikes but suggested that big increases may be coming in an effort to cool off this record high level of inflation. U.S. markets did not like that idea of rates going higher, the Dow shedding more than 500 points, a close of business on Wednesday. CNN's Richard Quest has more now reporting from New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The decision by the Fed to raise rates by three quarters of a percent had been baked into the market. It was expected and had been well telegraphed. Now, the real crunch question, what does the Fed do next particularly at its December meeting? Having given more than 300 basis points of interest rate rises, tripling of rates since the cycle began. The argument is you better wait and see. Wait for it to feed through to the economy, the so-called monetary lag, the cumulative effect. The Fed has acknowledged that they don't really fully know what the effect is of such large increases in interest rates in today's modern economy. Is the economy just waiting to slow down into recession? Or will they have to do more? It's called the pivot point or some people just basically saying, wait and see. We got little indication of that from the chair of the Fed. Initially, the idea was yes, we will wait and see. And the market loved that and roared up into the green.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Just hours ago, Brazil's outgoing president told his loyal supporters it was time to go home, time to stop blocking traffic on major highways. The protests began almost soon as Bolsonaro lost his reelection bid on Sunday. CNN's Paula Newton has our report now from Sao Paolo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro were out on the streets for a third day, and in some cases, they were violent yet again. Now, federal officials are ordering military police to use force when they need to clear these demonstrations. That's why you continue to see sporadic events, you will see tear gas being used. You will see water cannons. Having said that, protesters by and large that we've seen have been moved to the side. They have not actually been moved off their protest sites. And for that reason, these protests keep popping up. NEWTON (voice-over): Even the president seemed to concede things were getting out of hand. JAIR BOLSONARO, OUTGOING BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The blocking of highways in Brazil impairs people's right to come and go. It is not in our constitution, and we have always been within its limits. You have to respect the rights of other people who are moving, in addition to affecting our economy. I know that the economy has its importance, OK? I know that you are giving more importance to other things now. It's legit. But I want to appeal to you, clear the highways. This is not, in my opinion, part of this legit manifestations. We're not going to lose our legitimacy here. Other demonstrations, you are doing all over Brazil in square (ph) cities, I repeat, part of the Democratic game, feel free. NEWTON (voice-over): Protesters that we've spoken to says that gives them the greenlight to stay out on the streets for as long as it takes, and they're still waiting for him to decide whether or not he will accept those results. Now, having said that, that makes an already tense transfer of power much more contentious here in Brazil, at a time when it does not need it.

Concerns are mounting, though, over how much power those allies might wield in what could be Israeli's most far-right-win government ever.

Their result was much better than, really, anybody expected at 65. But one of the biggest stories from election day this week in Israel is the rise of the far-right. Part of Netanyahu's allies for his next coalition will be made up of a far-right wing bloc of parties called Religious Zionism and Jewish Power. And this party could gain as many as 14 seats in the next Israeli Parliament. That would make them the third largest party in Parliament, just behind Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and the current caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid Party. Now, this group of parties, they are made up of people who were once considered the far-right fringe extreme of Israeli politics. One of the leaders was, in the past, convicted for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Another one of their leaders, once from the Israeli parliament, told other Arab Israeli members of the Israeli Parliament they don't belong there and that they should have been kicked out in 1948 when Israel was created. But now, these types of people will have, potentially, quite a bit of power in the next government because of their numbers in the Parliament. The question will become, what sort of ministerial positions might they get? They've made public demands for things like public security or even minister of defense. But Benjamin Netanyahu, when he's been asked about this, he says that he will become the prime minister, that he will have the largest parties, and they will set the policy and make the decisions. But there also is a big question about how is Israel's around the world, especially the United States and newer allies, like those from the Abraham Accords, the United Arab Emirates, how what their relationship will be like with the Israeli government, if these new right-wing politicians have positions of power.

Here is the specifics on the landfall near -- near Belize City. This is, again, Hurricane Lisa as it made landfall as a Category 1, 140 kilometer per hour sustained winds. Made landfall about 4:20 Central Daylight Time. That's 5:20 Eastern Standard. And, again, police city located right about there. So, they were on the northern tier of the storm.

So the potential here really for some -- some coastal erosion, high seas along the coastal areas. Certainly, a threat. We have tropical storm warnings in place from Chetumal Southward through, basically, the entire coast line of Belize. Now, inland, this is a flash flood threat.

This is going to bring heavier rainfall into Guatemala, as well as portions of southwestern Mexico going forward through the course of the weekend. Something interesting, too.
