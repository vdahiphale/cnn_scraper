He's flying to California for a three-day trip to highlight the environment and meet with donors.The president officially kicking off his re-election campaign over the weekend rallying with union members in Philadelphia. The 2024 election is still more than 500 days away, and polls show that some Democrats do not want him to run again. He's also facing a Democratic challenger, including environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is posting surprisingly strong polling numbers. CNN's political director, David Chalian, joins us now. David, what is the polling saying about the Democratic side of this race?",

Your eyes sort pop and, whoa, here's an incumbent president, why is a challenger at 20 percent support?Obviously, name recognition has something to do with that. His name is Robert Kennedy. Not a bad credential to start with just for Democrats. But when you look inside our numbers, not all 20 percent are meaning the same thing. His support is coming largely from Independent, more moderate conservative Democrats, right? That's not the base of the party that shows up as majority in these primary and caucus contests. So he's not pulling right now from the folks in large numbers that -- that turn out and show up in these primary contests. Which is why the path to actually taking Biden on for the nomination is also a trick one.",

You know, we're Republicans, and the idea is you would support the Republican whether you won or whether you lost and you don't have to ask someone to sign something. Only in the era of Donald Trump that you need somebody to sign something on a pledge, so I think it's a bad idea.

This is really an extra push to a movement that's been going on for a while, looking at BMI not as a great measure of individual health risk.This is a metric invented in 1832 by a Belgian statistician trying to characterize the average man. It wasn't until the 1970s it was adopted as a marker to measure body fat measurements across the population. The issue is now it's on every medical record and can sometimes be used for individual health risks. The AMA in a statement last week saying that it significantly correlated with the amount of fat mass in the general population but loses predictability when applied on the individual level. That's really the issue here. This is really validated in a population that is mostly white, validated in the 197os in a population of mostly men. So this really isn't applicable across people of different racial backgrounds and people of different ages and sexes. So there are major problems with this. The problem with that though is that this is used so broadly, not just a screen for being overweight or having obesity but also eligibility for certain medical procedures like fertility treatments or having certain surgeries. It can also play into life insurance rates. So this is something that doctors are saying deserves a lot more scrutiny.",
