White House spokesman Andrew Bates saying in a statement that \"Asking members of Congress to reaffirm their oath of office and uphold the Constitution should not be a heavy lift. Congressional Republicans,\" he said, \"need to do that immediately, instead of repeatedly refusing to answer the most basic question.\" Now, Republicans are certainly not going to be taking their cues from the White House on this issue. But it is notable that the White House is choosing to weigh in in this matter because, as you know, the president did make a decision to go very in to this argument of protecting democracy as a part of his pre-midterms message. And after the election, they felt pretty vindicated that politically speaking, this was the right thing to do.",

Although we did hear chief of staff Ron Klain saying again yesterday -- reiterating that he does plan to make an announcement after the holidays and he does expect that decision to be for the president to seek a second term.

But what is fascinating is that these -- this concept of pheromones, which are these tiny electrical chemical signals that basically are an instant form of communication between humans. You can just -- these pheromones are just being given off and they can -- they can instantly communicate. They do it in species of animals, but humans do this as well. And it typically signals alarm, aggregation -- meaning you're going to find people that are similar smelling in this case -- and attraction to the point that you're making.
