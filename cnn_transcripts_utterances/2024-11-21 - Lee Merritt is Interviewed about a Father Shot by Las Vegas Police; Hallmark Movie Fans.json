That's almost a third of the country, people who get Medicare, people who get Medicaid. That's a pretty big job for somebody who's never been in administration before.And it keeps going. I mean Tulsi Gabbard, I looked yesterday, she does have behind - you know, on her resume, she's been on Fox News literally hundreds of times in the past couple of years. She could be the nation's top spy in charge of, you know, the CIA and all these - the NSA, all these other agencies. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. does not have that same relationship with Fox News that the others do, but he did write a bestselling book attacking Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates and alleging all of these conspiracy theories about the U.S. health system that he could now effectively be running.

Thank you so much for sharing your reporting on all this.So, a phrase I only learned for the first time this morning, \"gate lice.\" That's people who board with the wrong group at the airport. Kate Bolduan apparently included. This morning, one of the biggest airlines beginning a high-tech crackdown. So, Kate, beware. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:36:46] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: New this morning, the FBI says they have foiled a plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange. This was first reported by the website Court Watch. Now, investigators, they first got a tip in February that a 30-year-old man from Florida was storing, quote/unquote, bomb making schematics in a storage unit. So, an investigation ensued, and they later found sketches and other electronics that could be used for building explosive devices. The FBI says the suspect also told undercover agents he wanted to detonate a bomb at the stock exchange the week before Thanksgiving. And according to court documents, the man told them, quote, \"the stock exchange, we want to hit that, because it will wake people up.\" Also, U.S. wildlife officials are warning that giraffe populations are declining so rapidly they should be considered endangered. Officials say giraffes are disappearing because of a few factors, habitat loss, poaching and drought fueled by the climate crisis. The Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to make giraffe species either endangered or threatened, which will help, of course, to protect them. And American Airlines is now cracking down online cutters, making it better, or making it even worse, depending on your view, of boarding zones. The airline is rolling out its new boarding technology to 100 airports nationwide. The entire goal, stop line cutters, which they are giving a misnomer to and calling them \"gate lice.\" If you board before your assigned group, the technology will make a sound to grab the attention of the gate agent. What happens next, of course, scorn, shame, and ridicule. The company has been stress testing this system over the last month at airports in New Mexico, Arizona and Virginia. TBD if it actually helps planes take off any faster, but it does just stifle harmless rebellion. Sara.",
