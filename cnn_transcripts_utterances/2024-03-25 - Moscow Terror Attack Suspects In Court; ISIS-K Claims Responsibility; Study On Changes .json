And he peppered both sides questions about the timing of events and when they asked for certain information.At the end of the day, the judge said that he found that prosecutors were not at fault for the late turnover of information. He said that they acted in good faith. And it was at that point that he ruled against Donald Trump and said that this case would move forward to jury selection on April 15th. At that point, Trump shook his head, looking frustrated by that ruling. And ultimately, you know, now this case is moving forward. His past attempts to delay have fallen flat. His lawyers did make another effort with this judge to try to get him to hear arguments, legal motions on their attempts to say that the pretrial publicity is reason to delay this case. The judge said he would accept briefs on this. But as of now, he said to everyone, as we departed for the day, see you on April 15th.",

I built a phenomenal company that's very low leverage, unbelievably low leverage, with a lot of cash, a lot of everything else. Why should I let a crooked judge make a decision to give $450 million?

It's understandable. Former president, you know, facing unprecedented kind of legal challenges. But short of a trial on the January 6th riot and the efforts to overturn the election after 2020, I'm not sure any of these other legal proceedings are really going to move the needle that much. I mean, a conviction in the New York case obviously would not be beneficial to Trump, but when you think about who are the biggest bulk of voters that are movable here, and I think in the next seven months, are Black and Hispanic voters without a college education, primarily men, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck. And the debate over things like taxes, inflation, and health care is more likely to move them, I think, than most of these proceedings.

Essentially, they accused DA Bragg of engaging in misconduct, even going so far as to intimate that perhaps they were sort of in cahoots with the Southern District of New York, that they had held back this exculpatory information on purpose and in sort of a gamesmanship-y way. Turns out the judge really admonished them, saying, actually, it's the other way around. You asked for this production sort of late in the game. The DA pursued his obligation to give you and hand over that information under his discovery obligations in his request to the Southern District.They are not the same prosecutorial body. They are separate and distinct, such that the DA's office did nothing wrong here.

Donald Trump has repeatedly said that this is all election interference, that they're going after his money, and they're trying to fill up his calendar with court dates to keep him off the campaign trail. He actually has only had two appearances on the campaign trail since Super Tuesday. And most, if not all, I may be mistaken, but most, if not all, of his court appearances have been voluntary. He hasn't actually had to be there. Nevertheless, the idea that he's going to be in court for a significant amount of time during the campaign, I mean, that can't necessarily help him with voters, right?",

I mean, he was able to essentially make the case that they are going after me because they really want to silence you, and I am bearing this cross on your behalf, sometimes literally in, you know, memes by his supporters. I think in a general election, it is a more complex, kind of calculation in the sense that we do know in polling that there are a substantial number of voters who said they would be uneasy about returning Trump to the White House if he is convicted of a felony. Now, I don't think this case will resound as powerfully, as I said, as the January 6th case, but that reality is out there for him. And him being in court is a reminder to voters on the fence about the broader kind of chaos that often attaches to Trump and that, you know, prevailed through his presidency.I still think, though, if you look at the voters who really are likely to decide this, where Biden is underperforming now. It tends to be financially squeezed voters, and he is going to ultimately have to win the argument with Trump about who can improve their lives economically more than that they are going to look at this as disqualifying for him. I think the people who see this as disqualifying have largely moved, not all of them, but I think the bulk of what Biden needs to do is going to be on the economic and making your life better front.",

So, I mean, barring potentially Trump trying to change attorneys, I mean, that's the only thing I could think of that would sort of give him at least a colorable argument to sort of kick it down the road one more time. Look, I mean, for better or for worse, this is the case that is going to be the first criminal trial of former President Trump. It's gotten sort of a bad rap. But Alvin Bragg has really tried to elevate his language surrounding what this case is about.[14:15:09] You know, we're referring to it as a hush money case, but he has said adamantly this is not a sex for money case. This is an election interference case trying to sort of, you know, elevate the issues around there. And it really is, right? They are charging a theory of their case involves election interference. They kicked it up, these misdemeanor charges to felonies by, you know, trying to argue that the, you know, the misstatements in the business records were for the purpose of furthering another crime, which was election interference. Which was hiding this hush money payout to Stormy Daniels just, you know, in October, the October surprise, in order to keep that from the public. And that was an election, federal election law violation. So, you know, there's some thorny legal issues here, but I think Alvin Bragg's office is ready to go.",
