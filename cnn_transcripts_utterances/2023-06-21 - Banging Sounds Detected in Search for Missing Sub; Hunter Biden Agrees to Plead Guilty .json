And, an urgent call for the U.S. to step in as violence escalates in the West Bank. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. Good Wednesday morning to you. We begin with what could be a major development in the search for the submersible lost at sea during a trip to the Titanic wreckage. Search crews using sonar heard banging sounds at 30-minute intervals, according to an internal U.S. government memo. The U.S. Coast Guard also says that a Canadian plane detected underwater noises. Resources now have been diverted to try to find the source of those noises, no luck just yet. More on the search this morning from CNN's Miguel Marquez.

But, all of this, all of this is to search for a vehicle that they cannot find yet. This is the biggest issue right now. The easy part should be finding that vehicle, finding that submersible because it has a beacon of some sort.

The president son will plead guilty to federal tax charges and he has struck a deal with the DOJ on a gun charge. But sources tell CNN that he probably will not serve any time in prison and that has many Republicans crying foul. CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Biden's son, Hunter, reaches an agreement with the Justice Department to resolve a long-running criminal investigation. According to a letter filed Tuesday by federal prosecutors, Hunter will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and struck a deal to resolve a separate felony gun charge if he complies with his end of the plea agreement. According to court documents, Biden owed at least $100,000 in federal taxes for 2017, and at least $100,000 for 2018, but did not pay the IRS by the deadline. His lawyers say he eventually paid the tax bill, along with fees and penalties. As part of this deal, the Justice Department has agreed to recommend a sentence of probation for the tax charges, according to sources. But the final punishment will be up to the judge. On the gun charge, prosecutors allege he possessed a gun despite his addiction in violation of federal law. Biden's lawyers met with the Justice Department in April and sources tell CNN that negotiations to resolve the case have ramped up in recent weeks. The deal comes after a broad, years-long investigation that also looked at Hunter Biden's foreign deals and possible money laundering. On Capitol Hill, Republicans have been focused on the president's son and his foreign business dealings but prosecutors haven't charged him on those claims. On Tuesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized Hunter Biden's deal. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  It continues to show the two tier system in America. If you are the president's leading political opponent, the DOJ tries to put you in jail and give you prison time. If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal.",

Cannon says the case is complex, so both prosecution and defense might want more time. The former president has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal criminal charges. His codefendant Walt Nauta is set to be arraigned next week. All right, violence now surging between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank. Overnight, Palestinians say that Israeli settlers attacked dozens of villagers, injuring at least 37 in set fire to multiple vehicles as well as farmland and crops. This comes after four Israelis were killed Tuesday in L.A., following an IDF raid in Jenin earlier this week which left seven Palestinians dead. CNN's Hadas Gold joins me live from the scene of some of that violence in the West Bank. And, Hadas, Palestinians have urgently called on the U.S. to intervene. What can the U.S. do, if anything?",

The smoke is still smoldering, here you can still smell it in the air and when you touch some of the cars they are still hot from the flames.This is the aftermath of settlers, Israeli settlers coming from nearby villages, towards this village, Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya, and they burned cars, at least 37 Palestinians were injured, mostly as a result of stone throwing. This is reminiscent of course of what happened in February in the village of Huwara. Violence did not get to the same level, but you can still see just how many flames really engulfed this car right here. We heard from villagers that some of their homes were damaged as well. And we are just up the road from where that deadly attack took place, where four Israelis were killed, four others were injured in what became the deadliest attack targeting Israelis since January, it happened at a gas station at a restaurant among the victims were two teenagers, Israeli officials say that to Hamas gunmen came to the gas station in the restaurant shooting into the restaurant and then shooting at the gas station. We were just there, you could still see bloodstained on the floor and we can see that the restaurant is riddled with bullet holes. One of the gunmen was shot and killed by a civilian on the scene, another stole a car and got away but after a three-hour manhunt he was also shot and killed. Now, Hamas which took credit for the attack is saying it was in direct response as to what happened in Jenin on Monday, which was an 11-hour gun battle between Palestinian militants and the Israeli military, it was supposed to be interest rate. The military saying they went in the early hours to rest what they said to wanted terrorist subject, but it turned in something much broader. Militants using IEDs, roadside bombs which disabled several Israeli military vehicles, eight Israeli soldiers were injured. They used an apache helicopter to provide cover to extract those Israeli soldiers. We know at least seven Palestinians who were killed and while militants were among those killed, we know at least two teenagers were killed as well, a girl and a boy. The violence is really ratcheting up here, Christine. There are now calls especially from the right wing and Israeli politics from the settlers in villages here that we have spoken to, the Israelis. They want more Israeli military action. They want a broad Israeli military operation, in spite of the fact of whatever the Americans are saying. I spoke to the mayor of the Israeli settlement here saying I do not care what the Israelis are saying, I want is really action now.
