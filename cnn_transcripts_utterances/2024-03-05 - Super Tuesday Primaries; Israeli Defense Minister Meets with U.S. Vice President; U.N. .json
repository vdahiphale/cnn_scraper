It's the second busiest day on the U.S. political calendar and a day of huge significance for Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. We will learn some interesting lessons by the close of polls in 16 states and one U.S. territory.

We have these meetings at the State Department with both, asyou noted, the Qatari prime minister and Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet. And make no mistake, a focal point for these conversations, both of them, will be the need for a ceasefire, which the U.S. has really seen as the key to unlocking so many other components of this conflict; notably, ending this conflict and getting to discuss the day-after scenarios, as they're being called. But also getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. And the U.S. is kind of coming at this front from two angles, saying, yes, a ceasefire is absolutely needed. But absent of a ceasefire, there is still a need for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and for that aid to get to where it needs to be. So the secretary of state having this meeting this morning with his Qatari counterpart. This is what's called the strategic dialogue. It's the sixth annual iteration of this dialogue. So it would be happening even if this war wasn't going on. But, Becky, this is certainly going to be at the at the top of the agenda. The Qataris have been at the very center of mediating this potential ceasefire, which, as you say, both the U.S., Qatar, Egypt and others would like to see in place before Ramadan, which is expected to begin early next week. And then later, the secretary of state meeting with Benny Gantz. This was a series of meetings at the -- this rival of Netanyahu's, is taking here in Washington, which, according to Israeli media, has enraged the Israeli prime minister. The Biden administration essentially the rolling out the red carpet for him, giving him meetings with everybody except for the president, the vice president, the national security adviser and the secretary of state. The Biden administration making no excuses for that, saying this is a war. He is a member of the war cabinet.

And Becky, that is a reference to this demand that we have reported on, that Israel is now making, that they want a list of the hostages who are still alive and those who are dead in Gaza before a ceasefire can happen. And here we have Hamas saying, well, we can't give you that list until a ceasefire happens. To what extent this is a sticking point or an impasse, that remains to be seen.

Of course that is tied up in, at this point, a cease-fire, be that temporary or, as Hamas and many people in the region I'm in, would suggest is a permanent cease-fire. What's your -- what's your position on this? HALPERIN-KADDARI:  I think that, now that we have confirmation that the hostages who are still alive in Gaza are subjected to ongoing sexual violence, the calls should be for an immediate and unconditional release. And it should not be tied to any demand for a cease-fire, although I personally think -- but here I'm speaking, of course, not as a spokesperson for anybody -- I believe that anything and everything should be done to release them. But for anybody who has any shred of morality and humanity, to know that sexual violence is still being ongoing while they are in captivity, should lead to demand of an immediate release or, at least, at the beginning, to have them accessed to for the Red Cross. To have access to them to know that they are alive, that they are being taken care of, that medicine can be brought to them, that they are safe from any kind of violence. I think this is an abhorrent situation, where the hostages are simply being played with by Hamas on the other side of the conflict. And -- (CROSSTALK) HALPERIN-KADDARI:  -- end to that.",

And Israel is also conducting its own investigations whenever allegations of improper behavior, including possible sexual violence, is being brought against IDF personnel. As far as I know, the Israeli authorities are investigating that. And there are, again, other entities on the ground that are looking into that. But I would like to refer here also to, if I may, to other allegations that had been brought by the special representative on Palestine, occupied Palestinian Territories. And the special representative on sexual violence against women, in a statement released about 10 days ago, that had been completely unreferenced.

A lot of people have been able to vote by mail for a few weeks here. But some people wanting to do it in person here today. And what is at stake here besides the presidential election? Obviously this primary about whether or not people want Biden and Trump to go all the way here. The other really consequential vote here in California is for Senate. And that is because Senator Dianne Feinstein passed away in September. And so that open seat is what we see three U.S. representatives vying for today. That would be Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee. Those three U.S. representatives going for that position, which I should note, Adam Schiff is the faraway front-runner for that role right now, simply because he has had an outsized role, you could say, in the first impeachment of Donald Trump. And also, he's got some name recognition and a lot of support broadly from the party here in California. On the Republican side there's Steve Garvey. It's a name that people may know less but he is known for his sports acumen. He was a baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers and well as the San Diego Padres here. Now we've seen Schiff really spend some money going after Garvey. And he is trying to do that, because, in California, the top two candidates that win today, no matter their political party, go on to that run-off vote in November. So he's hoping to make it, Democrat versus Republican. Because California Dems outweigh Republicans 2:1 here. So that's what is at stake here.

But let me get you up to speedas to how we got here because we got here very quickly in U.S. terms when it comes to cases going through courts in the United States. Over the weekend, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the state of Texas a stay and ordered that this law go into effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court acted. And so we saw the U.S. Supreme Court very swiftly put a temporary freeze on this case and blocked the law from going into effect until March 13th. The justices there buying themselves a little time so they can look at this case. Now the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, took this as a victory, issuing a statement, saying in part, quote, \"SB-4\" -- and this is the law that we're talking about -- \"was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else.\" Now the arguments that have been made by the state of Texas in the lower courts gives us an idea of what the justices will consider in this case. One of the main arguments by the state of Texas is this idea that Texas is under a, quote, \"invasion,\" because migrants are crossing the border illegally. Now, in the lower court, the judge was very clear that he was not going to take that argument. He rejected that argument, saying that migrants crossing illegally into the state of Texas is not a, quote, \"invasion,\" and the lower court judge upheld precedent in the United States, which is that immigration is a federal function. I want to read you a few excerpts from this judge, because it gives you an idea of his thinking. He says, quote, \"Surges in immigration do not constitute an, quote, 'invasion' within the meaning of the Constitution nor is Texas engaging in war by enforcing SB-4.\" He goes on to say, \"If allowed to proceed, SB-4 could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws. SB-4 threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice.\" Now Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has maintained throughout this legal fight that the state of Texas has constitutional authority to do this. Now I can't emphasize this enough. There's a lot of concern within the Latino community in the state of Texas about potential racial profiling if this law goes into effect. Latinos make up 40 percent of the population in this state. And we have video of this. This is a workshop that has been conducted by civil rights organizations, Becky, to educate the public about their rights in the United States and in the state of Texas. And we're seeing more and more of these throughout the state as this population tries to educate themselves about what they will and will not be able to do in the case of they get stopped by the police -- Becky.",
