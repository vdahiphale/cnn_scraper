After he left the presidency to people who didn't have the ability to look at classified documents when he referred to and held up, waved around a piece of paper that was an apparent military plan from his time in government.Prosecutor Jay Bratt read from that transcript when Trump acknowledges that the record was classified and says to the crowd in front of him. He wishes he could have declassified it and shared it more publicly, but he can't. Prosecutor Jay Bratt said in court today that that is the sort of thing that would show you he knew these weren't personal records. He also knew the law. And so, these arguments that the Trump team is making today should not be able to get the case tossed. We're still going to wait to see what else the judge has to say. It's very likely she'll write some lengthy opinion on these motions and other motions Trump has made in court to try and get the case out from this courthouse.

And I remember them telling me the existence of that tape changed the way they viewed the legal jeopardy that their client was facing.Because remember, at the time, he had all these varying explanations for declassifying, that he had a standing order to declassify things, that he could declassify things with his mind. But this recording undercuts all of that. It also, as the judge has to weigh now, really undercuts these arguments as well. So, it is a critical piece of evidence.",

We're talking about the U.S. vulnerabilities to a foreign attack. What are the things that the U.S. would do in response to that? And as Paula just pointed out, I mean, you know, that tape makes clear that he knows that these defense programs, these very sensitive defense programs, were still classified. And that he had not actually done some kind of blanket declassification order. And by the way, I mean, you know, the idea of the limit of a president to be able to declassify things, you know, it's not been tested, really. And so, you know, until that tape emerged, there was some question as to whether what is, you know, whether he had that power and what is the limit of that power. You know, I think members of Congress and certainly in the Senate have said you can't just declassify nuclear secrets. It's not like that because of the way the government works.

The real question here is to the accuracy of that account and there's a lot of suspicion about that in the aviation world. The flight data recorder will be the unvarnished truth. It is key here. It can show the airspeed, the altitude, the position of the flight controls, even the position of some of the switches on board the airplane. About a thousand different points of data recording multiple times a second. So, we'll be able to see if something happened.
