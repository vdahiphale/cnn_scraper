And the wife of Ukraine's spy agency chief poisoned. Is Russia behind the brazen attack and where will there be more? There are more developments tonight, and the foreign minister of Ukraine is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Israel and Hamas clashing in northern Gaza today, both sides claiming a violation of the ongoing pause in fighting. This coming as the world watches and waits to see if the truce will be extended beyond tomorrow when it's set to expire. Ten Israeli hostages were released today, two Thai nationals also released in addition. You're looking at the moment they were handed by Hamas over to the Red Cross. And tonight, two American women are still being held captive in Gaza in addition to Israel's estimate this morning of 171 other hostages. And, of course, if this truce is not extended, they will all remain in Gaza. Six of them are children under 18. Children who may not be coming home for who knows how long. Children who have suffered great trauma. Dr. Efrat Bron-Harlev has treated some 31 children released so far and one thing stands out to her tonight is that the children when they come out of this incredible trauma and finally get to the hospital speak in whispers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. EFRAT BRON-HARLEV, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SCHNEIDER CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER IN ISRAEL: They speak very, very quietly about the most terrible things that they have been undergoing.

Of course, he's now 99 years old. He was there in the front row. It's the first time we've seen him in several months. How -- you were there, too, obviously and for all of this today, how important was it that Jimmy Carter was there today?",

Ukraine says other intelligence staffers are also sick and sources tell CNN that Western officials are suspicious that Russian agents may have paid off a staff member to carry out the poisoning. So far, the U.S. has not been able to independently verify this incident. OUTFRONT now is the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. And, Minister, I very much appreciate your time.

There's also issues in the United States, $64 billion aid package to Ukraine is now in question. Some Republicans, Minister, as you know, are now saying that there has to be changes to the U.S.-Mexican border policy. That has to happen in exchange for supporting the aid to Ukraine. So, these two things have become tied together. Half of Americans as you know think the U.S. government is already spending too much to help Ukraine.

It is without an exaggeration the stability of global order.And, you know, the best way to keep war away from your shores and from your borders is to support countries who are ready to fight the war defending themselves. I would like to remind everyone that never since the beginning of the large scale invasion, Ukraine asked for U.S. boots on the ground. We never asked the U.S. Army to come and fight for us. Our deal is still fair. You give us what we need and we will do the rest of the job, because we also are protecting NATO, not only ourselves.
