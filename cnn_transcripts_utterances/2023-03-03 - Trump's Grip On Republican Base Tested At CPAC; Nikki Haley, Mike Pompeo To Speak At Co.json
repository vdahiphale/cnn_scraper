I'm the older guy at the table. I was not there when Barry Goldwater gave CPAC a big name. But Barry Goldwater was really for smaller government and against the Communists. Ronald Reagan used CPAC as a huge springboard when he was saying we need smaller government and to be against the Soviets. CPAC today very different, as evidenced by some speakers this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I ended up putting a sign outside my office door that said, there's only two genders, male and female. Trust a science. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I think we had to spend four or five days asking the Chinese spy balloon what its pronouns were before we were willing to shoot it down. REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): Make no mistake, this is an investigation of Joe Biden and to determine whether or not Joe Biden, first of all, lied to the American people. I think we're going to be all right on that answer. But secondly, is Joe Biden compromised? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is simple. The District of Columbia must be allowed to govern itself.\" Now that is on the policy side. Then the politics. There were more than 170 House Democrats who voted against this Republican effort to repeal this law.
