The Brazilian team arrived here as the favorites to win it. Most pundits believe they had their best chance they've had since their fifth victory 20 years ago. Now, it was their best opportunity since then to make it six. And they looked so good in their last game against South Korea, but Croatia were a completely different proposition for them tonight. And full credit to Croatia for the way they managed this game, and for the way they saw it through in the end. Let's run the highlights and show you how it went down. Because the Brazilian team will be absolutely heartbroken. The game went to extra time, Neymar at the end of the first period scoring his  77th international goal, tying him with the record of Pele for official Brazil goals scored. They must of thought they were home and dry, but then look at this, Bruno Petkovic equalizing for the Croatians three minutes from time, that meant we went to penalties. And once we were into spot-kicks, it was a disaster for the Brazilian side. Rodrygo was saved, and then Marquinhos hit the post on the crucial spot- kick, meaning that Croatia have done it again. We shouldn't be that surprised by the way. They were in the finals four years ago. They are in the semis here now. And they are past masters at these extra time games in the World Cup and how they win them. Have a look at the graphic. Let's look at what they've done over this tournament and the last one. They've won four penalty shootouts, beating Denmark, the host, Russia four years ago. They knocked out Japan here on penalties the other day. And now they've toppled Brazil, that is absolutely extraordinary. You know, I come from a country in England, where, you know, we break out in hives when it goes to a penalty shootout because it so often goes the wrong way. Croatia are just -- they're just experts.

There are indications that the U.S. did anassessment that he does not pose a risk to the U.S. But that is far from certain, and that is far from the whole potential narrative that needs to be looked at here, according to some officials. Bout has long-time ties when he was not in prison to the African weapons trading business. He has stand accused, as you say, of illegal arms transfers of dealing with terrorists of a whole litany of offenses for which he has been related to that -- for which he's been serving time. So, the question now is, what is the world that Viktor Bout faces after coming out of U.S. prisons for so many years. Does he still have ties in Africa? Does he have business ties he will resurrect in Russia and use that potentially to trade weapons in Africa? Remember, the Russian Wagner Group has grown in strength over the years in Africa, in particular as a paramilitary organization, as an organization involved in what is widely agreed to be illegal activities. So, there are other players in Africa since Bout went away to prison. But I think the bottom line is, the U.S. will try and watch very carefully what he does. He's very expert in covering his tracks. The question is, what does Viktor Bout want now? Does he want back into the business or does he want to be home in Moscow, potentially with his family, living a quieter life in Russia.

And remember, it was Putin who illegally annexed Crimea back in 2014, I was here to cover that, and the Russian soldiers essentially   kind of, for better or worse, kind of walked right in. And Putin somehow believed when he started this war, perhaps that the same thing would happen, because he sent this convoy in through the Belarusian border and thought they just drive right here to Kyiv without any resistance. Well, of course, we have seen the Ukrainians fiercely fight back. And they were fighting back two months ago in October -- well, they have never claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Crimean bridge, but it's widely believed, and certainly the Russians believe, that Ukraine was behind the bombing of that bridge which was a pet project of Putin. And just two days later, they started this relentless bombing campaign of civilian infrastructure. And they have viciously targeted the power grid to the point that Ukraine is running out of these Soviet-era replacement parts that are increasingly in short supply. They actually have to ask other former Soviet nations if they have any spares to make the repairs. So as a result, you have almost 20 million people in a very difficult position in this country as the temperatures plunge. And the official start of Winter hasn't even come yet. That's in a matter of days. But it certainly feels like Winter, and it gets colder and colder every day. And you have millions of people, essentially plunged into the darkness and the cold at a time that, you know, help is really critically needed. And Vladimir Putin on the other hand at this award ceremony at the Kremlin is, you know, standing with a champagne flute in hand, essentially toasting the misery of the Ukrainians, and accusing them of starting this, when he started the war.

But personally, I don't think that this is going to stop the protesters this time around. I also can -- you know, I think as you said, like there are many more on the death row. There are many -- there are thousands of detainees that we don't even know enough about. And this is one of the scariest things. Because just as Mohsen Shekari's case shows, when a prisoner is not known enough by the international community, by the human rights community, they are at a greater risk of essentially one day their family waking up and hearing that they have been executed, killed and so on. And so, there is a lot to unveil beneath the surface of the numbers that we hear in terms of the detentions, the -- you know, the trials that are absolutely in violations of due process procedures.

As much as it actually takes lots of advocacy on our side as human rights defenders are brought to even get these kinds of statements or like let's say, a U.N. special session and so on. But I think that the people on the ground want to see action by the -- by the international community. They want a concerted, unanimous effort by the world to consider the Islamic Republic an illegitimate government, an illegitimate regime in the absence of the possibility of doing any kind of a free form of a referendum. These protests should be considered as a kind of a referendum against the Islamic Republic's legitimacy. And these need to be hand-in-hand with, you know, with a variety of means. For example, using universal jurisdiction to hold accountable, you know, various levels of authorities of the country that take part in persecutions. Whether it's the judiciary, the security forces, and so on. It's stopping the money from flowing outside. It is rethinking and reconsidering the continuation of the JCPOA negotiations at this point in time when people and children are being killed on the streets. It is the embassies of various countries trying to find ways to send high-level observers, you know, into these courts where people are being trialed for two minutes and then killed afterwards.

What we do know is that Keystone Pipeline went into an emergency shutdown yesterday due to this oil spill that was discovered leaking oil into a creek in Kansas. Now, Trans-Canada, the Toronto-based company that owns and operates this pipeline, they estimate that 14,000 barrels of oil spilled and they're still working to try to contain this spill. As you can see, there is a map. The red line is Keystone. You can see it brings oil down from Canada into the middle of America, into refineries in the Midwest and then along to the Gulf Coast. This is not to be confused with Keystone XL. That is the dotted line. That was the controversial proposed extension of this pipeline. That project was killed last year. So this spill takes place on the existing pipeline. And a short while ago, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, he provided an update. He said that the Transportation Department is monitoring and investigating the Keystone Pipeline leak that was first detected Wednesday night. He says that federal regulators have issued a corrective action order requiring a shutdown of the affected segment, analysis of the cause and other safety measures. Now, oil prices initially spiked on this news, Eleni, yesterday. Oil prices are up by almost 5 percent when this first came out. But all of those gains quickly vanished. Oil prices closed down on the day yesterday. And look at that, down significantly again today. This shows that investors are not anticipating a long shutdown that is going to have a dramatic impact on supply. And in fact, investors seem a little bit more concerned right now about the demand side of things. There's all these recession worries. And right now, markets are more concerned about how much energy the U.S. economy the world economy needs right now. They're not as worried about the supply disruption.",

And he said, yes, that will put a threshold on what we can do with Saudi Arabia. It's not just, you know, a threshold on what can be done with Saudi Arabia, but of all kind of U.S. partners and allies, because there's this concern that Huawei, for example, will give a backdoor for Chinese intelligence, for the Chinese government to get national security data from the U.S. and from its allies.

It doesn't have the levers that it used to have. It's distracted with other conflicts like the one in Ukraine, and this is to China's advantage, the world order is changing. The U.S. is not as powerful as it was, China's more powerful and sees these opportunities. And MBS wants more of that change, and more -- and to be a bigger player in the change in the influence. So I think the -- in the White House Administration, yes, this will cause concern. Yes, they will look at ways to mitigate it. But there's a direction of travel here that the U.S. will recognize is going to be a tough one to rollback.",
