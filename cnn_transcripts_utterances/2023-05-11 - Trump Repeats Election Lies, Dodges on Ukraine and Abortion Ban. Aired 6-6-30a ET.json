He refused to admit that he lost. He derided E. Jean Carroll, just one day after a jury of her peers found that he sexually abused and defamed her. Trump described January 6, the insurrection as a, quote, \"beautiful day\" and vowed to pardon, quote, \"many\" of the rioters who had attacked the Capitol that day. He called the overturning of Roe versus Wade a great victory, but he dodged Kaitlan's many critical questions about, if he's president again, would he sign a federal abortion ban into law. He wouldn't say also if he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. So that is where we start this morning. Let's bring in CNN chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny to break down last night's key moments. And Jeff, I was watching the coverage before the town hall started.

But DOJ's policy under prior administrations was, for the most part, unless the person has other convictions in the United States, turn them around, send them home, make a record of it. What started happening under the Trump DOJ was they said, no, no, no. We are now prosecuting all of these cases, even if the person doesn't have a prior aggravated felony. And as a result, when a family would arrive at the border, they would say, OK, parents, we're holding you. You're now going into our criminal courts. Children, if you're with the parents, are being separated. And so that is absolutely a decision that will be made president by president.
