And later, what could have been in mass casualty nightmare in a now canceled Taylor Swift concert. The latest on what authorities say three suspects were planning to do and how. Good evening. John Berman here in for Anderson. So, it turns out that after backing out of a September 10th presidential debate on ABC, Donald Trump is back in. That was the main nugget of news in a mountain of ramblings at his press conference today at Mar-a-Lago. He now says he wants to three debates. The other two on Fox and NBC. Vice President Harris late today said this about the ABC face off. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I'm glad that he has finally agreed to a debate on September 10th. I'm looking forward to it and hope he shows up. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: As for the rest of the press conference, it was a very lengthy, very Trumpy affair, one that left a pro-Harris strategist telling CNN's Jamie Gangel, they hope he holds one every day and prompted pro-Trump strategist, Ari Fleischer to tweet partway through, \"Trump should stop the news conference now. Don't turn this into the COVID 90-minute briefings.\" But like those briefings, the former president held court, held forth, and held the facts largely at arms' length or beyond, such as here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have a very bad economy right now. We could literally be on the throes of a depression, not recession, a depression and they can't have that. They can't have that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, I think, John, what's happened here is that they planned a very effective campaign against Joe Biden and they may think of it as having won a campaign against Joe Biden because he's no longer the candidate. But they landed about three months early and now they have a different race and he's clearly freaked out about it.The reason that he went on and on about crowd size was because he's been watching these rallies of Kamala Harris and he has crowd envy because she's stealing his act. She's got big enthusiastic crowds. I also thought it was noteworthy a couple of other things. One is, he repeated this notion that somehow it was unconstitutional that she was the candidate because she wasn't the candidate in the primaries. I mean, she was running with the president. So, I think he's laying the predicate here for claiming that somehow this is all illegitimate. If he loses this election, I think that's maybe what he thinks. But in any case, I leave you with this question, look at Kamala Harris the last few weeks and look at Donald Trump today, and tell me who looks and feels like the confident candidate. It isn't Donald Trump and that is a sea change here from the guy we saw in Milwaukee a few weeks ago who thought he was on his way to an electoral landslide.",

They have to prosecute that case in the same ruthless, focused way they were prosecuting strength versus weakness against Biden. It's not exactly happening every day right now. I would challenge Ax on one point about the confidence point. It's pretty confident to stand up and do a press conference. Kamala Harris is not willing to do that right now, is not sitting down to have her record challenged by any journalist. And I think that does show something of a lack of confidence and if they achieved anything good today, it was to make the point.

You have to stay because they need that position. But as you mentioned, he obviously was replaced by somebody plenty capable. He did his 24 years, which is four years after 9/11, by the way.

She's doing better among Hispanic voters. So she's really, really assembling the Democratic base. And the question is, can she push out from that? But I will point out a couple of things. One is that, Democratic enthusiasm in this poll is up dramatically. And -- and that's a very, very important element here because turnout is going to be so important in these races. And the second is her standing, has she had a 35 percent approval rating when they last polled in May and now it's up to 47 percent, that's an enormous amount of progress. So there are a lot of positive signs in here. But, you know, I've said it many times. I'll say it again. This is going to be a close race. This is going to be a battle.

When President Biden withdrew, he was at 36 percent support in the polling average. Now, he is mid, even a little upper 40s. He's gone up that far. And you think, why? Because people were relieved and grateful that he did it. And by the way, the exact same thing happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1968.
