Tonight is Vice President Kamala Harris' night. Last night, with all the star-studded cast, it was ultimately Tim Walz's night. Governor Walz talked about his military career and his political career, but it was his family who really showed America why Harris chose him to be her running mate.

Her statements when she ran for president, very liberal. And her actions as working for Joe Biden, which resulted in a mid-30s approval rating for the Biden- Harris administration. Now, through anonymous spokespeople, a lot of that's been -- attempted to be walked back. Nothing we've heard this week and nothing we heard last night would tell you what they would do if they got elected president. So I want to -- I -- as a voter, I think we need to hear a little bit more about that. All the things we heard last night from Oprah to everything else is about hey, she's got the right vibe so let's just vote for it and see what happens. To me, that's not quite good enough. I mean, she's obviously come a long way in the polls from where Biden was. But to get over the hump I really do think you've got to tell people what would your actions be. The one policy she has unveiled has been panned across the board by economists and media alike. She did it on Friday.

Just hours before, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone stressing the urgency of getting a deal done, according to the White House.

Now, that had been floated last week as something that would happen either Thursday or over the weekend. And at the moment, I have to say there's no indication that -- those big peace talk summit to get this over the line is going to happen in Cairo or anywhere anytime soon. Hamas has yet to say whether or not they agree to the U.S. bridging proposal. All indications, so far, is that they are objecting to it, and they will give it -- they will give it a complete rejection. And here in Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu already contesting and his office contesting elements that Secretary of State Antony Blinken thought Israel had agreed to -- the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from along the border with Gaza -- the so-called Philadelphi Corridor. The prime minister's office issuing a statement to contradict what's being reported in Israel, saying that Israel is not going to pull the troops out.

New this morning, Taylor Swift is now speaking out about her shows that were canceled in Vienna after a terror plot was thwarted, saying she was devastated to cancel the shows. In her first public comments on what happened and the threat that was uncovered around it, she posted on Instagram the cancellations filled her with \"a new sense of fear and a tremendous amount of guilt.\" But also, that she was grateful they were grieving only the loss of concerts and not lives. Great perspective there for sure. There's also this. Italian officials are still trying to recover the final person missing from a luxury yacht that sank off the coast of Sicily. But search and -- search and rescue has clearly become a recovery mission now. This morning, a fifth body bag was seen being brought to shore. The superyacht sank Monday after it was hit by what's been described as a freak storm so powerful it broke the superyacht's mast in half. The victims have not been formally identified but a British tech tycoon and his 18-year-old daughter were among those reported missing, along with a prominent banker, an attorney, and their wives. And one famous penguin now being honored today. Sphen, a penguin who became an unlikely international symbol for equality, died earlier this month from natural causes at the age of 11. But back in 2018, Sphen partnered with a fellow male penguin named Magic at the Sydney Aquarium in Australia. The two were inseparable and raised two chicks together. Their partnership became a worldwide sensation. After Sphen's death, the aquarium says that they took Sphen to Magic to help him understand the loss, and they say that Magic and the whole penguin colony then broke out in song in mourning. This morning, a major U.S. company is battling tech issues after reportedly being hit by a cyberattack. We're talking about Texas-based Halliburton. And Reuters reports the apparent attack is causing major headaches for this huge oil company. CNN's Matt Egan has the details. He's here with us now. What are you learning about this, Matt?",

They are not confirming or denying to CNN that they are the victim of a cyberattack. But they did acknowledge an unspecified issue. Let me read you what the company said in a statement. \"We are aware of an issue affecting certain company systems and are working diligently to assess the cause and potential impact.\" Halliburton went on to say that they have activated a response plan and they're working with experts internally and externally to address this -- all things the company would do if they suspected cyber here. We've reached out to U.S. cyber officials and to the Energy Department, and they're not commenting at this point. But clearly, an actual cyberattack on Halliburton would be very significant.
