And a Swiftie split. Taylor Swift fans divided on whether to take a sneak peek as her new album allegedly leaks online. All that and much more coming up. But first, major news from the criminal hush money trial against Donald Trump. A full 12-person jury has now been seated. It consists of seven men and five women. We had started the day with seven seated jurors. Two were then dismissed, with one of them expressing concerns about her identity becoming public. Trump also spoke from the courthouse in the past hour, again, stressing his innocence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm supposed to be in New Hampshire. I'm supposed to be in Georgia. I'm supposed to be in North Carolina, South Carolina. I'm supposed to be in a lot of different places campaigning.

After months of inaction, he finally decided to hold a vote, four individual votes, I should say, on these aid bills that will provide aid to Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine, and some other national security priorities, including a ban on TikTok. So, the House is planning to vote on those bills on Saturday, and then they will package them all together and send them over to the Senate in one piece. But they have to get through some procedural hoops. And because some of his hardline members are opposed to additional Ukraine funding and are also mad that there's no border security in this package of bills, that means Johnson is going to have to rely on Democrats to get these bills over the finish line. Now, so far, Democrats have not made any commitments, but they have sounded somewhat open to the idea. They like this package of bills. They want to see them passed. Even President Biden has said he would sign them if they were to get to his desk. So, we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But hanging over it all, as you mentioned, is this potential vote to oust Johnson from the speakership. That is something that some Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Green have threatened to do. She hasn't forced a floor vote just yet. And earlier today, we did hear some talk among Republicans about changing that rule so that any single member can't force a vote on removing the sitting speaker. Ultimately, though Johnson decided not to change those rules. He said they just don't have the votes to do it. So, he is pressing ahead with these foreign aid plans and knowing that his speakership could be on the line here. And once again, it may come down to Democrats to not only get those bills over the finish line, but also to save Mike Johnson's speakership. So, that is the question right now, is whether he can pass these foreign aid bills and also keep his speaker's gavel.",

And that also meant that the Israelis had the opportunity to sound off their missile warnings, their air raid alerts, and get their citizens to safety in their bomb shelters. So, I do believe there was a lot of effort by the Israelis not to roll the dice here. This was well calculated. But you're absolutely right. You know, when you're throwing hundreds of missiles at Israel, at a country that is armed to the teeth and views you as an implacable enemy, there is a decent chance that you're going to end up in war. And so, the stakes are very high and the Iranian leadership, both the IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, and an 84-year-old supreme leader whose health is not great, they feel like they're under a lot of pressure and they had to respond to the unprecedented attack by Israel against sovereign government building of Iran in in Damascus, in Syria. So, yes, they were actually taking a real risk. And when we're talking about this war going forward, a war that is no longer contained to Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but is actually expanding well beyond to the Red Sea, to the Straits of Hormuz, to Jordan, to Syria, to Iraq and now, to Israel and Iran, every time we talk about these escalations, we could be talking about direct war. And direct war between Israel and Iran would probably bring in the Americans, would probably shut down the Straits of Hormuz for a period of time, would probably lead to $150 oil for a period of time. And by the way, would probably lead to a Trump election come November. So, we are talking about an awful lot at stake here well beyond just these two countries.",

And they were there watching the president of Ukraine saying that he had lost the town of Avdiivka because they didn't have the military capability to defend themselves against the advancing Russian soldiers. And what I saw from across the political divide is that American legislators did not want to see Putin win on their watch. And I thought it was very likely on the back of that, that the United States would provide additional aid going forward to Ukraine. I also haven't seen Trump try to really prevent this aid from going through in a way that he did. He put his thumb on the scale pretty hard in terms of not having a border deal that would make Biden look like he'd handled the deal and been successful in the run up to the election. This was not a top priority for Trump. So, for all of those reasons, I felt quite confident that the Americans are going to get this money and these weapons packaged through, but it's taken a few months.

And now, there are fears it could partially collapse into the water and cause a tsunami. All the island's residents, about 800 of them, have been moved temporarily to a neighboring island. Michael Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Billowing plumes of smoke and ash darken the skies above an Indonesian island. Authorities ordered hundreds of people to evacuate Wednesday after a series of volcanic eruptions. The alert level now at maximum as the volcano's possible collapse into the water threatens to trigger a tsunami, like it did in 1871, which produced 25-meter waves, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 725-meter Mount Ruang sits on Ruang Island in North Sulawesi in Indonesia. Since Tuesday night, its multiple eruptions have sent hot clouds almost two kilometers into the sky, according to the country's volcanology agency, while glowing lava flows. TAKA, LOCAL FISHERMAN (through translator): Last night at 7:00, there was a mixture of fire and rocks erupting, causing the roofs of residents houses to leap. Lava flowed down from various directions. HOLMES (voice-over): Ruang Island's roughly 800 residents have evacuated to nearby Tagulandang Island. But officials warn that even there, villagers face threats from falling red hot rocks, hot cloud surges, and possible tsunamis. JANDRY PAENDONG, MANADA SEARCH AND RESCUE OFFICIAL (through translator): Last night, local people were evacuating themselves sporadically because of small rocks coming down from the eruption. People were panicked and scrambled. HOLMES (voice-over): Transport officials shut down Sam Ratulangi International Airport more than a hundred kilometers from the volcano. Some airlines cancelled flights to nine airports in the region. The showers of ash threatening flight safety and stranding passengers. ROBBY CHARLES, PASSENGER (through translator): We had already loaded our luggage and checked in our belongings, and we waited for about an hour, only to be informed that our flight was cancelled due to the eruption of Mount Ruang, and Manado was affected. HOLMES (voice-over): But as long as Mount Ruang continues to erupt, threats of hot smoke, lava, falling rocks, and tsunamis remain. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

How do you get demand? I mean, the IMF managing director talking to me afterwards, you know, it was clear, how do you get demand -- domestic demand, to replace or at least substitute for overseas demand, which has been the bastion of growth of China? So, that's one of the big issues here. The other one, which is sort of bubbling on the back burner, but clearly moving forward, Julia, is protectionism. Whether it's Biden talking for higher tariffs on China, or we know what Trump would do, or even Bruno Le Maire of France saying to me, there needs to be a level playing field between the E.U. and China. Well, one man's level playing field is another's protectionism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And a few showers here, too, around parts of Athens, and then rolling all the way up toward Kyiv. Some of this could be heavy at times, it could be 50 to 100 millimeters with that secondary low that actually rolls across Italy and then on up through Athens and toward the north.
