There was a little bit of a ceremony here where the search and rescuers, they put on the sirens of their ambulances and of the fire trucks. They put on their flashing lights as well. They themselves were honored. And, of course, they also honored and paid respects to the many victims that were buried underneath the rubble here. I just want to get out of your way because it really is an imposing site now. There's an eerie quiet here now and just this massive, gaping hole where this residential building used to stand. And, obviously, many people live their lives here. Dozens of families lived here until it all came crashing down. And all that, of course, just to one massive missile the Ukrainians say. Again, we have to point out to your viewers, the Ukrainians say that the missile that was fired into this building is designed to destroy aircraft carriers. It's a massive ordinance dropped here. And certainly the rescue operation, the search operation have been massive. And I think you guys were referring to it, there were still bodies who were pulled from here - were pulled from here earlier today. There were four bodies that were recovered, including the body of a small child. That puts the death toll of children here to four. And, of course, there are still people who are missing and maybe some more bodies will be found in the future, but for now the initial part of the search and rescue operation here certainly has ended. And if you just look at some of the figures, it really is remarkable because the operation went on for about 72 hours and the Ukrainians say that in that time they put -- they got away more than 8,500 tons of debris. And, of course, there were people buried underneath a lot of that. So, a massive operation that took place here. Folks here working around the clock. And as you guys can imagine, as people still stand here, still come here, still lay flowers here, many of them in tears, there is a lot of anger right now towards Moscow and towards the Russians.

He will be holding a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of the Netherlands. And, of course, as you said, no surprise here, the ongoing war in Ukraine is expected to be a major topic of discussion.Of course, the Netherlands is a country that has already committed some billions of dollars to supporting Ukraine. And as this war has dragged on, President Biden, for his part, has made crystal clear over and over again that he believes it remains all the more important that the alliance of countries that are supporting Ukraine basically stick together and continue giving security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and that these countries ban together to continue rejecting Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. Now, Ukraine aside, we also, of course, expect the two leaders to talk about different areas of economic cooperation. And one area that we are watching out for, of course, is containing China's economic expansion, and particularly on the key issue and the key U.S. goal of preventing China and Beijing from getting access to this important semiconductor technology. That has been a critical American goal and something that Biden has, again, made clear that he doesn't think the U.S. can do alone. Case in point, think back to last week when he hosted the prime minister of Japan here at the White House, and that, again, ended up being a key issue of discussion. So, again, the two leaders are going to be heading into a bilateral meeting this morning, and we expect economic cooperation and also the war in Ukraine to be two important topics. Of course, this coming on the heels of that horrific missile attack that we've seen in Ukraine in Dnipro. Obviously, the two leaders are expected to discuss that as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, our sources did not give us specific locations, but we know from our reporting that the president used other office spaces, his family also, for example, rented a home in northern Virginia. It's important to note, it wouldn't just be potentially searches for additional classified documents, but also potentially be looking for other presidential records that would need to be turned over to The Archives.Now, in terms of what has been searched so far, after that initial discovery of classified documents at the president's former office here in D.C., his team of attorneys decided to carry out some additional searches, but they specifically focused on locations where they knew documents had been shipped during the 2017 transition. So, that's the former office and these two residences, which you see there on the screen. Now, the other question is, if there are other searches, who exactly would do them? Because right now they have the president's private attorney and a White House attorney conducting these searches. Now, only the White House attorney has the proper clearance. And this gets a little messy. One attorney finds something, has to stop, wait for the person who has clearance, and then it has to be handed over to the Justice Department. Look, John, I'm not saying that there is some playbook for sitting presidents who have to undergo a search for classified materials from the time they were vice president, but this can potentially get a little messy. Now, it is interesting, in our reporting we learned the U.S. attorney out in Chicago, who originally handled the review of this case, he didn't ask for searches, he didn't conduct any searches. The Biden team did that on their own. But it is also notable that he did not wait, the U.S. attorney did not wait for the Biden team to complete all of these searches before recommending a special counsel. He had seen enough. There was also, we're told, a little bit of frustration with the pace and the lack of speed in these searches. And now this will likely be something we'll have to work out with the special counsel Robert Hur. Will there be additional locations searched and who will do them?",

So, Margaret, clearly not the conversation that the president had been hoping to start the new year on, and here we are.

And that is, if he were to be charged or if they were to try to use something and they're not - they're -- his team is telling him don't say anything right now. But, look, I have found that the American people and prosecutors and judges and juries are most forgiving when they don't feel like they're being, you know, led down a path without being told the truth. And so this seems to me to be a pretty simple call by this president just to come forward and say, this is what we're doing, this is what we've found, this is how it happened, this is what I'm going to do to make sure that we've recovered everything. And at that point he's dealt with it politically, but I really think, at the end of the day, he's also delt with it legally. I don't fault his lawyers for being cautious. I think certainly in this environment that's - that's probably a well-deserved place to be. But, at the same time, you know, this - this has been both a political mess and could turn into a legal mess. I mean even in the opening I was kind of chuckling at how there's -- the comment about there was frustration over the pace of the search. For crying out loud, I mean, we're talking about a few weeks versus months or a year or more in the search down in Florida. So, we - this - these have gotten conflated together and I think that's hurting Biden. And it will hurt him to come out and just level with where we are, what he's doing, what he's going to do to fix it, how it happened and face it head-on.",

And so we have differentiated the legal consequence from both of these cases, but you can't deny that the optics at least politically harm this current president, President Biden, who said that he came in with sophistication, right, with experience and criticized former President Trump with how he handled classified documents.Michael, if I can just follow you - follow up with you on the question of the volume of documents because we've said that maybe perhaps there's some under 20 versus the 300 or so that President Trump had stored. Does that matter as much as the level of sensitivity and classification of these documents?",

And so, from that aspect, I would say, no.From the optics of it, from a prosecutor looking at it, from a judge or a jury looking at it, then I think the volume matters. So, you know, you've got to sort of differentiate the threats -- the possible threat, at least, that there may be to some classified secrets getting out versus how many are there. And, again, we don't know. And that's part of what makes this whole, you know, confusion about who' going to search and how are they going to search. I mean think about how silly it is that we're getting into an argument about form over function. I mean, for crying out loud, let's get somebody in there. These documents are typically contained in an envelope or in some type of folder marked classified. It's not like they're just laying out, you know, like a kitchen recipe on the counter or something. Let's look at the - let's look at the documents. Let them find that. And then if they need to turn any - but let's go ahead and get on with the search. We're letting form take over function.
