      "sentences": "Overnight, a U.S. official told CNN Israel carried out a military strike deep inside Iran. Could this escalate the already tense situation in the Middle East? Jury selection in Donald Trump's hush money trial could wrap up today. Opening statements in this historic case are on track to begin Monday. Plus, on the House floor, a critical test for a long stalled foreign aid bill for Israel and Ukraine.Hello, I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. Happening now, a decades long shadow war between Israel and Iran spills out in the open. U.S. officials now say Israel launched an overnight strike on Iran, appearing to target a military facility some 200 miles from the capital, Tehran. In the hours since the attack, there has been a nearly unified global response. Iran's allies like China and Russia echoing calls from Israel's western supporters to show restraint and avoid a wider regional conflict. CNN is covering the story from around the globe. Our chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is tracking developments from London. Our national security correspondent Natasha Bertrand is over at the Pentagon. And Natasha, let me start with you. What's the Biden administration saying about the strike inside Iran?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, they're being very tight lipped so far this morning about this strike. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would not even acknowledge that it was in fact an Israeli strike inside Iran, saying only that the U.S. had nothing to do with this offensive operation, but reiterating that the U.S. does not want to see the conflict in the region escalate and essentially calling for peace and for calm as we move forward with this.But look, the administration was warned by the Israelis prior to them carrying out this strike, according to U.S. official, it may not have been days beforehand, it was fairly soon before the Israelis conducted this strike. But still they heeded the U.S. calls to give them a heads up before they moved forward with this strike. And the U.S. made very clear to them as well that they did not endorse this attack. Again, they have been trying to deescalate tensions in the region. And while they are not outright condemning it, they are still reiterating here that a full on war between Israel and Iran is obviously not something that anyone wants to see at this point. Now, U.S. officials were in conversations repeatedly this week with their Israeli counterparts, including here at the Pentagon. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant just yesterday and they discussed Iran's regional escalation. It's unclear if Gallant previewed the Israeli military action to Secretary Austin, but the message has been consistent here. They don't want to see this escalate any further and they importantly do not want Iran or anyone else in the international community, of course, to think that the U.S. had anything to do with this.

      "sentences": "Yes, look, it's been comparatively muted this morning from Iranian officials, a lack of transparency, frankly, on the damage done. Some military officials suggesting we're talking about three drones potentially intercepted. Another suggesting that the noise is heard over Isfahan, a city that has some key military and nuclear facilities around it but that was essentially related to air defenses targeting a suspicious object.So we don't really know exactly whether the Iranians are going to admit what was hit here and that may play very well into their hands. Look, Wolf, one of the key advantages of being an autocracy is you get to control the information within your own society. And so Iran looks like for now is essentially trying to say that Israel didn't really manage to hit anything and that what happened in the skies over Isfahan last night was a bit of a nothing burger. But still, that is a marked difference from just hours before this strike. What we heard from their foreign minister in terms of the ferocity of Iran's response where it attacked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): In case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level.

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it has been absolute silence both from the Israeli government and its military. No word from the Mossad either, which we know in the past has conducted some similar clandestine operations inside of Iran before. And that is all very intentional. The Israeli government, in choosing to carry out this limited response, also wanted to do so in a way that did it with very limited public fanfare, in a way that sent a message to Iran directly, that -- the kind of attack that Iran carried out on Israel over the weekend would not go unanswered, but while also allowing Iran effectively to save face.And what Nick was just reporting on in terms of the Iranian reaction and the way in which they are kind of spinning this to avoid having to retaliate further is exactly the reason why we are seeing the kind of silence that we are hearing from Israeli government officials. It's also important to keep in mind, of course, that this response came after days of pressure from the United States and other Israeli allies to carry out a limited response, to carry out a response that would thread that needle of both sending the message but also avoiding spiraling this conflict further into an all-out war between Iran and Israel. And for now at least, it appears that kind of delicate balance has indeed been achieved. And I also think it's important to note that the Israeli public, over the course of this week in public polling, has made clear that they didn't want to see military action in Iran that would risk undermining the Israel's alliance with the United States and with the other partners who helped carry out that very successful air defense operation over the weekend. And so clearly, that is ultimately the direction that the Israeli government chose here, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "So it's actually going to be separate votes initially. So this is how it's going to happen. Each of those votes are going to be four bills. Those are the three, eight or those three countries that you mentioned. There's a fourth bill as well that includes some other measures, including to try to force the sale of TikTok from the Chinese company ByteDance, if not threatening to ban it in App Stores in the United States. All that's going to be after it's voted on individually in the House, it will be all wrapped together in one package and then sent over to the Senate, which will give it final approval and sent to the President's desk.And that process also is what's causing that revolt on the right. There are a lot of Republicans who did not want to spend any more money for Ukraine and said that they absolutely should not be tied to aid to Israel in particular. But the Speaker of the House recognizing he had to get the votes. And also the Speaker changing his own view on Ukraine aid after getting briefed in sensitive classified briefings about the nature of that war within -- against Russia, has been become a staunch advocate of getting more money to Ukraine and recognizing the votes simply were not there to separate these and send individual pieces of these larger package over to the Senate. So he needed Democratic votes, so he decided to use this process to tie them all together. Now, because of those moves, this bill is on its way to become law. And the Speaker of the House potentially could stay as Speaker of the House with the support of Democrats if they decide to do that. Wolf?",

He obviously is taking on a number of members of his coalition, the far right, the Freedom Caucus numbers, you know, two dozen, three dozen or so. And the vote shows that. But I'm encouraged by it. I was also encouraged to hear, if I heard Manu's numbers correctly, that three quarters of Republicans voted for this package.So it tells you that an easy majority of Republicans still believe that America's leadership in the world matters and that we need to help Ukraine and of course, Israel and support Taiwan as well. So I think this is a very good day. Hopefully he's right in terms of the timeline, things moving quickly tomorrow through the Senate and then on the President's desk. And this will be very good news for Ukraine. And I'm sure Vladimir Putin is not happy sitting in Moscow right now.",

And I think maybe the same is true for their air defenses. They have S-300 Russian air defenses, which are very good systems. But it's more than just equipment. It's about training, it's about maintenance, it's about many other things.And look, the other part of this, Wolf, it's important to keep in mind, part of this trade off that's happening right now between Russia and Iran, which involves the Ukraine war, as Iran provides Shaheen drones and ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine. In exchange, Iran has been asking for advanced jet fighters, an S-400 air defense systems. If they were able to acquire both, that would make penetrating Iranian airspace far more difficult for both the Israelis and the United States. So this is part of that growing alliance between Russia and Iran and China as well that we need to be very careful about and mindful of.",

So far, I don't think there's been any Iranian response, certainly not immediate, not at the highest level. What do you think the Iranians are going to do?",

And this morning, the silence from both sides, frankly, is deafening, that nobody's talking about what happened, there's, you know, et cetera.

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: -- on Russia and China and Iran, which I believe is the new axis of evil, and many of us do, and they are the ones who are the aggressors in this situation. The reality here is that if the House did not do this better policy and process, allowing for amendments on the floor in the process tomorrow, we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill. And that is because were very close, given the timeline in both Israel and Ukraine to a discharge petition being brought. And a discharge petition in layman's terms, is that when a number of members or a majority of members get together, they can override the speaker and bring something straight to the floor. That would have happened imminently on the Senate supplemental. So by doing this, even though it's not the perfect legislation, it's not the legislation that we would write if Republicans were in charge of both the House, the Senate, and the White House. This is the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances to take care of these really important obligations. And so we look forward to the vote tomorrow. We look forward to every member voting their conscience and their desire. And that is exactly how this process is supposed to work and how the House is supposed to operate. So we're happy to provide that and we'll give you more comment tomorrow.",

The important thing is get the arms and munitions to them. We can sort out later whether they repay the full loan, half the loan, whatever the case may be. But look, I think it's a fair trade off.

They originally thought they could be. They slept on it. They could not.Now, we have seen them go systematically through, they talked about what they do, what kind of news they consume. Could they be fair and impartial? Do they have any interaction with various political groups? Now they're taking a break, and we're going to get to the part where both sides, the prosecution and the defense, start to ask questions, really of the group as a whole talking to them. And there are some specifics there. We've seen some social media questions, some kind of pointed questions at various jurors. Now, one thing to note here is that in the past, last two times we've done this, the last time we did this, they only got 25 minutes to question them. They're getting an extra five minutes now because this pool selection is bigger. Last time it was 18 people. Even though it has gone down from 22, they are still getting that extra five minutes. You'll see about 30 minutes on each side to go over the various questions that they think are important, whether or not these people, particularly what we've seen with the defense questions about how do you feel about Donald Trump?",
