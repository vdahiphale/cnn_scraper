It was a picture of the judge's clerk with Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer. And in that post, the former president basically claiming without evidence, that she is Schumer's girlfriend. Well, this clearly crossed the line for the judge. When court resumed in the afternoon he discussed the matter, saying that there was disparaging and untrue and personally identifiable picture that was posted of a member of his staff. He ordered that it be deleted. But he said that it was already sent to millions of people. And he said this, quote: Personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I will not tolerate them. And after that he said that none of the defendants could speak publicly about anyone on his staff. So remember, this is the same judge who will be calling all the shots, determining damages in this trial. And the president clearly going too far on this one.

And of course, this is set to be a lengthy counteroffensive. And these concerns around weapons shortages amongst NATO allies in terms of the supplies being offered to Ukraine is a huge issue.We know that the Ukrainian armed forces is heavily reliant on that support and that funding, and particularly when it comes to ammunition on its western NATO allies. And we heard yesterday from EU lawmakers adopting a now a multi-year funding package for Ukraine set to take place over four years, worth up to $52 billion. So this is a significant package and it is crucially a long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine. Which is the message that we have seen being put across by European leaders. They do intend to stick by Ukraine for the long run. And of course, we saw that call yesterday between President Joe Biden and his G7 and NATO partners. He once again reiterated that he, in his view, will stick by Ukraine and Washington will not turn its back on Kyiv. But of course, with these questions around the U.S. budget and questions around the additional funding that is being protected in the new U.S. budget, there is concern amongst Ukrainian officials and of course, among amongst Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines who are dependent on this ammunition and on these weapons. And as you mentioned there, NATO now issuing that warning that they are seeing the bottom of the barrel, that production of this ammunition really needs to be stepped up at a much faster pace. And of course, we know that the counteroffensive has been going somewhat slower than many would have anticipated or hoped. And of course, we are nearing the more difficult winter months, which could pose a significant challenge to the Ukraine armed forces on the frontlines. So this is a huge concern. But as far as the European Union is concerned, as far as EU leaders are concerned, they intend to stick by Ukraine.
