Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying he will address Congress accepting a joint invitation from the House and Senate. This comes as President Joe Biden on Friday outlined a peace plan for the war in Gaza that he says is from Israel. Hamas has said it views the plan positively, but Netanyahu is insisting that Israel's goals for the war have quote \"not changed\". And that's raising questions over its degree of support for the plan as outlined by Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The president as you heard there saying that Israel's stated goals have been met and that Hamas has been degraded and then calling for that end to the war as part of this hostage deal.Now he did outline what those three phases include. Some of these details we have discussed multiple times before and didn't change. But it was interesting to hear him outline and provide a little more meat on the bones here. So the first phase is similar to what's been laid out. It would include women, the elderly, and wounded -- those hostages, being released for a six-week ceasefire. Now the second phase includes all hostages being released and all of this in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. And then perhaps a permanent ceasefire to follow. He said ceasefire would continue while negotiations continue. And then the third would be the reconstruction of Gaza. This is not easy, but the president made very clear in his remarks yesterday that this is a decisive moment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But just as we have talked time and time before about the president's conversations with world leaders about this hostage deal, so much of this has played out behind the scenes.

Is it -- is it possible at this point? Will it work? DAVID IGNATIUS, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Jessica, I know from my own reporting that there is agreement on the basic outlines of President Biden's plan from the military leadership in Israel. But clearly the Prime Minister himself is not prepared to support it publicly. Members of his coalition who are very right-wing have said they will leave the government if this deal goes forward. So Netanyahu in effect is caught by his own -- his own coalition. President Biden is trying to break through that logjam. He has support in Israel from some members of the war cabinet to do that. But we're seeing this is going to take a lot more pressure from the U.S. It's probably going to mean breaking up the current Israeli government to move forward.",

We warned the Russians. We said that the heavy sanctions, we said we would arm Ukraine, didn't deter them. Israel feels threatened by its adversary, American power backs up Israel. I think there is some deterrence value, but you know, Israel lives in fear that Hezbollah tomorrow could launch a volley of a thousand rockets from Lebanon and wouldn't be deterred. So I think American power matters in these moments when other countries decide they're going to take, try to take advantage of situations as Russia's done, as Hamas has done. And you know, our credibility matters. People look at our country, I have had a foreign leader just say recently to me. Your country is so uncertain politically. We look at your election coming up.

You know, we've had at least one poll that came out over the last 24 hours that was taken since the conviction of Donald Trump here in New York. And what it shows is essentially that there may have been slight movement in the presidential race, right? Anyone who thought that Joe Biden was going to jump out to a 10-point lead, or Donald Trump was going to jump out to a template late, I'm sorry to disappoint you. But what we see here is this is according to Reuters/IPSOS, before the New York conviction the race was tied. We have seen slight movement towards Joe Biden in this one particular poll where now Biden's ahead by two. I will note, I've looked at some other data as well, and it seems to be consistent with this poll. That is that there is slight, and I mean, slight movement towards the current president. Now, of course, I would say that's notable because the race has been so close as it is. There really hasn't been any movement over the last six months. Nothing has seemed to shift this race at all. So if in fact we do see even a small movement in Joe Bidens direction, it's something that's certainly welcome, especially if it funnels down to the state-level. [17:19:49] ENTEN: And we're talking about states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, because if you see a movement there of two points in Joe Biden's direction, all of a sudden the electoral college you're looking at a race that instead of tilts towards Donald Trump is really tilting towards nobody and it's a race too close to call. Of course, Jessica, these are early days yet. We'll have to wait and see what happens as more of this new sinks in, one way or the other. We may see more of movement, but at this particular point, what we're seeing in the initial polling is slight movement, not towards the former president, but towards the current one.",

And I say this, Marco was born here. I was born in Cuba. I fled Communism. His family came here before Castro. My family fled it. I know exactly what it's like to live in a country, and I know exactly what those sham courts are like, that did lead to executions. And shame on Marco Rubio, shame on Marco Rubio, for comparing what happened in Cuba, what happens in Nicaragua, what happens in Venezuela, what happens in those countries that he knows only too well, to this, just to curry favor with Donald Trump.

Because I think it's going to move to -- remember, we keep saying it but I think it bears saying again, this is precedented. This has never happened.And so I think Americans probably need a minute or two to absorb this, particularly because most Americans are going about their daily lives. And perhaps, this weekend, as they're checking in with the news about what happened this week, really starting to absorb not just the fact that Donald Trump has been convicted of a crime, but the crime was actually towards trying to win the 2016 election, right? He broke the law in an effort to help himself for the 2016 election while he's facing charges both trying to impede in the 2020 election and potentially overturn it. Right? So that's a lot for people to absorb. But I think the question will really be, when people go to the ballot box, they're going to have to ask themselves, do I really want to vote for a criminal, a convicted criminal? Is that the person who I trust with my future? Or do I trust Joe Biden, who's a good, decent man, who I think most people think they may disagree if the job is done, but I think they believe he's been trying his best.

As Anaa points out, you're seeing the Republican Party fall over itself, for the most part, to show their fealty to Donald Trump, to undermine our justice system. And it is very dangerous for the country. But I think it's for us to remember, too, this is what Trump has brought on our country. And it's also the Trumpism that he has brought to our politics. And I agree absolutely with Ana. She's right. Joe Biden wants to beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. And that is the focus. It will be for others to -- you know, those of us here to comment about what this means. I think that's why you saw the president come out Friday and have a very serious press conference about what's happening in the Middle East. But of course, it's not surprising that Donald Trump isn't -- is an absolute hypocrite. I mean, as President Biden says often, right, you can't just love the rules and then be mad when you don't win. You don't just love our country when it's convenient. You have to love our country and believe in our democracy when it hurts and when you don't always get what you want.
