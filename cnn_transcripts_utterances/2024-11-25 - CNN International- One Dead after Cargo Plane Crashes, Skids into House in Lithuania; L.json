The source says details are still being negotiated and will need to be approved by the Israeli Cabinet. This as the death toll climbs in Lebanon.Lebanese officials say dozens were killed in Israeli strikes in Beirut and beyond. Over the weekend, Lebanon's Health Ministry says Israeli strikes have killed more than 3000 people since mid-September. The IDF says it struck 12 Hezbollah Command Centers in Beirut's Southern suburbs on Sunday night. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired some 250 projectiles from Lebanon on Sunday, some were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Jerusalem.

Now there are issues, and the primary concern that we've understood from the Israeli side all along is that if this 60-day ceasefire, which is the principal part of the negotiations as we understand them, if that gets up and running, Israel wants the right to strike back, if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the ceasefire. This appears to be one of the areas that they are still not convinced that the language is right. They still have issues that they want to see resolved that aren't resolved fully clearly for them yet. So, this is positive. And I think then when you look at those 250 incoming missiles from Hezbollah yesterday and over the weekend, more than 84 civilians killed inside of Lebanon. And more than 200 injured just over the weekend, and the real uptick that we've seen in strikes in the in the heart of Beirut itself, as well as those strikes targeting Hezbollah Command and Control Centers in the South of Beirut. And attempted, it appeared, over the weekend, assassination attempt didn't work on a senior Hezbollah commander by the IDF. All of that, it looks like you've got a massive up tempo in the war. This is not a typical when talks are coming to an apparent conclusion. Look back at the war in 2006 there was an uptick in escalations, in rocket fire and IDF strikes into Lebanon at the time. So, it appears that we're in a more positive position. More work to be done, though, yet, Max.",

He had really Donald Trump moved very quickly, far quicker than we've seen many other President-Elect in his position move to fill out his core cabinet. And now the question is about how easy their confirmation processes could be, or really how contentious they could be, and the problems that may arise?Donald Trump's transition team, even before he had hand selected some of these people to run these different agencies, knew that there were going to be questions, and they knew which ones were going to be controversial. That includes Tulsi Gabbard and many people are concerned in the Senate about her ties to foreign leaders, some who are deemed as enemies, quote, unquote, to the United States. But also, the way that she views her surveillance and her deep skepticism of the way that American agencies have conducted surveillance over the last several years. There's a number of other picks as well that they recognize are controversial. So really, what they are trying to do now is we know that Donald Trump himself, but many people on his team are beginning to work with the Senate, reaching out to different Senators directly, trying to see where their concerns are and what they can do to try and dissuade some of those. We know as well that many of these picks are going to be sent to the Hill. We saw some of them last week, including Pete Hegseth Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon travel with J.D. Vance, the incoming Vice President, and to meet with these different Senators, one on one, and to hear them out, and really on one part, get to know them, but also, again, try to see what their vulnerabilities could be and tackle those on the front end before these public confirmation hearings begin to get underway. Now, there are still a couple of other cabinet picks that Donald Trump has yet to announce, but really, he wanted to move quickly. When I talked to his team, he wanted to move quickly to get the core people in place, because for Donald Trump, he really views his performance in the election as giving him a mandate. Some people question whether he actually has one. But he believes that he has a mandate. He has Republicans in the House. He has Republicans in the Senate. He wants to be able to hit the ground running once he is sworn into office on January 20th, to carry out his agenda. And he wants these different people to be confirmed very quickly, to really see that process through. And so, I think from now until the time that we see him get sworn into office before Inauguration Day, this is going to be one of the key focuses of Donald Trump's transition team.",

Erik and Lyle Menendez have drawn renewed public interest since the release of a recent documentary on the case, with growing support from some celebrities as well. CNN's Camila Bernal has more.CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This status hearing is the latest step in the brothers bid to freedom after the Los Angeles County District Attorney recommended their re-sentencing. It is the first time that we'll see them in nearly 30 years after they were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the killing of their parents. And it is nearly 30 years later that this judge will also decide what happens, whether they appear in person or virtually. It is likely that they will appear virtually, and it is a hearing that will start at 10:30 a.m. at a Van Nuys courtroom here in the Los Angeles area. The judge also setting very strict rules around what happens in this hearing. There will be no cameras and no cell phone. In fact, the cell phones will be sealed in bags. Journalists will be allowed to attend, but only 16 members of the public will be allowed in that courtroom, and they will get their seats via a lottery. There is huge attention and interest in this case, especially after a 2023 Docu Series on Peacock, where a member of the boy band, Menudo, also alleged that he was a victim of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, the father of the two brothers. So, that along with a letter that Erik Menendez wrote before the killings, describing the sexual abuse is what the defense team says should be used, and is why they are asking a court to reconsider the sentence and the conviction. And so, the district attorney here in Los Angeles agreed with the defense. The problem for the defense is that that district attorney was essentially voted out of office. Nathan Hochman, the incoming district attorney here in Los Angeles, sees this case a little bit different. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NATHAN HOCHMAN, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-ELECT: Now as to whether or not I'm going to support that particular motion or not. You got to do the hard work to make that decision. You got to review thoroughly the facts in the law. You need to actually speak to the prosecutors, speak to law enforcement officers, speak to the defense counsel and speak to any victim family members as well. Only after I do all that work will I be in a position to weigh in on the Menendez case, because then I'm not only going to weigh in on it, I'll have to defend that decision in court.

But there is also another hearing that we're waiting for that is scheduled for December 11th, and that is the sentencing hearing, which could be more consequential for these brothers as this case continues to move through the courts.

So, I take these updates with a grain of salt, but however, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic when it comes to a deal being made in the next few days. There are a couple of things to watch out for, in terms of the diplomacy behind the scenes that's happening. The president's envoy to Lebanon Amos Hochstein, who has been back and forth now for months, trying to get this deal has basically said, reportedly to the Israelis, through the Israeli ambassador in Washington, that if Israel doesn't move close to a deal in the next few days, that he's going to walk away from these talks. We also know that the Pentagon's Top Middle East Official, Dan Shapiro, who was also a former U.S. ambassador in Israel, is going to be in Israel, talking to Israeli officials, trying to get this deal through. And the argument that the Americans are going to be making is the following. You have decimated Hezbollah. You have not destroyed it completely, but you have weakened it to a position that it really hasn't been before in recent history. And you now have still 60,000 Israelis who are displaced from their homes in the north. You've sent an incredibly strong message to Iran, time and again over the last few months.

But of course, as we know and as we've seen over months and years in the region, just because deal is signed doesn't mean the sides are not going to continue to try to weaken each other in other ways, and that's what each side is trying to guarantee for themselves right now. When they sign this deal is to make sure that when the deal is signed, that the other side isn't able to continue with the type of behavior that is seen as a threat by one side or the other -- So those are the sticking points -- Cautiously optimistic, but still a lot of details to be worked out in these final days.",

Tulsi Gabbard and another contentious pick, Pete Hegseth are now facing increased scrutiny amid looming Senate confirmation hearings.Critics say Gabbard Trump's choice to lead the U.S. intelligence services is compromised because of her pro-Russian views. And Hegseth, a Fox News Host and Army Veteran, Trump tapped to be defense secretary is also facing uncertainty after a police report revealed a sexual assault allegation against him in 2017 that he denies. The Trump transition team, meanwhile is bypassing traditional FBI checks for some of the cabinet picks, a move criticized by one high profile Democrat and dismissed by her Republican colleague. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): I want to have the hearings. I want to make a decision on each one of them on the merits, as I've done in the past, and I can't do that without the background checks. SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN): The transition team has been working for months to prepare for this. I'm certain that there was significant vetting that has taken place. It has for every candidate.

You know, in terms of the philosophy that Trump is looking at, he wants people who are going to be disruptive, who are going to shake things up, that's not going to change.You saw that with his quick turnabout when he nominated Pam Bondi to be his next attorney general. It's not that her philosophy of what she wants to do at the Justice Department is that dissimilar to Matt Gaetz. The difference, of course, is that Matt Gaetz was facing a slew of questions related to a House Ethics report that has not been released. And there were just a lot of upcoming questions about what was going to happen to that report, what the allegations in that report were looking like. Pam Bondi comes at this not having that kind of personal baggage, and we should point out that Matt Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing here. But that just gives you a sense of the fact that Pam Bondi and Matt Gaetz not that different in terms of what they're looking at doing to the Justice Department, but in terms of just their background, a very different story on Capitol Hill. FOSTER: Yeah, Lauren, thank you. Interesting times for you. Now, one of the factors that helped push Donald Trump to victory earlier this month was the support he got from Latinos. CNN's Isabel Rosales went to Central Florida to talk with some of those voters who helped turn their County Republican for the first time in decades. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANA MARRERO-PINTO, PUERTO RICAN TRUMP SUPPORTER: So, these are the pork chops. And if you look this is less than two pounds, and it's 549 a pound. The eggs now, I mean, the eggs have gone up probably like 50 percent in price, and then milk is just another item that's completely gone up. We're so tightly squeezed that we're living in an economy where all you're doing is working to live. And that's not the American dream. ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Whether it's sticker shock at the grocery store or watching her youngest son move out of Florida's Osceola County, his dream of affording a home out of reach. Diana Marrero-Pinto's family has faced a bleak economic picture. MARRERO-PINTO: People were tired. They were just tired. They were tired of prices going up. ROSALES (voice-over): A registered independent, she voted Republican at the top of the ticket, but for Democrats in some local and congressional races. In 2016, the Puerto Rican voted Donald Trump, but four years later, she went for Joe Biden. Bothered in part about this 2017 incident when Trump threw paper towels at struggling Puerto Rican residents during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, but now Diana came back to Trump.",

ROSALES (on camera): Here in Osceola County, there is an exceptionally large amount of non-party affiliated voters, meaning that both sides have to bring their A game to court these voters. Now Mark Cross, that GOP County Chairman that you saw in the story, he says that he is passing the torch. He is announcing the successor that he is endorsing, and that person is a Puerto Rican pastor, and as a Latino, he would be the first to lead the local party. I asked Cross what is the message they're trying to send with that pick? And he told me that Republicans are looking to the future, that this is someone who's young, someone who represents the community, showing that they are serious about this voting bloc.
