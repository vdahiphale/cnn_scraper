      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, it does look like things have calmed down significantly.You know, Janet Yellen, she's insisting that this is a confidence problem, it's not a solvency one. And so she is doing her best to try to reassure everyone that the banking system is strong, it's been made stronger by the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms. And Yellen did say that Washington is willing to come to the rescue if that's what it takes to put out these fires. Janet Yellen also sought to draw a contrast between what's going on now and what happened during the Great Financial Crisis, saying that this is not 2008, this is very different. She notes that there's no toxic assets right now. And so we look at what's going on in regional banks, they're up across the board. Look at First Republic, up 53 percent today. That is a big rebound after plunging to record lows just yesterday. And we did have the 11 biggest banks in the country come to the rescue with that $30 billion lifeline provided last week. And now a person familiar with the matter telling CNN that First Republic is being advised by JPMorgan Chase, trying to figure out what kind of options they have to try to restore confidence in this bank. And one of those options includes potentially raising additional capital. Right now, the mood on Wall Street has certainly improved from recent days - Brianna?",

      "sentences": "So the Fed is watching all of this.Today, we actually learned that home prices dipped last month. Is this a sign that the medicine the Fed is divvying out is actually working? EGAN: Yes, Brianna. I mean, housing is ground zero for the Fed's war on inflation. Mortgage rates have gone sharply higher since the Fed started even talking about raising interest rates. So that has slowed down the housing market. New numbers out today show that existing home sales, they did increase month over month between January and February. But look at that. Still down 23 percent almost from the pace of a year ago. And this is having an impact on prices. Home prices, year over year, they dipped by less than 1 percent. That breaks this decade-long streak of increasing home prices. So that is significant. And again, it really is all about what the Fed is doing to try to get inflation under control.",

      "sentences": "That is some graph right there.Matt Egan, thank you. I want to bring in CNN economics and political commentator, Catherine Rampell, of \"The Washington Post.\" So, Catherine, I wonder, should we be encouraged that Secretary Yellen said that things appear to be stabilizing? Can we sort of take that and be comforted by it? CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think Secretary Yellen, among others, had been hoping that they would not need to keep saying over and over again that things are safe, your deposits are secure, please don't worry. They had been hoping that when there were these extraordinary interventions over a week ago to rescue the depositors for Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that would be sufficient. Then they were hoping that this infusion from the bigger banks into - cash infusion from the bigger banks into First Republic would itself be sufficient. And obviously, there are still some market jitters out there. I think the real question that people have that is continuing to fuel the anxiety is, what happens to my deposit if it is above the level of the FDIC insurance cap, $250,000? So for most people that would not apply to them. But for some people it does. For legal reasons, among others, the administration has been reluctant to explicitly say, don't worry, everyone will be made whole even if there's a run on your bank, even if you're above that cap. Again, for legal reasons they're restricted from saying that. They're inching closer and closer to saying that. And that's what you heard Janet Yellen say today, essentially, that if it comes down to it, the federal government will swoop in and make sure that your deposits are safe if there's a risk of a broader run on the banking system. So to answer your question, I hope that allays people's concerns. But what they've done so far apparently has not gotten us to that point.",

Almost anything that the Federal Reserve does to try to deal with one problem, it's going to make its other problems worse. Right? If they act more aggressively when it comes to inflation by raising interest rates, that in turn could destabilize the financial markets again. And if they do what's best for financial markets that could aggravate inflation and make it become more entrenched. So unfortunately, they only have this one blunt instrument, which is raising rates. They can raise them or not raise them or they can cut them. I don't think anybody's really expecting that tomorrow. But they have that one tool and that's about it. And they don't really have a scalpel, unfortunately. So again, almost whatever choice they make will in some respect be the wrong choice. But I think they're going to try to finesse it with how they communicate their decision. Again, even if they pause rates - pause rate hikes, rather, tomorrow. Maybe they will communicate hey, guys, hey, world, this doesn't mean that we're done. And getting that message exactly right is important. Because there are other people who worry, including a number of former Fed officials, who have said explicitly on the record, well, if the Fed pauses, does that signal more worry than they intend, right? Is the Fed saying - if the Fed pauses but not actually calm markets that might that freak them out even more because the markets will say, hey, even if the Fed is freaked out, maybe I should be, too. I don't know that that's the right interpretation of events. There are a lot of ways this could go sideways.",

Normally, 4,000-plus kids on this campus. Not today. The gate is locked. Now, the union is asking for respect, they say. They're asking for about their working conditions, longer hours. But of course, this is all about money. The union is asking for 30 percent pay hikes for their workers. The district right now is on about 23 percent. So there's still a gap there. And the union makes this point. Our members, the average wage for them here in Los Angeles, is $25,000 a year, which put them - puts them, says the union, below the poverty line. So the union wants them to get more pay. Now, we spoke to a teacher here who's out on strike in sympathy, and you know, he said, listen, it's a difficult decision to make to go on strike to shut kids out of schools. But he says, in the long run, it's going to be the best for everybody because this should lead to cleaner, safer schools, and also the right pay for the workers who keep these schools running. But listen, half a million kids are out of school today. And right now, they will be for the next three days. I've spoken to both sides. Still no updates on whether their talks are even progressing.
