      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, law and disorder. Donald Trump faces a 5pm deadline to fight a Justice Department request. The former president claims it's an attempt to shut him up. Prosecutors say, it's to stop the defense from bullying witnesses into silence.Plus, seeing is believing. Joe Biden heads west to literally point to progress. It's part of his plan to make Americans feel and see how Bidenomics is changing their lives for the better. And a woke up call. New polling suggests, a red meat term is now overcooked, even among Republicans with plenty of appetite for owning the left. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, looming legal deadline. The Trump legal team has until the close of business today to respond to a Justice Department demand for a protective order. The order would restrict what Mr. Trump can say about what evidence prosecutors turnover. Let's start with CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, this is a typical provision. It's called a protective order. And that's what Donald Trump and the Justice Department are fighting over now. And a judge is going to have to figure out what to do here. This is one of the things that happens very early in nearly every criminal case. And essentially, the Justice Department wants something like this to protect the integrity of the trial. So, the trial doesn't take place before the actual trial begins in court before juries.And so right now, what is being fought over is whether or not there can be a nondisclosure provision placed over all of the evidence that the prosecutors have to give to Donald Trump's defense team, so that they can get ready for trial. And the fight right now seems to be sort of a meta fight over timing, because Donald Trump's team is saying publicly and in court already that they want to go to trial as quickly as possible, but they're refusing to come to some sort of terms with the Justice Department on one of these nondisclosure provisions, a protective order. And so, the judge has moved pretty fast here. Judge Tanya Chutkan has set this deadline for 5pm today, for Donald Trump's team to respond to the Justice Department. Here Trump too is on social media essentially saying, he's going to oppose this. We have to wait and see what his lawyers are going to say in court. He's writing. No, I shouldn't have a protective order placed on me because it would impinge upon my right to free speech. Deranged Jack Smith, a special counsel and the department of injustice should, however, because they are illegally leaking all over the place. That's Trump on social media. Now, calling this a free speech issue is extremely reductive. This is not a gag order. It's pretty typical in cases like this. Even Steve Bannon, his aide to him had something like this in his own criminal case.",

But that's not what they're getting at here. I mean, they want to make sure that if he reads a sensitive part of a grand jury interview, or some other key piece of evidence that he's not going to throw it up there on social media. Now, as I was told, usually, this is handled more on a piece-by-piece, evidence-by-evidence basis, as opposed to one blanket order.

She's spoken about it publicly saying that she's needed to change her own personal security detail. Of course, the rhetoric coming from the former president does not help that. He's called Fani Willis a racist. He said that this investigation is politically motivated. And now we're seeing road closures around Fulton County Courthouse, Pryor Street, this road right in front of the courthouse has been shut down. I mentioned those barricades. We're seeing a heavier than normal police presence.

There is two currently, two grand jury is seated here in Fulton County. One of them is going to be tasked with hearing the evidence gathered by the special purpose grand jury.

So, I do think that we have to be slightly patient and watch the campaign play out. These candidates now are introducing themselves. They are trying to get some semblance of traction, but it's very hard with Donald Trump in the race, not only that he's in the race, even if he was in the race without all these indictments. But it's even harder with the indictments in the investigation because the candidates don't want to talk about that. But Governor DeSantis they're finally being asked. And finally answering that question. I think is a bit of an acknowledgment. Most Republican voters I talked to except perhaps very hardcore, true believers. They all believe that, that the Joe Biden won the election as the president. Yes, there were some issues, perhaps. But there's, I think he was just sort of catching up to reality there.
