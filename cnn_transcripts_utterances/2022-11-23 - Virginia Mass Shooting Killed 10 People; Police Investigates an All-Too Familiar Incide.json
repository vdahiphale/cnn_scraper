I'm Rosemary Church.We are following breaking news this hour, another mass shooting here in the United States just days before Thanksgiving. Police say multiple people have been killed and wounded at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. We don't have confirmation on the number of fatalities, but a police spokesperson says it's believed to be less than 10. The gunman is also dead. Officers responded to the scene just after 10 p.m. local time. We don't know what the gunman's motive might have been, but a source tells CNN, he is thought to be an employee or former employee who walked into a break room and open fire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is believed according to that source, that if the shooter at some point turned the gun on himself, and as you heard police say he is deceased, Rosemary. But again, the details are so few and far between at this moment. The shoot -- the shooting happened a little less than four hours ago at 10.12 p.m. local time in Chesapeake. And of course, you know, Walmarts are open, many of them are open 24/7 here in the United States, and they are very busy places around Thanksgiving and Christmas. So, you know, a key thing is going to be, would be a key piece of information to learn is not only, you know, how many casualties there are dead and wounded, but to how many people were in the store.

So, another mass shooting in America this time at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Police have confirmed the shooter is deceased, but can't confirm the number of fatalities or injuries, but we are learning from a law enforcement source that this shooter was a former or perhaps current employee who entered the break room and opened fire.

      "sentences": "Yes, Rosemary, two things I'm looking at are the location of the shooting. The shooting. We're told this took place inside a break room inside the store, and for anyone watching and listening right now, you know, Walmart, this is a mega store.They have some 10,000 stores around the world in some 24 countries. Again, a large facility. They sell groceries, they sell general merchandise. But there's the customer area, which most of us are used to being in. You go, you buy your items, you check out and you leave. But there's a separate segregated area for employees. The break room where they have their downtime. We're told from a law enforcement source that this shooting took place primarily inside that area. And so that's key for investigators because that tells you that the person appears to have at least some access or familiarity to that particular area. And secondly, looking at the timing of the shooting, we're told that this took place just around the 10 p.m. local hour. This store itself closed just an hour later. And so, you know, Rosemary, you and I have covered so many of these shootings and you know, this is a, not to get too morbid, but obviously if you were a shooter whose intent on causing widespread carnage, that would not be the time of day that you would try to shoot as a store is getting ready to close. And so, that tells me as a former investigator, this appears to be very personal. The person perhaps is one of these so-called injustice collectors that we've talked about, you know, so often in these shootings, someone who had some kind of personal grievance. Of course, that will all come to light as investigators continue to conduct their investigation, but obviously no less sad and heartbreaking for the family members of these victims. Law enforcement tells us that there are multiple fatalities, there are multiple victims involved as they continue to process this scene. One key question will be, were there warning signs in advance? This, you know, as we've seen in so many of these shootings, there were red flags that someone inside a shooter's orbit had perceived. Whether this was someone who was predisposed to violence, who talked about perhaps causing harm to individuals. That will all be something that we will have to wait and see from investigators as we continue to learn. But obviously, a very sad situation in the U.S. state of Virginia, yet another mass shooting in the United States.",

And then of course, it's just, it came a couple of days before Thanksgiving. We know that we've been covering school shootings and so many other shootings.It is a horrifying situation for those of us living in the United States because nothing appears to be done. We talked about the paralysis that we see in Congress. No effort made, and yet, so many Americans want to see some meaningful gun controls put in place. Why are we not seeing that?",

      "sentences": "You know, it becomes so political. We often hear after, you know, these shootings, particularly Republicans saying, well, let's not politicize the gun aspect. But that is the common denominator in so many of these shootings, access to firearms inside the United States. There are more guns in the United States than there are people.And of course, you know, gun rights advocates will say, well, this has enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. There is a specific amendment that allows gun owners to have the right to keep and bear arms. But of course, that runs, you know, head on into polling that we see in the U.S., particularly by the Gallup Association, which actually determined that some, nearly 90 percent of Americans agree with some type of background check before someone is allowed to access a weapon. [03:09:56] You know, we've covered gun rights and gun violence around the world, obviously in the United States, we are the particular outlier when it comes to access to weapons and gun violence. But, yet, that is something that we continue to see time and time again despite this widespread, at least acceptance that we should look into the background of a particular shooter before they were actually able to access a weapon. We don't see meaningful legislation actually moving forward on that front. You know, I've covered, you know, by comparison, looking at the laws in the nation of Canada, our neighbors to the north, north here in the United States, they obviously have robust background checks. They have a robust process to look into the background of people. They actually interview family members and loved ones before someone is able to gain access to a weapon. And they're looking for those red flags that we've seen in so many of these shootings, whether it was just days ago in the US state of Colorado, this shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub where it appears based on CNN reporting that this is someone who predisposed of violence, who had con -- had contact with law enforcement previously. You go back to July 4th on Independence Day there was a mass shooting in the U.S. state of Chicago that left scores of people dead. Many, many injured. That shooter had previous contact with law enforcement. The shooter's family had called police saying that this is someone who was threatening violence against himself, he's threatening to kill members of his family, yet he was able to access that weapon. And so, that is the common through line that we continue to see in so many of these shootings. Of course, it's still too soon in this Virginia shooting that we're reporting on tonight in the state of Virginia at this Walmart. We don't know much about the shooter. The background we're told that this was either a current or former employee, but that, you know, passes prologue, that will be something that we will be keying in on. Were there warning signs? How did this person get a weapon? And was there someone in the shooter's orbit who knew something but did not call police to say that, hey, we have a problem here. And of course, tonight, we're reporting on people who are dead just day, you know, a couple days before the Thanksgiving holiday. Obviously, a tragedy here in the United States, one that we've seen many, many times play out over and over again.",

You can see behind me this bus stop and I'll have my cameramen zoom in.You can see police are still gathering up pieces of evidence, and you can actually see what appears to maybe have been the blast site where that fence and the rocks along the wall have been, broken through. Police do believe that a bag or package of some kind was placed here at the bus stop, around 7 a.m. and it was, detonated likely remotely. And then just 30 minutes later, another attack took place, actually just down the hill from here. Another, another, some sort of package that police also believed was detonated remotely. Police are calling this a coordinated terror attack, the likes of which Jerusalem and Israel have not seen in years. Explosions like these, these were common in the first and second intifada, but Israel and Jerusalem have not seen these sort of package bombs be in place in several years. This has -- this is a deadly escalation, Rosemary, to it's already been a very deadly year. It's been the deadliest year for both Israelis and Palestinians since 2015. Israelis have seen an increase in the number of attacks targeting Israelis in the West Bank and Israel stabbing attacks ramming shootings and a high number of Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank. Many of them, they say by Israeli forces. But this, this right here, this is what a lot of people were fearing would be the escalation. Because so far it felt as though there was a lot of dry kindling on the ground, just waiting for some sort of major event, major explosion that could potentially lead to a third intifada. That was the big fear. And this sort of explosion, the types of which we have not seen since years passed since the second intifada, there is a major fear that this is just the start of something greater, of another wave of violence that could plunge this region back into the chaos and the deaths of just years ago, Rosemary.",

The gunman is dead, and our source says it's believed he took his own life. Now this all happened shortly after 10 p.m. local time, just two days before Thanksgiving. Turning now to Ukraine where an official in the Zaporizhzhia regions says Russian rockets struck a maternity ward overnight. Authorities say the two-story building was destroyed. A woman who was giving birth at the time and a doctor were rescued from the rubble. The woman's newborn baby was killed. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack saying Russia continues to fight against civilians and civilian targets.

So Ukrainian officials accusing Russia of failing on the battlefield, as you saw in that package from Fred Pleitgen there, our colleague, the absolute difficulties that their soldiers are facing on the front lines.And in the absence of a victory on that battlefield, Ukrainian officials accusing Russia of intentionally targeting its civilian infrastructure, of inflicting more and more humanitarian suffering even far, far from the battlefield. In fact, the World Health Organization's Europe regional director was in Kyiv earlier this week to assess the damage, particularly on the power grid. You mentioned there, the Ukrainian officials saying that a colossal attack last week, hundreds, over a hundred rocket, rather, over a hundred rockets fired have left most of the countries hydroelectric and thermal plants completely destroyed. Half of the Ukrainian power grid is either damaged or destroyed in these sustained attacks. And again, going back to that World Health Organization visit, they say 10 million people, that's a quarter of the country's population is without power. They also have documented over 700 attacks on healthcare facilities. So, hospitals and clinics since the beginning of the attack. And these are absolutely life-threatening conditions, of course, Rosemary. Temperatures are predicted to drop to negative four Fahrenheit. That's negative 20 degrees Celsius this winter at a time when people can't heat their homes, can't eat, even get a cup of warm tea. And then taking you further to the east, right up to where those front lines as are as well, Rosemary. There are Ukrainian officials saying more civilians suffering, more shelling on neighborhoods. In Kharkiv this morning at a healthcare clinic and a school were attacked, two people killed and then to the south that absolutely devastating, horrifying story of the maternity ward you mentioned, that was attack a newborn baby killed in that attack, Rosemary.",
