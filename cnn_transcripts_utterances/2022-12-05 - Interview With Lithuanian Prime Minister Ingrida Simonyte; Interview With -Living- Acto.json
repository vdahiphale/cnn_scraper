Biographer Richard Stengel talks to Walter Isaacson about rediscovering South Africa'sdemocratic hero for his new podcast, \"Mandela, The Lost Tapes\". Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Yet another wave of Russian missiles threatened Kyiv today, prompting air raid sirens across the capital and sending citizens scrambling for shelter. Ukraine says its air defense system intercepted more than 60, but the country remains on high alert. This, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, criticizes the west for only capping Russian oil at $60 per barrel. He says it should be less. The Kremlin says, it will ignore the whole thing anyway. Meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron, drew a wave of criticism from both Ukraine and Baltic States for saying in an interview that the west should think about how to give Russia's security guarantees, \"The day it returns to the negotiating table\". Lithuania is one Baltic State deeply impacted by all of this. The country is sandwiched between Russia's territory and its ally Belarus. Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte is on an official visit to the United States and she's joining me now from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Prime Minister, welcome to the program. So, can I first start by asking you to react to what the EU. has tried to do, and that is capping Russian oil. Do you also think that it doesn't go far enough?",

And we had good argument for this, I think, mainly because we know a lot -- what are the extraction costs for Russia. What is the budgetary calculations for Russia. And we thought that initial price caps were too high. There was some reduction from 65, 70 to 60. There is a clause that provides for review of the price cap so that it would be constantly lower than the market price. And then, you know, one might wait whether it's better to have a not perfect solution or not to have any solution at all. So, this time, the sort of -- the agreement was around the fact that there needs to be a compromise so that Russia could not exploit the topic like west cannot agree on it.",

It finds that it won't abide by it. And it won't even do any business with countries that buy into this cap. So, do you believe even a bad deal, a compromised deal, as you've called it or a less than perfect deal is actually going to do that, deprive Russia of its ill-gotten war games?",

      "sentences": "Well, it can be but one thing -- what we need to see very clearly is that we cannot undo the past. Because it was our past experiencethat pushed us towards creating an alternative route of supply, both for oil and gas. So, when the oil pipeline broke apart all of a sudden in 2007 and another was restored, there was not the real problem. And when gas pump was starting to price us with crazy gas prices in 2007, 2008, then there was a decision that we need alternative supplies just to reduce the price. So, we've built an LNG terminal that is operational from 2014. And now, it is not just a matter of price, as you know, but also a matter of security of supply. And this is not only Lithuanian project as it appears, but this is also a regional project because now we can also help our neighboring countries with supply of gas in this circumstances. So, yes, some countries thought that whatever happens, they will have an argument with Russia and they will be able to deal with Russia. And Russia is a reliable supplier as some of the politicians were calling it. But now we know that this is not true. It is a very hard way to experience this because this is not just a matter of a price but also a matter of security of supplies. And of course, we would have been much safer now if some decisions were not taken in the past. If some countries were not too reliant on Russian oil and gas supplies. But now, what we can do is just do our undone homework as soon as we can.",

So, I would say no, ma'am. I see no, sort of, changes in the general stance of the United States. And I think it remains and will remain a robust partner and a robust supporter of Ukraine until its victory, because you know, this -- people can speak about -- politicians can speak about accountability and checks of the books and everything and this is maybe normal but -- normal democratic process. But the fact is that the support of Ukraine, the support of its fight, the understanding what Ukraine is fighting for. It's basically fighting not only for its territorial integrity and sovereignty but also for a more- broader concept of the values that the countries, in this part of the world share. So, I think that I would be very surprised if there would be any major changes in the stance of the United States administration in the nearest future.",

And this is how it is, you know, again, the homework that has not been done in a proper time. So, and now there is -- all of a sudden race of countries increasing their defense spending up to at least NATO two percent or above that. And of course, there is -- as an economist, I would say just a classical demand shock in military economy in this sort of industry, in this sort of business. So, definitely, it is a practical problem.

And he's given several interviews. The interviews suggests that Russia should be offered security guarantees, \"When they come to the negotiating table.\" A former Lithuanian foreign minister has tweeted pretty furiously, Russia has all the security guarantees if it doesn't attack, annex, or occupy its neighbors. If anyone wants to create a new security architecture that allows a terrorist state to continue its method of intimidation, they should think again. Where do you stand on Macron's statements?",

And who is, as a matter of, attacking Ukraine, destroying cities, infrastructures, civilian people, and performing war crimes each and every day. So, I don't know what exactly was behind the words of President Macron. But I think what is important is that the countries that believe in liberal democracy and territorial integrity and sovereignty. And the fact that nobody is here allowed to redraw the state borders and boundaries just because they wish so. They need security guarantees, they need to mind the security situation, and they need to become stronger and able to respond to whatever risks might occur. I don't think that we should be in the business of thinking about Russia's security guarantees when it cares for nobody's security.",

And I think, yes, with a limited success that Russia is having on the battlefield, where the losses of men's life that Russia has each and every day, they would be looking for additional -- sort of, to say bodies to cover the front.
