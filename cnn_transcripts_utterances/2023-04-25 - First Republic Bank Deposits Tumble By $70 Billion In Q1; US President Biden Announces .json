We start tonight with First Republic Bank, which says it will cut staff and look for ways to bolster its finances. It revealed the extent of the damage from last month's spiking crisis. The shares of the bank fell even further today. Look at that, down 43 percent, and the reason investors or depositors have taken more than $70 billion in Q1. The balance sheet would have looked even worse, if a $30 billion lifeline from America's top banks hadn't been put in. The shares are now more than 90 percent lower for the years so far. Rahel Solomon is with me. You know, the issue -- when I heard all of this today, I wondered, firstly, has the situation stabilized or is money still flowing out? And secondly, is the bank solid? I mean, in a sense -- well, answer the first one first, has the situation stabilized.",

But if you look at more recent weeks, the company says that fall was actually closer to about 1.7 percent and they attributed that to tax season here in the US. So, have deposits stabilized? Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this won't be an uphill battle. Take a look at the stock performance, Richard. You just showed from January. I want to take you back a bit farther and take you back to last April, you can see the really stunning fall. We can pull up here the last 12 months, you can see the real stunning fall in the stock price. Twelve months ago, the stock was at $155.00, and I think we can pull this up for you, $155.00, now trading at about $9.00. So here is what we learned, Richard in terms of what's ahead. A few things actually helping First Republic. The company said that it has actually maintained about 90 percent of its clients. It says deposits had stabilized and it is cutting back on expenses, and we can show you some of the ways that it's doing that. On the other hand, it is trying a new strategy. It says that it is going to try to reach new consumers, broaden its deposit base, but that comes with risk.",

That is, is he going to keep Kamala Harris on the ticket or off the ticket? And you know, there are an awful lot of people who feel on different times with that within the Democratic Party.
