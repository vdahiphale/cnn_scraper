Thenightmare is over for five Americans who have been in Iranian custody for years. The five landed in Doha, Qatar, a bit earlier from Tehran. Their release is part of a wider deal between the United States and Iran. They will eventually be flown to Washington D.C. The deal also includes the release of five Iranians being held in the United States. Two of them have already arrived in Doha. We've been told two others are staying in the United States, the others going to a third country. In addition, $6 billion in Iranian funds have been unfrozen with the caveat that the money can only be used for humanitarian purposes. Meantime, the Biden administration is imposing new sanctions. They target Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The top U.S. diplomat spoke about the release of the American prisons just a short time ago.

One of those released here, SiamakNamazi, the one who was held longest for eight years, his lawyer released a statement on his behalf. And I think just a couple of the headline points from that statement really tell you what you need to know but I'll explain even that isn't enough -- 2,898 days he was there, he said he spoke about those that had left behind and he singled out Ahmad Reza Djalali, Swedish Iranian physician who's been in jail for seven and a half years. So, even in his own freedom, he is talking about those that have been left behind, singling out somebody who's going through the hell that he went through, and sort of looking ahead, the statement said, you know, right after he gets to the United States, he'll have a few days of medical evaluations and treatment, and then he really needs to have, he expects some quiet time with his family. That's what he's going to need. And I think that will reflect broadly what they all feel having been released. It's hard for us to describe that. His lawyer did actually speak to CNN and did describe, you know, one of the horrendous moments where his father, who'd been encouraged by the Iranians to come to Iran to help him, was also locked up and he was told at one point that his father had died and then a week later told that his father was still alive. So, the mental anguish they've been through and what they can experience now is hard for us to comprehend, but I think when you wrap it up, a huge day, and as you say with a very, very complex set of lengthy negotiations over several years, eight different rounds of negotiations that the Qataris played middleman between the Iranians and the United States.

So, something is done there. But as John Kirby says, this isn't anything that can be considered as a sort of a building block for something else. And I think we've got a sense of that today, when the United States, the White House, announced more sanctions on Iran's interior ministry and Ahmadinejad, the former president there. And we had this in the lead up to where we are today. Just last week, the United States announced other sanctions on 25 different Iranians, senior figures within the IRGC, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, within the law enforcement bodies and the head of prisons, as well. So, the United States is very clear in continuing to target those that it feels are, you know, are responsible for injustices and specifically around the case of these hostages are sanctioning the head of the prisons just last week. So, there's no let-up in the pressure. We heard similar things coming from the British, the French, the Germans over the issue of nuclear sanctions on Iran for its nuclear activities and we heard very tough language. Really tough diplomatic language from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency last week calling Iran out for effectively banning access for a third of its inspectors, which is part of the agreement that Iran agreed to back in 2015. So, this is not bringing the Western world closer to Iran, but it is setting aside a contentious and personal issue.",

Turning to Ukraine now, because Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepares to travel to the U.S. this week to appeal for more weapons. Kyiv claims its troops are making progress on the battlefield. A Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister earlier told CNN, 300 square kilometers of land has been liberated since the beginning of June. But she admits the counteroffensive is progressing more slowly than anticipated. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues along the southern front, as you can see there on your map. Ukraine says two people were killed in Russian attacks in the Kherson region, and that happened overnight. And just weeks after Ukraine's defense minister was replaced, if you remember, a high- level departmental shake-up, it seems, continue. All but one of the country's deputy defense ministers were dismissed on Monday, along with the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense. No reason was offered, but it comes after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cited the need for, quote, new approaches earlier this month. Our Fred Pleitgen joins me now live from Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine.

But it also gives them a lot of momentum on the battlefield as well, they feel, and that of course, is also something that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is going to take to the U.S. when he comes there, to show President Biden and those U.S. politicians that yes, Ukraine's making gains. And in order to keep that going, they want to have more weapons.

We don't know if he's going to talk about that or President Biden will throw Iran a cupcake on that, but there's still so many differences between Iran and the United States and they continued today even with the U.S. adding more sanctions on Iranian officials.

At its long-abandoned compound at the coastal outpost of Port Salu, there's barely a trace of the peacekeepers that served here. And yet much has been left behind. Rosemina Joseph says she was a child when she was lured into a relationship with a Uruguayan peacekeeper and became pregnant. He was sent home and served a sentence for abuse, according to a U.N. document. But Rosemina wanted us to see her home, a place where she says dreams once stood, a plot for a house. Still a barren foundation. She has no money to build here. She lives on this patch of land in nothing more than a tent, clinging to proof and staking her claim that the U.N. is also responsible for the harm done to her and her 12-year-old son.",

All ties were severed after a group of radical Iranian college students seized the U.S. embassy into Iran back in 1979 demanding the extradition of the deposed Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, while the militants ultimately held 52 Americans hostage, triggering a crisis that lasted 444 days. Plays in the aftermath of Iran's revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, after fundamentalist Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini returned from exile and then rose to power. The American hostages were free just minutes after newly elected President Ronald Reagan was inaugurated. But months earlier, Iraq had invaded Iran, hoping to take advantage of Tehran's revolutionary chaos. The U.S. provided some support to Iraq. The move only intensified what has turned out to be a long as well as complicated history between Washington and Tehran, with acrimony and mistrust ranging on both sides to this very day.
