The only exceptions in recent history had been, of course, President Biden in 2020, and our two senators, Ossoff and Warnock. Biden won in 2020 in part because he was on the ballot with Ossoff and Warnock and they combine to make a pretty powerful message about not just controlling the White House, but flipping the balance of power in the Senate.The difference for Kamala Harris is she's running on a ticket pretty much by herself. There aren't really any other high-profile statewide races in Georgia on the ballot. So she doesn't have the benefit of that Democratic ticket to help pull her or along, which is just going to make it harder for a Democrat to win statewide in Georgia.",

But I think Democrats know that it's very hard to win, especially in close swing states, if your base isn't there to build upon and Black voters are the backbone of the Democratic Party. You meet Black men to show up as well in a state like Georgia, just a few percentage points difference in any key demographic could be the right race because we know a state like Georgia is going to be really close.So I think Kamala Harris is trying to boost those percentages, trying to nullify some of the criticism that she's hearing from Black men. I would say Latino men kind of fall in a similar category. But the risk for her is that she is perceived as speaking too much just the Black men in ways that are procedures alienating other key demographics that she also needs.",

Netanyahu saying Monday he repeatedly asked the group to get out of harm's way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER:  The charge that Israel deliberately attacked UNIFIL personnel is completely false. It's exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked UNIFIL to get out of harm's way, and repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel's border with Lebanon. In fact, on the day that Israel began its ground operation next to our border with Lebanon, we asked them specifically, please leave this area so you're not harmed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But also the Rafah boarding crossing. Also, Israel just saying it's not agreeing to a full ceasefire. Obviously, Israel's priority all along has been to get those hostages out, and to take down Hamas. And we've got some developments actually today, Kasie, on, you know, the operation against Hamas, the United Nations suggesting that North Gaza has effectively been sealed off altogether by these -- by the Israelis, the World Food Programme saying food is being blocked into northern Gaza. So the operation from the Israeli side very much focused on northern Gaza, we don't have the intel, but you have to pursue presume that Hamas is there, potentially hostages are there.
