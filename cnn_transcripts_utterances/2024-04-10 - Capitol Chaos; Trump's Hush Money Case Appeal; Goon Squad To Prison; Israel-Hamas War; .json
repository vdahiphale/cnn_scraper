Deep down in Mississippi, the sentencing for six former police officers convicted of torturing two black men. The rulings in the shadow of the Rankin County Confederate Monument right outside the courthouse. Plus, former major league baseball player and current Republican Senate candidate Steve Garvey here on \"The Lead\" from his days on the mound now making a pitch for politics, taking on Congressman Adam Schiff in a high profile race for the US Senate. And leading this hour, a conservative revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson in a protest vote today, was it led by Donald Trump? In the wee hours of the night, Trump posted in all caps on Truth Social, \"Kill FISA. It was illegally used against me and many others. They spied on my campaign.\" He signed off that post with his initials, DJT. FISA is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It allows surveillance on foreign nationals without a warrant. The current law expires next Friday. Late this afternoon, 19 House Republicans did as Trump advised today, voting to defeat what's called the rule, which would allow debate on this FISA legislation, forcing Speaker Johnson to scramble and find another path forward. Let's go to CNN's Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. Melanie, Speaker Johnson called an Emergency Republican Conference Meeting after the failed vote. What options does he have left? Are there tweaks that can happen to the bill to make it acceptable? And how big a blow is this to him overall?",

Now, Johnson did say that they're going to go back to the drawing board huddle as a conference and try to figure out a new plan going forward. They are still meeting in the basement of the Capitol as we speak.One potential option is to just pass a clean extension ahead of this April 19th deadline, which would rely on democratic support. But Johnson needs to tread very carefully here because he is already in hot water with hardline conservatives. And making matters worse for Johnson is that Donald Trump, as you mentioned, has waded in to this debate and encouraged Republicans to vote against the bill. But there are some signs that Johnson is trying to so show some unity with Trump. My colleague, Kristen Holmes, and I were the first to report that Johnson plans to head to Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Friday to deliver a joint press conference on so-called election integrity. Of course, Johnson was one of those members who tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. He encouraged members to sign on to a lawsuit to throw out legal election results, that ultimately was rejected by the Supreme Court. But clearly, Johnson is trying to stay in Trump's good graces and talk about issues that the former president cares about amid these threats to his speakership.",

So they basically say it's an end run against the process that you would use to get a warrant.Donald Trump, of course, as Melanie told us, is leading the Kill FISA Act and trying to influence Congress, claiming that they spied on his campaign. But, of course, you'll remember there were allegations of foreign influence on the campaign that were picked up in FISA surveillance or, for instance, his national security adviser before he was in office, was captured on FISA talking to Russian officials overseas, and then lied about it to the vice president.

The problem there was that in the reauthorization for that court order, one of the lawyers, frankly, changed the information, and was inaccurate and probably lied about what they understood, whether he was working for the US government. That resulted in the judge reauthorizing it. That lawyer, by the way, fired and prosecuted by the Justice Department for that problem.So, you know, President Trump is wrong about whether this was used to his campaign, it wasn't.

That's exactly the worst time for us to have the drawer locked, have to go to a federal judge to get a key to open that drawer, right?And by the way, if we want to collect on an American, you have to actually get a court order anyway. So all we're going to have is that one communication between an American and a foreigner. We can decide, do we want to go to a court and get more surveillance on that American, right. But the idea that we should lock it away, knowing there's information there for us to look at, right, when we might be in the heart of a terrorist plot or the like, that's crazy.

The chairwoman of the Center for Islamic Life says vandal smashed windows, broke televisions and printers, and ruined artwork and a Palestinian flag. Today is Eid al- Fitr, one of the holiest days of the year for Muslims as they celebrate the end of Ramadan. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy described the incident as \"horrifying.\"Turning into our World Lead, CNN has learned that Hamas told negotiators that they did not have 40 alive Israeli hostages to hand over for this first phase of the proposed hostage and ceasefire deal, which would include all the women hostages as well as any sick or elderly men hostages in order to meet the number 40. Israeli officials say they're now pushing Hamas to fill out the initial release with younger male hostages, including soldiers. One of those hostages still believed to be in terrorist captivity is 35-year-old Israeli American hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen. He's a father from kibbutz Nir Oz who still has not met his third child. She was born in December, two months after he was kidnapped. And Sagui's father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen is with us now. And again, we meet again, and I'm sorry that your pain continues.

While Sagui may not be among those 40, what I do know is that there are still 39 hostages remaining from kibbutz Nir Oz in Hamas captivity. Among them, two women, two little boys, and a great number of elderly or older men, all of whom are like my extended family. So the thought that the death and the murder has continued is something that's extraordinarily upsetting.

He was taken into Gaza and was forced to appear in two hostage videos. The IDF was able to recover his body based on intelligence. He was murdered in early January. We didn't get there in time to save him. Not enough was done to save him. Israel, the United States and the United States allies in the region, in order to save the region, need to help us get these people home.",

There have been massive protests by Israelis, thousands of Israelis in cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Even Israeli war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, called for early elections.Do you sense that there's a real shift in Netanyahu's support happening among not just American leaders, but people in Israel? DEKEL-CHEN: Well, I think there's been a groundswell in Israel, really, I would say from the second month or the third month since October 7th. This recognition that until very recently, his decision making around the war and around the return of hostages was based no less on his personal and political interests than on a sincere interest to get the hostages home and be done with this conflict. I think as a result of actions taken by the US administration and some other factors. He has begun to realize, Prime Minister Netanyahu, that the time is now, that there simply is no alternative to doing the things that must be done. As painful as they might wind up being for Israel, to get as many hostages back home as possible that are alive, and returning those who are no longer with us, and those numbers might be very significant. We simply don't know.",

He's running against Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff for the open seat that was held by Dianne Feinstein until her death last year. And Steve Garvey joins us now. Steve, thanks for joining us.

Just take my hand out to say, I want to work with you for the best interests of this country.But there are issues that we need to address right away. The first is the economy and inflation. There is that big difference between Wall Street and Main Street. The people are suffering. A poll came out that 88% of Californians break even or lose money every day, and that adds up to $10,000 to $12,000 a year. They need better energy costs.

Let's get back to affordable energy and not only gas, but for housing costs, for energy there.And I think if we do this, that will open up the economy back to a free market capitalism that let people breathe again. They want to go to a fast food restaurant more than once a month now, what they can afford. You've seen the costs escalate in that. So let's start at the kitchen table, and let's go to the gas tank. Let's go to affordable education. Those are the leaders of the future. I graduated from Michigan State with an education degree. I'm passionate about the future of our country and the need to have affordable costs with our education, you know, the homeless. I've been to the downtown in San Diego, in LA, in Sacramento, and I see the blight of these poor people that are. They can't get off the sidewalks. They're affecting small businesses.
