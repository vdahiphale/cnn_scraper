Now an uneasy feeling is growing among GOP lawmakers. Do they have the votes? We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.",

The gains have thinned a bit in afternoon trading, but the Dow roared out of the opening bell on the heels of that inflation report.The S&amp;P and Nasdaq have jumped as well, pinning hopes that the Fed might actually cut borrowing rates this summer. A decision on interest rates, which affect everything from mortgages to credit cards, is expected just about an hour from now. Prices for everyday items flatlined in May compared to a month ago, the first time inflation has been at zero in two years. Over the past year, consumer prices rose 30 -- rather, 3.3 percent, according to the Labor Department. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Egan to break down these numbers. Matt, these numbers are a relief, including a drop in gas prices. What does this tell you about the overall economy?",

      "sentences": "Well, of course, this is some much-needed good news on inflation. The cost of living is, of course, the biggest problem with this economy and one of the biggest frustrations for voters. So this is much-needed progress.Of course, everything is relative, right? Three-point-three percent year-over-year inflation, that's not good, right? It's well ahead of where prices were going up pre-COVID. But this is better than expected. And this is an improvement from a year ago, a major improvement from two years ago. Prices did not budge at all month over month. As you mentioned, we haven't seen that in nearly two years. And we did see price drops for gasoline, new cars, airfare, clothing. So all of that is encouraging. Also, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, that doesn't capture what Americans feel, but it is something that economists pay attention to, because it's a good indicator of where prices are going next. That was at the lowest rate in three years. So, when we zoom out, inflation, of course, is not solved. Life is a lot more expensive than it was a few years ago. But this is a significant step in the right direction -- Boris.",

CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is live in Italy. He's covering the G7 for us.

      "sentences": "Sure.I think the best reference point on this is to look back at the NATO summit last summer, when President Zelenskyy, he wanted a commitment that Ukraine was going to be a member of NATO. He wanted the equivalent of Chapter 5 support, Article 5 support, that if one nation who is a member of NATO is attacked, then the others will come to their side. But what was agreed there was that each nation would strike a bilateral security pact with Ukraine. And this is what President Biden is going to be doing. There's no sort of monetary value put on this at the moment, but it is a long-term commitment to Ukraine that, if somewhere down the road in the future that they were to be attacked again in a new scenario by Russia, within 24 hours, there would be discussion about that. There would be action taken about that. France, Germany, the U.K., 14 nations out of NATO so far have already made these security pacts with Ukraine, financial commitments of ongoing military support, another 17 member nations yet to do it out of NATO. And this will be, President Biden's decision to do this and move ahead on this will be a signal to those other 17 that they should be doing the same, and a signal to all NATO countries that, whoever becomes president next in the United States, whatever their relationship is with NATO -- we know that Donald Trump has threatened perhaps to cut ties with NATO, perhaps to cut military support for Ukraine -- that there is a more enduring commitment going forward.",

But, look, I mean, President Biden isn't alone in coming into these talks facing election turmoil back home. President Macron, although he's not running in the parliamentary elections he's just triggered in a snap election in the next couple of weeks, his party, and, therefore, his power and influence in France, is up for question over the next few weeks. The British prime minister here coming for the meetings, Rishi Sunak, very unlikely to be reelected in British elections on the Fourth of July. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, faces elections next year. The Japanese prime minister, there's calls from the opposition there for him to call snap elections. And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who will be here, also wants to be reelected and get her job back for another five years. So there's a lot of faces coming in here, not just President Biden, who might not be around this time next year at the G7.",

Earlier this morning, the House did take a procedural vote where theyadvanced that resolution. And so now the GOP leadership is confident that they are going to be able to have the votes to pass this over the finish line, that despite some concerns that were privately raised by some centrist Republicans about moving ahead with this vote. As a reminder, this all stems from the DOJ's refusal to hand over audiotapes of the special counsel's interview with President Joe Biden as it relates to the classified documents case. Now, the DOJ did provide transcripts to the committees, but Republicans say that is not enough. They want those transcripts and they also want those audiotapes to make sure that the transcript is correct. Just take a listen to Speaker Mike Johnson and his reasoning for pushing ahead with his contempt vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  He is refusing to comply with a lawful subpoena, and that's a problem under Article 1. We have to defend the Constitution. We have to defend the authority of Congress. We can't allow the Department of Justice, an executive branch agency, to hide information from Congress. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The bottom line is that Hamas has been saying since the very beginning of the war that there will be no hostage deal that doesn't include an end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Israel, on the other side, has been saying that there will be no deal that Israel will agree to that will end the war. And this is the basic gap between the two parties, which seems quite unbridgeable. I'm encouraged by Secretary Blinken's optimism, but, quite frankly, I don't know where it's coming from, because Hamas is very, very clear what their demands are, as well as Israel. And I don't see how to bridge them. And yet there are 120 hostages, Israeli hostages, still in Gaza. It's believed that about 80 of them are alive. Every day that they're there is a risk to their lives. And we're stuck. The Israeli government doesn't want to make the deal that will end the war, and we are stuck here. We're also stuck because the war in Lebanon is escalating. And we know that, if the war in Gaza ends, the war in Lebanon will stop as well.",

But the bottom line is that, in phase two, there should be a completeIsraeli withdrawal from Gaza and end to the war. And Israel has never agreed to ending the war. And this has been said by Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of his cabinet. And his cabinet now is made up once again of the extreme right-wing and religious parties in Israel. The middle-of-the-road party of Benny Gantz has left the government. And it seems impossible to imagine that the Netanyahu government could accept anything that includes the end of the war while Hamas is still in power in Gaza. And that's the reality. Israel has done nothing to advance any kind of other political solution that might be able to replace Hamas in control of Gaza. And that's why we're stuck.",

We know that the people who lived alongside the Gaza border in Israel are suffering terribly, as well as the Israelis who live in the north of Israel on the Lebanese border. With Gantz no longer in the government, I think we will see an increase in Israelis taking to the streets, demanding a deal and demanding new elections, because the majority of Israelis no longer have confidence in the government of Israel.
