Republican leadership fell one vote short of impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Then, just minutes later, they failed to pass a standalone aid package for Israel. Now, this morning, the Senate is poised to kill the bipartisan border deal that many Republicans had initially asked for, which will all set up what might be the defining moment for aid to Ukraine.

I mean this moment last night with the failure of the vote to impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the House floor really caught everyone by surprise, including, of course, Republican leadership. It became very clear that something was afoot because you had this first vote series in which you had Democrats with one absence. Then, when the vote to impeach Mayorkas began, all of a sudden Al Green, a Democrat who wasn't anticipated to be there, was wheeled on to the House floor, voted against the impeachment. And because there were already three Republicans voting no, they had no margin for error. Suddenly it was tied, which means a failure on the House floor.And, John, it really is this moment in which, if you were going to do something that hadn't been done in nearly 150 years, you have to count the votes. And that includes knowing who is there on the other side of the aisle. Now, we should note that Republicans really thought, because they had done this vote checking vote right beforehand, that there was a Democratic absence. In fact, Andy Biggs, who's a Republican of the House Freedom Caucus, he said, I like a good game. Democrats played a good game. I'm just upset that Republicans lost here.

Now, there's going to be some conservatives who are opposed to more aid to Ukraine who will vote against it, but a large majority of the Republican conference in the Senate is supportive of aid to Ukraine. Now, that does lead to a larger question, what does this mean in the House of Representatives where it's very clear Mike Johnson has his hands full with a narrow margin and some conservatives who have made clear that putting aid to Ukraine on the floor of the House could be a problem for the future of Johnson's speakership.

And Trump's name wasn't on the ballot either. He is competing in the caucus later this week, which actually awards the delegates in the state. So even though she lost this primary, it doesn't mean that she has given up any delegates that she was actively competing for.

We didn't both to play a game rigged for Trump. We're full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.\" But we should note that this is a setback for her campaign at a moment when they're trying to show that there's momentum behind her campaign, you know, hauling in more than $16 million in donations in January, even though she hasn't yet been able to win an early state.",

The second thing they're trying to do is focus on that fundraising.They had a really successful month of January.

She's really making an effort to get in front of donors and make sure that they are still with her. And the other thing that they are really focused on is trying to double down on that commitment that she's in it for the long haul. We heard from her campaign manager saying that so long as they have the resources, they're going to go to distance.

We're not sure what he'll say, but I think it would be expected that he'll be referring to Hamas' count proposal. Secretary Blinken also having his own separate press conference, expected probably a little bit after the prime minister's. So, we'll get two narratives from both sides about what they think about this proposal. The proposal, in essence, from Hamas picks up on some of the threads that were in the proposal that came from the United States, Israel, Qatar and Egypt over a week ago. And that is that this will be a three-phase process, 45 days between each phase.And the phases would run like this. In the first phase, Hamas would release the women, the children, the elderly, and the sick hostages. They would expect Israel to pull back their forces out of civilian areas, stop all military operations, stop drone activities, open up Gaza so humanitarian aid could get in. They want a massive input of humanitarian aid, 60,000 housing units, 200,000 tents. They want people to be able to move around Gaza. Now, during that phase one, Hamas say we've got to talk about the permanent ceasefire that we want. And as they get into phase two they say phase two would have to see an agreement on that permanent ceasefire. Phase two would also, they say, lead to the release of all the male hostages, whether they're civilians or serving in military forces. Phase three, 45 days later, if everyone gets that far, that would be the release of all the hostage bodies. Now, there are some big problems in this - in the Israeli government because what Hamas is also asking for in this phased approach is a release of all their prisoners. And as you said, Israel says absolutely no way are they going to release prisoners whom they captured on October 7th, who were involved in the - in that horrendous attack. So, the impasse here is that Hamas is talking about a phased approach but ultimately a complete ceasefire, and Israel is saying no to a complete ceasefire and the Israeli prisons releasing all the Hamas and Palestinian prisoners that they have. That's the impasse. Is there a diplomatic nuance that - can the needle be threaded here? We'll get an idea of that when we hear in these press conferences later today.",
