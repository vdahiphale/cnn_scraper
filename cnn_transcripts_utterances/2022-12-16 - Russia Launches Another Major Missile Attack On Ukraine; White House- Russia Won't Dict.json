It's always good to see you, sir.Ukraine's defense chiefs, including the President told the economists there could be a major Russian offensive, even another attempt to take Kyiv and it could start as early as the next few months. Given how the battlefield looks right now, though, do you think that's feasible? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: You know, Michael, feasible is a tough word to describe. I think it's a possibility. I'm not sure it's feasible. And the reason I say that is because the Belarusian forces if there is another attack from the north, aren't that capable, and the new forces that Russia is putting together, I don't think we'll be ready anytime soon. But here's the point of all of that. You know, warfare is made up of constant shifting between offensive defense, forces are either attacking or defending. And when you're talking about the Ukrainian front lines, they are attacking in some places, with small unit attacks, and they're defending in other places like the Donbas. And there's this back and forth, during each phase of the war, we've seen both the Russians and Ukrainian shift in these areas. Well, what we now have, if you take a look at the front lines is you have a pretty static defense in the East. And in the southeast, you have the Ukrainians trying to take even more ground than they've already taken. And the Russians are defending harshly to try and prevent that. But here's the question. The lines have gotten smaller. They've gotten more compacted and it's more intense. So if Russia is able to threaten another offensive operation from the north, it's going to appeal Ukrainian forces away from the frontlines that they currently have. And Ukraine does not want to do that. Both sides of this fight are trying to build up their capabilities. Russia is doing it through trying to mobilize forces and train them. Ukraine is trying to do it by getting combined arms teams together to conduct large scale counter offenses. So it's really a rush to that who gets there first. And who has the logistics and the capability to continue the offensive and determine what comes next.",

Previously, those migrants were either detained or released into the U.S. while their immigration proceedings played out.Now, the Biden administration is preparing for a surge in border crossings as it plans to end another Trump-era policy known as Title 42 next week.

But in November, her daughter was born symbolizing the future she came here for in the first place. Her journey mirrors the more than 30,000 asylum seekers that have landed in New York City since the spring. Some on their own volition, some sent on a bus from Texas to make a political point.

Defense Minister Alberto Otarola declared a state of emergency Wednesday that will be in effect for 30 days. He said the national police and armed forces are responding to acts of vandalism, violence and seizure of roads. Peru's national police has said earlier that highways in at least four regions across the country had been blocked by protesters demanding the immediate return to power of former President Pedro Castillo. President Pedro Castillo As you may remember, Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7th after he announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Castillo's accused of conspiracy and rebellion. He denies those allegations. Dina Boluarte, who was Castillo's vice president and succeeded him after his impeachment, said Wednesday that it is technically possible to call for new elections by the end of next year, even though Peruvians are not scheduled to go to the polls until 2026. The national police were deployed to Lima's international airport which, according to a spokeswoman, is operating normally. However, some regional airports remain closed. This means that many international tourists are stuck without a connecting flight to the capital and must stay in Peru for now. Train service between Machu Picchu and Cuzco was disrupted due to deadly protests, leaving dozens of tourists stranded at the Inca Citadel. A political crisis has gripped Peru for years. Boluarte, who took over after the ousting of Pedro Castillo, is Peru's sixth president in less than five years. Rafael Romo, CNN -- Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It really has felt like a global village, with fans from all 32 teams and many other countries lingering here, hanging out, enjoying each other's company, often late into the night. We are not seeing so many fans here tonight with 3 days go until thefinal. Perhaps it's the calm before the storm. But there's still a great vibe, a great energy, a good atmosphere and hopefully , we can find some fans of Argentina and France to see what they think about the big game. So when we flew out here four weeks ago, of course, we are very much looking forward to the tournament. And I was wondering if I was going to miss the alcohol, the chance to have a beer every now and again. And the truth is, I really haven't. So, I'm going to introduce you to our new vice. We love these, often very, very late into the night. They're absolutely delicious.",
