And he talks a little bit about the rogue's gallery of terror organization. Some of it, obviously, Hamas and Hezbollah, supported by Iran, but also Al-Qaeda and ISIS who are making threats against U.S. interests in the Middle East against Americans in the United States.

You need to begin to talk before you can begin to address more important things.Now, the signals we are getting is that they are going to address some of the important things. So there's already talk of the fentanyl issue, that China will crack down on the factories and labs that produce the sort of materials that go into making fentanyl. This is not a small thing. This is an important achievement. The larger world audience will be looking for more than that, though. They will be looking for a reassurance in a time when we have two raging wars going on, in a time when the climate change crisis seems to be getting progressively worse and worse. We need the two most powerful men in the world to be able to communicate. Symbolically, that is not unimportant. Let me put it that way. It would be great if they could get much more done, and we know that there has been weeks of negotiations by officials on both sides before this meeting takes place. This meeting will last for a considerable period of time, several hours. So we can hope that something more meaningful would be achieved.
