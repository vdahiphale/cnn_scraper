Investigators say Boeing is unable to provide key records related to the door plug blowout on a January Alaskan Airlines flight.

I'm Lynda Kinkade, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening to you. Tonight, one of the most popular social media apps may soon be forced out of the US. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to remove TikTok from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company sells the app. Lawmakers in favor of that measures cited national security concerns. The bill now heads to the Senate where its fate is uncertain and they claim the bill was not a blanket ban. Lauren Fox reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After major bipartisan support in the House for a bill that could potentially ban TikTok, its next stop in the US Senate and the fate of its tens of millions of users in the US is not as clear cut. REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): This is one of those arguments you can push either argument. FOX (voice over): The House overwhelmingly passed their plan that would require Chinese parent company, ByteDance to sell its popular social media platform or face a ban in the US.",

Good morning now from Beijing today.Look, this is all happening at a time when the United States and China are trying to figure out this business economic relationship moving forward, especially post pandemic. So the question that I posed was this: Regardless of what happens from TikTok, there is a feeling of mistrust by some US lawmakers and by some members of the American public. How do you respond to this? Let's take a listen to the response from the ministry here in Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (through translator): Even though the US has not found evidence on how TikTok endangers its national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok. Such practice of resorting to acts of bullying when one could not succeed in fair competition, disrupts the normal operation of the market. It undermines the confidence of international investors and sabotages the global economic and trade order. This will eventually backfire on the US itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is ample precedent for the United States to block foreign investment on national security grounds. Certainly, I think the way that the US government has dealt with Huawei effectively removing Huawei from operations in the United States because of concern of essentially sort of network security and national security. So I think this poses a similar concern for a lot of people in government, but as I said, there are some who raise this constitutional question and it will certainly be litigated.

Now, that's a much smaller app. It's a much smaller company, but candidly, when you see the Chinese Foreign Ministry as your correspondent reported, objecting so vociferously to the divestiture, it actually kind of hardens in my view, the resolve of American politicians to demand this divestiture because why should the Chinese government care so much that TikTok operates in the United States. They ban it from the Chinese people. You know, China does not allow TikTok to operate in China, so clearly, they're concerned about it. When you have the Foreign Ministry saying these things, it actually suggests that TikTok is a huge national security asset for China, which I think again, just kind of backfires as a counterpoint.

Chile is leading this investigation, that's where LATAM is based. New Zealand is helping, but investigators really will want to know this. Was this an issue with the flight controls? Was this an issue with the autopilot? Or was this just severe turbulence because pilots described something a bit more than that.

A grand jury doesn't decide guilt or innocence. They just determined, one, is there reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed? And two, that the subject of the proceedings committed it. We know that that was the case against Mr. Trump, as well as 18 other defendants. Furthermore, it's a majority vote, it's not unanimous, as would be the case in an actual trial. But what happens is, is that a grand jury is the wing of the prosecution. The prosecution presents a case to the grand jury, the prosecution instructs the grand jury as to the law, the defendant or the defense attorneys are not there. Why is that all significant? Because when you're instructing the jury, you have to be specific with respect to what you're requesting of them. In this particular case what the judge said is that you're saying that these defendants are accused of soliciting public officials to violate their oath of office. Public officials take an oath of office and part of that oath, Lynda, is to uphold the Constitution of Georgia in this case and the United States. So the judge said, what specific provision of the Constitution of Georgia and the United States are you referencing that they were solicited to violate? Constitutions are vast. They have hundreds of provisions within them. You have to be more specific because at the end of the day a defendant has a right, of course, to a fair trial but to defend themselves and in order to defend yourself, you have to know what specifically you're being accused of and what specific provisions the prosecutors are relying upon and finding you guilty.

Let's start with Yeezy because that's obviously had a big impact. This was a very expensive breakup for Adidas. At one stage the Yeezy line was considered to contribute around 40 percent of the company's profits. So suddenly breaking up that partnership and trying to figure out what to do with the existing stock as you mentioned, they did start selling it with the logo, but there was a lot of confusion for some months about what to do about all of that. Now they are contributing they say a significant amount or they will to organizations that deal with discrimination and trying to combat discrimination. But they also, Lynda, have made some money from the Yeezy line. More than $300 million added to the operating profit from that. Good thing, too, all things considered looking at their earnings report, sales in North America dipped 16 percent last year. Part of that to do with the Yeezy issues, but also speaks to a broader demand issue in the U.S. and Canada are actually in terms of sportswear and athleisure. It's something Nike is facing as well. Part of it being consumers just wanting not to buy some of these product lines, but also going for upstart brands like Hoka and On, I think, are very trendy brands right now. So I'm told. Nike is actually saying they'll lay off 2 percent of their workforce so it's not just Adidas. The huge tax bill last year was one of the key big issues for Adidas because they actually did make a pretax profit and they're expecting hopefully to get over some of those issues this year.",

Despite the destruction and the rubble, we bought our food and cooked on firewood. Open Arms will be one of the first ships to enter the strip in years ever since Israel implemented a naval blockade on the territory in 2007. Aid trucks which on average crossed at around 500 a day before the war began now pile up at the Rafah Border Crossing in Egypt. Only a fraction actually make it across the border every day. Governments and other aid agencies have also taken to airdrops, though this option has proven both controversial and even risky. Leaving the sea as one of the last remaining avenues to bring food to those so desperately in need. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
