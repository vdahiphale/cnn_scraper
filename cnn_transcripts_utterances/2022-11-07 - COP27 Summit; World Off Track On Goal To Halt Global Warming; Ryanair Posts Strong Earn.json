And, you know, both of those would be inflationary. But neither would really be possible if you have divided government. Now, history shows, markets tend to do just fine when democrats have the White House, but not full control of Congress since 1944. The two best political scenarios are when democrats are in the White House. But republicans either have total control of congress or when republicans have a split control of Congress. There you see that 13.6 percent since 1944 in that last scenario. Now, we should note that's a small sample size, so we can't read too much into it. But it does support that gridlock is good theory. Also, we had the world's richest man seemingly out there supporting this gridlock idea. Elon Musk tweeting today, \"Shared power curves the worst excesses of both parties.\" Therefore, I recommend voting for a republican congress, given that the presidency is democrat. Never mind that, of course, Elon Musk has previously said he thinks that Twitter should remain politically neutral to keep the public's trust. I do think he's echoing this gridlock is good sentiment.",

The 2016, 2020elections, they showed how the social media world and the risk of misinformation and disinformation can have real tangible political implications there. You know, I do think, though, that we should push back a little bit on the gridlock is good idea. That's not always the case. I mean, one issue here is that Republicans have threatened to have a debt ceiling fight. They've said that, you know, they will use that as a gambling chip to try to get spending cuts out of democrats. And we know that a default would be terrible with spark a financial crisis. So we don't want to see another debt ceiling fight. And that is something that could happen in gridlock. The other point, I don't think this is getting enough attention is we are worried about a recession in the next year or so. And if there is gridlock, you have to wonder whether or not that limits Washington's ability to respond to a recession. We know the Federal Reserve is not going to be able to slash interest rates to zero if inflation is high and the economy's in recession. And gridlock may mean that congress and the administration won't be able to do that much either.",
