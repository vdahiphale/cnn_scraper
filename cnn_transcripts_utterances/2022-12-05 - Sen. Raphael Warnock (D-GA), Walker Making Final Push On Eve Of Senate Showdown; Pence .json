Why is this race still considered so absolutely critical? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYSTIf you're a Republican, it would be great to end the campaign cycle by ending the career of Senator Raphael Warnock, somebody who is in so many ways kind of a rising star among Democrats, so if they are able to end his career in the Senate, put Herschel Walker there. That would be some good news for the Republican Party that didn't fare as well as they thought they would fare in these past midterms. It looks like in these past elections in Georgia that Democrats have gone a long way in terms of trying to turn a Georgia little less red. So, if you are a Republican, you really, I think, wanting to sending a message that Georgia is still very much a red state and they have got a good ground game there if they're able to put Herschel Walker over the finish line, we'll see what happens. We'll see who shows up tomorrow. Obviously, Democrats have banked a lot of early votes and Republicans will see if they're able to surge ahead in the last moments tomorrow.",

You can see the crowd gathering behind me here at this last Walker rally and they're playing a lot of holiday music, some Christmas music, really reflective of the fact that people have moved on from elections. But those T.V. ads certainly are keeping this race front and center.And, Wolf, I can tell you, in a crush of T.V. ads that we see throughout the midterm election year, this is something different entirely. You literally cannot wait just a couple of minutes between ads to see Walker ads and Warnock ads and outside groups, $80 million in the last month alone. It's really extraordinary. But the disparity is also so key. So, tomorrow night, we, of course, will be watching the outcome of this. And if it is a strong night for Senator Warnock, we certainly will be looking at these spending numbers. So, Republican outside groups simply did not commit as much money, did not invest as much money into this runoff as Democrats did. They certainly promised to a month ago, but then when the control of the Senate did not hinge upon Georgia, a lot of the Republican investments and cavalry did not come to Georgia. So, certainly a big spending disparity, we'll see if that tracks the outcome tomorrow. But it's palpable here, the imbalance in ads, Wolf.",

Their hearts and minds are still with Donald Trump. They believe what Donald Trump says. And so if you're Kevin McCarthy, if you're Mitch McConnell even, I'm not sure if you at this point are prepared to say that you would not support Donald Trump in 2024.

They are leaving no stone unturned to find out who did this and why. I think it's absolutely critical that we find that out. In the meantime, making sure that people are safe and warm, we've committed significant resources from our state Department of Health and Human Resources, Department of Transportation, our emergency management. All of the traffic lights are out, so making sure that those intersections are policed, making sure that adult care homes and nursing homes have the resources that they need, because when you're completely without power, it causes significant problems. And we've been there to help. I was there today. And I actually went to the substation, one of the substations that was attacked.

These were apparently Soviet-style drones with jet engines giving them a longer range. And while Ukraine is not claiming responsibility for these attacks that caused massive explosions that killed at least three people, the Russian Defense Ministry says they do believe these are Ukrainian- made, perhaps a not-so-subtle signal to Moscow that Ukraine is working to strike farther than just the frontlines here in Ukraine.",

If Ukraine was indeed behind these strikes on these Russian airbases inside Russia, of course, what does it say that they struck so deep inside Russian territory? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, it says Ukraine is developing its own technologies to do what the United States really doesn't want it to do, which is to strike Russia. And, Wolf, you have to understand these people don't want to give Russia a sanctuary from which they can be bombed and their country destroyed. So, yes, it's a natural thing, they're going to do this. This is a high-tech industrialized country. It has its own defense industry and it can produce weapons like this.
