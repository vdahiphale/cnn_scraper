      "sentences": "An American president under pressure suggesting a pause in Israel's bombing campaign as the war tears this world further apart. That's tonight on Newsnight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. As the war against Hamas continues to accelerate, the more it appears that old global divides are growing wider and deeper. Today, again, Palestinians carrying children away from heaps of mangled concrete. The IDF struck Jabalya, rocking that refugee camp for a second time this week. Israel says that Hamas is hiding leaders and infrastructure there and using civilians as shields. But, again, Palestinian families are tonight praying that it's not their turn to count the dead. Satellite imagery may provide the clearest view, before Jabalya unscarred, and then after Jabalya splintered by IDF bombs. But with each passing day, each deadly incident and each scene of despair, we see more division. President Biden tonight says Israel should pause strikes in Gaza to get more hostages out, but the president, otherwise, wants to give Israel the space to fight this war how chooses. It's a position, though, that progressive Democrats, like Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, say they will not let stand. We see the divides in New York, too, where Jamaal Bowman, a rising star on the left, now faces a four-fire alarm for his political career, a potential primary challenge over demanding a ceasefire. Republicans, too, are far from immune to division over this war. The House speaker is at odds with Senate Republicans over how to pay for aid. The division and paralysis that comes with it leaves a vacuum, often filled by the most extreme voices. And for evidence, just look at Congress today. On the House floor, where Florida Republican Brian Mast said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BRIAN MAST (R-FL): I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians, as is frequently said. I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians during World War II. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the fact that the international community within the U.N. system at least did not find its way to come and condemn Hamas in a clear way since the beginning of the war, this, I think, is outrageous on its own. We are hearing condemnations from countries across the board in support of Israel, as we should, because this is our fight for justice and our fight for what's right, and actually our fight for the well being of the Palestinians in Gaza. And what we are saying is free Gaza from Hamas because of what they are doing to their own people.

And just today a group of Muslim leaders in the key state of Minnesota are holding Abandon Biden signs and announcing that they will not support the president's re-election bid. And a new Quinnipiac poll shows that among people aged 18 to 34, a key group in the Democratic coalition, 66 percent disapprove of Biden's handling of this war. And joining me, Chris Wallace, host of the new CNN program, The Chris Wallace Show, airing this Saturday at 10:00 A.M. as well as Who's Talking to Chris Wallace, on Max. Chris, there is so much happening in this conflict between Israel and Hamas, but one of the main things that I think people might remember a long time is this Jabalya refugee camp strike. And it really does show the tightrope that President Biden is facing on this issue, even within the Democratic Party.

Because, on the one hand, he keeps saying publicly that Israel needs to abide by the laws of war and they need to have humanitarian concerns.I think that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes in terms of them pressing, he and some top people, like Blinken, secretary of state, behind the scenes. Publicly, he has not been as critical of Israel particularly, as a lot of people, as you said, particularly in the left wing of the Democratic Party would like him to be.

And I think about the scene where he's proposing to Monica and this character who we think of as being afraid of emotion and funny and using his sarcasm and his jokes as sort of a -- to deflect things.
