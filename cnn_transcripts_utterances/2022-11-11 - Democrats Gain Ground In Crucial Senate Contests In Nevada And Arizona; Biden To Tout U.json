The focus is on two very close races in Arizona and Nevada, two states where incumbent Democrats are trying to hold on to their seats in the U.S. Senate. Let's take a look at the latest updates with half a million votes yet to be counted in Arizona. Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly expanding his lead over Republican challenger Blake Masters. Most of the votes are being counted from Maricopa County, Arizona is biggest county with about half of the state's total population that includes the city of Phoenix. Kelly's campaign manager has told CNN they are confident and expect to win. In Nevada, new numbers show democratic comic Catherine Cortez Masto closing the gap on her Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. There are still tens of thousands of ballots yet to be counted from Clark County, the biggest county in the state, which includes Las Vegas and the seats only County which leans Democrat. CNNs Gary Tuchman has the very latest report again from Las Vegas, Nevada, but first he is CNN's Kyung Lah in Phoenix, Arizona. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Here in Maricopa County, the tedious work of democracy continues counting the vote hanging in the balance is control of the U.S. Senate some 78,000 vote results were released this evening by Maricopa County didn't really change the races all that much percentage wise but the Democrats who are currently on a razor lead, a razor thin lead they got just a bit more vote pat. Now this is a slow process and it is a careful process. What we're hearing though on the edges are some of the Republicans on this ballot who are frustrated have been talking about some of these election officials might be doing this on purpose, releasing this slowly on purpose. And we got strong pushback by election officials here.",

We could tell you that the tabulators are done tabulating for the evening. They will resume on Friday. And the 17 counties in the state of Nevada, the Democratic candidate for Senate who was an incumbent, the Democratic candidate for governor who is an incumbent are making up ground with the counting of mail-in ballots. Tens of thousands of ballots still need to be counted in the state of Nevada. But right now, Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic senator has made up about 7,000 votes today is now behind a Republican challenger by 8,000 votes. Meanwhile, Governor Steve Sisolak has made up about 7,000 votes and is behind by 27,000 votes. So here in Clark County alone the largest county in the state, there are at least 50,000 ballots still the count. These are not ballots that were done in person on election day. These are ballots that were mailed in or dropped in drop boxes on election day. Now the ballots can come until Saturday. That's the rule here in Nevada. So either way they would have been counted. They're not counted because it's close. They're counting because that's the law. As long as the ballots were postmarked by Tuesday, they could arrive by Saturday and be counted. So, this will continue totally Saturday. The counting will continue to last until Saturday. And we still don't know who the winners of these very high profile races will be.

Now, at the same time, a CNN exit poll found that in the House 49 percent of independent voters went for a Democrat candidate while 47 percent went for a Republican. And according to David Shor, from the Blue Rose Research group, Democrats, one independent voters, which may be the first time that a party that controls the presidency, has won independence in the midterms since 2002. They got a lot of self-identified Republicans to vote for them. That's the Democrats. And they did these things, especially well, inclusive races.That's the how Democrats managed to defy the odds.

As we saw in the exit poll, a majority of voters disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling the presidency. You have incredible numbers 75 or 80 percent saying the economy is only fair or poor. Large numbers, as you as you know in the exit poll, saying that inflation has been a moderate or severe hardship on them. And historically, those are the kinds of numbers that produce, you know, a route for the party holding the White House, particularly among those independent voters.But there was a second negative judgment that bounded and limited the impact of the first, which is that many of those same voters have deep concerns about the Republican Party in the Trump era. And what Democrats were able to do was focused just enough voters not only on the question of what Democrats had done with power, but on the question of what Republicans would do with power. And I think the reluctance to give Republicans unified control, symbolized and crystallized by the issue of abortion, and also about democracy, is what allowed Democrats to really avoid the worst in this midterm, especially given those underlying economic attitudes and attitudes about bite.",

And it is interesting how much difference a year has made. Eventually that bill passed, it was sort of a slog for the President, but it did include $370 billion to combat climate change. That was the largest investment in American history. And the President certainly does feel like he's entering this conference.Now, a year later, having put his money where his mouth is when it comes to sort of goading other nations into making their own significantly ambitious climate pledges. And White House officials say that he does plan to try and leverage those commitments when he speaks later today in Sharm el-Sheikh to try and tell leaders that now is the time for the -- for their own countries to step up, for the for their own countries to make very, very significant investments to try and curb global warming. The President does feel like he has his wind at his back when he's coming into this summit and onto the rest of the trip, in part because of the midterm elections, which seemed as if they were a referendum on his choices over the last year. And so the President does feel pretty good. What White House officials say that he'll say in his remarks is that other leaders need to keep their eye on the ball when it comes to curbing greenhouse gases and stay focused on this specific issue. One issue that he will confront here is that a lot of leaders are focused on a different issue, which is the issue of climate reparations. Basically, some poor countries who are being adversely affected by climate change are asking for wealthier nations, who are the largest emitters of greenhouse gases to pay up to essentially pay them to help build resilience for issues like floods, fires, other extreme events that are directly related to climate change. What the President's dilemma is, is that there really is no support for that politically, particularly if Republicans take control of the Congress. And that is sort of the issue, the dynamic that the President has, as he embarks on this round the world seven day trip, certainly the President will tell these leaders as he does everywhere around the world that America is back that its renewing its commitments to allies, to things like democracy and climate change. And certainly the biggest threat to that is President Trump and he does appear politically weakened, but at the same time for Republicans take control of one or more chambers of the Congress, the President's agenda will be severely corrupt. So those are the two things that the President is balancing as he arrives here in a few hours in Sharm el- Sheikh. John.",

The change of seasons. Well, this is what is left of the winter storm across the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Not much, just a few more inches of snow anticipated across North Dakota and extreme northwestern sections of Minnesota. There is a lot of wind associated with it. So it's blowing and drifting the snowfall. But what I'm going to show you now -- here is the weather alerts that are currently ongoing. By the way, that ice storm warning, that's all thanks to the kind of a spray coming off of Lake Superior. But this is the remnants of what was Hurricane Nicole spiraling across the southeastern U.S. And so there it is, there you have it. The winter storm to the north, the tropical storm impacting the southeast. And this is going to usher and garner (ph) in a complete change in our weather pattern across the U.S. And I will show you that in just one second. By the way, we have a tornado watch in place for places across South Carolina and portions of North Carolina as well. That severe weather shifts into portions of the mid-Atlantic for the day on Friday. These two systems are almost going to do a dance over the next 24 hours. What I mean by that is, the moisture, that is the rainfall associated with the remnants of Nicole is going to actually get swept up by this cold front that is producing the snowfall across the upper Midwest. They combine to produce an extremely wet weekend for the East Coast. So, we've got travel headaches in place if you are traveling anywhere across the I-95 corridor. Some of the airports -- Syracuse, Pittsburgh through Columbus as well as Cleveland, Roanoke to Richmond -- the potential here for flash flooding exists anywhere you see that shading of yellow. That is for the mid-Atlantic, northern sections of New England into the central Appalachians. We have the potential for flash flooding across that area. Again, that is all thanks to the remnants of Nicole that continue to move across the region, bringing wind as well as the potential of heavier rainfall onset across this particular region. Both of these systems working in tandem to produce this extremely wet weekend across areas. So do take care and double check those travel plans if you are traveling this weekend, John.",
