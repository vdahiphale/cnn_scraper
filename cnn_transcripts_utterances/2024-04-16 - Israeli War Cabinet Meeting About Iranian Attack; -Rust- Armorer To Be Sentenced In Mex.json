And this morning, brand new details on where the juror selection process goes and how the Trump team plans to keep a delay strategy going. CNN's Kristen Holmes outside the courthouse. Trump will arrive presumably sometime in the next hour or so. What do you expect today Kristen? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, I can tell you that speaking to senior advisers last night, the thing that they were most upset about after that jury selection process yesterday was the fact that there reports that Donald Trump was nodding off. They insist that he was not at any time sleeping, saying that he was just closing his eyes, he was taking it in, he was rocking back in his chair, also insisting that no one actually really knew anyone who had been reporting that was in the courtroom. They were just going off of a feed. Again, this was clearly what they were upset about after the first day of this trial of the jury the selection. So let's do a quick recap as to what we saw yesterday. We saw this jury selection process actually start around 2:30, 96 jurors were brought in, 50 of them were immediately dismissed, saying they could not be fair or impartial in this case. So then that left another nine saying that they just couldn't participate. They did not give any reason for it. Then it whittled down just based on the questionnaire. We are still not done with that first group of 96 today. Today we're going to see 32 jurors go through that questionnaire process trying to, again, find a single juror. About nine people full have gotten through the first round, but just remember, this is not the nine people that are going to make up the jury. This is just round one. We are talking about people who still have to go through cross-examination, the voir dire, by both sides. Also, both sides get 10 people that without any reasoning they can just dismiss. We're not even close to that yet. So today we expect another 100 jurors to be brought in for vetting. And again, this all starts with the judge. He goes through that questionnaire that we have talked about at length, asking people just the simple basics of where you're from, what kind of news you consume, but also getting into the details of how this could be political, asking have you ever been to a Trump rally? Have you ever worked for Donald Trump? Have you ever been to anti-Trump rally? And this is expected, again, to weed out an enormous amount of people, particularly here in Manhattan. I'll tell you, yesterday, even Trump's team was surprised that 50 people were immediately dismissed. They thought that number would be closer to 30, maybe 40. But the fact that it was over 50 percent of that 96, they were even surprised to see that. So we'll see how this all plays out today. One thing I'm watching, Donald Trump in the courtroom. Remember, today now is only going to be jury selection. We saw that whole full morning yesterday of discussion over schedule, of questions. That's not what today is. How is Donald Trump going to react to just sitting in this courtroom for hours and hours on end watching these people essentially talk about him with no participation. That'll be something to see. It's going to be very hard for someone like Donald Trump who really wants to be part of everything, John.",

I'm not going to scrutinize you, you can just walk out, essentially get a free pass, I would think that a lot of jurors would say, oh, I can be with my wife, my kids, my job, my husband. I'm out of here.But in this case, we had nearly half that remaining. They answered that fundamental question that they could be fair and impartial, and that is really the biggest hurdle.

That is not what this case is about. This is about a false business records case. So I thought the judge struck the right balance, only allowing certain evidence to come in, but excluding what would be considered highly prejudicial. And the judge and the parties are also very focused on an appeal. And so the judge is trying to eliminate potential areas of appeal and keep this trial focused on the key issues that are at play.",

I know that the prosecution has asked for a thief $3,000 financial penalty, query whether $3,000 has any impact or even registers with Donald Trump. So I think the judge is going to hold this hearing to make it clear that he's not going to just let things go.

It is all over now, you don't have to respond.But that is not how the Israelis see it. Israelis feel that they have to do something. And if the Israelis do something, the natural tendency for the Iranians is to do something in return. In other words, we are in that ladder of escalation. The possibility exists that this could go on for a while. But if both sides are taken off that ladder of escalation, it could be quite different and you could end up with a scenario where they kind of stop this particular process.

In other words, flying them up to this point and then turning them back. That is a possibility without striking anything.That is also a possible scenario that they could do. We do a lot of that all of the time, but of course the tensions aren't that high when we say going against Russia or China, or some country like that.
