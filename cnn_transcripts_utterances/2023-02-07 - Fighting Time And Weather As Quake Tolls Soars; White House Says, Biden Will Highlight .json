Let me come off here to you so see properly. You see the search and rescuers in the yellow hats. Now, these guys have been here, some of them for more than 40 hours. We've been talking to them today and they are not giving up. What they're using are drills. They're using heat probes and sound probes to get inside what they believe is quite a large void underneath that rubble to assess whether anybody is still alive. And as I said, they heard about three voices earlier on today. So, they're absolutely determined until they see or hear no sign of life, they will continue this and it will be a search and rescue effort. Using drills, as I say, but you could also see that they're literally using spades and their hands, Wolf, to scratch away the surface. I mean, this is really delicate and a very challenging, very, very challenging for these guys, because they are also working in an environment where they are concerned about how robust these two buildings to the right and the left are at this point. So, it is a real challenge for them. There are buildings to my right and to my left, both of which have come down, two of which have got buildings sort of over the top of them. And there are concerns that all of these buildings will come down in the next 24 hours or so. So, it's very difficult, heartbreaking for these search and rescue workers.

This is going to be a lengthy speech tonight where the president lays out both what he and his administration believe are critical accomplishments of their first two years, but also their roadmap for the path forward, including the potential and also likely re-election campaign we expect to be announced in the weeks ahead.But when you dig into the excerpts of what we've received so far, you get a sense of core components, the central tenets of the speech the president will deliver to Congress and tens of millions of Americans later this evening. And in part it addresses the fact that sitting behind him will no longer be a Democratic speaker of the House but instead Speaker Kevin McCarthy. And this will not be a political attack speech. Instead it will be an effort to try and find some unity, try and find some bipartisanship something the president found on several critical legislative agenda items in the first two years of his time in office. And that is something that he will cite, according to one excerpt, the president will say, to my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is to reason we can't work together in this new Congress. The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere. And I think that underscores what we've heard from White House advisers in terms of the approach the president is going to take tonight. Certainly, he will list off all of the accomplishments he and his team believed they had in the first two years and how they view the path forward but they also will try and continue to take the temperature down, continue to try and press for bipartisanship where there is agreement, where there is overlap on critical issues and more than anything else, try and reach across the aisle where there are opportunities there. It certainly hasn't felt like the way things have been headed in the first few weeks of this new House Republican majority but the president trying to, to some degree, rise above where they believe the political partisanship has been over the course of the last several weeks and really underscore that point to the American public tonight, Wolf.",

It stands in contrast to what you see outside, 8- foot-high metal fencing now surrounding the U.S. Capitol complex. This is the third year in a row for the security measure in the wake of the January 6th attack. Some Republicans don't think it's really necessary even though authorities are monitoring very disturbing online chatter that concerns them big time.CNN's Brian Todd has more on that. First, though, a warning, some of the images you're about to see are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  According to a Capitol police intelligence and interagency bulletin obtained by CNN, U.S. capitol police have been tracking social media posts, which called for violence against the Capitol and, quote, aspirational targeting of the State of the Union. One post read, quote, this was the problem with January 6th, you can't do it halfway. Other posts called for the executions of officials in President Biden's administration and for Biden's arrest. The bulletin did say there were no specific credible threats related to the state of the union address. But the rhetoric concerns law enforcement veterans. TERRANCE GAINER, FORMER U.S. CAPITOL POLICE CHIEF:  The rhetoric that's online and the general hate and discontent still going around the country causes some concern for the capitol police and other law enforcement, but they are trying to prepare for that by having the proper defensive mechanisms.",
