Andy, appreciate your time this morning. Most of the capitols evacuated for kind of a brief amount of time. It would seem on its face to be minimal disruptions.

You know, Phil, the point of these sort of mass threats, and hoax threats, is really to disrupt, to harass the targets, and ultimately to create fear and terror on some level. And they all accomplished that. As you said, some places react more strongly than others. But really in every one of these instance, law enforcement doesn't have the luxury of reading this email and instantly, you know, just going with the likely result and dismissing it as a hoax. They have got to take some procedures, some precautions to at least confirm that they aren't dealing with a real threat here.It's easier in a situation like this, when it's a mass mailing that's identical, it's been received by over, you know, 23, 24 different statehouses around the country. It's kind of even easier to lean this that direction of saying this is a likely hoax. But you always have to take threat reporting seriously. I think the - the locations that evacuated their courthouses temporarily, conducted logical checks did the right thing, but that takes an enormous amount of time and resources and really distracts those responders from other duties.",

You'll remember back in 2017 there was a young man who was a dual U.S./Israeli citizen, was actually arrested in Israel for sending out what authorities believe were somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 different threats online. And he was doing it for a variety of reasons. He was trying to profit from them by charging folks fees on the dark web to submit threats to schools. But he was also alleged to have significant mental health issues.[08:35:02] So, the range of possible motives for these things are broad. When you see them directed at political institutions or judicial institutions, I think it's reasonable to suspect that the person or people behind them are somehow motivated by some sort of politically tinged ideology or grievance or anger.

So, to have each location, each target location that receives a communication like this immediately report it to their local FBI bi office or their local Joint Terrorism Task Force is super important. That way at least you have one national entity that understands the total threat picture, where all these things are landing, and can do the kind of really considered research and intelligence collection that might lead to identifying and locating the offender.

And I think part of that is because we know that there are literally thousands of people who receive judgments they did not want or sentences around the country, in federal, state, and local courthouses every single day. And there's really no way to accurately determine which one of those people is going to snap, like this man did, and talk matters into his own hands and commit some sort of act of violence.So, it's impossible to protect completely against that threat. You know, you have -- our judicial system is already bogged down by a lack of resources and they are required to maintain an environment that respectful and protects the rights of the defendants. But really at any moment something like this can happen. And so it's quite a risk and it creates extreme anxiety for people who work in these environments. And I should also say, you know, that I don't have hard data on this, but it does seems like the current wave of discourse and criticism and attacks of the judiciary, of our legal institutions, of our law enforcement institutions, has led to an erosion of trust in those institutions. And you have to think that that adds to this problem, creates an environment in where almost more permissive to strike out against members of law enforcement and members of the court. So, I think we're definitely in a time of elevated risk to people who work in that system that we all depend upon for justice.",
