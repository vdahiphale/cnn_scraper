I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6:00 in the evening. After nearly eight months of war inside Gaza, three European nations say they will recognize a Palestinian state. What does this move by Norway, Ireland and Spain really mean? Well, Iran's supreme leader prays over the coffin of the country's late president, Ebrahim Raisi, as huge crowds fill the streets of Tehran. Iran will host 60 delegations from different countries for the funeral. One person has died and more than 100 injured during extreme turbulence on a Singapore Airlines flight. We'll take a look at the investigation underway into what has been a frightening incident. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Certainly you've heard from those leaders saying that they are pursuing a path to peace, trying to put an end to what is going on in this Israel- Hamas conflict. But, Nic, let me start with, you.

But I think what they're trying to do is speed that process. Sweden is a member of the European Union that has also independently recognized Palestine as a state. And some of the former Eastern Soviet bloc countries in the east of Europe, now part of the European Union, they automatically, as part of the Soviet Union, had recognized a Palestinian state. That stood well with some of them and not so well with others. But I think if you look to the sort of the powerhouses in European Union politics, like France and Germany, they are both saying that this is not the right move at this time. Germany is saying, officials saying that this essentially rewards Hamas. And the French saying, look, we should move collectively. And this is more than opinion of the United States. We should move collectively to take a decision like this when it will count politically for recognizing a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution, as part of a broader initiative. Which is the United States' point, that the end of the war in Gaza, to bring on board the support of regional partners like Saudi Arabia and others, necessarily has to recognize a clear pathway to a Palestinian state. So I think the aspiration here is to speed a process that I think most would understand is potentially in the wind. But potentially in the wind only will become a reality when the government changes in Israel, which they all recognize. And perhaps there's an element of that in what the -- in what the Norwegians and the Irish and the Spanish are trying to do, heap pressure on this particular government of Israel.",

He believes that this move of recognizing a Palestinian state seven months after October 7th is tantamount to awarding a, quote, \"gold medal to the murderers and rapists of Hamas,\" according to Israel Katz, and he is vowing serious consequences. We don't yet know the extent of those consequences. But Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of this current Israeli government, is suggesting several steps, including seeking the approval of tens of thousands of housing units in Israeli settlements. Approving new Israeli settlements, canceling crossing permits for Palestinian Authority officials as well as withholding tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority.

But look, I mean, what you heard from Simon Harris today,  the taoiseach, the prime minister in Ireland, quoting Ireland's own history of its own bid from independence more than 100 years ago from Britain. And what it took and what it meant to the state. So there's something -- there's a hot, a passionate and hot element that goes into the logic and thinking. Norway, that has sort of long been a paragon of standing up for human rights on the globe and in fact has played a very significant role in that part in many conflicts around the world. So these are countries that have a long tradition of trying to stick up for the people that are suffering. And the Irish feel that they have a deeper sense of understanding of that. Perhaps each of these countries come at it from their own point of view. But it's to try to hasten that change, that these other countries, their partners and allies, seem to be prepared to wait longer. And just one more thing for the Irish taoiseach speaking at a press conference after his statement in the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, he said, look, we -- we're looking at all this suffering.

It's absolutely right that, as a result of the fact that so much of the aid coming off the pier the other day never reached the warehouses, because people, of course, if they had a chance to get some food, they'd grab it from the trucks that are passing. It's not surprising. As a result of that we are working with both the Israelis -- we deal with them every day -- and the U.S. to find these alternative routes. That's true.

That's what sources close to ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are saying. They claim Egyptian intelligence quietly changed the terms of a proposed sign-off by -- or a proposal signed off by Israel, meaning the one Hamas agreed to two weeks ago was a different deal. CNN's Alex Marquardt has been across this story and he joins us now live. Just explain, Alex, if you will.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Becky, we just -- we've gathered a lot more details about what happened in the pastfew weeks in these ceasefire talks and how they came to fall apart. Essentially, there was a framework that Israel had all but agreed to. They were on board with the terms. It was just missing the final sign-off. And this was at the end of April. An Egyptian delegation went to Israel to finalize that framework and then they went back to Cairo, where they started discussions with Hamas. Now it became clear to the Egyptians that Hamas would not be on board with these Israeli terms. And Egyptian intelligence, in particular, one senior Egyptian intelligence officer, whose name is Ahmed Abdel Khalek, started to tinker, to tweak with that framework in a way that would get Hamas on board. So after it was amended, it was submitted to Hamas and Hamas accepted it. You'll remember, Becky, back on May 6, just over three weeks ago, Hamas came out, saying, we accept the ceasefire deal. And there was this brief period of excitement, where it appeared that Hamas was accepting something that Israel had essentially tacitly already agreed to. And we could have been on the cusp of a cease-fire. But that was quite short-lived. It became clear that what Hamas had agreed to was quite different from what Israel had agreed to. And sources tell Jeremy Diamond and myself that, in fact, what Egypt had submitted to Hamas was something that the other parties, Israel and the other mediators, Qatar and the U.S., were not aware of. So one source told me we were all duped. That same source saying that the CIA director, who was in the region at the time, who has been the U.S. point person in all of this, almost blew a gasket. So there was a lot of anger; the talks soon fell apart. They are currently on a pause, we're told, with no sign of picking up anytime soon, Becky.",

The latest from the CNN weather team, that these thunderstorms were building at an incredibly rapid pace. One of the big causes of turbulence, though it can be not visible to pilots and they say that these thunderstorms are building so fast over the course of an hour. The tops of the thunderstorms, the anvil head that really signals the strength of a thunderstorm, went from 20,000 feet to 50,000 feet, a 30,000- foot growth in the course of an hour. The causes of thunderstorms, wind shear, things like different currents of air moving at different rates, terrain like mountains that can cause interference with airplanes that are flying along, especially in mountainous terrain. But this was in an area where the monsoon season is just about to start. The afternoon thunderstorms build fast and furious. The flight crew said, according to Singapore Airlines, that this came on rapidly and without much warning. Even the passengers are understanding in the hospital, as they're exiting the hospital, they have told the media, we understand that the pilots could have potentially not seen this. So many of them were injured. We have heard at least 100 were injured. That's up from the initial reports of about 70. Very infrequently do turbulence incidents like this cause much damage to the airplane structure itself. Although you have seen the video from inside of the plane, where the sort of non-structural pieces of the airplane, the interior, the ceiling, the headliner, the parts that hold the oxygen mask in place, those have all come down. Thankfully, these airplanes are stressed to an incredible degree. Really rare that those end in a fatality. The last time there was a fatality as a result of a turbulence incident on a major commercial flight was back in 2021. Before that, in 2016.",
