It's a redistrict that's been redistricted because of the population changes, but it's another Republican win.Let's take a look at the balance of power as it stands right now going into these final days, before the new Congress comes back. Right now, the balance of power shows 204 Republicans to 187 Democrats. 44 seats still remain outstanding. You need 218 to be the majority in the House of Representatives. And once again, the Congressman-elect John James wins Michigan 10. Another Republican win in the U.S. House of Representatives. Meanwhile, the president of the United States has spent the last few minutes tweeting out a new video of him congratulating Democrats on their winning elections. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's two years away and start touting the victories.

      "sentences": "At the White House right now, President Biden is just moments away from holding a news conference about the midterm election results. He will face reporters and the nation with control of the House and the Senate still up in air as election night in America continues. I'm Jake Tapper, we are back in the CNN Election Center as we wait hear from President Biden.Let's take a look at where the expectations define cliffhanger elections stands this hour. In the fight for the Senate, Democrats now hold 48 Senate seats, Republicans have 49. They need to pick up two more seats, Republicans, in order to get 51 seats required to retake Senate control. The balance of power hinging on three key Senate races that remain undecided, in Georgia, in Arizona, and in Nevada. It could all come down to Georgia where CNN projects the contest between incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker is headed to a December runoff. In the House of Representatives, 218 seats are needed to control that chamber. Democrats, now trailing with 187 seats compared to 204 for Republicans, with 44 races still uncalled. Republicans closer to winning a majority, although likely not as large as House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy had hoped. As we standby to hear from President Biden, we are told Biden and his team are feeling vindicated by the results so far. The Democrats bucking historic trends and defying predictions that a red wave would sweep over them in this election. A less upbeat outcome for former president Donald Trump. His endorsements in some high-profile races, failing to deliver the swift and sweeping victories many Republicans anticipated. Our political team is in place to cover it all, including Dana Bash, Abby Philip, Chris Wallace and Casey Hunt. John king is back at the Magic Wall to show us where and why we still cannot call key races. David Chalian is digging deeper into the issues influencing voters choices. And Brianna Keilar is at the Voting Desk monitoring how and when the remaining ballots are being counted. In addition, of course our correspondents are standing by as more votes come in to be counted. And President Biden gets ready to take questions. Let's go right to Phil Mattingly, he's at the White House. Phil, what are we expecting to hear from President Biden when he comes out, which could be at any moment?",

But this is the format that will give him ample opportunity to really lay out what White House advisers call equal parts vindication and validation. Vindication, because they were able to a buck those historic trends. They were able to buck inflation that remains at four decades highs.And while they have lost and will likely lose the House at this point, they believe it underscores the reality that his agenda is popular, that his approach is popular, and while the president's approval ratings aren't exactly sky-high. They have still managed to buck those trends. Now it is a tricky balancing act right now. Obviously, the Senate and House remain uncalled. White House officials are keenly aware the House is likely to flip even though it is closer than just about anybody thought it would be. And it raises very critical questions going forward. The president has made clear he would start to think through his decision about seeking reelection after the midterm elections. We are now a day after the midterm elections. And he also has to weigh the possibility at a Washington reshaped. A House Republican conference, no matter how small the majority, dramatically changes what the president can do and what the president will face over the next two years. Those are all critical elements that we expect the president to delve into here. But when you talk to White House officials, there is no denying the fact that they are very pleased with what they saw last night, very closely watching how the races that are still outstanding play out. But certainly, a better night than most people expected. And White House officials feel very good about that, in advance of the presidents marks -- Jake.",

It could make governing difficult and also make the first task for Kevin McCarthy difficult. That is getting the votes to become the House Speaker.Now, behind the scenes Kevin McCarthy is moving swiftly. He assembled his teams of whips today in order to fan out across the House Republican conference, lockdown enough support in order for him to become the next Speaker of the House. But there's a problem. With the narrow majority, that will almost certainly embolden the far-right faction of his conference. The House Freedom Caucus who we are told is threatening to vote against Kevin McCarthy. Roughly two dozen or so members are suggesting they are open to voting against him if they don't get some concession. Some of those key concessions, putting the idea of impeaching Joe Biden on the table. Putting the idea of impeaching some cabinet members like Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department. Putting that issue on the table as well. Now in order for Kevin McCarthy to get those votes, he will have to cut some of those deals. Because next week will be the first step in the process. He has to get the nomination from his conference, half in the numbers need to vote for him. But then the big vote happens in January where you would have to get 218 votes in the full House of Representatives to become the next Speaker of the House. And a narrow majority, means a handful of members, if they defect, will complicate that path. And, Jake, we are told that those far-right members are looking at this possibility of putting up a challenger against him next week, a long shot challenger who they believe will force him to come to the table. But while they are happy, they have the majority, the margins do matter and McCarthy is contending with that reality right now.",

Because I think, even they beat their own expectations. They tried to put together what they thought was the best closing argument they could under the circumstances. Frankly, not really knowing if it would be enough to hold back the gravity of history, the gravity of the president's approval ratings, which are upside down. And I do think that what we saw last night was, when you look at thescope of recent American history, the last say 40 years, you don't really see incumbent presidents who are as unpopular as President Biden is, getting the result that they got last night. And I think that's why you are probably going to hear Biden, with some caution, saying something along those lines. But I will say one other thing. Remember, Biden campaigned as wanting to bring back the soul of the nation. I do think that there is a feeling now that Americans responded to the idea that there should be lines drawn with some of these candidates who went too far on the election denial, too far on the conspiracy theories. And I would not be surprised if you heard him talking about what that means for the country, not just for them.",
