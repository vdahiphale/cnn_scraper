I mean, look at the temperatures. It is coming down to 97 right now in DC.

Like I said, in Baltimore, it hit 101.   At this early in the season, it is extreme and it is unusual. We do know that this is the Climate Shift Index here and what it does is it helps us calculate the influence of climate change on daily extreme temperatures. And you see these oranges and these reds here, it tells us that the temperatures here today were made at least two to three times more likely due to climate change. We are seeing these temperatures get more extreme sooner in the season as our summer heat season simply just gets longer. Here is a look at those alerts from New York to Philly down to DC over towards Cleveland as well, it will keep these temperatures above 90 degrees for more than 80 percent of Americans through the next couple of days.

So they have 27 out of 28 working.It really gives them a little more time to check out the spacecraft. It gives the crew on board a little more time to - the station crew that's already there, a little more time to interact with the new astronauts to get a little help with things. And it also gives Butch and Suni some extra time on orbit. So, you know, it was planned for nine days, but that was really a minimum. I would look at it as that it's going to be between nine and 45. The longer they can stay in general is a good thing because they can check the spacecraft out for a longer period of time.

So they really want to test the vehicle and find out as much as they can before they have the next flight, which they're going to be considered more of an operational flight. This flight was designed to learn as much as they can about the spacecraft.And they said - the interesting thing they mentioned there, the orbital module, that does not return. So there's two pieces that are up at the space station, the crew module and the orbital module. The crew - the orbital module is going to be used to help them get home and then it's not coming back to Earth. So the crew module, for example, they're going to get that back. They can study it and get some more data on it. But this is the last time they're really going to be able to get data on the orbital module. They want to make sure that it's performing as best they can. So there really is no rush here to get them home. And, you know, the thing is that it's coinciding with a couple of problems. You know, if everything was smooth and they didn't have the problem with the leak or the thrusters and they were staying extra time, it'd probably be a different story. But because they had those problems, you know, we're wondering, is that the cause of the stay on board? Well, not really. The extended stay gives them some extra time and it really is a win-win. Hopefully, they'll learn a lot in the next few days. They'll probably get them home, I think, in early July. And I think it's going to be a good conclusion, at least I'm hoping.",

But really what you're focused on is the job you have.And Suni and Butch are good friends of mine, great astronauts. The right people for this job to make sure the spacecraft is working correctly. I also want to point out, Omar, it's not just the crew on board, it's the thousands of people down on the ground, you know, the people working for the contractor, Boeing, and the dedicated people in the mission control center. You've mentioned, I think it was Steve Stich that you had the recording on. I know him very well as I worked with him for many years. These are really dedicated people. So it's not just the troubleshooting on orbit. It's really the folks on the ground doing a lot of the hard work, and thinking, and planning and making sure that everything is going to be okay with the spacecraft so that the crew comes back safely and that the space - they learn enough about the spaceship so that when they launch it again, they feel very confident it's going to work appropriately.",

And, you know, Jonathan Haidt has a new book out called \"The Anxious Generation.\" The Surgeon General of the United States, just on Monday, suggested that social media companies have warnings for kids the way that tobacco products do.So I really do think it's a moment whose time has come. You know, now that it's been over a decade since we've had this student smart phone use, we're starting to see those effects. And I think it's really reached a fever pitch. As soon as the Board of Education passed my resolution in L.A. on Tuesday, about an hour later, the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, announced that he'd like to do it statewide. So I really do think we're kind of reaching this tipping point where everyone is coming out of the woodwork to say, yes, can we finally monitor student cellphone use during the school day?",

I hate to ask - to even have to ask this question, but it is a reality in some of our schools across the U.S. And some parents have said that in an unfortunate time where there's an incident at school, whether it's a school shooting or just another unsafe situation, they might worry that they not - might not be able to locate their child in an emergency if they don't have their phone on them.

You know, it is such a tragic sign in the times that that is where our head goes when it comes to schools and emergencies. And I think we have to do a much better job in this country of gun violence prevention and keeping kids safe.But public safety experts agree that it is actually safer in an emergency, whether that's a lockdown or a school shooting situation, God forbid, for students not to have their phones for a number of reasons. One is a beep or even a vibration can give away the location to an assailant. If every kid is texting their parent and then - and they in turn are calling 911, it can and has overwhelmed the switchboard or overwhelmed the school.   So even though viscerally we all want to be able to check in immediately, it is actually safer if we let adults deal with emergencies, follow school procedures, and make sure kids are safe. And so that is something that will be addressed during implementation. Schools need to make sure that they're communicating better with parents and with the community. But it is in those unfortunate and horrific situations safer for kids actually not to have their cellphones.",

And as part of its implementation, we're going to continue to work with teachers and parents and students to talk about the harmful effects and also about the implementation. And it's my hope that over the course of that process, schools will embrace this.We have some schools in L.A. that are - have already gone phone free during the entire school day. And none of those schools want to go back, including the students. They realize how much more present they are, how much less FOMO, the fear of missing out, they have because they're not texting during class time. And so it's my hope that we actually get to a point where schools embrace this and they realize that putting your phone down for six hours is not the end of the world. If anything, it can let you reconnect with each other and with your teacher. So we will be working, again, on that implementation, whether it's the cellphone pouches or the lockers which I think just trying to spend time and the Surgeon General's warning this week is helpful in convincing parents that this is in their kids' best interest. And maybe by kind of a trickle-up effect, we can also try to monitor adult smart phone use as well over the coming months and years.",
