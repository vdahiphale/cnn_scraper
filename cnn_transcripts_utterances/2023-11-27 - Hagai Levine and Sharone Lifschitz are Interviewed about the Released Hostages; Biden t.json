We want to speak with you. You are now in Israel. And she didn't answer.So, we don't know what kind of passage she had, but we know from her CT scan how poorly she was treated. We know from her blood samples that it's been a long time that she was not with it. And you know some of her medications are rather simple, thyroxine (ph) for thyroid problem.

I met with Sharone Lifschitz, and her mother, Yocheved, and me and the others were very pleased to see Yocheved and others recover. But there are still shades for a long time. And, you know, for all of the released hostages and also for Maya Regev, for example, they have other family members for her, (INAUDIBLE), still in Gaza. So, it's very difficult in terms of, you know, when there is traumatic event, you are in a safe place now, you can recover. The event is over. But for them, the event is not over for all of us. As long as there are still hostages, some of them family members, still there, they could not really recover. And this is something that I don't sleep well at night because of that. And I think that everyone with a heart cannot sleep well at night when there are baby, 10 months old baby (INAUDIBLE) is still in captivity. And there are elderly people who really need their medications and there are people with all kinds of problems and no one deserves to be in the dark for so long without a sign of life.
