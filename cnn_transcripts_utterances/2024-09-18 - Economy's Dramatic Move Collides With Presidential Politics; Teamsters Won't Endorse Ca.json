Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race.(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Did Kamala Harris just get a major economic boost or did Donald Trump just get another reason to criticize her? For the first time since the pandemic, in four years, the Fed have cut interest rates. It's a big, big move, especially if you're trying to make a big, big purchase. And some economists say it shows a soft landing that the United States is finally turning the page on inflation. But there are some others who say it could mean a downturn is on the horizon. Now, as for the candidates, Harris calls it some welcome news. Trump, though, he's saying it's all politically motivated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much. Assuming they're not just playing politics, the economy would be very bad, or they're playing politics, one or the other, but it was a big cut. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's around the time you would have needed to have any sort of effect on the real economy at this point.But more to the point, the Fed is politically independent. They prize their political independence. It is important for them to be seen as above the political fray as not being influenced by the near term political, you know, ups and downs of what's going on in the economy, or excuse me, what's going on in the country in order for their medicine to work, right? If people don't believe that they are politically independent, then they're going to say, well, we don't really believe that they're committed to stable prices, and so, you know, inflation expectations can get unmoored.

But when you look at a lot of things people across the country are struggling with right now, like credit card debt, you know, we're looking at people who maybe have a $1,000 credit card bill when you cut and they have maybe a 20 percent interest rate, we're talking about $0.42 they're saving monthly on their finance charges. This is not that much. So, people economically, I think are still struggling in this country and we're going to need a lot more relief than that to really move the ball.

There are all of these data points that suggest that Democrats are much more aligned or at least willing to be pliable on the preferences of union members, including Teamsters members.

You can go back to Nixon, his relationship with the unions.I just want to say, look, I do not credit the head of the Teamsters talking about how he is representative of the working man, right? It is a euphemism that a lot of unions use to make it sound like if you're not a member of the union, you don't support the union, that union, the Teamsters, just get out of federal receivership for like a quarter of the century because it took them that long to get the mob out of it. Teamsters are historically corrupt goon squad. And like there are other unions that if I were a Democrat, I'd be very proud to have in my corner. The Teamsters aren't necessarily one of them. But regardless, I won't say I disagree with you. I agree with you. There are a lot of voters who don't vote their economic interests anymore. But that is something that is scalable up and down the socioeconomic spectrum, where we have moved from the old definition of what it means to be left, which is to be class conscious of the Bernie Sanders model, and much more in sort of the cultural politics of the sort of the squad model, and that reverberates all over the place, and that's one of the reasons why the white working class is leading the Democratic coalition.",

But that said, I agree with you entirely, that the actual stories of these deaths, whether you're pro-life or pro-choice or somewhere in the middle, are tragic, and they are the inevitable consequence of the changing of the law. So, I agree with that entirely. But some of this is also possibly attributable to the responses to the changing of the law. And so far as in one of these cases, the abortion pill that was taken later than it's supposed to be, because now it is essentially all access thing, which normally would have been done much more closely under a doctor's care.
