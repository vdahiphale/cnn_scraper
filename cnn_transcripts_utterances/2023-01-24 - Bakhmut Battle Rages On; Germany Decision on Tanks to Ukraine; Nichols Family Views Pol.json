They're still interviewing witnesses, he says.He also hopes that this leads to a conversation about reform in the Memphis Police Department. Five officers, all of whom are black, were terminated as the result of their involvement in their arrest, as well as two Memphis fire department personnel who were part of the initial response. The Shelby County district attorney tells me that they are considering charges against these individuals. And if any are leveled against them, they could come later this week.
