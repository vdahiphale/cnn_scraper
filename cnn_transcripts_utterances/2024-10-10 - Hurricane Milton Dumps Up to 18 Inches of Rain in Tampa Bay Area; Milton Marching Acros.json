So we are not done yet. You saw the wind gusts in the measurements we took a minute ago, 83 miles per hour in Daytona Beach. That's substantial.Tampa Bay actually just tweeting something out from their National Weather Service there, Erica. This is a really important point to hammer home to our viewers this morning. There is ongoing flash flooding near Tampa. A lot of downed power lines. You don't know if they're still live. And so getting out into those conditions, it's dark. It's very dangerous to go through flooded streets. My advice don't do it if you're actually riding out this storm there.",

There could be downed power lines.I want to stay on that issue of the flash flooding for just a moment if we could. There's been so much water that has come in. There is the flash flooding issue and then there's also the issue of where does all this water go. And I was speaking with somebody from the Weather Service a short time ago saying that that will be a concern for days to come from some of the rivers surrounding.",

      "sentences": "Well think about it, Eric. So the state of Florida, especially the coastline through the interior, the area that got the heaviest rainfall is very, very low elevation. So these rivers, the creeks, the low line elevations that have the water piling up, we're talking Orlando to Tampa, inland communities as well where that heavy swath of rain actually occurred and is still falling from the sky.That water is working against the surge that came in with this storm on both the west coast and the east coast. So you've got inland flooding trying to drain out of the rivers, trying to drain out of the creeks. And then you've got the inland component or the incoming component from the storm surge and what happens with that type of water working against each other from the inland and from the coast? It has nowhere to go but up. So it's going to take some time for that to drain and to be allowed to drain as well. The storm needs to get well away from the state before we see the surge component die down along the east coast and then when we start to see the water end and then the rivers start to recede.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica, we're still getting the wind, the gusts of wind getting pretty strong but we are getting a short break from the rain. We expect that will return as well. Derek talked about the flooding there in Tampa Bay.I want to go to St. Petersburg and talk to Jonathan Petramala who is a storm chaser who has been of course watching Milton and following Milton. Jonathan, thanks for being with me. Let's just first start with what it's like there now as we're hearing these reports of flooding in Tampa Bay. What are you seeing? JONATHAN PETRAMALA, JOURNALIST AND STORM CHASER (via phone): Hey, good morning. Yes, the flash flooding fortunately has receded and the rain has stopped falling here in St. Petersburg but to just get into St. Petersburg was a challenge. The bridges have been closed now for several hours since early yesterday afternoon and that's the main access, right, to get in from the south or from the east as well. And so we had to go the long way around and it was a maze of flooded streets around Tampa. Really deep water. We had numerous cars stalled out in that deep water as well and unfortunately signs that showed the water getting into some neighborhoods as well. So it wasn't necessarily the storm surge here in Tampa Bay but it was that freshwater flooding and the tides were just high enough, as your meteorologist mentioned, there was just nowhere for the water to go. So it just went up into people's homes and the neighborhoods and on roadways as well. So that added to the challenge of the hurricane for the Tampa Bay area at least. But the brighter side of that again is because the storm did make landfall south of the Tampa Bay area, the catastrophic predictions of storm surge that could reach 15 or 20 feet did not occur here in the area, which is great.",

It was supposed to offer this respite, this place for rest for the first responders as they respond to others who call in for help from Hurricane Milton.We also had the report of the crane that came down in St. Petersburg as well. What do you know about damage beyond these two that we know? Of course the first responders are working to get out as soon as the wind dies down on that coast. I'm sure the wind has died down but what do you know about the damage in neighborhoods in communities beyond downtown?",

      "sentences": "Sorry about that. Yes, you broke up a little bit. I heard you talk about the crane we just had our eyes on that as well. Ironically, it crashed into the Tampa Bay Times building so they broke their own story there unfortunately. Doesn't appear anybody was hurt which is the best part about that.A lot of cranes in St. Petersburg up and about because there's a massive amount of growth now up and that was the only one that appears to have collapsed under the fierce winds of Hurricane Milton. Otherwise what you're looking at in terms of damage, damage to awnings, damage to garages, rooftops, mostly tree damage. That's really what we're seeing as we're driving around St. Petersburg. I actually just pulled up to my house for the first time since the storm when I left yesterday. I didn't really know what I'd be coming home to and it appears my trees are still standing. There's some big branches down but I don't know I don't see any signs of major damage at my house. So it's kind of surreal to be reporting on your neighbors and your community and then also in the back of your mind always is you know what's happening at your place. But you have to just kind of step out of sight and that's why I just kind of I just took a big breath of relief on the phone with you.",

But I'm glad that that your home fared well.And as it relates to the trees down, we've got now more than three million customers across the state. Those trees have taken down power lines those three million customers without power so that of course will be the narrative in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. Jonathan Petramala a storm chaser who is in St. Petersburg bringing us video bringing us reports of damage reporting on his own home and own neighborhood there as well.

They never thought in a million years they would have this kind of water. So now they're in too deep. We need to focus on those people first, getting them the drier land, getting them the medical attention they need, then we'll worry about opening up roadways and some of those ancillary problems that trying to get people back to some type of sense of normalcy.

I can't show you because, you know, it's dark here and we don't obviously have the lights to light the sky, but the clouds are racing across the sky here as this storm is moving east. It's actually quite beautiful here.We on the ground though, we'll see something not so beautiful as we assess the damage and potentially the flooding here. I want to go to Makenna Caskey. She actually saw the crane in St. Petersburg that came down several hours ago, pretty early on in this storm. McKenna, I know it's windy here. I hope you can hear me. If you can tell me, just tell me the story. What did you see? MAKENNA CASKEY, ST. PETERSBURG RESIDENT: Hi, Victor. Yes, I live in an apartment complex about a block over from where the crane fell. I was at home. I decided to shelter in place with my aunt, with my dog. And around, I would say about 10 o'clock at night, we heard a really loud, thunderous metal clanging boom that sounded like a train wreck. And with it came a massive earthquake-style rumbling of the building that we're in. It shook the plates, the furniture, any drinks that we had nearby. It both viscerally startled myself and my aunt. And the first thing that came to mind, per the mayor's warning earlier in the day, were those cranes. We had thought that we were a safe enough distance away that we wouldn't be impacted if they fell. And thankfully, our building was not. And after the winds died down, about an hour later, I was able to go check them out for myself. Through my building's Facebook group page, there was a couple videos floating around from different perspectives of possibly the crane coming down when it was on fire. And then when I was able to, between breaks and the gusts of the wind.",
