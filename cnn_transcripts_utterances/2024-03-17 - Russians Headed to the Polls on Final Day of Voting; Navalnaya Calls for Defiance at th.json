Now, the outcome is expected to be a landslide victory for President Vladimir Putin. He faces no real challenger, partly because many opposition leaders are dead, jailed, exiled, or banned from running. But some average Russians are still fighting back. Prosecutors have opened 15 cases against people who reportedly staged small acts of protest at polling stations. But as Russians vote, the defense ministry says three dozen Ukrainian drones were launched against the country overnight. Moscow says two people are dead, and this refinery in southwestern Russia caught fire.Meanwhile, we're waiting for more possible pushback against the Kremlin at polling stations. Yuliya Navalnaya, the widow of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, urged voters to show up in droves at noon, which is the current time in Moscow. She asked them to do anything they want with their ballots, except vote for Putin. Now, she's hoping the optics would send a message of defiance to the Kremlin. I want to go now to London, where Clare Sebastian is standing by. So, Clare, these acts of defiance, I guess, were slated to start now, so it may be too soon to know what exactly is happening.

We have a template for that with Crimea, where holding elections, getting people to take Russian passports, bringing in Russian institutions, that turns what should be a temporary occupation, certainly in the eyes of Ukraine, into something more permanent and irreversible and allows Russia to consolidate its power in those regions. So Ukraine is trying to get the message to its people not to be part of this. And of course, we are also seeing in the lead up to these elections an increase of Russian -- of Ukrainian or alleged Ukrainian attacks inside Russian soil. We've seen, as you say, some three dozen drones. Russia says that Ukraine fired at it overnight. There's been another attack on an oil refinery. We've seen a spate of attacks on oil refineries in recent weeks as Ukraine tries to bring the war home, both to the sort of the military element of this. We know Russia makes most of its money, of course, from its oil and gas, but also to civilian life as well and getting the message to the Russian people that this war is not something that they are insulated from as they go to vote in these elections, Kim.",

Both Donald Trump and his team believe that he will do very well in this state in November.Instead, he was here to boost his endorsed candidate for the Ohio Senate primary, and that's businessman Bernie Moreno. Moreno is locked in a messy, contested three-way primary, and Donald Trump really came to the state in the hopes of giving him that last-minute boost and more support ahead of that race on Tuesday. But even though Donald Trump was here to talk about the Ohio Senate primary, much of his speech focused on the general election. He attacked Joe Biden and blamed him for what he argued were the many charges that he is facing. And he also offered a new line that I have yet to hear yet on the campaign trail.

But President Biden's campaign was already slamming Trump's comment.In a statement, Biden's campaign spokesperson said Trump, quote, \"wants another January 6, but the American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge.\" Meanwhile, President Biden is courting African American voters, an important Democratic voting base. He recently spoke to the Black Information Network, and that interview will be coming out in the coming hours. Now, it comes as a recent New York Times Siena College poll found that 66% of black voters are leaning towards Biden compared to 23% for Trump. That's a nearly 20% decrease for Biden from 2020 and a near doubling for Trump. A recent Reuters IPSOS poll found that 37% of black voters say they are voting to stop Trump versus 65% of white voters. All right, joining me now is Clifford Albright, co-Founder and Executive Director of Black Votes Matter. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, listen, you can argue with individual polls, but it's hard to question the trend. And that seems to suggest President Biden is bleeding support from the African American community. Now, it's more noticeable with black men particularly, but it is overall as well. What do you think is behind it? CLIFFORD ALBRIGHT, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BLACK VOTES MATTER: Yeah, good morning, thanks for having me. I think, you know, as you said, you know, different polls say different things. You know, there's other polls that are showing, including one that Cornell Belcher recently did that says that, that percentage of those black voters looking to support Trump is closer to 11 or 12%. You know, when we talk about the trends, though, the reality is that at about this point in the election cycle in 2020, Joe Biden's approval ratings or favorability ratings in the black community at that time were close to around 76%. And so he's really at about where he was in 2020. With that said, obviously, you've got, you know, a lot of stories and some anecdotes about black men in particular that are leaning towards Trump. But I just got to say it just doesn't match what we're seeing in the community when we're out doing our work. It's not matching what we're seeing or hearing, and it's not matching the way that black men or black voters in general have been voting in recent election cycles when you look at Georgia or Kentucky or even Ohio in the abortion referendum.",

And that's a significant number of people who've said in recent polls that they would actually vote for Trump, you know, 13%, 17% around those numbers, depending on the poll, which is obviously a lot higher than the 8% he got in 2020. So that means that since then, black voters have looked at Trump, listened to his message and says, yeah, you know, he's -- he's the man for me, despite the many statements he's made that have been widely described as racist against black people.",

Or even saying that in a poll and the way that we actually vote, you know, it is not all that unlikely or unfamiliar that there are people that will say that they're thinking about voting for Trump.But we just don't come out and you can do that. We heard the same thing in Georgia with the 22 Senate race where everybody thought that black men were going to swarm over to vote for Herschel Walker because he is such a popular football hero in Georgia.

So that's part of it.The other part is that people, you know, black voters in particular saying, you know, we've been through that. We've heard that before. We know that he was bad and all that. But a lot of stuff that he tried to do this last term was stopped. I'm not saying that the second term would be the same way by any means, but that's what a lot of black folks, you know, feel like. But what we are more concerned about is the president's policies. And so, so far, the messaging has largely been about Trump and his threats to democracy. But I think that if you look at some of the more recent materials, especially after the State of the Union, where President Biden and his campaign are starting to focus more on those policies, focus more on all these infrastructure projects that Republicans have tried to take credit for, and now doing the same thing that Trump did, which is basically putting his face and name on some of those projects, you know, I think some of the policies are now about to get more messaging. And as you see that happening, then you'll start to see some of the -- some of the favorability and some of the polling starting to shift. But that process is only just now getting started.",

The reality is, I think you just hit on it, right? As you look at the, quote unquote, \"non-white voters of color,\" what's happened more so than Black voters shifting is that the composition of the non-white electorate has changed, where you have more Latino voters and some AAPI, Asian-American voters.But the composition of what that electorate looks like has shifted, and Latino voters are less likely to vote heavily Democratic as Black. So it hasn't been so much that Black voters have been shifting, it's been that there's been a shift in the composition of non-whites. But as you said, Latino voters and Asian-American voters have always voted at a lower percentage than Black voters for Democratic Party, not at 90%, but maybe it's like 75% or 70%. And so that shift is changing the total numbers. But if you look at it over the past 30 years, the Black vote has really been remarkably consistent, always somewhere between 88% and, of course, the Obama highs of like 96%.",

You know, we have Republicans who control the Pennsylvania Senate, you know, saying, well, you know, we're in the midst of an opioid crisis. We don't want to add another drug. Some shamelessly resort to -- to the gateway myth or the gateway drug myth, saying if we legalize marijuana, then we're going to exacerbate the opioid crisis.And it really just doesn't hold water anymore. And I think that Republican legislators are coming around more and more as they realize this is not a political liability. And they hear from their constituents that say this doesn't make sense. We would like to see the jobs in our neighborhoods and our communities that are being created by this -- by this growing industry.

That's the fourth ranked team in the country, 84-76 for their first ACC title since 1987. The Wolfpack also grabbing an automatic NCAA bid.
