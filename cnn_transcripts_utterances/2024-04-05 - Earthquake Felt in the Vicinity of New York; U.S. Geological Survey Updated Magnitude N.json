But if you talk to people in the New York City area, you see that there are people who are describing what they felt as tremors in just the last several minutes. Elisa Raffa is in the CNN Weather Center. And Elisa 4.8 magnitude earthquake, that is -- I mean, that's enough for folks to feel it. What can you tell us?",

It was significant enough for there to be cracks in the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral, and it caused a huge mess. It was extremely rare. I have to assume -- and maybe this is an area where I'm going to get something wrong on live TV, are we along the same fault line?
