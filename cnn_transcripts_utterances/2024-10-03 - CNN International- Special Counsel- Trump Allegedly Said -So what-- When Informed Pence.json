A no power, all running water U.S. officials say Hurricane Helene's recovery and cleanup could take months. Well, Israel's UN Ambassador says retaliation for Tehran's missile attack will come soon and be very strong. U.S. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, is urging Israel to make sure its response is proportional this as Israel bombs the Lebanese capital. Live pictures here, plumes of smoke in the sky after Israel struck the heart of Beirut, that was for the first time in nearly two decades. At least nine people were killed, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Israel is also issuing evacuation orders for another 25 villages in Southern Lebanon, signaling a broadening of its ground incursion. The Lebanese Foreign Minister made some rather startling remarks about that temporary ceasefire called for by President Biden and others. Abdallah Bou Habib says Hezbollah's Leader had agreed to the 21 days pause in the fighting just days before he was killed by Israel. Listen to what he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

As you said a few minutes ago, the Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations said it will be a strong and painful response.He has said, and is saying, what other officials, the prime minister, the minister of defense here, have all said, is that Iran knows that Israel's reach is long. It can reach its enemies and targets across the whole of the Middle East, so the signaling is there. And I think if you talk to people in Israel with a military background when they're trying to calculate what their enemies are going to do next in response, their assessment is always, well, the sort of -- the bigger the gap as you sort of wait for a response. Therefore, the stronger, more sophisticated, more complicated, the response may be. So I think that's the assessment at the moment, that all the planning and discussions that are going on right now about what may or may not be the targets, could it just be Iran's commercial interests, oil facilities, for example, that are on the coast of Iran, that would be in relative terms, relatively easy to strike compared to trying to reach deep inside Iran, overfly their territory, risk surface to air missiles, et cetera, that Israel might just consider economic targets, such as oil facilities. It really isn't clear, strong and painful, speaks to Israel's desire to have a deterrence and maintain the sort of visibility in the region of maximum deterrence. This isn't just a message to Iran. It's a message to Israel's other enemies as well. But precisely what the targets are going to be, I think perhaps the best understanding is that one that the military would apply that the longer the planning, therefore the more sophisticated, complex and potentially wide ranging the strike could be.",

But we had been moving toward this point for a while. But I do want to be very clear. I know I said this before.But the migrants living in Springfield are here legally in 2023. We know that the Biden Administration had created new pathways and new status for several nationalities, that included the Haitian migrants who are living here, given them parole status. Had vetted them. And many of these migrants living in Springfield said they chose to live there because one the city and the county overall has a relatively low cost of living, but also, they knew that they could find work here. We have heard from several local officials on the ground, including many Republican officials, that these people, these migrants, are there to just work hard and are trying to live their lives. And so, this has really disrupted that entire community. But to go back to the politics on this -- you know, again, this is an issue where Republicans and Donald Trump specifically believes that it's a good talking point for them ahead of November, particularly in communities where they have seen really a spike in immigration. Have seen a surge in immigrants in their communities, and they think that this is something that will resonate with many American voters. But again, there's no truth to the claims that they are in here legally, and this is a very controversial statement from Donald Trump.",

This is part of their broader strategy to show that they can appeal to a broad swath of voters and attempt to move those undecided voters away from former President Donald Trump.Now, Liz Cheney did endorse the vice president last month when she was in North Carolina. And this is going to mark the first time that the two will be campaigning together since that endorsement. And it is also notable where they're going to be. They're going to be in Ripon, Wisconsin, which is the birthplace of the Republican Party. So clearly the signal here is that the vice president wants to and believes she can appeal to Republicans. Remember that during the Democratic National Convention, there was a whole part of that program dedicated to Republican endorsements behind the vice president. Now I will also note that campaign says that what she's going to say is very focused on her commitment, the vice president's commitment to uphold the rule of law, to uphold the Constitution, and that it should be country over party. She'll also nod to something that Liz Cheney has said before, that she does have policy differences with the vice president. But the Former President Donald Trump poses such a risk that she believes it is better, in this case, to put her vote behind Vice President Kamala Harris. Also, notable that this comes on the heels of that special counsel filing yesterday over the subversion of the 2020 election, because Liz Cheney has been such a vocal voice about January 6th as well, in her opposition to the former president within that context. So, this will certainly be an interesting campaign event to monitor. And it will happen as I mentioned at the birthplace of the Republican Party within the State of Wisconsin, which is a battleground state, it's one where the vice president holds a slight edge over Former President Donald Trump. Polls show 49 percent for Harris versus 46 percent for Trump. So still very close. The Vice President trying to keep that edge and gain some ground again by doing this visit and more of this is going to happen over the next several weeks. We anticipate, according to the campaign, that she will be doing much of the same type of event appealing to Republican voters in the battleground States of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, among others. So certainly, this is the clearest indication of the beginnings of this strategy, and something that they will be doubling down on in the home stretch of this election Max.",

I mean, its top leadership has been killed, including Hassan Nasrallah, the towering, charismatic leader who built, who turned Hezbollah from really a small organization into one of the most important non state actors.The explosions, the communications Israel seems to have infiltrated the communication systems of Hezbollah, its command and control. But Hezbollah is not a spent force. Hezbollah is not dead, and I think many Israeli policy makers and analysts are celebrating the defeat of Hezbollah. The war has not started from Hezbollah's point of view, as Israel discovered yesterday, the first incursion, Israeli incursion in Lebanon was a disaster for Israel. Almost 50 Israeli soldiers and officers were killed and injured. Israel has tens of thousands of very skilled and hardened fighters. Once Israel really tries to move militarily in terms of ground, Israel will discover that Lebanon is a minefield, that Lebanon is not really a picnic. And I'm not -- I'm not just saying it for the sake of it, but the days ahead will show that even though it has basically killed a lot of Hezbollah leaders. The organization still very much intact. Most of them are they have been there for decades. So, you can imagine, they know the terrain. It's their homes, it's their villages, it's their alleyways, it's their valleys and mountains. So really, we're talking about a long, long war. And sadly Max, I don't think Israel has learned the lessons of its wars in 1980s or 1990s and 2006. Just final point on your question, even the United States of America, the most powerful nation in the world, could not defeat a committed insurgency in Afghanistan and Iraq. You cannot really defeat committed insurgencies. It doesn't matter how much firepower you have from the air. And the reality is, Hezbollah will use a symmetrical warfare to really get Israel bogged down in Lebanon's killing field, as it did in the 1990s and in 2006.",

According to Hezbollah leaders, Hezbollah has been able to replace the killed officers and commanders.And that's why you're seeing really a more agile, a nimbler, a more active Hezbollah in the past few days and its media, basically communication person took the media, including CNN, on a tour of the Dahieh, the Southern Lebanon. So, what Israel -- Southern Beirut. So, what Israel did today is to really destroy the communication center? But most of the communications people and the Hezbollah office had left. They were preparing for this. But it tells you a great deal that Israel is chasing a moving target. It's hitting everyone. I mean, hundreds of attacks every day. It's carpet bombing because they control the skies. But the reality is a lot of people have been killed, a lot of civilians yesterday, Max, according to Lebanese Health Authority, Israel attacked in West, in the heart of West Beirut, a medical center and killed seven medical workers, including an injured, you know, dozens. Israel said it was a targeted attack. Today, Joseph Borrell, the Head of the European Union Foreign Policy, basically wrote a -- on his acts on communication said the attack on the medical center in Beirut violate international humanitarian law, which is a war crime. But well, you know, I'm sorry to basically reiterate and say commonsensical points. Israel has devastated the medical I mean, sector in Gaza hospitals, medical workers. And I think what we're seeing now, really, Max, is a similar pattern. Israel is targeting the medical centers, medical workers, civilians, in order to terrorize the civilian community and the international community. Now, I mean, what's different about Gaza and Lebanon in Beirut now you have tons of media, international media, including the CNN. So, they are bringing the making the international community aware of what the air bombings is doing to the civilians and the medical communities throughout Lebanon, not just Southern Lebanon.",

And you know, a lot of people here see some parallels to Gaza. Lebanon is not Gaza yet, but a lot of people fear that you could see a repeat of that here. I mean, when you look at the sheer numbers of civilians who have been impacted by this unfolding war. In a matter of days, Max, more than 1000 people are killed, many of them are women and children. When you look at the number of people who have been forced out of their homes.
