That he -- we understand that had very clear boundaries of how far he could go and what he could agree to. So he has left and we understand the technical teams have now picked up and they're finessing the details if you like. So what we've heard from the spokesperson here in Doha for the Foreign Ministry is that he is cautiously optimistic. The fact that these talks have resumed makes him cautiously optimistic, and they are expecting some kind of counter proposal to be able to take to Hamas. But he says it's too early to claim any kind of success. So really, this -- this does seem to be just another step in trying to secure that desperately needed ceasefire. Now, this would be a counterproposal to what we heard from Hamas just last Thursday, when they gave their details of what they wanted to see, according to officials and sources. We understand they want between 700 and 1000 Palestinian prisoners to be released, and in return, they would release the female hostages, including IDF soldiers, and the elderly, the sick and the wounded, assumed to be around 40 hostages. This would all be within we understand a six week temporary ceasefire. And the hope is that that can be agreed to and if this ceasefire is agreed to most notably, it can allow more humanitarian aid in which was beyond desperately needed. But it also gives all parties some space to be able to talk about the next steps because this was always going to be a deal that had multiple phases.

This is basically the aftermath of a war zone. Driving through the battlegrounds between gangs and police we dodged massive craters and piles of burning trash. The police controlled these roads leading to Haiti's International Airport for today at least. It's been shut for weeks. Out front checkpoints to search for suspected gang members and an armored truck to keep watch it sits beaten and battered. Less than a month ago we flew in and out on commercial flights here. Now it's desolate. The country is in chaos, essentially held hostage by gangs eager to expand their reign of terror. Over the weekend more businesses looted and car stolen, gangs leaving behind a scorched path of ruin.

And it's just not clear they're going to be able to move quickly enough here in the House and in the Senate to process this bill and avert a shutdown all together, it's very possible they could stumble into one just because of how long this process takes to play out on the floor. Once they have text finalized, they will release it to their members. The House has what is known as a three day rule. That means members get three days to review text of legislation before being expected to vote on it. Once that happens as early as Thursday or Friday, then the Senate will move. But it's important to note that any one Senator can really use delay tactics to make this process run beyond the clock of Friday's midnight deadline.

Navarro will begin a four month sentence after failing to win a last minute reprieve from the Supreme Court. CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is in Washington for us. Katelyn have we had a response from Navarro's team and tell us more about the extent to which the Supreme Court decision was expected? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Navarro's team is saying that this is very unfair, it's a violation of separation of powers because he was a Trump White House official at the end of the administration, that time period, where the how -- U.S. House of Representatives sought documents and testimony about. Now they wanted him to give information that he was speaking publicly about writing a memoir about related to the January 6th attack and the 2020 election things he was doing on behalf of Donald Trump the candidate, not Donald Trump, the President. But in this situation Navarro's team was trying and failing repeatedly in the court to get any traction of this separation of powers argument that he was making. The courts just said no, he didn't have any evidence. And he missed his chances to try and claim executive privilege saying that there should have been a bubble around him because of his role in the administration. So that's all the technical details of what's going on here. But this is a big, important moment for Congress in that they issued a subpoena to Peter Navarro. He failed to turn over records. He failed to provide any testimony to show up for an interview. And so Congress sent it to the Justice Department for prosecution. That prosecution was successful. And now Peter Navarro is going to prison because of his conviction by a jury in Washington D.C. last year. He is being sent to prison for four months. He'll serve a little under that amount of time very likely. He is going to be in prison in Miami at a federal institution that is a minimum security camp type setup. And he will be on the inside having to acclimate to this situation that is very -- it is a prison. It is not nothing -- it is not something to sneeze at.

Generally, the side effects are tolerability issues, nausea, vomiting, things like that. And that can be really difficult for a lot of people.

They are rare, but they can happen. So that's why doctors emphasize you had to take these with medical supervision. They are powerful medicines. Another big issue with them, of course, is that they are so expensive. They can cost $1,000 per month before insurance depending on which one you're taking. There you can see the four newest ones in this class two are for Type-2 diabetes, two are for weight loss.
