Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. On this World Refugee Day, we are more acutely aware more than ever of the risks people are forced to take in search of a better life. A life beyond war, persecution, climate change and poverty. The U.N. estimates that today, 110 million people are displaced worldwide, more than at any other time since the Second World War. Right now, hundreds of migrants are still missing after their overcrowded fishing vessel capsized off the Greek coast. The E.U. says it may be the worst tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea has ever had. As families wait for news of their missing loved ones, the Greek coast guard and the Greek government are under intense pressure. And a court case is underway in Athens where nine men are accused of people smuggling. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is here in London, where he and his British counterpart, James Cleverly, have been at the center which is set up to help Ukrainian refugees who fled Russia's invasion. David Miliband is a CEO of the International Rescue Committee. He was British foreign secretary from 2007 to '10. And he's also the son of Jewish refugees. David Miliband, thank you for joining us.",

Secondly, the asylum processing system across Europe is a patchwork at the moment. The U.K. government is trying to make -- even claiming asylum illegal. So, on the asylum front, you've also got this situation. Thirdly, the aid and support for countries that are hosting refugees, countries in North Africa, countries in the Middle East, countries like Jordan and Lebanon, that is haphazard and insufficient. So, you've got the absence of safe and effective legal pathways for people to register their claims. The loss of hope is what makes people think the only way to save my own life or to save the life of my kids is to put my future in the hands of the people smugglers.

Your statement, along with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others have said, the E.U. should abandon the narrative of blaming shipwrecks on smugglers and stop seeing solutions solely in the dismantling of criminal networks. I mean, again, what is going to make them do it? And I say this and I ask it because it was just a few years ago, if you remember, E.U. commissioners, Italian prime ministers and others would rush to the -- you know, to the tragedy area, they'd express their sympathies and their sadness.

And she's been trying to get this pact agreed. Now, she's made some progress, but we are still a long way from having a coherent Europe-wide approach that will offer the safe and legal pathways that give people the sense of hope and then reduces the incentive to put themselves in the hands of the people smugglers. Obviously, the U.S. version of this is a real one too, because we've had the Trump years where there was an effective ban on all forms of refugee status. And that -- what happened then? Well, south of the border, you actually had chaos. That's why I write that cruelty leads to chaos. Because while the policies that say, we're going to seal the border are rhetoric and are sometimes translated into policy, they don't actually bring order. They don't actually end the chaos because of these actors, the smuggling opportunity that's created when there aren't these legal routes to give people a chance to start a new life.",

The International Rescue Committee, my organization, were trying to help people there. So, let's not give up on diplomacy. Secondly, we've got to have fair burden sharing around the world. Responsibility sharing. If only a few countries do this it's not going to work. There is no refugee resettlement scheme in the Gulf. China is not part of this system. There's got to be a proper global system. Because we've got a global right to refugee status, but not global contribution.

I don't know the capabilities of the submersible. I mean, it's a private surmountable, it's not built by any government. So, I don't know the communications capabilities that's resident in the submersible, what emergency capabilities it has. The fact that it hasn't surfaced on its own is indicative of a problem. Surely the folks that are in the submersible, that are in charge of it, know that there is a problem. And as far as finding it, I mean, it's -- to me, it's obviously in the location and the proximity of the Titanic. So, people know roughly where it is.

And obviously, this comes on the heels of Secretary Blinken who canceled his visit when the balloon incident occurred here. So, in that regard, I think it's positive. I didn't expect a whole lot of specifics to come out of this visit. And certainly, there will be some behind the scenes. I actually think the fentanyl issue is a huge issue and a very positive thing. We really need to work together on that, as an example.

The other is, I mean, the report very strongly supports on maintaining the One China policy, which is supporting peaceful reunification. And that's really critical as well.

I think the U.S. has tremendous leverage in great part because of the economic relationship that we have, you know, with China in terms of producing an outcome which would be peaceful in the long run. It's a very - - it's not totally in intractable problem, but the leaders, President Xi and President Biden, have to lead this. And it's getting tougher and tougher to solve. So, the first step that Secretary Blinken took and that President Xi took in the last day or so, I think, is really critical. And hopefully, that will lead to a meeting of the minds between Biden and Xi later on this year. I think it's in November, for the APEC Summit, which is in San Francisco I think in November.

Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has usedthe word de-risking, and that is translated and traveled across the Atlantic, and that's what the Biden administration are talking about right now, regarding China, and maybe any other, you know, threatening political, I don't know, challenges they face, that it's de-risking rather than decoupling. At the World Trade Organization, how do even define that difference? What does it mean? OKONJO-IWEALA:  Well, the way we look at it, Christiane, is we welcome the de-risking rather than the decoupling, because the decoupling and fragmentation will be very costly for the world. We've actually calculated a 5 percent loss in real global GDP in the long-term. So, de-risking it means, to us, that some supply chains are too concentrated. And what we saw during the pandemic that 10 countries produced 80 percent of the world's vaccines, this does not build global resilience. So, there is some argument to be made that if you want to de- risk, you may want to make sure that those supply chains are more diversified. There's also the same thing with the rare earth minerals. There's the same thing with chips. So, there are some sectors and some supply chain, you really need to diversify the supply chains all over the world or for more countries, I would say, in order to build resilience. But let me just say that in addition to the word de-risking, we want to put another word out that we've been talking about, re-globalization. And that is very much another way to interpret de-risking. When you are diversifying supply chains, it shouldn't only be to nearby countries or to friends, it shouldn't be just China plus one China plus Vietnam or Indonesia or India, although we like those, it should also be China plus Morocco. China plus Brazil. China plus Bangladesh. China plus Senegal and -- or Kenya or Rwanda. We need to think more broadly when we diversify supply chains.

You need to find a way to create new jobs. And why don't we diversify supply chains to those areas? There are countries that did not benefit in the first phase of globalization.

How else are you going to spread those technologies? So, we think that the open multilateral trading system is central to helping solve the problems of the global commons we face today.",

I mean, I think that number right there is probably going to be a shock to a lot of people. So, what gave you this interesting idea?

I'm from the Swinomishand Tulalip tribes where I am coming to you from today here in (INAUDIBLE) Country. And, yes. So, I am the creator of \"Project 562,\" which stands for a number of tribes, when I started the project, there are now 574. So, you know, that number is contentious and always changing based on the plenary power of Congress. So, yes. I, in a massive effort and undertaking into taking in 2012, left my home and my family and sold everything and hit the road to visit over 500 tribes in what is now known as the United States. And I traveled for eight years. And my big girl. That's my RV. She likes to back it up. And, yes, we had a great adventure. I went to over 400 different travel communities. And I -- you know, from the Bering Sea all the way to seminal country, to what is now known as Florida. I went to every state.

But we've erased these tales the of native women and of native people in general, and we've created this American historical amnesia that celebrates notions like Thanksgiving, which we do every year. Instead of telling the real history of what happened in this country, the story of indigenous dispossession of land, of stolen labor, you know, from enslaved people from Africa and instead, we've told a story that completely dilutes the horrible reality of genocide. Over 80 percent of college kids believe that Native Americans are extinct. And the extinction narrative has been re-told over and over and over and over again, right? There's over 10 million native people in what is now known as the United States. You know, we've done things like -- we've been a part of the growth of this nation. We've contributed to the collective consciousness in more ways than I can count.

Another told me about when she was in the military and she was raped and she came home and she had a child born of rape. And, you know, like what was treated unfairly by both the military and by her community because of that, what had happened with that child. I spent a number of months hearing stories from indigenous women who had been violated, who were -- in those stories, were taken to Congress when there was an effort to reform the Violence Against Women Act. And so, this is what we know to be true. Three out of four native women experience sexual assault or domestic violence in their lifetime, you know, that is an outrageous egregious number. You know, we have thousands of women that go missing every year. And it should be a public health emergency, a public health crisis, you know? But native women's bodies have been disregarded.

And so, you know, we are, in many ways, facing an epidemic of hopelessness with our young people. And so, we need positive representation.

When he went back home, he decided that he wanted to go to college. And he went to his parents and he told them, like, you know, I heard they are letting native people into college in Arizona. Of course, this was before schools were integrated and before native people were allowed into college. And he had heard they were allowing that kind of continued education in Arizona. And so, he asked them if he could go to college. And his parents were like, no, you're going to stay here, you're going to be a rancher. And so, when they went to town to get some feed, he wrote them a note, he said, I'm going to college. I'll be back in four years. And he proceeded to walk like over 1,000 miles from Omaha, Nebraska, to Phoenix, Arizona. When he arrived, he didn't have any money. So, he went to that school. He offered them tobacco. He said, I don't have money, I don't have transcripts, but I swear to God, if you let me in, I'll pay back every red cent. You know, and they let him in. He proceeded to graduate and eventually go on to theology school and then, eventually law school. And then, you know, he worked during the civil rights movement to open the first American Indian center in the country in Phoenix, Arizona at a time when it was very dangerous to be a native person, when we need public -- we needed public spaces. And Leon championed those public spaces in a lot of ways.

You know, pre-colonization, our communities celebrated several two-spirit, three-spirit or four-spirit genders. We didn't just have two genders in many of our societies. Many of our languages were not gendered. Many of our languages were defined by spirit, like Anishinaabe, the language is defined by what has a spirit and what does not, for instance. So, like the entire world view is fundamentally different, right? But many two-spirit people in our societies held special roles in our communities, both power holding roles, politically and also spiritually and also familiarly. It wasn't quite as taboo or controversial, as it is in western society or in western religious belief systems. We had a different belies about two-spirit people. Of course, colonization changed that.
