Republican lawmakers say their party's steering committee is meeting today to decide which Republican members will sit on the most powerful committees in the House of Representatives. And it is giving us all new insights into the deal set now Speaker Kevin McCarthy may have made with his hard-line opponents to get their votes and secure the gavel, as four of the previous holdouts who voted against McCarthy on valid after ballot, today's scored committed committee seats. Also on Capitol Hill today, the new leader of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee is setting his sights on bank accounts of members of the Biden family accused of cashing in on their last name. We'll have more on that in just a moment. We're going to start with CNN's chief congressional correspondent, Manu Raju, who has a closer look in McCarthy's strategy as he chooses which Republicans to reward. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  House Republicans behind the scenes crafting their strategy for the next two years. And working to implement the deals Kevin McCarthy had to cut to win the speakership. To win over his holdouts, McCarthy agreed to name more members of the hard rate freedom caucus to serve on the most powerful committees in the House, giving them more sway to shape their party's agenda, including two who flipped the GOP leader, Andrew Clyde, and Michael Cloud, to serve on the committee that funds the government.

Now that that has been completed, Lausch has briefed the attorney general and the leadership of the DOJ.And so now, the attorney general has to the side what are the next steps.

And so, the White House is working to draw that distinction. But it is not up to them if they have a special counsel, it is up to the attorney general and you can already see he is trying to make clear that this is not political by putting the U.S. attorney appointed by Trump in charge of this review.

This is second new leader for Putin's war in just three months. A move so significant, former U.S. national security advisor John Bolton tells me it would be as if we moved the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, to the job. The move comes as a major battle is underway for the town of Soledar, in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces claim Russia is close to capturing the town. Those claims by Russia are false. But as CNN's Ben Wedeman reports for Ukraine is struggling in this fight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Medics load a wounded soldier onto an ambulance, another casualty from the embattled town of Soledar. It varies depending on the number of casualties on the front lines. Russian forces, mostly troops from the Wagner group, the private military company, claim to have control of the entire Soledar territory. The battle for Soledar may be in its final stages, and it doesn't appear to be going well for the Ukrainians. And if indeed the Russians do emerge victorious, the villages around it may be the next to fall. Ukraine's helicopters still flying sorties, its forces aren't giving ground easily. One soldier says it's difficult but we're hanging in there. Despite the fighting, Irina is staying put with her pigs and cows in her home in a nearby village. We won't leave, she says. You can only die once. I will not abandon my house. Her 81-year-old mother Ludmila has lived here for more than 40 years. We had a good life here, she says. Sergei Goskov (ph), head of the Soledar military administration. I'm delivering aid, he says, and reminding people they need to evacuate before it's too late. Svitlana says she will heed his call. Everyone is tired, she tells me. We can't take it any longer. As Soledar burns, there is little time to waste. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And the picture that is emerging from inside Soledar is one of a Ukrainian army desperately struggling to keep its positions. Now, as we were leaving that area, we did see Ukrainian forces -- rather Ukrainian reinforcements coming in. It wasn't clear if they were preparing for a counterattack or to cover a retreat -- Jake.",
