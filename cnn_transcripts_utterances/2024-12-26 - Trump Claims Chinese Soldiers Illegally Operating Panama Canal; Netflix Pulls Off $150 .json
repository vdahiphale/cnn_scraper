Over years, there was this gentleman's agreement, if you will, between the NFL and the NBA. And then they just reversed course. The NFL is a Goliath. It will always supersede, at least in my opinion now, the ratings of the NBA. And if you're telling me there's $150 million the NFL received from the Netflix to have two games and they can get those ratings, do you think they're going to leave that money on the table?

I know that people have heard about this. The NBA ratings are low. But the reason the NBA ratings are low is because we need more characters. We need more superstars. We have our big superstars leaving us, our LeBron's of the world, our Stephs. They're not leaving, but they are no longer as box office as they used to be. And so that's why you find people are turning to different outlets, whether it be WNBA, NFL Now on Christmas Day. And so we needed these Christmas Day games with more attention than usual during the regular season so that people could pay attention and say, I'm interested. Who is this Austin Reeves kid who all of a sudden out of nowhere was the game-saver against the Golden State Warriors? Like, those kind of storylines we need.
