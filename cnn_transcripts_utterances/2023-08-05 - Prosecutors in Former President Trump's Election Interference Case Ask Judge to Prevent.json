I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with a new deadline for Donald Trump's lawyers after the historic indictment against him on 2020 election interference. Now the Trump team has until Monday, 5:00 p.m. eastern, to respond to a request for a protective order by Special Counsel Jack Smith. In a court filing last night, Special Counsel Jack Smith sought to stop defense lawyers from sharing with Trump copies of evidence deemed sensitive. Smith wrote \"If Trump,\" quoting now, \"were to begin issuing public posts using details or, for example, grand jury transcripts obtained in discovery here, it could have a harmful, chilling effect on witnesses or adversely affect the fair administration of justice in this case,\" end quote. And Smith flagged Trump's online post Friday as an example of Trump's habit of speaking publicly. It says, these are Trump's words, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" A Trump spokesperson said the comment was the definition of political speech and had nothing to do with the case. Let's turn now to CNN's Alayna Treene in Columbia, South Carolina, where Trump will be speaking later on today. Alayna, what are you expecting to hear, what is everyone expecting to hear possibly from the former president?",

We heard him do that last night in his remarks in Alabama, and I expect him to do that again tonight here in South Carolina. And also, like last night, Donald Trump will be speaking to be a receptive crowd. He'll be speaking to South Carolina Republicans. And I think you can anticipate for him to frame these charges as election interference, the same playbook we've seen him use time and time again when talking about his legal troubles. He's also likely going to argue that he's been targeted because he's doing so well in the polls. He mentioned that during his speech last night. Let's take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Every time they file an indictment, we go way up in the polls. We need one more indictment to close out this election.

We've got stuff possibly, probably coming up in Georgia in the next couple of weeks. So Republicans have a lot to think about because there's polling out there that indicates if he were to be convicted of a felony, a whole bunch of people just simply wouldn't be able to vote for him.

If anything, it's helping him. He has managed to portray himself as this Christlike political figure that's sacrificing on behalf of everybody else and taking the hits for everybody else. They're coming after me so that they don't come after you. And it seems to be resonating with the Republican base. And it has led to increased fundraising. Even though people have heard that the fundraising he's doing is going towards paying legal bills, they're still donating.

The DEA told CNN they have eyes on some of the most sophisticated money launderers for the cartels. We talked to multiple agencies about this ongoing surge, and they have the tools that they think they need to be able to trace the payments, but intercepting them, seizing them, and disrupting the very lucrative trade is another story, Fred. So it's very much an ongoing push to try to understand how this money's moving across borders. You mentioned the Chinese chemical suppliers. They are feeling this crisis as well. China has cracked down on the sale of fentanyl, wholesale of fentanyl.

It's so great when we get to talk about these uplifting moments in sport. And Simone Biles has been so transparent about her journeys.

Hard to believe another Olympics is coming so quickly because, of course, it was only two years in Tokyo because of the pandemic pushing the Tokyo games to 2021. And so only a three-year break between Olympics. Any athlete would say instead of four years, sure, why not. Keep going. And for Simone though, what she's done that is so different and, of course, also so necessary for her, she took a break. She got married. She has been living her life. She is having a great time, obviously. She shows up on her social media accounts, and the fans are there, as you've heard in the Chicago suburbs. They're there waiting for her. And it makes perfect sense to me covering all these Olympics as I have, that these athletes -- she's still, my goodness. She watered down her program to come back after the troubles with the twisties. Watered down the program at the Tokyo Olympics, Fred, as you'll recall, and she still won a bronze medal even with all the issues she was dealing with. That's how good she is. She knows it. And she wants to see where she is now on the road to the Paris Olympics.",

We handled the pressure. Social media has added such an incredible and awful spotlight in some ways to these athletes.And so yes, they're taking over their entire lives. It's not just the physical part where they are achieving at great levels, some of the greatest of all time, but also every other part, including their mental health. And they feel that they can do that, and it's a wonderful message from role models. We heard from the mom saying she wants to tell her girls the same thing, take that break and reset.

Now before the reenactment took place, nine members of Congress made up of Democrats and Republicans toured the 1200 building with some of the family members. They got a look at the three floors where 17 students and staff members were killed and 17 others were hurt in 2018. We're told that the building remains exactly the same as the day of the shooting. Now, after the tour, the lawmakers met with the families to discuss school safety legislation and increasing funding for mental health services and school resource officers. Here now is south Florida Congressman Jared Moskowitz, a graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas here in Parkland, Florida. REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ, (D-FL): There's nothing more powerful than visualizing what happened in that building. And I'm hoping that it breaks the walls down and we figure out where we can mitigate this from happening, not just in schools, but in communities, with an understanding that there's still going to be disagreements and there's still going to be things that I want done that they won't do, and there's things that they want done that I won't do.
