Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy joins us live, an exclusive interview on the fallout from this week and the infighting plaguing the GOP. INSIDE POLITICS, the best reporting from inside the corridors of power, starts now. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. Thanks for joining us for INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. With just five months until Election Day, one of the major parties' nominees is now a convicted felon, potentially facing prison time. But how much will that actually matter to swing voters in November? Now one thing is clear, Donald Trump's base is all fired up and many GOP lawmakers are falling in line. Trump racked up tens of millions of dollars in donations after that New York jury of 12 Americans convicted him on all 34 felony counts in his hush money criminal trial. But one thing we do not know for sure this morning is whether it might influence undecided voters, especially on the margins, in those key battleground states where the outcome could be razor thin. Now, new polling, taken shortly after the verdict came out shows the Biden-Trump rematch actually remains neck and neck, with no clear leader. And last night, Trump was spotted in an ultimate fighting championship about in New Jersey but he stayed off the campaign trail this weekend. Although he did speak with Fox News in an interview that aired this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Good morning, everybody. It's been busy, especially for you. You've been working nonstop, so its great for you to be here to break down what's happening in this trial? You know, Trump in that same interview was asked about whether or not he would take this to the Supreme Court directly, didn't quite answer about that, but this is all the political calendar the legal calendar is all converging CNN debate is on June 27th, then there's a Trump sentencing on July 11th. That is just four days before the Republican National Convention. You talked to them legal team all the time, Paula.

I mean throughout the course of this trial, certainly, the 2024 race was a factor, but you never heard Todd Blanche mentioned it in court? Yes, he mentioned it in litigation about moving the trial. And, of course, in the gag order litigation.But inside that courtroom, the 2024 race was not a factor. Now, going forward through the appeals and sentencing, it is the factor, because some of his political advisers believed that having this sentencing just a few days before the convention is ideal to help continue to frame him as a martyr, but his legal team is going to be bogged down, dealing with the classified documents case and a big hearing on that in late June. So it's unclear right now if they're going to move to try to postpone that July 11th sentencing.",

Fourteen percent of Republicans say they wouldn't vote for Trump with the conviction. There were 58 percent of independents, of course, that's going to be the key number to watch come November. There was a shift though, among Republicans pretrial versus post- trial, 24 percent before the trial. So they would now have over dropping his convicted. That's down for just 14 percent now.

How could we have a president in the United States who does this?Then Trump does exactly the unthinkable thing and they find ways, at least millions of them do so to rationalize and justify. So I'm not surprised that those numbers have gone down. The question is, even if there's 1, or 2, or 3 percent of Republicans for whom the label of convicted felon is absolutely unacceptable -- remember, we're talking about such a close election here that it really matters only in a few key battleground states. So, it's not going to be 17 percent of Republicans who abandoned Donald Trump.

But there's a real debate within the Democratic Party about how far to go, whether to embraces what are the campaign on the fact that they are running against a convicted felon. Just a good debate among some key people in the Democratic Party, Doug Jones, a former senator, telling political, I don't think there's anything to lose and a lot to gain because I'm convinced as a swath of people out there who are going to be very troubled at this point and haven't really completely founded, wondering about it, all of a sudden, this is a game changer, suggesting that perhaps they should embrace it.

And so, they need to make it part of this larger question of democracy, and Trump's position on abortion and some of these other issues that they are trying to drive leading into that first debate.

And I suspect we'll eventually here from the campaign or hear more from the campaign, the two words that were all discussing, which is convicted felon, how much will they lean into that? But the other part that could be true is that the president can continue to do what he did on Friday, which is talk about Trump's reaction. He's not actually getting into the weeds of the trial. He's not actually making a judgment on the case. He's talking about how the president is reacting. I think one way to look at this is how Biden is thinking about it in terms of -- when they talk about the case, they talk about, oh, this is really about democracy in influence. This wasn't just a hush money case, and that's the main point that you want. You're going to hear from the Biden campaign is that this isn't hush money. This is about democracy.

You know, the people who are just getting their news from social media at this point have very different political views it turns out, than the rest of America.But I think I'm watching whether and how the idea of a conviction does break through. There are certainly anecdotal evidence to suggest that people obviously were not watching this on TV. It wasn't on TV, but that this idea of the conviction did break through. But just one important point it seems to me is that its not just, well, how's Biden doing? How's the Trump people doing reacting to this? It's like the escalation and the radicalization that we've seen this week, it is a historic moment to have a former president in the United States convicted and then the response which has been something different, a full-out attack on the legal system itself. That's different than what we've seen even in 2016 and 2020 from Trump and his supporters.",

My panel's back with me now. What's interesting is that there are though these vulnerable Republicans, some of them are not saying a word about it.
