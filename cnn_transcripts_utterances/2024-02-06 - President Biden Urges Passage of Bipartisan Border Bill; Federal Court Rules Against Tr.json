      "sentences": "A federal appeals court dealing a major legal blow to former President Donald Trump, the three-judge panel rejecting Trump's claims that he is immune from prosecution for alleged crimes that he committed while he was president.The decision is now opening the way for special counsel Jack Smith to prosecute Trump on multiple charges, accusing him of trying to undermine the 2020 election. The judges in the D.C. Circuit Court not only sided with the Justice Department, but they repeatedly eviscerated Trump's behavior after his 2020 defeat. Their ruling said, in part -- quote -- \"Former President Trump lacked any lawful discretionary authority to defy federal criminal law, and he is answerable in court for his conduct.\" With us now, we have CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, a Trump spokesman says the former president plans to appeal this. How much time do his lawyers have?",

      "sentences": "So the circuit gave them until next Tuesday to tell the Supreme Court that they intend to appeal.And then we will likely see a process play out where both sides of this case will be able to weigh in on whether they think the Supreme Court should get involved here. Of course, Trump's team would love to make another trip to the Supreme Court this year because their strategy is really about delay. Former members of his legal team have said publicly that they don't believe this is really, truly a winning issue on the merits for Trump. So this is really about trying to drag this out as long as they possibly can and trying to get this trial pushed until after the November 2024 election. I would expect, of course, to see the special counsel say that the Supreme Court does not need to weigh in, even though this would be an issue of first impression for the High Court. I think they're also likely going to be relying heavily on this opinion we got today from these three appellate judges, where they found -- quote -- \"Any executive immunity that may have protected Trump while he served as president no longer protects him against this prosecution.\" Brianna, one of the things that was so interesting about this opinion is, they went far beyond just the constitutional analysis, eviscerating Trump's theory of absolute presidential immunity and his actions in and around January 6, saying -- quote -- \"Former President Trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches.\" So, as much as this is about constitutional questions, important, really untested questions of constitutional powers from the presidency, it's also about timing, Brianna. So now we're watching to see how long it takes for this appeals request to play out.",

      "sentences": "They were very pointed in their language. They are not mincing words. They're not pulling any punches.This was a definitive ruling by this court to say, you do not have a blank check. You do not have all the power. And you certainly need to have a system of checks and balances, where you cannot say that, just by virtue of being in office, you are not going to be held to account for things that happen that are outside of the official conduct. That's the most important aspect here. They were not saying that there are no circumstances in which someone could have immunity from liability at the civil side for official performance of duties. What they were saying was that, if it's not an official act, if it falls outside of that scope, you can be held to account, which is exactly what this system of checks and balances really already contemplates, Boris. The other big important part here was this idea of what role the impeachments had in the past to now influence this. Remember, before, there was the argument by the counsel for Trump to suggest, look, you can only go after a former president if they were first impeached, convicted and removed from office. That was already met with a lot of skepticism, Boris. But suffice it to say, this court said, first of all, there's no double jeopardy attaching for a political action like impeachment. And, number two, that's not a criminal matter, and it's still fair game.",

The court gave Trump until Monday to appeal to the Supreme Court. But I'm wondering, what options do they have now? Can they still put it in front of the entire panel of circuit appeals judges?",

      "sentences": "Well, they could take to have that full review, that en banc review. Remember there is a wider number of judges than the three that actually heard the case. That's usually done to streamline the process. You can imagine the volume of cases before the appellate court.And they streamline it by assigning different random attorney -- random -- excuse me -- judges together to hear a particular case. But this will likely go to the Supreme Court. They want to have it before the Supreme Court if you're Trump's team because it might be a more protracted process. They will have time to see if they want to take up the case. If they do, there's the oral argument calendar. Then there's the briefing. And, remember, their docket goes until June. And so you don't have that much of a window between June and then the November general election should he secure that nomination. But, in reality, the Supreme Court could keep their hands clean here. I think one of the reasons why this opinion is so thought out, is so comprehensive is because it does invite the Supreme Court to say, well, hold on. What would we be examining on different grounds? Will we rubber-stamp this opinion? Is there actually a controversy before us? Do we somehow want to have a different finessed point or a totally different direction? And with the cases -- with there not being cases in this area and with, frankly, the proposition of checks and balances being so clear, I wouldn't be surprised if the Supreme Court was a little bit reluctant to even weigh in, not just politically, but because it's so thorough in the court below.",
