I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 7:00 pm in the evening. It's 5 pm in Beirut, 10 am in New York. Lots going on today in all of those timelines -- time zones. We begin stateside where the major new update in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case. Any moment now, we will learn what happens next after proceedings were put on hold last week following Trump's reelection. Trump had been due to be sentenced next week over his conviction on 34 felony counts which were handed down earlier in the year. There's now a huge question mark over whether or not that can happen at all. Let's bring in Katelyn Polantz in Washington. What more do we know about today's decision?",

Often a judge will take the lead of a prosecutor whenever they have won the case. But this is unprecedented circumstances with Donald Trump coming into office. And just a reminder of what is happening here. Donald Trump has been convicted by a jury in New York's state court system on these 34 counts of hush money payments, business falsification of records, charges related to the payments to Stormy Daniels back in 2016, when he was still a candidate for office. And the question is, will Donald Trump be sentenced for those crimes? He is convicted of them. What the district attorney's office has to weigh, as we're waiting on their filing today to see what they want to happen, they have to weigh how to respect the jury's finding of guilt of Donald Trump here, the verdict in this case, with Trump as a criminal defendant and then the Office of the Presidency. What is the balance there as Trump will become President of the United States in January?",

Now one of the things that is happening in this case is that Judge Juan Merchan is also weighing if there should be some immunity around the presidency related to the -- what the jury's findings were. So as part of the case, should it be cut out and should it be dismissed outright? Trump's team wants this whole conviction overturned. They want the case against him dismissed. They say he's coming in as president. And what we know courts have done in the past is given essentially a bubble to the presidency, both around the actions taken while someone is president and also to protect the leader of the free world. The leader of the United States from having to face things that would take away from that very demanding and consequential job. And so there's just a lot of questions about if he is sentenced, if he is sentenced, does that sentence be put on hold for some time? Is it something so minimal that it could be resolved by January? Or is he sentenced at all? Is there the level of protection for president-elect right now that Trump's attorneys are arguing over and over again, very forcefully in every single court, where he is facing some sort of legal fallout.",

But over the past several days, we've seen Russia blanketing Ukraine with drone and missile strikes. There's incredible concern, especially in Washington, about the introduction of North Korean forces on the side of the Russians, especially in the Kursk region, where they're believed to be in the thousands, where Ukraine has, in recent months, staged its own sort of surprise incursion. And president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has warned that those numbers, the numbers of the North Koreans could grow, you know, exponentially here. So all of this is again happening against the background of, you know, a very serious moment, when we have an incoming administration, the Trump administration. Donald Trump has vowed that he can bring the warring parties to the table, that he can end this conflict quickly. And the jury, in some ways, is out on whether the two sides here, the Russians and the Ukrainians, are positioning themselves so that they can negotiate from a position of strength respectively. But you know, clearly, there's been a lot of rhetoric particularly around the introduction of the ATACMs system, this longer range system that can strike inside of Russian territory. Russia has made it very clear that it sees this as a provocative move, that it's, quote, \"throwing oil on the fire\" here of the war, that it would see the U.S. as being a direct party to the conflict. And against this background, Becky, it's important to point out that Russia has come forward now with a formal revision of its nuclear doctrine that would seem to sort of loosen the rules or widen the door a little bit for the -- for the ability of Russia to, you know, consider something to be aggression that would reach the threshold. That would require the retaliation, the use of nuclear weapons -- Becky.",

The Russians claim that all five of these missiles were shot down, however, that parts of the missiles hit a military object, as that report said. Now so far, there's been no confirmation of any of this coming from the Ukrainians or from the American side. So right now it is only the Russians saying that. At the same time, of course, the other big breaking news story here in Russia is the fact that Vladimir Putin has now signed off on an update of Russia's military doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons. Now all of this essentially makes it easier for Russians to conduct first use of these types of weapons. The Russians are now saying that if Russia is attacked by a non-nuclear country -- like, for instance, Ukraine, using long distance weapons like the ones that the Russians claim have now been used. And that if it is aided by a nuclear nation, like, for instance, the United States, that then that could trigger a nuclear response from the Russians. The Russian spokesman for the Kremlin has come out and said that the Russians want any sort of adversaries to understand that a response from the Russians would be coming if there would be an aggression. It's unclear whether or not this will really change the game or change things on the ground. However, right now, it certainly -- it seems as though the Russians are saying that, if the Ukrainians fire missiles deep into Russian territory, that this could also pit the United States and NATO and Russia against one another -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

      "sentences": "Well, I think U.S. officials definitely want a win for President Biden, especially on thisissue, because, of course, the president has been so preoccupied with this conflict in the Middle East over the last several months. And the fact that Israel really has not listened to a lot of what the U.S. has advised them to do with regard to the wars in Gaza and in Lebanon. So getting some kind of achievement here, showing that the U.S. still has some degree of influence and leverage over this peace negotiation process, that is going to be really key. And it's something that U.S. officials are, of course, keen to accomplish sooner rather than later. We are told by people inside the Biden administration that it is their understanding that the incoming president, president-elect Trump, is not going to throw a wrench in this, that he is not going to try to upend this peace process in order to wait and hold essentially for when he gets into office, so that he can say that this was his victory. And so for that reason, you know, in conjunction with the fact that U.S. officials here have gotten positive signals from the Israelis, that they also want to complete a cease-fire deal sooner rather than later, has spurred U.S. officials to kind of move full steam ahead on this. And that is why you're seeing Amos Hochstein in Lebanon today, saying that they are very optimistic that the window of securing something is happening right now. And I think that, you know, when the election happened, when, you know, Donald Trump won, it was very unclear at that point whether the U.S. would be able to continue these negotiations. But soon after those election results came in, they received indications from the Israelis that they don't necessarily want to drag this out any longer, either. And so while we have been here before in terms of feeling very close to a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, kind of being on the brink, it does appear that U.S. officials are more confident now than they have been, that something is very, very close to being achieved.",

When children who went to school there, large towns in some cases 20,000 people evacuated, that they would be able to go home, that they would be free and safe from Hezbollah fire coming across the border. To a degree some of that has been secured because the rockets that were coming across the border were generally pretty short-range. Some of them sort of shoulder launched anti-tank missiles fired at people's houses, devastating, deadly in some cases. But Hezbollah still continues to be able to fire rockets. Debris falling on Tel Aviv last night. Somebody killed in the north of Israel yesterday as well. So the threat, Hezbollah's threat still exists. So it it's hard to say that it's been achieved definitively. And I think there's a sense creeping in on the Lebanese side, knowing that Amos Hochstein met earlier today with prime minister Najib Mikati. And he also met -- went --  then went on to meet with the speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Nabih Berri, from the Amal party, closely tied or closely associated with Hezbollah. The main interlocutor, Nabih Berri is the main interlocutor with Hezbollah for these -- for these U.S.-proposed negotiations. And what we heard from Nabih Berri talking to local media -- and this is a first analysis of what he said. And we need to drill down and get a full and complete translation of everything that he said to get the full context. But he seemed to indicate that, yes, the talks are going well but he also seemed to have some skepticism that he was indicating in his language that Israel had sort of reneged on some part of some understanding. And I think there's a vagueness in what Israel wants and that Hezbollah is willing to go along with. And is it written down? Is it in verbal language? But I don't get the sense that the complete job is done until Hezbollah actually stops firing those missiles and they're no longer sitting at the border. They're not really sitting at the border but they're still firing the missiles.",
