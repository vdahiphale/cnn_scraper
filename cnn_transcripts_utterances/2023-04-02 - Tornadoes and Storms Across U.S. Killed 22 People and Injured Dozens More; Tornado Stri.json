First, the indictment must be unsealed and we expect that to happen at Tuesday's arraignment in Manhattan. CNN's Kristen Holmes has our report.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Former President Donald Trump's aides and advisers have expressed concern in recent days that the former president might not get a fair trial if this were to be held in Manhattan. Now, of course, we do not know if this is actually going to go to trial, still a longways away from that, but they are citing the potential concern over the fact that it is a politically blue Democratic borough. Now, sources close to the legal team say they are not considering it this time, asking for a change of venue to perhaps a more Republican friendly borough, but they are just waiting to actually see that indictment, see those charges, which they are expecting to do on Tuesday when the former president is arraigned. Now, this messaging, though, around the unfairness, that is what we have really seen for not just the last several days, but the last several months around this potential indictment, around Donald Trump's ongoing legal problems. They tend to paint this as completely unfair, as a political hoax, as a witch hunt. And it's not just the former president and his team. Republicans have also started to follow suit. We know that the former president has been calling his allies, Capitol Hill and across the country, trying to sort -- shore up that support. And also, really trying to stress the fact that this is political, and they seem to be following that lead. We have seen all of these surrogates, these people who are close to the former president, hitting up conservative media, talking about how this is unfair, how this is a problem for the Democrats, how this is a political hoax. And the big question, though, right now is what this actually means for the former president politically. Now, in some cases, there are people who believe that this might help him in a primary, contested primary with Republicans. But people are still very unsure what this means for the former president in the long term, and that is something that there's a lot of conversations going on and on about, particularly as we see is 2024 campaign ramping up.

You know, we live in a country where we're blessed with a system of laws. Prosecutors are charged with evaluating facts and law and bringing actions without fear or favor in their work. So, I think there's a lot of commentary based on no evidence yet. If you're charged with a crime, you're entitled to due process. You're entitled to a presumption of innocence unless you are convicted. And the former president will -- I hope and believe, be entitled to all of those constitutional protections. You know, if this is not a strong case, then he'll win in court. If it is a strong case, I think the people are suggesting that it's improper, we'll be very embarrassed.

This will come with major logistical and security considerations. Security, for example, we have seen the last several days, the NYPD set up additional lights, additional cameras surrounding the building they'll use behind me, which is where those court proceedings will be housed in come Tuesday.According to several sources, we have also witnessed an increased NYPD presence surrounding the building, as well as court officers that have been asked to work through the weekend. Also what you don't see behind the scenes, which is the intelligence operation, intelligence officials scouring the internet to identify any potential threats. And we also know that Governor Kathy Hochul from the state of New York has reached out to New York City officials and offering state resources should that be needed. Though the New York City mayor's office, making it very clear, that they have not identified any credible threats so far. In terms of the logistics, it's certainly going to be a massive undertaken when it comes to what we have seen between secret service and the NYPD. They're certainly familiar with the practices that come with transporting former presidents in and out of New York City. However, given the unusual circumstances, our colleague John Miller, reporting that there is very likely that the booking process will be modified, that we do expect the former president to travel here, come Tuesday, to face those charges. He would be taken upstairs in the building they'll use to behind me to a detective squad, be fingerprinted, then taken before an arraignment judge and then potentially be released on a P.R. bonds. So, certainly everything that we expect, come Tuesday, but in terms of the security presence, it will only continue to grow as we get closer to that day. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.

President Tsai called Guatemala a solid ally of Taiwan. Adding that she was moved by President Giammattei's friendship and expressing gratitude for what she called Guatemala's permanent support. The Guatemalan president said his government supports Taiwan and reiterated that Taiwan is, in his words, an independent nation, and the only and true China with which Guatemala shares democratic values, mutual respect and fraternal ties. On Friday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry praised the new diplomatic relations between her country and Honduras. Saying that the one-China policy should be favored by the rest of the world. Mao added that China hopes that Guatemala clearly understands this trend and makes the right decision to stop supporting Taiwan in the near future. But Guatemalan President Giammattei has ignored China's admonitions, celebrating his country's sixth decade bilateral relations with Taiwan instead.
