And here's what he told me. He said that he realized that he had a personal experience with Fani Willis, with Nathan Wade that was potentially relevant to what Fani Willis was saying in that hearing room. And that happened in 2023, according to Brody. He said that Fani Willis and Nathan Wade came to visit a winery in Napa Valley and that, at the end of the day, when the bill was delivered, Fani Willis not only picked up the check, but paid in cash. And so the bill was about $400, which it is a pretty sizable amount to pay in cash, which is what surprised Brody at the time. And it's what reminded him to reach out. And he wanted to put this information out there, too, because he thinks it's important to backup what Fani Willis testified to in a courtroom. Because, at the end of the day, the thing about a cash payment is there's no receipts, there's no paper trail. So he thinks adding his voice to this conversation does at least help verify what Fani Willis was talking about. SANCHEZ: So, Zach, do you know if Fani Willis' team has reached out to him?",

That could obviously change as this matter's not resolved yet.Judge McAfee is still weighing whether or not to disqualify Fani Willis. And really, he has to determine if she financially benefited from her relationship with Nathan Wade. That's really the core threshold that the evidence has to cross an order for him to remove Fani Willis from the case. And look, sources I've talked to say that, if Fani Willis is removed from this case, that the entire hope of prosecuting Donald Trump in Georgia, the entire case that's been years in the making essentially goes away.",

      "sentences": "A first-of-its-kind ruling that puts in vitro fertilization in jeopardy for thousands of families. Alabama's Supreme Court says frozen embryos were children and should be protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act.This is a case that stems from two lawsuits filed by couples after their frozen embryos were accidentally dropped and destroyed. A lower court had dismissed the lawsuit, saying that embryos do not fit definitions of person or child. But the Alabama Supreme Court overruled that. Associate Justice J. Mitchell writing in the majority opinion, that state law, quote, \"applies to all children, born and unborn, without limitation. It is not the role of this court to craft a new limitation based on our own view of what is or is not wise public policy. That is especially true whereas here, the people of this state have adopted a constitutional amendment directly aimed at stopping courts from excluding unborn life from legal protection.\" Let's bring in CNN legal analyst, Carrie Cordero. So much to talk about here, Carrie. What are the implications of this ruling? Because you have another justice on the court, Greg Cook, writing in the descent that this ruling, quote, \"almost certainly ends the creation of frozen embryos through in vitro fertilization in Alabama.\"",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think there is a really strong argument here that, as to Alabama specifically, the ability to have the procedure of in vitro fertilization is at risk.Because this would place liability in case something happened that was not intended to happen. And so providers are most likely not going to be willing to engage in that. And what we really have, Brianna, here is this is a collision of the old and the news. So you have an old law in Alabama dating back to 1872, which is the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. And then that is combined with a much more recent development in Alabama constitutional law, which is that the voters added a provision to protect unborn children in 2022. And so the Alabama Supreme Court took those two pieces together, took this case that had to do with a specific instance, and has used it as a vehicle to most likely eliminate the practice of in vitro fertilization in the state of Alabama.",

But that's the circumstances in this particular case. And that underlies much of the advocacy that, in many ways, Brianna, in my judgment, is reducing women's rights in terms of reproductive freedom, reducing their rights in terms of decisions to make, in terms of their own health decisions, and really taking the rights of women backwards, perhaps decades, if not centuries.",

And just like in other states where clinics have had to decide to stop engaging in the provision of abortions, for example, in Alabama, these clinics will have to decide what they are going to do in order to continue or not to provide the service.
