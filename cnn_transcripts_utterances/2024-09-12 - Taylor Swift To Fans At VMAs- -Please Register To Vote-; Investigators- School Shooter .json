You know I am, Boris. I know you are as well. All right. So the vote.gov Web site visits, you mentioned that 406,000 folks who clicked on that link. I want to put that into some context for you. The normal, usual activity on a daily basis is, get this, just 30,000 folks who go to vote.gov. So if you were to quickly do that math, my goodness, it's well more than 10 times as many folks who clicked on that link in a 24-hour period than, in fact, visit on a daily basis. So Taylor Swift, you want to register to vote? She's someone you absolutely want in your corner. And someone, obviously, that Kamala Harris wants in her corner. Now, it's beyond just the registrations, right? There are people who might already be registered to vote. People who are in the electorate. Could Taylor Swift change their mind? Well, I'm not sure that they is that many people out there at this point who are particularly undecided But if they are undecided, there's probably no one better to have in your corner than Taylor Swift. Because I want you to look here. This is the net favorability ratings. Most politicians are underwater these days. Donald Trump underwater at minus six-point net favorability rating. Kamala Harris right near even but still at minus one point. Look at Taylor Swift. My goodness, gracious. I'm not sure there's someone more popular in this country right now with a plus 22-point net favorability rating. So, Boris Sanchez, I think Kamala Harris definitely welcomes Taylor Swift's support.",

He was able to reassemble it and come back into the hallway and start shooting. Now, this is something that we've been hearing from student after student that it was that point where he walked outside, came back in, and we even heard students talk about him pulling it from the bag. Some of the classrooms were able to get the door closed, but obviously some weren't. Take a listen to one student who had an eye-to-eye encounter with the shooter as the shooting started.

He apparently got hit by shrapnel.He obviously was released from the hospital. We talked to him, but he obviously was scared about exactly what happened and knew some of the people who died. So you can understand the pain he's going through. Look, there's some video that just got posted to the high school Web site. We're going to show you the principal. She makes an address to the student community here. She tells them how painful this has been as she realizes that some students may be ready to return to class, but others are not ready to return. Of course, everyone sort of trying to figure out what the next steps are. They haven't detailed when that school is going to reopen. Now, the rest of the county returned to school just this week. But something I should mention here. There were two deputies who were inside that school. And of course, the sheriff talked about them. That's Brandon King and Sergeant Chase Boyd. Those we're the two men who ran to the gunfire to stop the shooter. Let's not forget, he surrendered under gunpoint to those deputies in that hallway, the 14-year-old. But it's because of those deputies' quick work that they this was able to be stopped in that hallway before anyone else was able to get hurt. Four people lost their lives. We also know there'll be a visual and some memorials happening over the next 24 hours or so -- Brianna?",

First, any information they can glean about the shooter himself.Although this young man has confessed, according to police, to doing this awful act, they still want to know as much as they can about that suspect. So obviously, the mother would be a key witness. Secondly, they would be working to determine anything that might help bolster their case against the shooters father. And just remind viewers, the father has also been charged in this case surrounding the access to the firearm. We know, for example, based on our reporting, that authorities had visited that home previously and warned that the shooter was suspected of engaging in online communication threatening a school shooting. Despite knowing that, the father then went and essentially bought this A.R.-style rifle for his son. So again, could the mother provide information that might help bolster that case? That is certainly a possibility. And then finally, authorities will want to ensure that she has no culpability here as well. Again, to try to interview her. What did she know? I had previously reported that when authorities conducted a search warrant on the shooters home, they found these writings in his room where he was looking at and writing about past mass shootings, including the Parkland mass shooting. What did the parents know? That will be key as they interview the mother.",

Again, this all surrounded that access to the weapon. What we're hearing from legal experts, to include the D.A. who prosecuted those parents, is that, in this case with Georgia, this all comes to what is called reasonable foreseeability. What does that mean? When a reasonable person will look at this situation involving the shooter, these alleged past threats, and then foresee that giving this young man a high-powered assault style rifle could be recipe for a disaster. That is something that authorities will want to decide. And again, a key part of that is actually interviewing her, getting her side of the story.",

Is there something wrong? Can I help you?\" I would've told that person everything and begged them to save me. I couldn't say myself, in that moment, and I needed someone to reach it and reach out. And that's what Jon Bon Jovi did. He reached into someone who was in desperate, lethal emotional pain. And he and his team got them back to safety. Because they showed what matters most, that they cared, and that that person had value. And when you can show someone who feels valueless, who is hopeless, that they have value and there is hope around the corner, you can be the catalyst to saving a life.",

Because the word \"suicide\" has such a taboo on it. But those three questions we must ask our loved ones, family and friends and colleagues, who are struggling, are you thinking of killing yourself? Have you made plans to take your life? Do you have the means? Statistically, they get a more honest answer than those other options. Because they are not putting the thought in someone's mind. That's a myth. They're giving them permission to speak on their pain. And a pain shared is a pain have. And that's what Jon Bon Jovi did today.
