We dobegin with the news from Italy that the Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has died at the age of 86. Berlusconi, a billionaire businessman and media mogul was Italy's longest serving Premier. His decades in public life were marked by numerous personal and professional scandals. Much more on his complicated legacy and the mark he leaves on Italian politics in just a few moments time. In the meantime, also offensive, intensive Ukrainian soldiers were raising the nation's flag after apparently taking back territory in the Donetsk region, Kyiv reporting some early successes in recapturing Russian occupied territory. But also fresh reports too of American supplied armored vehicles being destroyed or damaged in the process. We've got all the latest on that just ahead too. Plus, a miracle rescue after 40 days in dense Amazon jungle, four children found alive after surviving the plane crash that killed their mother will take you to Columbia for the latest on that too.

In fact, there are lots on investor's plates in the day ahead, plural on plates to on this spinning this time tomorrow we'll get the latest U.S. consumer price data. The U.S. Federal Reserve announcing its interest rate decision on Wednesday we are expecting a Fed rate hike pause. Will it be a long pause though or a pity pauses. Jay Powell said to shed some light on that too. And the ECB and the Bank of Japan are all in action this week as well. A busy show, as always coming up, but first we do begin today's show in Italy. Tributes are being paid and condolences sent to the family and friends of the Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Barbie Nadeau looks back over his life. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice over): The Jesus Christ of politics, the best political leader in Europe and the world. That is how Silvio Berlusconi once described himself, and without a doubt he was a powerful political operator and businessman who sparked more than one scandal. And despite a string of legal trouble and dubious friends, Berlusconi always managed to bounce back. He made his name as a business tycoon. He owned the famous AC Milan football club for 31 years. At one point, he was the richest man in Italy.",

He was quickly removed when his coalition partners pulled out, but he was elected to the top job twice more in 2001 and 2008, becoming Italy's longest serving Prime Minister since World War Two. And voters brought him back to power in 2022 as a coalition partner with Giorgia Meloni and Matteo Salvini. Charming and with a flippant sense of humor, Berlusconi's off the cuff remarks and missteps with protocol were often criticized. He welcomed the newly elected U.S. President in 2008 by complimenting Barack Obama on his quote \"suntan\", a left German Chancellor Angela Merkel waiting during a NATO summit. And his close friendship with Vladimir Putin got him in hot water after he disclosed he had reestablished his friendship with the Russian President in late 2022 after Putin sent him 20 bottles of Russian vodka for his birthday. He later blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting a war, putting him at odds with Meloni. The Prime Minister often surrounded himself with beautiful women. Allegations of a relationship with an 18 year old aspiring model which he strenuously denied triggered a painfully public divorce. And revelations about his so called \"Bunga Bunga\" parties landed him in court on charges of abuse of power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Allegations he also denied.",

But nonetheless, he did appeal to certain part of the Italian national character that is impatient with the bureaucracy with the high taxes. And so he really did strike a chord with many people. But the fact of the matter is he was very good at running for office. And but when he held office, he really wasn't able to change much in terms of improving the Italian economy. In fact, during the 20 years, when he dominated Italian politics, the Italian economy stagnated. Italy's debt went through the roof, so very little actually changed, if anything, things got worse as a result of his time in office but nonetheless, he did. He was a charismatic character, there's no question about it. I attended several of his speeches. And certainly you oftentimes found yourself nodding in agreement with what he said. What he did, on the other hand, was often quite to the contrary, he was very much focused on preventing any legal action against him. And there was a sort of a constant stream of cases against him during and after his time in office. And oftentimes he worked hard to change the laws to protect him, to protect his personal and business interests. So he leaves this earth with a very mixed legacy, but many Italians nonetheless, look fondly upon to him as a somebody who sort of cut through a lot of the dusty, heavy language of Italian politics and spoke a certain amount of truth, didn't necessarily act on it, however, Julia,",

Well, we can take a look at what we're seeing in terms of price action lower down by more than 2.5 percent for Brent downwards and 3 percent for crude in the U.S. Anna Stewart joins me now.

Andit's worth noting that Goldman Sachs actually raised their price forecast for the end of the year only in April, so just two months ago from $90 to $95 a barrel. They are slashing that on the supply side, they see huge beats from sanction countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. According to this report, they say Russian oil supply is nearly back to where it was before the invasion of Ukraine, despite so many Western companies refusing to buy it, despite the price cap and so on. The fact of the matter is there are still buyers for Russian oil, particularly, of course, India and China. But I have to say undershooting the compliance for too long does risk the ire of Saudi Arabia. So that may well rein it in. You've also got strategic reserves, particularly course the U.S. that has also fed into the supply side issues. And on the demand side, you can point to slowing economies recession fears, you can even look to concerns about China's economy and as a separate note, actually from Goldman Sachs over the weekend, looking at the impact of China's property sector, but also we're out in a high interest rate environment. It's just less than investment learning to actually hold oil right now. And we've seen a lot of destocking. Goldman Sachs does see the price of oil rising next year. They're citing rising emerging market demand slowing U.S., supply OPEC cuts, but they're still cutting their price forecast for next May, which was at $100 a barrel now at 93, Julia.",

Now, just to give you a sense of what this looked like in France, for example, 86 percent of the users who saw a psychologist job ad for women -- psychologist job ad were women, 93 percent of the users who saw a preschool job ad, preschool teacher job ad were women. But just 25 percent of the users who saw a pilot job ad were women and 6 percent of the users who saw a mechanic job ad for women.

And so we are really focused on acceleratingreforestation, doing this from the air and drones is really the best way that we that we can think of doing this specifically in post wildfire areas. We have seed pods; each plant has a tree seed in it. And these are designed to enhance germination, enhance the survival of these little seedlings when we plant them, and then we essentially fly over a post wildfire area, we can access this through up remotely. And when we fly over this post wildfire area, we can fly these bonds at a very high rate; we are actually shooting these bonds into the soil into the ground. And, and by doing this, we can increase the germination rate. And we can essentially accelerate the rate of reforestation and bypassing the safety risks, planting and post wildfires is inherently dangerous.",

So human planted spiked in the post-harvest industry, what we're doing is post wildfire reforestation. And post wildfire reforestation is actually it is, it is very, it's not very common for humans to go in there. They're very focused in the post-harvest industry, it's very dangerous. And so when we get in there, we can do remote site access. But in terms of efficiency, we're planting it about nine times the rate of human planters right now. So on a per tree basis on a per value added person in the field, we can plant it about nine times the rate of human tree planters, so that that gives you an idea for efficiency, yes.",

We're about 90 percent automated right now; we're leveraging a lot of machinery to produce these pods. We're almost producing about 500,000 of these a day.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Why would scientists put pants on a frog? It turns out; it's a good way to track where they're going. These poison frogs from South America are some of the most brightly colored frogs in the world, but they're dangerous to touch. Measuring a mere two to four centimeters in length, their skin secretes toxins that can paralyze or kill a predator. Stanford University biologists wanted to learn more about how male and female poison frogs navigate. So they tracked to the tropical rain forests of Ecuador and French Guiana to study three different species.",

In our study, we have one species where female do the job and run around more and we have two species where males around run around and move more. KINKADE (voice over): In the end, the team got a mixed bag depending on the species. In some cases, the female frogs navigated more quickly and accurately than their males. The male frogs from all three species tended to explore more. And if you're hoping to catch a glimpse of the fashionable frogs, you'd be out of luck.

And there is a good feeling, a general good, good feeling about the story. One thing that the general told me that I think it's worth pointing out is that the kids walked for about 20 kilometers in those five weeks, they stayed in the jungle. And that at some point, the GPS evidence shows that they stay that the search and rescue operations were so close about 100, 250 feet from the kids. And they couldn't find them because the terrain, the vegetation, the rainy season made it the search so difficult. The general say that their team on the ground had a visibility of about 30 feet, that's about 10 meters. And then that's why it took so long to find them.
