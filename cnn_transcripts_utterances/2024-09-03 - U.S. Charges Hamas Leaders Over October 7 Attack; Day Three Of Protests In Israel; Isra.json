The United States charges Hamas leaders over the October 7th terrorist attack in Israel. A Russian ballistic missile strike killing 51 at and around a Ukrainian military academy. Spy scandal. A former aide of New York's governor is charged with acting as a Chinese spy. And blood block. The plant-based gel that stops severe bleeding in seconds. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, the U.S. announcing criminal charges against several Hamas leaders for the first time. It comes after the death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin in Gaza and a promise from President Joe Biden to hold Hamas accountable. Goldberg-Polin was one of six hostages killed in Gaza who were held by Hamas and recovered over the weekend. It led to three days of protests in Israel amid public demands for an immediate ceasefire and hostage deal. Many protesters say the government should be doing more to bring the remaining hostages home. Negotiations stalled after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Israel must control the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Hamas wants a full withdrawal of Israeli troops. Thousands of Israelis marched together on Tuesday while Hamas revealed chilling orders to kill the hostages if Israeli troops close in. Our Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv for us tonight. Nic, good to have you with us. We can talk to us about what the protests are saying and the scale of the protests that we're seeing, but I think the context here matters. If we go back to May, Netanyahu agreed to with President Biden's proposals that didn't include the presence of troops in that corridor. Why is he now fighting this point at the potential cost of a deal? Because clearly protesters are saying it doesn't deem necessary.",

Does it really determine the future or could they even come back to bringing troops into this corridor, for example, even if there are other military options?

But it is a little bit like, if you will, somebody at a roulette table or a card table. And if you move away when you're in a losing position, then you lose. But if you stay in and stay in the game, and this is what Netanyahu is doing, he hopes still to be able to prove that he was right, that Hamas can be destroyed. And he -- you know, let's say Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, was killed overnight tonight, then the prime minister will be in a position of being able to say, look, I told you we could do it. We did it. We broke the back of Hamas. You know, let's see where we get on negotiations. Now, the position could change. So, as long as he's still in the game to use that expression, he has the potential, in his mind, to come out proving the point that he thinks he can prove. Now, many leaders who are in power for a long time, like him, get to the point where they believe that their view is right. And if they just have enough time, they can prove it's right. But he does have time, if you will, because he has a cabinet around him and a coalition of 64 within the Knesset, 64 members, which gives him the majority, which -- and the cabinet still supports him apart from the defense minister. And that went to a vote last week over the Philadelphi Corridor and it was passed with only one abstention and the defense minister voting against it. So, the numbers in government to keep Netanyahu in place to continue with his plan, it's all there. And the mechanism that would have to change that would be members of his cabinet would have to leave or five members of the coalition would have to leave, then he wouldn't be in a majority. Then constitutionally, it could be challenged and the government could be formed. Very difficult, mechanical -- political, mechanical things to do. And the other alternative is what the protesters are proposing, which is to, as they say, shake the country, find a way to stop the country working through the unions, if they can beat the courts. If the unions can, you know, shutter the airport, close the ports, close down the bus depots and the transport network, reduce services at hospitals, all of that would put a very big significant pressure on the prime minister. But at the moment his in a delicate and finely balanced political place, but it's one that's working in his favor.",

And you're absolutely right, they are saying that in the case of these ballisticmissiles that the Russians used, which apparently were Iskander ballistic missiles, that there are very few surface-to-air missile systems that can actually take such missiles down. But the patriot U.S.-made surface-to-air missile system is actually one of the ones that can and the Ukrainians for a very long time have been saying that they need more of those systems across more regions of the country. Of course, Poltava is in the center of Ukraine, but also, closer to the border with Russia than, for instance, in cities like Kyiv, where there are Patriot missile systems. And the Ukrainians say, yes, they need more of them. It's unclear whether or not it could have prevented something like what we saw today. But at the same time, certainly, they do say that it is urgent after the carnage that we saw in Poltava. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Parts of the military educational facility almost completely destroyed. Dozens killed here, the Ukrainians say, when two Russian ballistic missiles struck, leaving those on the ground with no time to get to bomb shelters. More than 200 were also wounded and a nearby hospital damaged. Ukraine's president, irate. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The Russian scum will undoubtedly be held accountable for this strike. And once again, we urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror, air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine. Not in a warehouse somewhere. Long-range strikes that can defend against Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia's been accelerating its Ukraine's cities and infrastructure. A massive barrage aiming for the capital Kyiv early Monday, just as children were gearing up for the first day of school after summer break. One of the places damaged, a management college. ANASTASIYA, STUDENT (through translator): We got up and it had already started to boom. We ran out into the yard near the dormitory. We heard something flying and something being shot down. PLEITGEN (voice-over): On Sunday, more than 40 people injured after Russian airstrikes on the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Responders desperately trying to save the victims. There's an ambulance on the other side, the photographer says. We won't be able to carry him there, she answers. While Ukraine's air defenses often take down Russian missiles, the consequences can be devastating when they don't. The strikes on Poltava were one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of the war. We were on hand when a ballistic missile annihilated a funeral wake in Eastern Ukraine in October of last year, killing 59 people. And 46 were killed in Dnipro in January 2023 when a heavy cruise missile blew a giant hole into an apartment block.",

PLEITGEN (voice-over): Now, yet another mass casualty strike, leaving Ukraine's leadership angry and vowing revenge. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And certainly, also this entire country very much in a state of shock after those massive attacks. And one of the things the Ukrainians are also calling for, aside from additional Patriot surface-to- air missile systems, is for the U.S. to lift some of those restrictions on longer distance U.S.-made weapons, like, for instance, those ATACMS, surface-to-surface missiles, to let the Ukrainians strike deeper into Russian territory to, at least in some cases, possibly hit those missile launch sites before the Russians can even fire those missiles towards Ukrainian territory.

So, we're going to keep watching this because it will be a significant wind maker. It's already been a very big rainmaker, 400 millimeters. And for those of you who don't do metric, that's 16 inches of rain just in the past couple of days with pictures like this. Watch the road kind of fall away. That car just got through there. There is the rainfall. Here it comes. Here's Haiku, Hainan, the island nation there, and then back up toward Hong Kong, you see how much rain is going to be coming down through here. And even for Manila, there could be 125, 150 millimeters of additional rain on top of what they already had. But then it becomes a wind event, and for Hainan, especially. 213 kilometers per hour. That's the official forecast. You could go plus or minus 10 percent from there without a doubt. Every heavy rainfall on the island as well. And then, not that far from Hanoi, it doesn't lose a lot of power.

Well,now, a U.S. inventor has found a way to harness the power of algae to stop moderate to severe bleeding in seconds. From his dorm room at New York University, Joe Landolina began work 14 years later, and his treatment, called Trauma Gel, has just received approval for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. His company already sells another product that works in a similar way on animals, which has already been used in more than 45,000 veterinary procedures worldwide. Landolina is the co-founder of Cressalon, a Brooklyn-based biotech firm, and he joins us now. Joe, fantastic to have you on the show. Just start by explaining how the gel works in practice. JOE LANDOLINA, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, CRESILON: Yes, of course, Julia. Thank you so much for having me. So, Trauma Gel is an algae-based gel that instantly creates a mechanical barrier against bleeding. And so, if you inject the gel directly into a bullet wound, into a laceration, into a stab injury, it nearly instantaneously creates a barrier against bleeding, allowing the patient to produce their own clot much quicker than with any other products included packing that injury with gauze.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, today, and what we call it in Brooklyn, is pressure and a prayer is the standard of care. Meaning that you have to painfullypack the injury with gauze, which is very difficult in a bullet track, meaning it's very difficult to get the gauze all the way down to the source of bleeding. And so, this gel not only allows for a much faster delivery, meaning it can almost instantaneously be delivered, but it shortens that treatment time from a minute to maybe five minutes, down to second, something less than 10 seconds.",

Cresilon is the only aseptic fill and finish manufacturer in the five boroughs of New York. And five years ago, Cresilon launched a product called VETIGEL, which has been saving pet lives around the world. And so, that product is available in 30 countries. It's been used to save the lives of over 60,000 pets, ranging in procedures from brain and spine surgery into trauma care. And so, we have a huge amount of experience in these types of procedures. But with Trauma Gel, this will be our first opportunity to exercise our mission of saving lives into saving human lives.",

The idea for us, at least, is that if it isn't cost competitive, it won't be accessible to all those who need it.

And one day, I realized that this substance that I made would stick to my skin. It wouldn't let go until I wanted to. And I had this idea, which was what if you could take that material and put it into a bullet wound, at least to transport a patient from point A to point B. And so, with that, that sparked the idea for Trauma Gel, and we entered that into NYU's business plan competition, where, at that time, I was an engineering student and Cresilon was born out of that competition.",

This was the fifth time he's reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament. He's now one step closer to winning one in his own nation.

He will be absolutely desperate to try andgo all the way at this year's U.S. Open, but so too will the young American Emma Navarro who continues to break through so impressively this calendar year. The 23-year-old, she's the daughter of the U.S. billionaire Ben Navarro, overcoming compatriot and defending champion, you'll recall, Coco Gauff in the previous round. Well, she's now gone and booked a spot in the first quarterfinal at this year's U.S. Open. Navarro taking care of business against Badosa, as you mentioned, straight sets. At one point though, she was left with a real mountain to climb in the second after going a double breakdown, but rallying superbly to stun her opponent from Spain and reach the last eight. Just another great win for Navarro. You may recall at the Aussie Open earlier this year, we saw her get to the third round at a slam for the very first time. She then gets to the fourth round at the French. I think you could see where this is going, because she then makes her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, that was at Wimbledon in London and now, the semis. Impressive stuff indeed. Wonderful improvement. Though, Navarro herself is not too surprised. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMA NAVARRO, AMERICAN 23-YEAR-OLD BEAT PAULA BADOSA IN STRAIGHT SETS: And when I look at my physical ability and my mental ability in this sport, it's not surprising. And I feel, you know, just more comfortable now with having good results and having success. And yes, I think I've had periods of both surprise and not surprised. But, you know, right now, I think I'm ready to be in this position. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
