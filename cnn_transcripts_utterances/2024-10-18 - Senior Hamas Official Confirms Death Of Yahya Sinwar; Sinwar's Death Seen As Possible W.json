Of course, a key priority at this point in time for the U.S. is the release of those hostages. However, Hamas has come out and said that nothing changes for them at this point. The conditions for a ceasefire remain the same. That is an end to Israel's war against the group. It's complete withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners. So how much of an opportunity for peace is there really? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a great question and I think these follow-up conversations are likely the most critical to watch if the Biden administration is able to actually take advantage of what they say is this momentous opportunity for there to actually be peace. Because they have rhetorically, publicly stated that they think that this is an opportunity now to drive forth and end to the conflict. But the question is, how do they actually do that? How do they actually get there given that both sides are not necessarily headed in that direction as you well point out? It's not even clear Prime Minister Netanyahu, even though, you know, he indicated that it is a time to secure the release of the hostages, it's not clear that he is ready to drive forth an end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, at least not at this moment. So those follow-up conversations that the secretary will be having in Israel and presumably other stops in the region as well, though we don't know his exact schedule yet, will be really critical in determining if that's possible. And one thing that we'll be watching for is, what kind of pressure the Biden administration can put on Israel and those regional counterparts to take advantage of this moment in time? One thing that we might be watching for would be a return of the conversations about normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. Of course, those conversations were largely dead ended just months ago, but it appears that there might be a reopening for those conversations to be restarted once again. But you have to also keep in mind that the Biden administration is running out an incredibly tight timeline right now. President Biden only has about three months left in his term. And in just a few weeks, of course, there's a U.S. presidential election, so he'll be a lame duck president shortly now. So officials are very clear about the fact that they don't have much time to work with now, but they are really energized in a way about what this moment could pretend in terms of reopening these conversations that were largely stalled, if not completely dead ended in recent weeks.",

You've got both groups now, without top voices, top commanders, you know, Sinwar obviously being killed this week. Nasrallah, who led Hezbollah since 1992, also assassinated as well.

Just given that we've now seen, as I noted, Israel call up yet another reserve brigade into that fighting. What do you make of that? And do you agree with them? Is this an opportunity, perhaps, for a pause or a ceasefire in the fighting in Southern Lebanon? SAYIGH Hi. I'm sort of struggling hard not to laugh, frankly. If President Biden had wanted a ceasefire anywhere, he would have had it. This whole year, we've seen time after time the president coming out in public or Secretary of State Tony Blinken coming out in public saying that they have got Israeli approval of a ceasefire deal only to have Netanyahu turn around and demolish that. And there's no question that the United States administration has the leverage. It's provided Israel with 18 billion worth of military assistance in the past year. So if President Biden actually wants a ceasefire, a pause, a truce, whatever you want to call it, anywhere, he can have it and get it. I think that -- but the other thing that's interesting about his remarks is the distinction he's made between Gaza and Lebanon. I think in Lebanon, this is where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu feels he's on the up. He's pushing his ratings in domestic opinion polls in Israel higher with the war in Lebanon that's very poplar across, you know, the political divide within Israel. And so he's not going to let go of that momentum, partly because he has, you know, higher aims or broader aims in terms of what he wants vis-a-vis Iran, eventually. But I think also because he feels this -- the wind is behind him in his sails right now. He's not going to stop. At the same time, the Biden administration appears to have, in effect, joined Netanyahu's approach, which is this is a great opportunity to fundamentally weaken Hezbollah and fundamentally weaken the Iranian position. And so I don't think this administration intends to hold Netanyahu back. So I would read his statement rather differently. As for Gaza, I'll just slip in quickly that I think it's clear Netanyahu has never wanted a ceasefire in Gaza. Much of his domestic political calculations now ride on maintaining a war. That war in Gaza is no longer so popular in Israel. People are pretty demoralize that the Israeli army has still not achieved total victory. And in that sense Netanyahu needs a different war front. And I think Biden, in this respect, is not spending any last political capital he has in the last remaining weeks of his presidency trying to differ with Netanyahu on this assessment.",

But your thoughts now on the U.S. sending that letter, demanding that Israel improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, otherwise, threatening to restrict access to arms to Israel.

But otherwise, they usually said that he would try not to lean into race. And I can tell you that during the presidency, when he leaned in on issues like Trayvon Martin, for example, or when, you know, black professor was arrested up at Harvard. They said -- they saw their poll numbers among white voters go down.

You know, we were really struggling with whether or not we even wanted to speak with the hostage family following the news of Yahya Sinwar's death, because, on the one hand, that is such a significant moment and so much reason to be hopeful that things could come to an end. But, as you know, there have just been so many ups and downs throughout this horrific year. And putting you through it is not something we took lightly. But I know you were speaking out on behalf of your father the way your mother is as well and has been since she's been released. Since we heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, before the confirmation even of Yahya Sinwar's death, he said one thing, and that was to hostage families, that there were no hostages around Yahya Sinwar at the time. And as you know, and we heard from Doron Spielman there, the IDF spokesperson, that he said that Israel would be willing to give amnesty to those that are currently holding hostages.
