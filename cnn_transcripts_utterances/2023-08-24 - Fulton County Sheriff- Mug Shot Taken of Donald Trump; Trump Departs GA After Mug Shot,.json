There are 19 defendants charged in this case.Kenneth Chesebro, one of the defendants has demanded his speedy trial rights, and Georgia has a very strict speedy trial law that essentially says, if a defendant wants to be tried quickly, he has a right to be tried with what amounts in this case to by November of this year 2023, not 2024, the trial has to start by then. And the DA has agreed to this and the judge has agreed to this. Now the question is, will any of the other defendants be pulled forward to have a trial that quickly? The DA, Fani Willis has said, I'm ready to try all 19 of them in late October 2023. The problem though, is she cannot force people who don't want a speedy trial, she cannot force defendants who do not want a speedy trial.",

Boy, what if someone really demands their speedy trial? We're not necessarily ready. I would guess that she is ready, and maybe he just wants a speedy trial. I mean, the reason we have speedy trial protections in our Constitution is because people aren't supposed to have cases lingering over them for longer than necessary or it could be that this is a sort of coordinated tactical maneuver where it was basically decided someone go first, be the canary in the coal mine, get out there, force them to do an early trial, so the rest of us can sit back and watch.",

I mean, this is a horrible situation.And every American watching this almost with no exceptions, would call this the worst day in their life. Right? Not only because they're indicted, not only because it's the fourth time in four months that they're indicted, but because 18 of your closest friends and advisers are now going to possibly lose everything because of your selfish behavior around not wanting to admit you got smoked by Joe Biden in an election.

Rudy Giuliani, one of the most famous people in the world starts calling these people crack dealers and everything you can possibly imagine. They'll never get that sense of safety back. They'll never get that sense of belonging and that -- And so, a prosecutor stood up for those people and said, you can't do that. And today, and by the way, this is a stable system working appropriately. You don't see riots, you don't see troops in the streets. You don't see mass demonstrations like you would in other countries. It is a stable system working appropriately, when people in office abuse their power and other branches stand up and say there are lines that should not be crossed. So there is some vindication here.

I think it's worth pausing here now that we've been through four of these arraignments indictments that our system has held up. There were questions. People would say, well, can we? Should we be trying a former president in a civilian criminal court? Can we sustain that? And now we've been through this four times? We were nervous. I remember the first indictment here in Manhattan. Is there going to be a January 6th-like incident? Or is there going to be a lone wolf? There's a long way to go. But I think it's a good testament to our criminal justice system, to the people who protect it, the people who work in jails, prisons, and courthouses that we've done this now, four times, and it's gone the way it should.MILLER; We also have to remember, there is going to be a defense here. And the defense, you know is as you see people asked to be separated and severed. You know, the defense had planned to be a unified defense, which starts off with one, we were receiving in the campaign numerous reports of suspicious activity, fraud, and so on. Two, we didn't have the resources of the FBI or a large agency to investigate it, so, you know, we got people to look at it, we got all these reports in and we had all of these suspicions. Three, we took this evidence which wasn't fully baked, but it's what we had at the time, and to try and slow down the process, we went to courts and dozens of them refused to hear us, either on the evidence, but mostly on standing, then we went to legislative bodies. So their overarching argument is going to be, it doesn't matter if we won or lost, it doesn't matter if we were right or wrong, it doesn't even matter if we lived in a press conference. When it came to using the system, we went to the courts, we went to the legislative bodies, and we believe we did it by the book. Now, you have a special prosecutor in Washington and a district attorney in Fulton County who say there were things that weren't true, they knew they weren't true. This was actually a calculated fraud, actually a racketeering exercise, but the only -- I've been involved in in a million investigations as a reporter, and as an investigator, and an analyst in police departments and the FBI, you never really know the full story till you hear it all in court, and both sides put all their evidence out on the table, even if you think you do.",

It is unconventional for somebody to just keep fighting. You're not supposed to do that. And usually, a hundred years, you just -- that's not unlawful. It's not unlawful to play in the extra innings.

Is it going to play out -- are voters going to rethink -- are primary voters going to rethink their vote when they go to the caucuses in Iowa, when they go to the polls in New Hampshire, when they vote in South Carolina?I mean, that's to be determined yet. And, you know, we still have got a long way to go here. Fani Willis and others have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did all of these things. So the question becomes, what political impact does this have? Does it have -- if Trump gets -- if he gets convicted after the convention, what happens? You know, there are so many different iterations. Or if he's going to the convention, if somebody mount a floor fight, a challenge on the floor of the convention like Ted Cruz is going to do in 2016 and say, we're going to wrestle this away from you. We don't think a president should be doing this. There is going to be splinter group of the party that tries to do that. I mean, that's -- I think, that's -- for Republicans, you know, last night, they asked who's going to vote for the president -- you know, who would vote for Trump? Everybody shot their hands up.

First they negotiated bond, then he surrendered. Then they schedule this first hearing before the judge.And the District Attorney Fani Willis has said she would like to do these arraignments the week of September 5. So the former president and his 18 co-defendants will all have to come back to Fulton County for that arraignment. We can also expect pretty much simultaneously to continue to see legal challenges. We know that Mark Meadows and Jeffrey Clark have already filed challenges trying to move their cases to federal court. We expect the former president will likely try the same. Rudy Giuliani has also suggested on one of his podcasts that he intends to do that. But, Jake, we also have to see these legal teams really solidify. This might be part of why the former president just secured his new attorney, because they only have a finite amount of time after that arraignment to file certain challenges to this indictment. So someone, for example, Rudy Giuliani, needs to figure out who is going to represent him throughout this trial, because, of course, the lawyer who helped with his bond, Brian Tevis, has been non-committal about handling this entire case.

Whether it would make it to the Supreme Court, is it an issue of first impression? It's always possible.We've seen a lot of issues around the former president make their way closer to the Supreme Court, if not make it before the bench. But the other thing is, if he wins, right? Potentially, the U.S. attorney could be the same district attorney he's facing now. They could waive in the DA Fani Willis. It would still be a case under state law, but it would be a different jury pool. And that's another thing that the former president, for example, is angling for. Fulton County is a predominantly Democratic district, and they believe that even if they can't get the case dismissed at the federal level, if they could just get the broader jury pool, that could potentially be more favorable for the former president or any of his co-defendants. But it's a very unique situation, and it's pretty fascinating to see how the legal system works and how everybody's trying to game it out here.

But sometimes in cases where you don't think you'll get enough people from just that division, you may draw from the entire district, which would obviously mean even from the North Georgia area where Marjorie Taylor Greene is from and other people who might be favorable to Trump. So it expands even further if they need to do it. This is -- it wouldn't be unprecedented. They drew a larger jury in the Arbery case in South Georgia because they needed to make sure that they had enough people who didn't have some preconceived idea about the case and that's what's going to be difficult here. This jury selection could go on for some time as they try to find some panel of 12 plus some alternates who have no real feelings one way or another about the former president. And that becomes, I think, a difficulty. You just look at sort of public polling even on that.",

What -- I mean, do you think this transferring it to a federal jurisdiction, drawing from wider parts of the state geographically means that ultimately the odds that Donald Trump will at least have one juror -- because that's all you need -- one juror who will vote to acquit? I mean -- MCCABEmore in his favor if he gets the case removed to federal court for all the reasons that Michael said. But I think it's important to also emphasize that if he gets into federal court, he's halfway to getting this thing dismissed on Supremacy Clause grounds, right? So he's got to get into federal court in order to make that next argument which will be you should dismiss this case because I was acting within the scope of my federal authority. And, you know, that's another whole argument. But that would be, I'm sure, any of these defendants optimal result.",
