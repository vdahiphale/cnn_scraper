I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with the manhunt that continues for this man. 38- year-old Francisco Oropesa has been the focus of a desperate manhunt since Friday night. That's when neighbors asked him to stop firing his rifle in the front yard because they were trying to get a baby to go to sleep. Police say Oropesa then entered their home and began shooting. An 8-year-old boy was among the five neighbors slaughtered, almost execution-style, that according to the sheriff in that area. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Cleveland, Texas, for us. Ed, I know you're on the scene of a vigil that just took place a short time ago for the little 8-year-old who was killed in all of this. And it just underlines once again what we're dealing with in this country. Just another awful tragedy stemming from mass gun violence.",

He is the father of the young boy that was shot and killed. His wife was also shot and killed. It was his property where the shooting took place. And he just spoke with us and spoke very lovingly of his son and the anguish that his family is feeling at this moment, but he also detailed the horrific events that led to this shooting.Wilson Garcia told us that on Friday night, they called 911 five times, asking for help to deal with this neighbor, Francisco Oropesa, who was shooting his firearms on his property next door to where their baby was sleeping. Garcia told us that he and two other men walked over and asked him not just to stop shooting, they said, would you mind going to the other side of your property so it wouldn't be so close to their home. He said that 10 to 20 minutes later that this suspect came back over to their house, didn't say anything else, and then just started shooting. That his wife was one of the first to be shot and killed. And what he described after that, Jim, was absolutely heartbreaking. He said that one of the women inside the home told him to jump out of a window and to run because his wife was dead and that his two other surviving children needed a parent. So he jumped out of the window and started running away. He said that there were 15 people inside the house, so that there were 10 survivors, and that some hid under piles of blankets in the closet to get away from the shooting and the rampage. Heartbreaking and just really terrible details to listen to in this account that Wilson Garcia has shared with us. In the meantime, investigators here in Cleveland, Texas, northeast of Houston are mainly focused on this manhunt. It's been nearly 48 hours since this suspect got away. Investigators here say they have no signs of where he might be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Switching gears to a financial story we're watching closely. Right now, one of the troubled banks that's been in the spotlight is being auctioned off by the FDIC. Final bids for San Francisco-based First Republic were due a few hours ago. This follows a staggering 97 percent drop in its stock price since March 1st and comes despite a $30 billion lifeline that apparently fell short of what was needed. And joining us now to discuss this is CNN's Matt Egan. Matt, what does this auction entail? And I have to ask you, now that we're sort of getting into the evening hours of Sunday, you know, we're not that -- 14 hours and a half, maybe, from when the market opens on Wall Street. I have to imagine they got to get this done tonight or people are going to be a little nervous tomorrow morning.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, that's right. I mean, investors and U.S. officials, they are hoping that a white knight emerges here to rescue First Republic. The FDIC, it held an auction this weekend, trying to entice big banks to acquire this ailing regional bank. That is according to a person familiar with the matter.Now we don't know yet, though, what the results of that auction are. And we don't really know yet who bid on First Republic. We've been checking with our sources, but, you know, we haven't heard anything. It's been quiet, really quiet the last few hours, even though final bids were due three hours ago. And you would imagine something would get announced some time pretty soon. U.S. officials would like to get something resolved to ease this concern in the marketplace. Certainly before U.S. markets open tomorrow morning, but ideally before Asian markets open next hour. Now, First Republic Bank, it has been teetering really for weeks. This company's stock price is down 97 percent. Look at that chart, 97 percent since March. It was trading above $122 March 1. It's now below $4. And this is not some tiny community bank. It's actually the 12th biggest commercial bank in the United States. It was sitting on $233 billion of loans and other assets. Based in San Francisco, it caters to wealthy clients. It's got branches in Beverly Hills and Palm Beach, Greenwich, Connecticut. It even has a branch right across the street from our offices here in Montana. The problem is that two-thirds of its deposits were uninsured as of the end of last year. That means above the $250,000 limit that the FDIC insures. And a lot of bank customers, they got very nervous after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month. We saw that First Republic lost 41 percent of its deposits in the first quarter alone. That translates to a loss of $72 billion in deposits. Jim, now we are just waiting to see if a big bank will come to the rescue of First Republic. And if U.S. officials are able to stop this bank crisis from spreading to other banks.",

The Fed is set to meet this week and it's widely expected to raise rates another quarter of a percent, which could complicate the sale of First Republic and add to some concerns there on Wall Street. Joining us now is CNN economics and political commentator Catherine Rampell. She's also an opinion columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" Catherine, great to see you. What do you think about what is happening tonight with First Republic, and might the Fed's decision hinge on what happens with this First Republic auction? I mean, I suppose you might see a scenario where we don't get an auction tonight or it doesn't end with the sale of First Republic Bank. Wall street gets a little jittery tomorrow, and that might affect what the Fed does. What do you think?",

That would be the best solution for the stability of the overall financial system as well as the current customers of First Republic Bank. And when I say the stability of the overall financial system, what I mean is, if there is a failure, if this goes into receivership, if they can't find a buyer, if it drags out for a while as it did in the case of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, where they were, you know, trying to sell off the different assets of those institutions, then you could see some additional contagion effects.And in fact on Friday, we already saw some other regional banks after, you know, there have been stories breaking that First Republican Bank might be going into receivership by the FDIC, there had been a number of other banks that saw their own stock prices fall after hours, in fact because of these additional fear of contagion. It's the same thing we've been seeing basically for the past month. The hope is that this can be tied up with a neat little bow. First Republic, the problems with First Republic, which have been ongoing for a while, will be done with and then everybody can move on. Because, again, part of the problem here has to do with mismanagement at some of these banks, but part of it is the additional stress on the financial system because of those interest rate hikes. Some of which was foreseeable. It doesn't mean that the interest rate hikes were necessarily the wrong decision, but if the Fed is still going to keep its eye on the ball and try to tamp down inflation, it's probably going to consider at the very least or it's expected to raise interest rates again this week. And so, you know, more anxiety about the fragility of the financial system will complicate those discussions.",

A lot of social issues right now that, you know, I agree with Ronna McDaniel that Republicans are going to have to hit this head on in terms of talking about it.

And on abortion, I think there's a middle ground between pro-life and pro-choice, but we're looking at some regulatory issues, right, at a certain point when we determine personhood based on science, but I think up to a certain point, there is not one woman out there who wants the government in the way of their decision making with their body, you know, and a child that they're carrying at the time. And, you know, again, just looking at the field right now, they've got to run to the right to win the primary, Jim, they've got to do that and if they don't do that, they're not going to win. So, you know, you sort of hope and cross your fingers if it is an Asa Hutchinson or something like that.

What I think happened in the Trump years was that we saw a candidate so dismissive of the constitutional order, our democratic norms, and ultimately, the transfer -- the peaceful transfer of power that I think it caused a lot of people to wonder why evangelicals were so committed and that is also part of the story.",
