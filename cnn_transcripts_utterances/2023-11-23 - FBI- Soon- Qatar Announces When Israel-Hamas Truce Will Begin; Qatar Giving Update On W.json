      "sentences": "So first and what this is all predicated upon is a pause in the fighting. So, the troops in Israel -- I'm sorry that Israeli troops in Gaza will take defensive positions. And we expect that after about 40, something days of war nearing the seven-week mark of this war, there will be for the first time, a stop in the fighting. Once that's established and likely confirmed by both sides, the hostage release itself begins. And from everything we understand the framework hasn't changed here, even as they hammer out the last logistical details to make this happen. And that framework is the release of 50 Israeli women and children held in Gaza over the course of four days of a pause in the fighting in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails, who will be released, and from there likely go home to where they are in the occupied West Bank and in Jerusalem.In terms of how this works out on the ground, Hamas will transfer the hostages to the Red Cross, the Red Cross will then bring the hostages to one of several crossing points between either Gaza and Egypt at the Rafah crossing. That's where we saw the hostages come out at the beginning, those four who came out early on, or they'll cross straight into Israel, from Gaza. From there, they will be taken into the care of the IDF, soldiers will get them to hospitals, and then depending on their age, that will determine how quickly they meet their family. Hostages who are at least or who are 12 years or younger, will immediately meet their family, while hostages who are over the age of 12 years will be taken to the hospital. And that's where they will meet their family. But as is the case right now, there is no final word that on when this all happens. The expectation is not sooner than tomorrow, Israel not being very careful with its words as we wait on the country foreign ministry to hold a press conference and say when they expect this to begin. Very difficult moments for the families who have been this close before only to see things fall apart. And here they are with what is a sign deal moving forward here, still waiting to find out who's coming out, when they're coming out, and how long until their pain ends.",

And yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his press conference last night not only spoke about this, he pulled out a document that appeared to be the agreement itself and read one of the clauses they're saying the Red Cross will visit the other hostages who do not come out.So, it's quite shocking to hear the confidence with which he expressed that. And then to have a statement from the Red Cross saying, they're not a party to this agreement and don't know what this entails. So that will certainly have to be clarified. And at the rate this is going it will have to be clarified very quickly. It's worth noting that under international law, the Red Cross is supposed to be able to visit hostages.",

That is when we will take it because of course, we want to hear these updates, what indication they could have and what it could mean for the families of these hostages. We did just hear from the Israeli prime minister, he's meeting with the British Defense Secretary, Defense Minister, David Cameron -- Foreign Secretary, excuse me, during his meeting here, as he's on the ground meeting, not only with Israeli leaders, but also Palestinian leaders.

In fact, he was asked about how the pause in fighting would work. And it was specifically asked what happens if a soldier is shot at and he wouldn't give a specific answer there too. So, he's being very cautious with his warning, especially now since we've seen the delay. And it should be worth noting that it seems Israel was very much expecting this to happen today, because the government press office, which is under the Prime Minister's office was prepared -- preparing a room for journalists to view the crossings and the video coming out of there.So, it seems that Israel also expected this to come tomorrow. Now Netanyahu being very careful in his wording there, talking about the challenges, and the final details. The framework has long been as we know it the 50 -- for the 150 more aid going into Gaza, the pause in fighting even the length. We've known this for quite some time. But it's the details and the final details hammering those out who's released, how exactly did they come out the locations, the routes, the crossing sites that it seems is where this got caught up.
