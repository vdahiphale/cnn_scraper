This is a witness that was requested by the Trump team. They have asked Robert Costello, he's an attorney, well-known figure in Trump world, he has represented other Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon. And once upon a time, he also represented Michael Cohen. So the Trump team wants Costello to go before the grand jury and testify to undermine Michael Cohen's credibility. And that is significant because Cohen is really essential witness here in this investigation.Now also making things interesting, Cohen and his attorney will also be at the court around the same time. We know Cohen does not like it when people question his credibility. So this is of somewhat of a provocative move by the Trump legal team but it is their right. And the grand jury will have the option about whether they want to hear from this witness. We expect they will.",

But I'm told, if they had not granted this request in terms of optics, it would not have looked good, it probably would have become a thing. Now true question of timing. We know over the weekend, the former president put on through social that he's going to be arrested Tuesday. Now his own team came out and contradicted that. They said, look, we have no evidence to suggest that is the case. Our own reporting also suggests there is no guarantee that anything is going to happen tomorrow or at all. Though it certainly does appear that this investigation is moving into its final stages. And I will say, we don't know the strength of the case. We don't know all the evidence. There could be a reason that all of this is happening now because right now it's not clear why after five years, this is suddenly heating up. But what we do know is this is certainly not the most consequential case that he faces, and we will see if he is indicted.",

The seditious and insurrection charges would disqualify Donald Trump from public office under the 14th Amendment Section 3. Those really should be the first charges to be brought. They should have been brought a long time ago. It's been over two years since the insurrection of January 6th.

So law enforcement has to be prepared. They have to be coordinated. They have to have those contingency plans in place. Hopefully, they never have to use it.

And he would like to bolster his own domestic support and his international legitimacy by somehow demonstrating that he is really an international statesman and peacemaker. And if he can get Putin to make any positive proposals at all, he will claim that this is his great achievement.But of course, even more important is the phone call that he reportedly plans to have with President Zelenskyy, and unless President Zelenskyy shows any positive response to what Xi Jinping has to say afterwards, then this whole thing will be a big act that is designed to bolster the legitimacy of Xi Jinping.",

I think that he would like to see the war end in a way that reduces the pressure that Xi Jinping is now under to appear to be neutral but in reality, at least morally and politically, support Putin.Let's go back to the beginning. Putin really tricked Xi Jinping with this statement of friendship without limit on the eve of his brutal invasion of Ukraine. And yet, even with that trap, Xi Jinping continues to express moral support for Russia and for Putin. And of course, if the two of them appear to be standing together on the side of peace, what they will want to do is to pit the United States and the West as kind of the warmongers, the cold warriors, if you will. And this will put a lot of pressure on Europe in particular. Europe has firmly stood behind Ukraine up until now, but it's been, and of course, the winter has not been as cold, so it hasn't -- the pressure hasn't been quite as acute. But with time, it becomes more and more difficult for the Europeans to stand completely with Ukraine. And if Russia and China appear to be the peacemakers and they have some credible way of doing that, that will put a lot of pressure on the pro Ukrainian side in the war.
