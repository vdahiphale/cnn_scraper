I'm Kaitlan Collins.Tonight, one of America's most wanted suspects, the alleged leaker of highly classified U.S. Intelligence, is now under arrest, after a massive manhunt. The FBI, taking 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, into custody, in Massachusetts, in a dramatic scene, that unfolded, with agents, carrying rifles, outside his home. The Air National Guardsman is accused of the unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified defense information. The Feds believe that he's the one, who leaked that trove of secret documents, online, which first appeared, last month, on the social media gaming platform, Discord. These are documents that provide insight, into U.S. intelligence activities, not just here, but worldwide, tactical information, about the war, in Ukraine, and much more. Some of them could be as recent as last month. The Pentagon says that this major breach has presented an incredibly serious risk, to national security. Teixeira will be appearing, in court, tomorrow, in Boston, for the first time. He's an Airman First Class, which has raised major questions, of how a low-ranking member of the military had access to so much sensitive information. Former U.S. Attorney General, Bill Barr, is here. He'll react to this, and the investigations, into his former boss, Donald Trump. But first, I want to bring in an all-star cast of my CNN colleagues, to discuss this. Evan Perez, Abby Phillip, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, and John Miller, all here, tonight, to discuss this. John, I want to start with you.

The Justice Department, announcing today, it is going to take emergency -- an emergency dispute, over medication abortion drugs, to the High Court.I'm joined now, by the Senate Judiciary Committee member, Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota. Thanks so much for being here, tonight, Senator. What do you expect the Supreme Court is going to do here? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Thanks, Kaitlan. When I look at the law, and the facts, of this case, I don't understand how they could let this ruling, from one judge, in Amarillo, Texas, stand. It then goes, as you know, today, a surprise ruling, in the Fifth Circuit, where they actually maybe narrowed a little, but it is still absolutely absurd, opposed by the American Medical Association. Why? Because now as it stands, these two Trump judges, on the Fifth Circuit, in addition to the one Trump judge, in Amarillo, said this. The two Trump judges said, \"OK, well, you are not going to be able, women of America, to use the drug, Mifepristone, that's used in half of the abortions, in this country, for 10 weeks. You can only use it for seven, in our non-medical judgment. And two other things. You can't get it in the mail, and you can't get it in the pharmacies.\" That's what they said. So, that is the case that now goes to the Supreme Court. They have one day, to stop this, from taking effect, for a huge number of states, in this country, a huge number of women, in this country. And there is a way, for them, at least, for now, to get out of this. And that is by simply saying the truth, which is the people that brought this case, a very small number of doctors, do not have, what we call, standing. They are not hurt now. And they're not going to be hurt in the future by this case. And they should not be able to bring this case.

And that judge said he's not listening to the Fifth Circuit. He has made his own case. So, this is all going to end up in the Supreme Court.

But if it goes on and on and on and on, then we're down one vote, in the Senate. In what is still only a one-vote margin, that becomes a whole different issue that I think she's going to have to make serious decision, at that point, because when you have such a close vote, in the Senate, then you do need to have all the votes, there.
