Can you give us more information about how they assert Israel is doing that and what Israel's response has been to that accusation?RIPLEY (on-camera): Israel's response is to change the visa procedures for U.N. officials who provide vital aid to Gaza. But Israel says also are on the ground there turning the world against the Israeli military who say they are justified in striking the targets that they're striking, even with the skyrocketing number of civilian deaths and injuries, because they say that Hamas is deliberately abetting themselves within these heavily densely populated areas. Israel says international law makes even a mosque or a school or a hospital a legitimate military target if indeed your enemy is operating there, and you stand to make a tactical advantage by striking. Now, the U.N., of course, has been calling out the horrific situation on the ground. Now their visas will not be approved automatically only on a case by case basis, which critics say will basically slow down the process of getting people and help into Gaza when they need it most. And also, will effectively silence those voices who are on the ground telling the outside world what's happening. NOBILO: Will Ripley in Tel Aviv for us, thank you very much. Intense fighting in Ukraine shows no signs of abating. In the southern city of Kherson, a railway station came under Russian attack, killing a policeman and injuring several others on Tuesday. And that is according to the Interior Minister, who adds that people had gathered there to evacuate the area. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian commander says Eastern Ukraine is coming under increased bombardment from armored vehicles, drones and artillery shelling. Let's bring in our Fred Pleitgen to discuss this. Fred, there's been a lot of discussion over the last day or so about this strike on a Russian naval vessel in Crimea, but it's a little bit of a distraction from the broader picture here, as we've heard that Ukrainian forces have retreated from Maryinka, which marks one of Russia's biggest successes, surely, in the last six months on the battlefield.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right, Bianca, that the bombing of the Novocherkassk landing craft of that ship on the eastern side of Crimea, that that certainly is somewhat of a distraction from the bigger picture where Ukraine certainly seems to be increasingly on the back foot, especially on the eastern front, as you've mentioned.No doubt it was a huge feat for the Ukrainians to hit that landing craft, especially since it's nowhere near any territory that Ukraine controls. Apparently, they used air launch cruise missiles for that. But the Ukrainians themselves are acknowledging that they're having a really difficult time on large parts of the eastern front. Maryinka is one of those places. Maryinka, though, is a place that really has been completely destroyed over the past year and a half that the full on invasion of the Russians against Ukraine has been going on. Even when I was close to that area, in February of last year, they were already saying that most of that town had been completely destroyed. And certainly some of the videos that we're seeing on our screen right now, which are actually from Russian TV, which is obviously trying to play this up, show that there's basically not a single building standing there, and you see some of them have just been basically reduced to crumbs of what they were before. So, it is certainly something where the Russians can say that they've completely taken that town, but they really don't have much that they've taken. One of the big battles that is still going on though, and that certainly is very fierce at this point in time, is Avdiivka, the one that we've been talking about a lot over the past couple of weeks. The Russians still launching big assaults on that area, the Ukrainians are saying. They're saying that so far they're keeping the Russians in check, but it is increasingly difficult, especially in light of the fact that the Ukrainians are dealing with severe ammunition shortages, of course, on the one hand, getting less from the United States, and on the other hand, also, their European partners not being able to make up for that, Bianca.",

He was best known for his role in the film \"Parasite\", the dark comedy that became the first non-English language film to win a best picture Oscar. Police say that Lee was reported missing by his manager and was later found in his car. Lee claimed that he was tricked into using drugs and then blackmailed by that same person. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is covering this live from Hong Kong for us. This is such a shocking death to hear about and I'm sure is sending just ripple effects throughout all of South Korea.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We use electric heating. STEWART (voice-over): Even though the government helps to pay the bill, for some families, it can still be a lot. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Frankly speaking, this is not as good as the high rise, which has 24-hour central heating, but it's not too cold here right now either. STEWART (voice-over): The Arctic chill has been felt far beyond Beijing. Across the country, coal powered plants have been on full drive to warm up homes. Yet, problems at a plant in Central China forced heating in one city to be temporarily cut. And in northwest China, the weather got in the way of rescue efforts after last week's deadly earthquake. Residents in the quake zone set bonfires to get warm. A burning stove and a bowl of warm noodles enough to comfort these children. Back in Beijing, the forecast is for the cold wave to pass, making tasks in the city of more than 20 million people a bit more tolerable. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

To put pressure on Mexico to do more to stem the flow of migrants and drive down the number of border crossings.Right now, some 11,000 migrants from Central and South America are waiting in shelters and camps on the Mexican side of the border, desperate for their chance to enter the United States. Let's get to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez at the White House for us. Priscilla, really good to see you. So you have new reporting, I'm told, on what the administration might ask for at the border.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Officials have shared with me the request that they are going into these meetings with to try to drive down the number of migrants at the U.S.- Mexico border. This has been an urgent issue for the White House and it's telling how urgent it is by who is attending these meetings. That's Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.Now, here is the asks that I'm told officials will be looking for. This includes moving migrants south. Those are migrants who are at the northern border of Mexico and interested in crossing into the U.S. Controlling railways, which are often used by migrants to more quickly get to the U.S. southern border and also providing incentives for migrants to stay in Mexico. That includes, for example, visas. Now, all of this is an extension of a call between President Biden and the Mexican president just last week, as numbers on the U.S. southern border have surged. To give you a sense here, by the numbers, the seven-day average in December was 9,600 migrant encounters. That's up from November when it was around 6,800. So clearly, the numbers have been increasing and creating more pressure for the Biden administration, especially as border towns have grown restless. So this is a step that the U.S. is taking to try to provide some relief to the U.S. southern border. And historically, the U.S. has leaned on Mexico to try to manage the flow of migration. In fact, the start of the year, President Biden went to Mexico to talk about migration with his Mexican counterpart. We're now at the end of the year, and the two are still trying to tackle what has been an urgent challenge across the Western Hemisphere.

The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Apple's latest watches violate patents registered to another company. And, as expected, the White House didn't take emergency action to overturn that ban. So, for now, top of the line watches like the Series 9 and Ultra 2 cannot be sold in the U.S. until Apple makes some changes.Apple says it's pursuing both legal and technical options to get the affected watches back on shelves, including submitting a redesign for U.S. Customs approval. The company is asking for a stay on the ban until the U.S. Customs can consider its redesign, which is expected to happen by mid-January. Time magazine's person of the year has had a very successful 2023. Taylor Swift's North American shows alone surpassed $2 billion in revenue, making her concert tour the highest grossing of all time.

(SINGING) STEWART (voice-over): In fact, she is Time \"Person of the Year.\" Even in Taylor Swift's wildest dreams, it would be hard to imagine greater success, or bigger revenues. Not one but three bestselling albums. They're not all exactly new, \"1989\" and \"Speak Now\" were re- recorded as Swift continues to reclaim ownership of her music.",

And it was just no denying that, you know, what she has achieved over the last 12 months, in my lifetime at least, from a productivity and a quality point of view, is sort of unprecedented. STEWART (voice-over): Bloomberg says Swift came a billionaire in October, and Swift-fluence spread beyond music this year. The artist was spotted not on the bleachers, but in a box, as she debuted a new relationship. (SINGING) STEWART (voice-over): The \"Love Story\" boosted ticket sales and NFL TV ratings.
