At one point, he alleged that the private investigator working for MGN fitted a tracking device in the car of former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, he described an article in the now defunct British magazine The People that gave great detail on a private conversation between him and his father now King Charles, saying that kind of article just perpetuated feelings of distrust within all of my relationships. Harry highlighted this picture, an article published by the Sunday Mirror in 2007, which shows him dropping Davy off in a private road near Kensington Palace. He said he was suspicious of the means by which the photographer knew about this location, it posed a security risk. One by one, the court went through articles published in the 1990s and 2000s. Harry detailing his suspicions about how the information was sourced. Green would then point to legitimate ways MGN reporters could have gathered information on him, such as via palace spokespeople. He repeatedly accused Harry of entering into the realms of speculation, and this accusation that led to Harry's only real show of emotion in his two day appearance. Later, he was questioned by his own lawyer about how it felt to be repeatedly accused of speculating, having to sit through so much cross examination, how he paused for a long time and got visibly choked up. Harry's evidence finished early in the afternoon, and the court then heard from Jane Kerr, a former Mirror journalist who wrote many of the articles Harry identified in his testimony. Kerr has been defending her stories and is denied using any illegitimate means to obtain information. MGN is contesting all of Harry's claims saying he lacks evidence or they've been brought too late. Harry said in court today that he would feel some injustice if he and other claimants lost their case.

CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Whether it is gobbling up golf rights or signing yet another global soccer star, or setting oil price trends -- Saudi cutting production by one million barrels a day -- or in diplomacy -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken's three-day visit -- many, many roads now seem to lead to Riyadh. U.S. relations with the desert kingdom have been rocky, President Biden making democracy and human rights a core issue. But increasingly, Saudi's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, setting his own agenda. Blinken hoping to thaw U.S.-Saudi tensions and build on recent cooperation, hoping both Yemen and Sudan end internal conflicts. Ahead of his arrival, Blinken putting Israel on his agenda, too. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATES: The United States has a real national security interest in promoting normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. We believe that we can and, indeed, we must play an integral role in advancing it. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Blinken's days-long visit meeting not just Saudi officials, but regional and other diplomats, too. Discussing ISIS in Africa and Asia, and likely Iran's nuclear enrichment program, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine. All point to Saudi's growing influence. Monday the crown prince hosted Venezuela's president. Tuesday, Iran reopened its diplomatic mission in Riyadh, thanks in part to bin Salman strengthening ties with China. Last month he hosted Ukraine's President Zelenskyy; hopes to help broker peace there one day. Whether diplomacy or sport, MBS is thinking big. Eye-poppingly big. Listen to the Saudi private investment fund governor who bankrolled Saudi's Liv Golf tour, explain Saudis' growing influence in the world of golf. YASIR AL-RUMAYYAN, SAUDI PIF GOVERNOR: The potential there is really big. I mean, if you look at the -- the size of golf, of monetary wise, it's about 100 billion today. And I think the growth is -- it's there. ROBERTSON (voice-over): From Formula 1 to boxing to music festivals. MBS is reimagining his kingdom. As strange as it seems to many outside the region, outraged at the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, bin Salman is offering his population entertainment, unimaginable a decade ago, when religious conservatives he banished held sway. At home, his re-branding of Saudi Arabia has gained traction, albeit detractors risk jail if they speak out. Significantly, however, he has yet to persuade the world he can be trusted.

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, you know, \"The Little Mermaid,\" as you just mentioned, it is dramatically underperforming in these key markets, South Korea and China, the world's second largest box office, amid racist critiques and criticism out there.The black actress Halle Bailey has been praised for her inspired, star-making turn as the main character, Ariel, in this Disney remake. But apparently, that's just not enough to win over certain would-be viewers in China and South Korea who simply can't get over the fact that Disney cast her in this part. Now, the film has found success in many countries around the world. Let's walk through some data points for you. According to Comscore, globally, the film has made some $327 million. But China, again, the world's second largest box office, has contributed a very, very small amount. According to Ndata (ph) -- this is a Chinese box office tracker -- in mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days. And you have to compare that to \"Spider-man Across the Spiderverse,\" which in the same period of time brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of its opening. And some in mainland China have been openly sharing their thoughts and objections online. You know, one Netizen on Malyen (ph) -- this is a Chinese movie box office platform -- said, quote, \"The fairytale that I grew up with has changed beyond recognition.\" And Chinese state media has encouraged such reactions. In, fact this op-ed that was published before the film's debut in China in The Global Times\" says this: quote, \"The controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but it's lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy,\" unquote. Now, Disney declined to comment on the story to CNN. I should add that similar reaction has been found online in South Korea, with one user there saying that the movie had been, quote, \"ruined,\" and using the hashtag \"#notmyariel. According to the Korean film council, in South Korea, this film, \"The Little Mermaid,\" attracted some -- more data here -- 472,000 viewers in the first week, and compare that to the 643,000 fans that showed up for the latest \"Fast and Furious\" sequel over the same period -- John.",
