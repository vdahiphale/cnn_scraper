What's top of mind for them? More than one telling us reproductive rights. I know that there's a national conversation about inflation, the economy, but, here, we're hearing about this issue of abortion, perhaps no surprise, given where we are. We are in Fulton County. That is a heavily Democratic county. More generally, though, some people say they just want to get it over with, get it done early. One woman joking: \"Hey, I might break my leg on November 8, so I just don't want to leave it up to chance.\" The secretary of state here, Brad Raffensperger, saying this surge in early voting really illustrates that Georgia's voting infrastructure is sound, and that Georgia sort of should be the envy of other states across the country for its election administration. But Raffensperger's Democratic opponent, Bee Nguyen, says that is not so, that Republicans in this state should not get credit for Democrats being able to out-organize what she characterizes as voter suppression. But, yes, a key Senate race here that could determine the balance of power in Washington, and we see folks are motivated to participate because of that as well -- Ana.",

But, really, at this point, it's about driving turnout. We heard similar from Senator Ron Johnson at an event yesterday, where he said he wants Republicans to vote early. Today is now the second day of early in person voting here in the state. As you mentioned, polls have shown no clear leader between the Senate candidates. We're also seeing the same thing at the gubernatorial level between Democrat Tony Evers and Republican Tim Michels. Evers will be campaigning with Elizabeth Warren here in the state who's coming through, while Michels will be appearing with Virginia's Governor Glenn Youngkin, all of them keenly aware we are less than two weeks to Election Day. And here in Wisconsin, we have seen a steady increase in midterm voter turnout going back to 1990, a general trend upward. So we will see if that trend continues here with a lot on the line -- Ana.",

This is an issue that Congressman Lee Zeldin has been focusing on for weeks.But we also saw from Kathy Hochul talking about some of the issues she's been focused on for months, trying to tie Lee Zeldin to the former President Donald Trump. Zeldin was an early supporter. But, really, if you look at this debate last night, the question is whether or not either candidate was able to score enough political points to really change the dynamics of this race. There weren't any huge gaffes or big knockout punches, but there is clearly a lot of enthusiasm on the Zeldin side. That is why we're seeing this race becoming closer and closer. And that's one of the big issues that Democrats have to be concerned about. We did some reporting late last week talking to voters throughout Brooklyn. And we noticed, on the Democratic side, registered Democrats, they might say, yes, I know who I'm voting for. I know I'm going to vote for the governor, but I'm not very excited about it. If you talk to folks anecdotally about kind of just lawn signs that you're seeing out on Long Island -- this is -- it's a state race, so out on Long Island, where Lee Zeldin is from, you're seeing a lot of Zeldin signs, not as many Hochul signs. Of course, a lawn sign or a sign in your window could just be a lawn sign, but it's also a sign, potentially a signal of enthusiasm. So that's another big issue. And when it comes to what Zeldin would have to do to win, to become the first Republican elected to statewide office in 20 years, he'd have to win Upstate. Now, Upstate is more rural. That's more possible. But, of course, Kathy Hochul is from Buffalo. So she's a known entity Upstate, and she has been known as a moderate. Zeldin would also have to do well in these downstate suburbs, either win them or do very well in them. But, most importantly, he would have to do very well here in New York City, so about 35 or 40 percent of the vote, he'd have to get in New York City, New York City representing more than 40 percent of the state's population.",

Yes, they elected a moderate Democrat who ran on a crime-fighting message, but they have also elected socialists and women to the city council, so -- a lot of women to the city council. So this is -- it's not clear that Zeldin will be able to close the deal here. But we do know that this is too close for comfort for the governor.",

And this one is crazy, $28 billion in hidden cable fees in 2019 alone. Now, the companies would argue that these fees are justified and that they are providing a service. But Biden regulators, they are skeptical. I just talked to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, and he told me that people are -- quote -- \"sick and tired of these surprise fees\" and that there is an all-of-government effort to attack them. Now, we should note that one of the things that they have attacked today, they have signaled a crackdown on overdraft fees. We have seen in the last year-and-a-half a bunch of big banks say goodbye to overdraft fees, Ally Bank, Capital One, and Citibank. The CFPB director, he told me that he wouldn't be surprised to see more and more banks do the same, Ana.",

More concerning, this is down by 11 percent from a year ago. Now, this makes sense because it's been an awful year for the stock market. Look at this. The S&amp;P 500 started the year around $4,800. It's now $3,750. It's come up just a bit in the last few days. But this is really just a drop in the bucket. If you look bigger picture, the Dow is down by 12 percent so far this year, the S&amp;P 500 down 19 percent. This is on track to be the worst year since,you guessed it, 2008. The Nasdaq has almost lost 30 percent of its value. This is, of course, because of recession fears, because of inflation concerns, because of this aggressive Federal Reserve, but, Ana, not surprising.

And so we did not see the typical surges we see every fall, winter of RSV, of even the flu. And so now we're paying for it, in the sense that all those children, that whole cohort that was born or raised at a young age in those last couple years did not get exposed to RSV. And, typically, this is a virus that most kids have, most adults get before the age of 2. So you have a whole group of people now getting exposed to it all at once. In addition, the timing is off a little bit. We see that too, the seasonal changes. So, typically, this is a fall/winter. We have seen the onset a little bit earlier. But this was really predicted. In fact, there was an article published last August by a pediatric disease infectious group. They put out a position statement saying we very well may see a rise, a surge in the coming years. We should be prepared for it. They did mathematical modeling. So this is not unheard of. It's just really what was unheard of was the kind of unprecedented hygiene or mitigation strategies.
