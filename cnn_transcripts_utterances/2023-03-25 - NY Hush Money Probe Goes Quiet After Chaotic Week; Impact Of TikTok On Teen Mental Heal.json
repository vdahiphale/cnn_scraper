He does under the law have to give Jack Smith's recommendation, quote, great weight. So he has to lean towards deferring to Jack Smith. But he does not automatically have to do that.He has to exercise Merrick Garland, what we call prosecutorial discretion. And I will tell you from day one at the Justice Department, I was there, you are trained. You are not a robot. Your job is not to take the inputs, the evidence and mechanically apply it to the law. And whatever spits out as the result, you do that. You ought to exercise broader discretion. And of course, that applies extremely to the Attorney General of the United States.",

If you're the attorney general, you have to think about how will this case reflect on this department? Will it promote public confidence in this department? Will it promote a sense of legitimacy? Will people believe in this case? So all of those are sort of softer factors, but they're absolutely in play for Merrick Garland.And, Michael, if you take a look at the justice manual, which is the official guidance to every prosecutor at DOJ from the Attorney General on down and you just word search, Ctrl F discretion, you will get dozens and dozens of hits virtually every section says that federal prosecutor has to exercise discretion.",

When the New York Times asked Costello about his two hours plus testimony he said this, quote, \"I told the grand jury that this guy couldn't tell the truth if you put a gun to his head.\" Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal charges involving payment to porn star Stormy Daniels who said she'd had an affair with Trump, a claim the former president denies. Cohen said Trump authorized the payment of claim backed up by federal prosecutors who referred to Trump as individual number one, when they wrote in proceedings that Cohen himself has now admitted with respect to both payments that he acted in coordination with and at the direction of individual one.

The Seattle City Council passed the ordinance in 2017. It barred most landlords from asking prospective tenants about their criminal history or refusing to rent to tenants because of their record. It was intended to help those with criminal records access housing and to protect against policies that might disproportionately harm renters of color because of disparities in the legal system. Joining me now is Seattle City council member Lisa Herbold, who was a sponsor of the original ordinance. Council person, thank you for being here. This is a confusing ruling.

He paid his debt to society and, you know, the man is entitled now to earn a living.Here's some social media. Put it up on the screen and the council person and I can look at it together. I'll read it aloud. It's public knowledge, really obtainable information. They can ask and if they choose to disclose that will be a good test. You know, council person, when I talked about this on my radio program this week, people did say any landlord, you know, with access to a search engine could figure these things out.

When Michael Cohen was being prosecuted, they could not charge Trump because he was sitting president. But they had a series of meetings in 2021 when Trump was leaving office and decided against it. That's a fact.Second of all, Mr. Davis leaves off a very important part. He says, the Southern District said Donald Trump told Michael Cohen to do it. He leaves off what comes before that in that memo. The Southern District says Michael Cohen says Trump told him to do it, which brings me to the final point. One of the big reasons the Southern District did not charge this is because they did not believe Michael Cohen. They found him not credible. And here's a quote from a letter the Southern District wrote on December 7th, 2018 to the federal judge in the case. They wrote that Michael Cohen's statements to the Southern District were -- quote -- \"Overstated in some respects and incomplete in others\" -- end quote. Michael Cohen tried to cooperate with the Southern District. They found him to be not credible, and that's a big reason why they passed on charging Donald Trump.",
