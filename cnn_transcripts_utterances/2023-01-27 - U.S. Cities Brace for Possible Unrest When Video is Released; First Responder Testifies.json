And they understand that people may be inclined to act upon that pain hopefully peacefully but sometimes not.The Major Cities Chiefs Association -- one of the leading professional law enforcement organizations -- has convened several calls with dozens of member agencies to share information. Memphis police as well as the Tennessee bureau of investigation provided some information on those calls according to sources. And to give a few examples of how law enforcement agencies are preparing here in Washington, D.C., police have met with members of the clergy. They're adding police staffing throughout the city. On Capitol Hill police are adding staffing as well. In Atlanta officers are going to be on 12-hour shifts. Agencies such as Minneapolis, Nashville and Los Angeles police are telling CNN they are closely monitoring the situation in their own cities as well as in Memphis as they develop their own operational plans. The Major County Sheriffs Association told CNN multiple sheriff's departments are talking to community and faith based leaders ahead of this video's release. Trying to embrace the community and they added that their organization is engaging with intelligence command staff around the country at various departments to ensure there is an accurate flow of information both to law enforcement and then through law enforcement to the communities.
