School Achievement Test,Scholastic Aptitude Test, Standard Aptitude Trial, Study and Triumph. If you said Scholastic Aptitude Test, you are on your way to a perfect 1600, the highest score you can get on the SAT. No need to bring your number two pencils to an SAT anymore because this college admissions test is now fully digital. Test takers still have to be there in person and supervised, so no badinage with friends during the test. The SAT will be taken on a laptop or tablet and the exam will be shorter. Where it was three hours before, it`s now down to two. It will still be based on a 1600-point scale and the results will come back sooner in a matter of days instead of weeks. But a concern for some, this digital version is also adaptive, meaning it will serve harder questions the better you do, which some students say increases test anxiety and overthinking. These changes from the college board are an effort to make this standardized test more accessible to students. As many colleges made it optional to submit standardized test scores, especially during the pandemic, more elite universities have announced a shift in now requiring students to include these test scores with their applications. But on the other side, some critics believe standardized tests can be a disadvantage for lower income students because they may have limited resources to study and prepare for these tests. For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, we`re going to a Starbucks in Washington, D.C. that`s the only one of its kind in the U.S. It was designed with the deaf and hard of hearing communities in mind. We`re going to experience this special coffee shop the same way its customers do with no sound. If you`re not fluent in American sign language, don`t worry. We have subtitles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Starbucks` mission and values is to create an inclusive environment for everyone. And this is the first U.S. signing store. On a daily basis, people come in and they want to learn how to sign their name, how to sign their beverage. You have a variety of options. You could use a tech pad to write out your order. You could use a picture menu to point to a variety of core beverages. You could point to the coffee that you want if it`s drip, tall -- gesture. Different ways to communicate. When your order is finished, a monitor will show your name and we`ll point to that, \"Hello, your drink is ready!\" And hand that to you, creating that connection. For the past month, I`ve seen customers come in and they`ll write, \"Thank you for opening this store.\" Other businesses out there need to see this model. To see what it looks like, and be a profitable business with this model, with deaf people running the store. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
