Communication is key. Why? Because the flight crew on the flight deck do not have situational awareness to what is going on in the back. They need to know what's going on in the cabin so that communication needs to occur, they have to know how quickly they need to land.

The electoral commission says she won at least 152 out of 300 seats. Critics say the election was one-sided, as the main opposition party boycotted the vote after Hasina rejected their demands to resign. She's been in office since 2009 and human rights groups have raised concern about the government becoming a one-party system. Election officials say turn out at the polls was low with only 40 percent of about 120 million eligible voters taking part.

Peregrine is now on its way to the moon and is planning to touch down on February 23rd. It's loaded with equipment that will gather data for feature moon missions, but it's also carrying mementos from other countries including photographs, novels, and a piece of Mount Everest.And human remains are also on the flight on behalf of two space burial companies. This is expected to become the first commercial mission to land on the moon as part of NASA's collaboration with private space companies. And earlier I spoke with CNN aerospace analyst Myles O'Brien. He explained the significance of this mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  It's been 50 years since the United States attempted a soft landing on the moon. That was Apollo 17 teen, you may recall or at least I recall. And so, there is a historical piece to all of this. Putting this into the larger context of why this is happening now, this is part of the overall effort by the United States in its so-called Artemis mission, to put people back on the moon in the next few years. And this time instead of just planting flags and leaving footprints behind, the idea is to build an outpost there. And so, what NASA did about four or five years ago is gave contracts to about 14 private players to fly payload and landers to the surface, first and foremost, just to get used to doing that so that you have the ability to carry freight to and from the surface if need be. And also, to put some instruments on the ground to characterize the environment a little better. It's been 50 years since we've been there. The instruments are better. We know a lot more about the surface of the moon. For example, we know now that there is a liquid water ice there. Understanding the radiation environment, the dust environment. A whole host of things is what leads NASA to this moment, Rosemary.",
