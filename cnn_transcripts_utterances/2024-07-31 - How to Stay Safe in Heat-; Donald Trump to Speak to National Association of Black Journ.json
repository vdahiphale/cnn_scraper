He's hilarious. And I got to talk with him a little bit about just Democratic engagement, which I think is so important, and just getting out there and reminding people, especially now, we don't just get a democracy. We have got to make it every day. And what I'm really concerned about is I want all of this energy to focus on the swing states. Joe Biden -- we look at these polls every day. Joe Biden won the last election by five points. He won the Electoral College by 40,000 votes in the swing states. In my home state of Wisconsin, it was below 20,000. And so we really need to focus this energy for the long term on those swing states.",

If I walked into the writers room of the West Wing and pitched Project 2025 for a Republican to be running on, I would be kicked out of the room for being condescending to Republicans.

Chinese swimmers are under an intense microscope in Paris after a previous \"New York Times\" report revealed several of their swimmers tested positive for a banned drug and then went on to win gold at the Tokyo Games in 2021. One of those swimmers could be competing tomorrow in the 4x200 meter relay. Joining us now from Paris is one of the reporters breaking these stories, \"New York Times\" global sports correspondent Tariq Panja. Tariq, what more can you tell us about this latest investigation? TARIQ PANJA, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\":  Well, this comes after -- you mentioned we have written three stories, separate stories now, involving Chinese swimmers since April. The first one involved the 23 positive cases linked to trimetazidine, TMZ, a prescription-only heart drug that the Chinese said was found in a hotel kitchen where these athletes were staying while in competition. The second one related to a type -- well, not exactly a steroid, but a steroid-like substance called clenbuterol, involved three of those 23 swimmers a few years earlier. And this latest one involves a mail-in female swimmer, one of those from the 23, a man and another young female swimmer called Tang Muhan. She is the swimmer you mentioned there who we expect to be lining up in the relay to defend China's gold. What they're saying is, while in training camp, Ms. Muhan and this male swimmer left the camp to go on a day of eating hamburgers, shopping, cakes and coffee. And it was in that period at a restaurant called the Blue Frog that they believe they ate this hamburger that had a powerful steroid in it that they tested positive for. And there's so many questions here. It's taken us again to reveal these positive cases. This was another secret case involving Chinese swimmers. And now WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, after these stories, has finally said, hang on. Yes, we think we have a problem with contamination, and we are looking into this and seeing if things need to change.",

These cases, these stories just keep coming up. We were told just before the Olympics that the Chinese have been tested more than any other team coming into Paris. That might be the case, but it's very hard, given the way sophisticated doping works, to be caught doping at an Olympics. You have had to have done something really silly. And I was talking to anti-doping experts. If you -- blanket testing, just doing thousands of random tests, that really isn't the way to catch cheaters these days. It has to be sophisticated, intelligence-led, the right time for the right drugs. Now, a lot of the way this works is, it's up to each nation -- in the case of the United States, you saw the United States Anti-Doping Agency, in the case of China, CHINADA, to basically test their own athletes. So it's nations. We're trusting these nations to essentially mark their own athletes. And, look, you -- I don't know if you have been to an Olympics, Paris -- Pamela, but the Olympics is a bragging right for a nation.",

He is attacking Kamala Harris.And there -- the sort of controversy surrounding this has a lot to do with the fact that she is not here, that they have these two candidates who are the -- one, the presumptive nominee for the Democrats and one who is now the nominee for the Republicans. But only one of them is showing up at the National Association of Black Journalists. According to NABJ, they reached out to these candidates, as they have done since 1976, trying to get them to come to the convention to sit down for interviews in front of the crowd here. And Donald Trump ended up doing it in person. Kamala Harris' team said, look, they had a lot of things scheduled. They could not make it in person or virtually at the time of the conference. You might imagine she was quite busy with what has been going on since Joe Biden stepped down from the campaign. But they went ahead and said yes to Donald Trump. That has been some of the consternation, Donald Trump responding to this, though, now. And this is why some people are quite annoyed about it. He is, of course, using this against Kamala Harris. And here's what he put on TRUTH Social earlier. He called her crazy Kamala Harris disrespecting the National Association of Black Journalists by not showing up. She has now agreed to do a virtual setting -- sitting with the NABJ, so that people can listen to her views. People are able to ask her questions, but after the conference. All of this happening at a time when, of course, everything is heightened, and the whole campaign has changed because Kamala Harris is now at the top of the ticket. And Donald Trump is reaching out to black voters, who he is seeing in some small way growing for the Donald Trump campaign. He's trying to reach out to them. And one of the ways to do that is to come to this conference. I do want to let you hear from the president of National Association of Black Journalists, who put his foot down and said, look, we are journalists. It is the last name in the moniker that we have.
