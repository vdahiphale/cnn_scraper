And while the Qatar is who negotiated this deal or mediated this deal, I should say, say that the international community should take this pause in fighting as an opportunity to try to push a more diplomatic path to end this war. Or, well, Netanyahu has made very clear in his speech to Israel yesterday that this war is not over. He says that it will only end when Hamas is completely destroyed, Max.",

But there have been some sticking points, some more major than others, that have gotten in the way. And so, if you go back 10 days, that's when there was somewhat of a breakthrough. Israel had been asking for names, ages, nationalities, you know, identifying features of the people who are actually being held and might potentially be part of this deal, the women and children.And that's when Hamas finally turned over that information. And that led to Israel going. And that led to Israel going ahead and finalizing the deal, at least approving the deal with their own cabinet. The trouble, though, is that during that period of time in the last 10 days, that is when Israel also went into the Al-Shifa hospital complex. Obviously, the Palestinians, that has been a particularly sore spot for them. And Hamas, through the intermediary, Qatar, actually went dark. So, despite the fact that Israel had signed off on this deal, it wasn't entirely clear whether Hamas would actually accept it, given what was happening at that hospital. But it was Tuesday. Hamas actually came back to Qatar, approved the deal. And here we are, potentially, with some hostages being released in short order, Max.",

There's also the potential for the deal to be extended with an extra day added for an additional 10 hostages available for release. Hamas said in a statement, which they subsequently took down, that 150 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails would also be freed. Hamas has said those prisoners would be women and children.Now, Israel is holding about 8,300 Palestinians in Israeli jails, including many who don't even know the charges against them.

It's been a very long time. We've been struggling to remember the last time Putin directly addressed Western leaders he's been addressing. Sort of African leaders, BRICS leaders, but to be directly addressing Western leaders is very significant. I think it's significant that he's decided to do this now. He didn't, for example, do it last year when there was a G20 summit in Bali, which happened really almost on the same day that Ukraine liberated the town of Kherson. I think this comes, obviously, as Russia, albeit hasn't advanced, but has managed to hold off a significant Ukrainian advance for the past 12 months in full. So that is significant. Perhaps he's feeling more confident, perhaps emboldened by the fact. that Ukraine has fallen out of international headlines because of the conflict in the Middle East.
