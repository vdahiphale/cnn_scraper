      "sentences": "The New York A.G. has got her eye on a marquee Trump property for potential seizure. That's tonight on NEWSNIGHT.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Tonight, Donald Trump's financial peril is getting very, very real. Letitia James has taken the first steps on that road to making the former president pay up. Trump has until Monday to come up with $464 million in cash to pay the bond on the fraud case that he just lost. And in the event that he doesn't, the A.G. has made a legal filing in Westchester County, just a few miles outside of Manhattan, to ensure that he'll have to hand over something. Now, it's our very first clue as to where James plans to go to cobble together the nearly half a billion dollars in value from Trump's business holdings. This is Trump's Seven Springs estate. It is massive, sprawling, lush, beautiful. It sits on 230 acres spanning three separate towns. It has a unique history tied to some of America's most storied business families. Trump bought it for a cool $7.5 million back in 1996. And since then, it's been his family's northern home, not quite Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster, both of them clubs where Trump spends quite a lot of time, but something more intimate, or at least as intimate as a 60-room property can be.

This won't come as a shock to you, but it's not worth that. And appraiser valued it as below $30 million.The estate also features prominently in a classic Trump yarn, like that one time that he tried to AirBNB land on the Seven Springs Acres to the now dead Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Now, Gaddafi was never planning to actually stay in the property. He just wanted to pitch a tent on the property. That was back in 2009. Ultimately, Gaddafi never stayed there, but that didn't stop Trump from telling the tale over and over again. Now, that aside, listen to how Trump's kids talk about Seven Springs. You can hear that for them, there is something different about this property. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Barbara, you hear Eric there talking about Seven Springs. It's a special family property the way that he describes it. Talk to us about that personal association that they have with this property.

It can't do that with a personal bankruptcy.And also, with a personal bankruptcy, you tend to lose, like, really, everything. It's not like going Chapter 11 where you reorganize. That's what a Chapter 11 is for, to give a company a chance to step back away from their lenders and reorganize their companies so that they can get back. But I remember while I was working a project in California a long time ago with Trump, and it came to a point where it had to go bankrupt because of some political things that happened. And he pulled out of the project and lost a good deal of money, but he did not want his name associated with that bankruptcy. So, he's very skittish about that.

He has various real estate holdings, many of which have debt against them. Some of them are office buildings. The office building market is not good right now. For example, he owns 30 percent of a trophy office building in San Francisco, but that stake may be worth almost nothing because the office market in San Francisco is so bad. But then the other key thing he has is he has Truth Social. The parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media, is supposed to go public imminently. There's what's called a SPAC. It's one of these shell companies that they take on the market that has stock that doesn't have assets and they merge it with a private company, which will be Trump Media in this case. And where the stock in that SPAC is trading suggests that Donald Trump's stake in what will be the public Trump Media Company is worth several billion dollars, maybe like $3 billion.

And I think that's the one big question that you hear a lot. The other is, is there anybody outside of Trump and Trump's kind of business entities that will finance this in and of themselves?
