Israel is warning its punishing strikes against Hamas and its strongholds in Gaza are just the beginning as it ratchets up its response to the militant group's unprecedented surprise attack over the weekend.Israeli airstrikes have been pummeling parts of Gaza aimed at degrading its military capabilities. And now the Israeli Defense Minister has ordered the complete siege of Gaza, halting the supply of food, fuel and electricity. Rockets are also being launched from Gaza as Hamas threatens to begin killing civilian hostages and broadcasting it if Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. The death toll on both sides continues to climb including at least 900 people killed in Israel, following the assault by Hamas. And nearly 700 killed in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising his country will go after the militant group like never before, saying their horrendous acts have not been seen since the time of ISIS.

When we talk about the Gaza Strip, we are talking about a very small, densely populated area that has been under a land, sea and air blockade enforced by Israel since 2007. More than two million Palestinians live in this area.And of course, many of them are refugees. And there is concern around the impact of this decision will have as well, of course as the impact of Israeli airstrikes on civilian life. We have heard those repeated warnings from humanitarian groups, including, as you mentioned there, the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres who spoke yesterday and while he deplored the attacks carried out on Saturday by Hamas against Israel. He also warned of the civilian toll on the humanitarian impact of this latest decision taken by the Israeli government. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: I am deeply distressed by today's announcement that Israel will initiate a complete seize of the Gaza Strip. Nursing allowed in, no electricity, food or fuel. Humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before the hostilities. Now it will only deteriorate exponentially. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Moments after an Israeli airstrike on Gaza is Jabalia refugee camp, desperate calls for help. The dead, the dying and the injured covered in dust and blood. Israel's wrath is now unleashed upon Gaza. The Israelis say, Achmed Shamala (ph), hit the building without warning. They didn't ask us to evacuate. They didn't say anything. Suddenly, we heard the airstrike and we ran to the building and found it had completely collapsed. Around 75,000 people in Gaza have already been displaced. According to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency which deals with Palestinian refugees. In this cramped strip of land along the Mediterranean, two million Palestinians are now in the crosshairs of an enemy bent on revenge for Hamas' surprise attack which left hundreds of Israelis dead and thousands wounded and dozens now in Hamas captivity. By evening, the death toll in Gaza was approaching 700 with almost 4000 wounded according to the Palestinian health ministry. Monday evening, the spokesman for Hamas issued a grim warning. They'll start executing their civilian hostages and broadcasting those executions. Israel targets people in Gaza without warning. Gaza and Israel have gone to war many times before since Hamas took control. This will not be yet another brief outbreak of attack and counter attack before we return to the status quo. Israel is massing troops and armor on the outskirts of Gaza, preparing in all likelihood for a ground invasion on a scale not seen before. And now Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has ordered what he called a complete siege of Gaza cutting off all food, fuel and electricity. That in a place where according to the World Food Program, 63 percent of the population was food insecure before this war began. So much has happened since Saturday morning in Israel in Gaza and it's only the beginning. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What Hamas with its incursion on Saturday is basically as I said earlier, changed the rules of the game.The status quo had become completely untenable. Palestinians were being massacred on an -- on an almost daily basis or attacked or on almost daily basis. There was no political underside, the two-state solution was dead. It's -- there's an apartheid system in place. So basically, change the role of the games but with no political end in sight. And I think this is the real disaster that's in the works. I think, from the Israeli perspective, they didn't believe or they didn't see -- they really bought into the narrative that such an action would not be taken by Hamas militants. It's also as a more concerted effort.

So, I gave her a tourniquet on her leg. DIAMOND (voice-over): Minutes later, shots rang out. OHANA (TRANSLATED): There was silence for a few minutes, and the police woman who was there with us simply screened, \"Whoever wanted to be alive needs to leave now\". Those who could leave, left. Those who couldn't, I don't know what happened with them. DIAMOND (voice-over): Michal and her boyfriend took off running, but Michal panicked. As her legs buckled, her boyfriend dragged her across the ground and managed to shove her into the window of a passing vehicle. But, at every turn, more Hamas fighters. OHANA (TRANSLATED): They just went with white pickup trucks. On each pickup truck, there are at least 20 terrorists with Kalashnikov grenade guns, shotguns, machine guns. I've never seen anything like this in my life. DIAMOND (voice-over): Seemingly encircled, Michal once again jumped out of the car and began running before finding an abandoned Army tank on the side of the road. The bullets reached her there too. Hiding under the tank, Michal was shot in the leg, and shrapnel from a grenade pierced her stomach. OHANA (TRANSLATED): And in that time, we didn't see -- we couldn't see anything. And they were taken, some people were taken. DIAMOND (voice-over): For six more hours, Michal laid lying underneath that tank until Israeli soldiers rescued her and evacuated her to Hadassah Hospital where she was one of more than 60 victims treated.",
