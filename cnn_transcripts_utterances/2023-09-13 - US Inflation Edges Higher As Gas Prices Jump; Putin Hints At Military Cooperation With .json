We're going to be talking a lot about inflation, and that's the reason you're seeing the market behaving as it is. This month tricky inflation data, it is like the proverbial pure of tech (ph), part of it of good. A luxury cruise ship has run aground on a remote stretch of Greenland. There are 206 people on board. They are safe. And the king of comfortable shoes, the Birkenstock decides to go public, and it's doing so in the United States. We are live in New York on Wednesday, it's September the 13th. I am Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. We start tonight with troubling news for the US consumer as rising gas prices are fueling higher inflation. The CPI, the consumer price index rose to 3.7 percent in August from a year earlier. The biggest driver by far was higher energy costs. Gas prices were up more than 10 percent from July to August. Well up on shelter, it was one of the other big factors. Core inflation, which is the one everybody looks at and excludes. Food and energy is still slowing on an annual basis, which is good news for the Fed ahead of next week's meeting. Matt Egan is with me. Matt, if we look at these numbers, there is nothing I can see in them that would shift the general consensus that the Fed will sit on its hands.",

      "sentences": "Well, Richard, I think that this report kind of has a little something for everyone. I mean, if you were worried aboutinflation before today's report, there is plenty of reasons to still be concerned. I mean, headline inflation, which is the stuff that everyone actually pays for every month, it is moving in the wrong direction, 3.7 percent. That is, again, largely because of gas prices. Month over month, headline inflation actually tripled to 0.6 percent. That is the highest rate since June of 2022. Remember, that was really the peak of this inflation crisis that was also driven by gas prices, but we all want to know where is inflation going next, and for that, we do look at core inflation and the picture is moving in the right direction there. So to your point, though, Richard, I don't really think that this report shifts the narrative at all. No, inflation has not been defeated; but it is slowly moving in the right direction.",

I mean, the odds in the market are more than 90 percent,that the Fed just holds rate steady, but investors are pricing in basically a 50/50 chance that the Fed has to do at least one more rate hike. And here is one of the problems for the Fed, it is that energy prices have actually gone higher since this data, right? This is August data. We know that gasoline prices, oil prices have only gotten higher in the month of September, so that's going to cause some issues. And I think the other problem here, Richard, is that this all speaks to how some of this is out of the control of Jerome Powell and the Fed, right? I mean, he can't decide whether or not Saudi Arabia and Russia pump more oil or less, and at times, that is going to play a huge role in the inflation data.",

I think this is just another reminder of how getting inflation back down to four percent or three percent. You know, that's one thing, getting it back to the two percent target.

But maybe that there's things left from the pandemic that really were different than before. I mean, this thing about households actually had quite a lot of savings. They could insulate themselves. So the fact that we haven't seen it yet was the surprise. As I say, the fact that the unemployment rate went up by 0.3 on a single month is suggestive, but the danger -- Richard, let's just put this in context. Just let's understand that banks are run for bankers. Bankers care about inflation, but real people care more about the unemployment rate. There's a lot of work done on it, it suggests that a one percentage point rise in unemployment makes people much worse, about six times worse than a one percentage point rise in inflation. So bankers want to do things to deal with the inflation rate, but real people care about the unemployment rate. Bankers are not going to get to be unemployed, your listeners are. And I think that's the reality. The question is, is what the bankers are doing for the banks, the sensible thing to do for your listeners? And it's okay, as long as the labor market doesn't collapse, but as soon as it doesn't, they don't really have many tools to stop it.",

They touched on agriculture, space exploration, and other initiatives. It's the two countries military ties that have the West concerned. Will Ripley is following the Summit from Taipei. When you looked at the speeches at the state dinner, they're all very grand and eloquent. No one really said, except, arguably, Kim was a lot more anti-West.

They've been growing their nuclear weapons arsenal. Of course, they've always had a large stockpile of conventional weapons and ammunition, because North Korea is very rich in the minerals that you need to produce those things and they can help Russia, they can help resupply beleaguered Russian troops in Ukraine with these weapons of which they have plenty. And in exchange, Russia, which has decades of experience in building ballistic missiles can share some of that knowledge strategically with Kim who is trying to get his nuclear program at a level which it will never be challenged by the United States or anybody, he will never be asked to denuclearize and will have to be accepted as a nuclear power, that has been Kim's objective, pretty much since day one. And bit by bit, he's getting closer to that. And now, he is taking advantage of really Vladimir Putin's humiliating downfall to partner with him and use their combined powers to actually come up with this plan, which is quite clever, that will allow them to use Russia's sanctions veto power, and Russia's access to certain components and the North Korea's weapons to basically bypass these Western sanctions led by the United States that have prevented Russia from getting things that it needs and preventing North Korea from getting parts and components that it needs. So they have come up with this plan. They're executing it. And as you know, Richard, unlike democracies, which require consensus, Russia and North Korea are dictatorships. And what Kim says and what Putin says, basically goes. So if these guys decide this is what they want to do, they're doing it.",

You're talking about less than 40 miles an hour on that train. No bullet trains in North Korea, ballistic missiles, yes, but no high speed rail. Kim actually flies his own planes. But you know, that's a little more dangerous and North Korea's planes are getting older and older, even though they're well maintained. So the train seems to make the most sense, not to mention its tradition. His father and his grandfather always rode on that train.
