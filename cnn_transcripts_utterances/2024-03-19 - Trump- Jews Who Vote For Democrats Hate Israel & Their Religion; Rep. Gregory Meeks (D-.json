      "sentences": "It's a fairly shocking thing for a presidential candidate to say about any religious minority. But about Jews at this time of rising anti-semitism in the United States, it is certainly noteworthy. This is not the first time he is lashed out at Jews who don't support him. Just last year around the High Holy Days for Jews, Trump shared a social media image that said liberal Jews who didn't support him, quote, \"voted to destroy America and Israel.\" But that was a repost on Instagram or read truth or whatever.The White House was quick to respond to Trump's latest comments saying, quote, \"As antisemitic crimes and acts of hate have increased across the world, among them the deadliest attack committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Leaders have an obligation to call hate what it is and bring Americans together against it. There is no justification for spreading toxic false stereotypes that threaten fellow citizens. None,\" unquote. That was putting it nicely compared to what the Biden campaign had to say, which was, quote, \"The only person who should be ashamed here is Donald Trump. Donald Trump openly demeans Jewish Americans and reportedly thinks Adolf Hitler,\" quote, \"did some good things.\" That last bit is a reference to comments Trump made in private to his then Chief of Staff retired General John Kelly according to CNNs own Jim Sciutto. CNN's Kristen Holmes is here with more. Kristen, shocking comments by Trump, offensive comments by Trump, are -- is this just going to be what we're hearing from now until November or perhaps beyond?",

When you talk to your campaign advisors or aides, you don't get any sense that he's going to change his rhetoric, that he is going to tamp down the kind of language that he uses. In fact, they say they know who their candidate is. And keep in mind, we have not heard Republicans in any way largely coming out to rebuke Donald Trump's comments. And in fact, his campaign doubled down on what he said.And this is what they said in a statement, \"President Trump is right. The Democrat Party has turned into a full blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal.\" There is a clear messaging problem with Donald Trump and several of these various minority groups. Two things are true, Donald Trump's team believes that there is an opening with Jewish voters who are unhappy with the way that Biden has handled the Israel Hamas war. This is how Donald Trump chooses to message to those voters. This seems very similar to what we saw last month in South Carolina when Donald Trump's campaign was saying that they saw an opening among black voters in America, only to have Donald Trump say that black voters liked him because he had been arrested and discriminated against just like they had, essentially tying his own indictments to the years and years of legal discriminations that blacks have faced in this country. Again, just because there are openings does not mean that these groups of people are going to vote for Donald Trump. And they clearly need to work on how exactly he is going to message people if they want to pick up any of these votes instead of actually turn voters off.",

It is not a Defense Department decision to say, yes, we're evacuating, that's up to state even if it's the Defense Department that carries out that evacuation, essentially an emergency evacuation with its assets. You see some of the aircraft that were involved in the NEO on your screen right here.McKenzie said a month earlier, he began to doubt and this is in July of 202, whether state could effectively carry out a NEO as he waited for the order to come down, an order that only came on August 14, which is one day before some members of the Afghan government's leadership fled the country. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. KENNETH MCKENZIE (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: Orders to commence the noncombatant evacuation operation, bringing out our embassy, our citizens and at risk Afghans were received on 14th August. These dates are important, because I believe that the events of mid and late August 2021 were the direct result of delaying the initiation of the NEO for several months, in fact, until we were in extremists, and the Taliban had overrun the country.

We all saw how this played out. And tragically, of course, in the final days of that withdrawal of suicide bombing that led to the killing of 13 U.S. service members at Abbey Gate.",

Congressman McCaul said there was a bipartisan effort. And he said in principle, they have reached an agreement with the White House to increase the number. He basically said stay tuned for that number and for announcements, so that at the very least here is good news for the Afghans who are trying to get out who have helped the U.S. during a 20-year war there as we wait to find out how many perhaps will be allowed into the U.S.",

And sometimes, you know, I actually felt very sad for the gold star families because the gentleman was kept saying over and over that in order to really get out and to answer their questions, we've got to look at the policies that have taken place and the decisions that were made, not just for the last for three days or for a week.But the whole 20 years that we were in Afghanistan, the general also said that the Doha agreement was the foundation of everything that followed, including the end, which says that you can't just make a judgment of and give the transparency and give the gold star families what they need, without looking at the entire picture. And I hope, because I want them to have the answers to, but the only way that we can do that is in a bipartisan way, not in an overtly political way. The sole focus of this hearing was just trying to discredit Joe Biden, without looking at the Doha agreement, and Donald Trump or any other president. We want, I want, I don't -- won't stop until we figure out what went wrong, what went right.
