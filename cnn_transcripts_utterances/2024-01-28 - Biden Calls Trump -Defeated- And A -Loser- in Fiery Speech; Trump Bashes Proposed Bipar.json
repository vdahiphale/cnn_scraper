Instead, she's on the ballot for the primary, but the caucus is really where the state's crucial delegates will be awarded. And so that was a key part of Trump's message on Saturday. He was telling voters to go out to the caucus, skip the primary, and really focus on the race where Donald Trump will matter, but because they don't see Nikki Haley as a player here. It also allowed Trump to shift his messaging toward a general election rematch with Joe Biden. And a key issue was talking about the border. Part of that is because the border is a very important issue to Nevada. It's a state with a very large migrant population, but it's also the timing that is noteworthy. I think, you know, in Congress there is this bipartisan immigration deal that Donald Trump has privately and publicly been urging lawmakers to reject.

This proposal expected to be this week is expected to significantly stop such crossings in the months ahead.That's what one -- several Republican senators that I caught up with talked -- told me last week they said that this bill will may not be perfect, but it will go far away to dealing with the problem. And that's why Republicans should accept it. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN):  I would encourage James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won't be looking to third parties in assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal.

It's not easy.And there's still skepticism about what Hamas has said is their bottom line on this. And of course, they're not involved in these talks. That bottom line is a complete cessation or complete end of this war. Bill Burns is meeting with David Barnea. The Mossad chief is meeting with the intelligence chief from Egypt and the prime minister of Qatar. Of course, the Qataris are the main go between, between the Egyptians, the United States, Israelis and Hamas. They are the ones that are seen to be able to sort of have some leverage here. Egypt does. Egypt's intelligence officials too have conversations directly with Hamas officials. But I think at the moment, the idea that the hostages can be released in Israel at least is something that while it is hoped for, I don't get the sense that people are building up their hopes too much. Look, I think it's really important to say here that it was Bill Burns and David Barnea, the Mossad chief who worked together back in November to get those 100 hostages released. There was a six-day pause in the fighting back then. And that was their conversation. So the fact they are talking again, somewhere in Europe we understand this weekend, is an indication that the situation may be getting closer. But it's that holdout, is Israel ready to accept what Hamas is demanding on the permanent ceasefire? Or is Hamas prepared to back down on that issue? because I think it's clear to most people in this country at least that once Hamas hand over all the hostages, then the war can be fought in a different way. That is certainly how the people of Israel feel. The IDF, the military obviously will get their leadership from the government here. But it will be something everyone is hopeful here about. But at the moment, it's under discussion. And the indications are, it may be close but it's not there yet.",
