I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with one of the biggest names in the Democratic Party stopping short of a full-throated endorsement of President Biden. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is asking her colleagues to give President Biden until the end of the week before issuing any more calls to remove him from the top of the ticket. Pelosi warned this morning that time is running out for the president to leave the race if that's what he decides to do. Comments appear to underline the importance of the president's upcoming news conference at the NATO summit that's set to take place tomorrow. Pelosi was asked earlier this morning whether she wants the president to be the Democratic nominee and here's her response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But still, even as President Biden has sought to rally some support around him with a couple of key meetings and phone calls with the Congressional Black Caucus and progressives, like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there are still some in the Democratic Party who harbor deep reservations about Biden remaining at the top of the ticket. So far, you have had seven House Democratic lawmakers publicly calling for the president to step aside, many more expressing concerns privately as well. And then over in the Senate, at least three Democratic senators in a meeting yesterday, saying that they're concerned Biden won't win in November. Senator Michael Bennet was among those, and he spoke to that issue last night here on CNN. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

So, that's part of it.But he's also long said that he wanted to wait until the convention.

But he said his advisers have said that's not quite practical in terms of logistics. So, look, I think that we're in the window here, probably beginning. I'm told on Friday into the Monday range. He has a rally scheduled for Pennsylvania on Saturday. That certainly could be a place. But there's also thinking why not wait until the convention on Monday? It would add some more excitement and drama. But, clearly, the people who do not know are the potential running mates.

It's like, well, this is a, a speech on the world -- yes, it's like this is a speech -- it's a speech on the world stage. This is not abnormal.

So, no one had to explain NATO to Joe Biden. It's something that he has committed himself to from the early days of his career. Often I say when I go into brief the president on NATO, he ends up briefing me. So, I can't wait to see him hosting this summit.And as for the comments that you just played, look, anybody who invites any sort of attack on NATO territory, I mean, those types of comments are irrational, they're dangerous, and, frankly, irresponsible. So this president knows that we have to turn the alliance's focus right now to Russia, and what Russia is doing in Ukraine, push back, and stand united with our allies so that Putin understands that the NATO alliance isn't going anywhere, and that we will stay united in supporting Ukraine in this very dangerous moment.",

NATO, for the first time in its history, is actually establishing a command that is focused on moving Ukraine closer to NATO membership. You also saw the announcement just minutes ago by Secretary Blinken that the F-16s that are being provided by both sides Denmark and the Netherlands are now on their way and those jets are going to be operational this summer.In addition to that, allies are coming together and making new commitments on air defense, new Patriots and other systems that will allow the Ukrainians to protect their territory against these indiscriminate attacks on civilians, such as the hit on the children's hospital that we saw just a few days ago. So, we are building a bridge to NATO membership for Ukraine, and we are doing that not in words, but actually in actions. And so this is a big two days for President Zelenskyy and his team. Ukraine joined us at the big celebration last night at Mellon Auditorium, and we look forward to having them here in the Washington Convention Center.",
