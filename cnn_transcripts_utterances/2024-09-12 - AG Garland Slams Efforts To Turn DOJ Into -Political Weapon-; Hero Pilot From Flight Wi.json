So Alaska, United, all the U.S. carriers, I've seen those facilities and I've been part of the certification of several aircraft where they do that training on-site at the airport or at the aircraft -- at the aircraft simulators. So it's really something they feel like they've experienced before. That's the only way you can really be prepared. You can't just talk about it. You have to experience that idea of walking through the cockpit and knowing that the pressurization has gone. You only have minutes to breathe without getting oxygen.

There's a checklist of what to do during rapid deceleration -- a rapid decompression and how they handle that. So they fulfilled that checklist. They looked to see what they need to shut off, what they need to control. How they - how is the aircraft flying at the time? She knew at the time that the aircraft was stable.
