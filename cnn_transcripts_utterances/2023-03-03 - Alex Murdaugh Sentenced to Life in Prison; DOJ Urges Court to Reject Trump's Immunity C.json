It's just been great.But without any delay, we're going to schedule some of the matters. I know that Mr. Harpootlian's scheduling is complicated and you sacrificed quite a bit too to be able to be here defending Mr. Murdaugh, as well as the Attorney General's Office, with all the other many, many things and obligations you have. And to be able to have the attorney general here, Alan Wilson, for the period of time that he's devoted to being here along with everyone else, it has been quite a sacrifice. But there are other victims whose cases deserve to be heard. And this case has jumped some of those other cases, perhaps jumped it because of this case resulting in an assault on the integrity of the judicial system in our state, law enforcement in our state. Even during this trial, the law enforcement have been maligned for the past five or six weeks by one who had access to the wheel of justice to be able to deflect the investigation. As the evidence has pointed out in this case, the looming storm that Mr. Waters talked about, I can just imagine on that day, June 7th, when a lawyer is confronted and confesses to having stolen over half a million dollars from a client and he has a tagger like Mark Tinsley on his tail pursuing the discovery in the case involving the death of Mallory Beach, and having a father for the most part on his death bed. I can imagine, or I really can't imagine, but I know that it had to be quite a bit going through your mind on that day. But, amazingly, to have you come and testify that it was just another ordinary day that my wife and son and I were out, just enjoying life, it is not credible, it is not believable. You can convince yourself about it, but, obviously, you have the inability to convince anyone else about that. [10:0505] So, if you made any such arguments as a lawyer, you would lose every case like that, cases that you will not have the opportunity to argue anymore except perhaps your own as you sit in the Department of Corrections.

For the murder of Paul Murdaugh, whom you probably loved so much, I sentence you to prison for murdering him for the rest of your natural life. Those sentences will run consecutive. Under the statute involving possession of a weapon during a violent crime, there is no sentence where a life sentence is imposed on other indictments.That is the sentence of the court and you are remanded to the State Department of Corrections.

But the judge saying he didn't believe him. The judge said, you continue to lie throughout your testimony, and he said that many, most, he described it as more than 99 percent of the people observing this case would continue to believe that he was lying in his statement of denial in that courtroom in these final moments there.

Joey Jackson and Sarah Ford back with us.Joey, just continuing to pick up on this point, so if you are just joining us, consecutive life sentences for the murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, paul, for Alex Murdaugh. We also heard throughout from the judge talking about who Alex Murdaugh was in his view prior to these murders, prior to these moments in court now this morning and who he was today. And he said, maybe you weren't the person who killed them, maybe you were not the person because you had popped so many pills, and maybe you weren't in that moment. I have had people who stood before me who were not the person who committed the crime, but they were the same individual, I found that really interesting, Joey that he would lay it out in that way. JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Yes, remarkable, Erica. And in addition to that, even the personal connection that the judge spoke to. Remember the judge saying that, hey, I have seen you at events, I've known you as a member of the bar, I know you and your family to be a beautiful family, I know you to have been a nice person. What happened? And then going back to the point that you made, Erica, which is compelling that the judge talked about, which is that, yes, perhaps it was not you, but maybe it was the individual that was so strung up on these pills that it happened. Big picture, Erica, when you look at the sentencing issues, they are about punishment, rehabilitation and deterrence, right. And the judges look for those things, and, clearly, this is not a person who could be rehabilitated, so the judge then has to pivot to what is the appropriate punishment under these circumstances. Is there anything that anyone would believe that would be appropriate other than multiple life sentences? And then the deterrent factor, no one else should be able to get away with this, whether you are a lawyer, whether you have a family that has a portrait hanging on the courthouse door or anyone else. So, it seemed to me that the judge was very reflective, very thoughtful, had a number of things to say, spoke to the sacrifices of the attorney general and the prosecutors and everyone who was there to met out justice. I think the judge under these circumstances did what justice required and demanded, and that was a two consecutive life sentences that we saw.",

And I think because there is a very fine line, there is no distinguishing between the victim's family and the defendant's family. Buster is the son of Maggie, the brother to Paul, he's also the son of Alex. And hearing him speak or Maggie's family speaking, they are all one family. So, I think it would be very difficult for them to speak.But, certainly, Creighton Waters and the Attorney General's Office did an excellent job advocating for Maggie and for Paul for asking for the life sentence, which Judge Newman did sentence Alex to.

There was a dispute as to whether or not the judge should permit and allow evidence concerning his financial, really, misrepresentations, the lies and everything else to the clients. Defense saying, hey, number one, it's not relevant to murder, number two, it's so prejudicial. That is a term that we lawyers used to say that, listen, even if the jury doesn't believe you murdered someone, given the fact that puts you and paints you in such a bad light, it reflects on your character, they're liable to find you guilty anyway. So, I think that is being the -- all of the introduction concerning the financial crimes that he wasn't on trial for, it's fertile for an appeal.Last point, having said that, there was, of course, a firm legal basis for the judge to permit it. You can permit evidence which goes to show motive. Remember the whole essence of the prosecution's case and setting the foundation was that Alex Murdaugh did this because the world was crumbling in, his financial crimes were being exposed, his family was learning about that. So, the prosecution says, hey, we should be permitted to put this before the jury, because that's what we're showing what's his motivation to commmitte these murders.
