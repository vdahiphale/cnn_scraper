Republican Elise Stefanik announced that they are launching this investigation into what she described as the, quote, \"pathetic and morally bankrupt testimony\" earlier this week. Let me read you a line from Stefanik statement. She wrote, quote, \"We will use our full congressional authority to hold these schools accountable for their failure on the global stage.\" She noted that this is going to include subpoena power. It should be noted that it was Stefanik's questioning of the university president on Tuesday that really sparked all of this controversy. The university president struggled to answer questions about whether or not cause for genocide against Jews would violate the university's code of conduct. Listen to one of those exchanges between Stefanik and Penn President Liz Magill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): I am asking, specifically calling for the genocide of Jews.

Which was also right around the time that the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, condemned Magill's testimony, called for the Board of Trustees to look into this. Boris, we are going to stay on top of what comes out of these meetings in Pennsylvania and these calls from lawmakers for more answers in more accountability for the university leaders.",

They are all conducting this operational stand down on these Ospreys a week after an Osprey crashed off the coast of Japan and killed all eight servicemembers on board.It really comes amid a number of crashes that have been suffered by these Ospreys over the last 20 months or so, which have resulted in 20 deaths over four different crashes. Clearly, this is something the U.S. military found that they really need to address here. And out of an abundance of caution they are grounding the entire fleet across the military. And in a statement, the commander of Air Force Special Operations Command said, quote, \"Preliminary investigation information indicates a potential material failure caused the mishap last week off the coast of Japan. \"But the underlying cause of the failure is unknown at this time. But the standdown will provide time and space for a thorough investigation to determine causal factors and recommendations to ensure the Air Force V22's fleet returns to flight operations.\" They really do not know exactly what happened here. That is what they are going to be investigating, whether this is an internal problem with the Ospreys themselves. Because a preliminary investigation has concluded that this was not some kind of pilot error, for example. This was something intrinsic to the machinery itself. So out of an abundance of caution, they will be grounding the entire fleet, which, of course, raises questions about whether that is going to affect the operations here. But deputy Pentagon press secretary, Sabrina Singh, just told reporters that each service essentially will be reevaluating the timeline of investigating this and getting them back up into the air when they are deemed, of course, safe -- Boris?",

Musk often uses his perch of 155 million followers on \"X\" to lash out at critics, lash out, really, at anyone who refuses to bow down to his throne.Whether it is a wise business decision, probably not. If you are Bob Iger and you are at Disney, you are probably already not inclined to resume advertising after he, quite literally, told advertisers, singling out Iger, and told them to go \"F\" themselves. They're probably not inclined to advertising after that. But even if you were, now that Elon Musk is going on this rampage against Bob Iger, and misspelling his name at times, you're probably not going to resume advertising. And that's a big problem for \"X\" because \"X\" is really dependent on advertising. That's where they get the vast majority of their revenue. And Elon Musk himself has said that this current ad boycott could eventually or will eventually kill \"X,\" will lead to the death of his company. And so, you know, alienating one of your biggest advertisers even more, it's hard to see how that's a wise business decision. But again, it's classic Elon. He just can't help himself.",

His father making the announcement on \"X.\"In his own social media post, Hurst says it happened after he took a hit in a game against the Chicago Bears last month. Adding that he can't actually remember what happened up to four hours after the game. Let's discuss with Dr. Robert Cantu. He's a leading expert on concussions and brain injury in sports. Dr. Cantu, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. So post-traumatic amnesia. That must have been a really significant hit. How exactly does that happen? DR. ROBERT CANTU, DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL RESEARCH, CANTU CONCUSSION CENTER: Well, amnesia comes in two types, Boris. One is anterograde and the other is retrograde. They're both under the name post- traumatic because they happen after trauma to the head, trauma to the brain. Anterograde is amnesia or loss of memory starting at the time of the hit going forward. Which is what you've described here, for four hours. By far and away, the most common. And most people, most researchers and clinicians think because it is so common, it's probably less important than the other kind of amnesia called retrograde. And that is forgetting things that happened before you even got hit in the head. Like what you were doing the whole day leading up to whenever you were hit. Both of the amnesias are felt to be graded in severity by how long they last. And clearly, when amnesia last more than minutes, it lasts hours, that's more severe than an amnesia that only lasted a few minutes. But amnesia sometimes can last days. Four hours is not insignificant. It's certainly not rare.",

In other words, some people with cognitive behavioral and mood issues, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, never have had them prior to concussions. But it's also very common that somebody may have had that earlier intheir life at a fairly minimal level, at a level they could deal with quite well. But then after a head injury, it's like an injury on top of an injury or an injury on top of a dysfunctional situation. You can greatly aggravate the underlying issues.
