      "sentences": "For more than a week, Haiti`s marauding gangs prevented Prime Minister Ariel Henry from returning to the country hewas supposed to lead, until finally Henry reached a breaking point and agreed on Monday night to resign. ARIEL HENRY, HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My government will leave immediately after the inauguration of the council. We will be a caretaker government until they name a prime minister and a new cabinet. Haiti needs peace. Haiti needs stability. OPPMANN (voice-over): Henry had traveled from Haiti to Kenya to sign an agreement with the government there to provide troops to fight the out-of- control gangs terrorizing his beleaguered nation. Once he left, the gangs united to further batter the Haitian government in a series of coordinated attacks. The latest explosion of violence leading to a massive jailbreak that freed thousands of prisoners closed the country`s main airport indefinitely and forced the United States and other embassies to evacuate diplomats via helicopter. The news of Henry`s impending resignation is not placating the leaders of gangs, though, who have threatened an all-out civil war. JIMMY \"BARBEQUE\" CHERIZIER, HAITI GANG LEADER: We in Vivasan (ph) are demanding that the Haitian people must choose the person who will lead the country. OPPMANN (voice-over): But it is the Haitian people who are suffering the most. More than 300,000 have been displaced by the violence, the U.N. says, gangs block access to food, water, and hospitals. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with regional leaders in Jamaica and announced an increase in U.S. funding to the security mission to be led by Kenyan troops. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I`m announcing today that the United States Department of Defense is doubling its approved support for the mission from $100 million to $200 million. And that brings the total U.S. support to $300 million for this effort. OPPMANN (voice-over): Following the announcement that Henry will resign, Kenyan officials now saying a government needs to be in place in Haiti before their troops can deploy, creating more doubt of when exactly they will have boots on the ground to begin fighting the heavily armed local gang. For too many Haitians living in a country where there is no longer a functioning government, no escape from the violence. It is already too late. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Ten second trivia. There`s been an uproar online over the cost of a Big Mac meal at a McDonald`s in Darien, Connecticut. What`s the price?$10, $12, $18 or $20? If you said $18, that is correct. It`s becoming an increasing trend on social media to see users sharing a look at their fast-food meals and questioning the cost as prices skyrocket in the U.S. Now, you may be familiar with surge pricing from apps like Uber that charge you a different price for the same service, depending on the time of day and how many people want it at the same time. Airlines, hotels, event and sports ticket vendors, they have been using this strategy for a long time, allowing them to bump prices up or down, depending on demand. Well, now, restaurants are experimenting with surge pricing too. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reports that this month, San Diego- based Cali BBQ, for instance, would charge you around $18 for a pulled pork sandwich delivered on a Saturday night, but it would only cost you about $12 on a weekday afternoon. Last month, Wendy`s announced it too would test surge pricing, but after customer backlash, the fast-food chain said it would instead offer discounts in the slower hours. The restaurant industry is still bouncing back after the pandemic. Restaurants are looking into surge pricing as a way to boost profits and offset growing labor and food costs amid the supply shortages. So what say you? If you own a restaurant, would you try surge pricing? If so, how would you justify and introduce it to your customers? If not, and you had to boost revenue, how else would you do it? All right, more and more employees are heading back to work in person post- pandemic, and according to some studies, they`re bringing back some bad habits with them. So much so that some believe a proper workplace etiquette refresher might be needed. We got a chance to speak with an etiquette expert who gives some workplace tips for how to act appropriately at work, or school for that matter, along with some good old-fashioned people skills when working alongside others. They might be just as important as the actual work itself. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
