It`s because the band and all its members are stopping to join the South Korean army. The nation requires all able bodied men to serve at least 18 months in the armed forces by age 28, due to ongoing threats from North Korea. Fans are upset and I mean, they are hot. No new tours or music for BTS for several years. The plan is for the ban to get together again around 2025, after all seven members complete their service. The decision could also come with an economic cost. Analysts project that between 2014 and 2023, the group would have contributed $29.4 billion to the South Korean economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We heard from the label Big Hit Music saying, quote, they respect the needs of the country. Now, this has been under speculation as I say, for months. This has been debated within the South Korean parliament itself, as to whether or not BTS should be exempted or whether they should be carrying out their mandatory service. It is a conscription that all able bodied men between the ages of 18 and 28 do need to go and serve in the military. Now, it`s increased by two years, just a couple of years ago, for the age of 30, just for those who excel in popular culture and art. So, it did defer somewhat the decision for BTS and gave them some breathing space. But the argument for the exemption is that there are some sportsmen who have won Olympics medals, Asian Games medals, who have been exempted from military service. There`s also some classical musician, so award winning global musicians and singers that have been exempted as well. But it was decided and it was debated at length that BTS should go ahead. Big Hit Music saying, quote, both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as the group around 2025. So, certainly, the BTS Army as their passionate fans are known will be looking forward to that date. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Long distance travel for large cargo can be overwhelming, but not with Airbus Beluga cargo jet. The Airbus which gets its name from its resemblance to a Beluga whale made a rare appearance on U.S. soil over the weekend. It landed at the Kennedy Space Center. CNN`s space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Behold the Airbus Beluga, making a rare appearance over American soil this weekend with the special delivery to the Kennedy Space Center. The EuroStar Neo telecommunications satellite safely arrived in Florida, in a cargo bay in this whale of a plane. The giant transporter is named for its resemblance, the Beluga whale. First rolled out in the `90s, the Beluga ST, was designed to move oversized cargo across the globe, for military hardware to aircraft parts for its own fleets. With a payload length of 39 meters, about 128 feet, it`s one of the only planes that could transport space equipment, and spotting the Beluga is a treat for airplane enthusiasts. Aviation lovers in the U.S. got a look at this giant over the weekend for the first time since 2009, when it delivered Europe`s tranquility module for the international space station. And if you think this model is impressive, take a look at the Beluga XL. It has 30 percent more transport capacity than its little brother. But it only flies the European skies for now.
