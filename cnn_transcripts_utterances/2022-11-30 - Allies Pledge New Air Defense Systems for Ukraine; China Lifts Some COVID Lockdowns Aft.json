So, the short answer is, it's very complicated and it takes time, and we don't have the time. And it is true that we were also able to restore some of the electricity infrastructure and the heating system, for example and the water supply system, that's back up and running in Kyiv, for example. It was gone. A week ago, there was no water supply in the whole city of Kyiv. But it is also true that this is, you know, far and few between, given what we would normally need, and given the pre-sort of terrorist attack conditions that we had when the energy system was up and running.

This is a visit that showed from the European pointof view have been all about the continuation of what we saw in 2018. The Trans-Atlantic alliance made even stronger by everything that we've seen in Ukraine. The efforts within NATO to take on Russia in Ukraine. All that proximity, all that closeness that we saw summit after summit, whether it was G7 format or NATO with of course, the last couple of years. All of the natural proximity as well between these two presidents, let's face it, are far more made to get along on paper. Both because they have a natural chemistry and because they're frankly, multilateralist in their views. This should be a state visit that should be much easier for the Europeans to organize than it had been in 2018. And yet, the interesting thing, Isa, is of course, that the background to all this is the Inflation Reduction Act. The Europeans are extremely worried about the impact that's going to have, particularly on European automobiles. The French say, the Germans will be much more impacted, but still, this is what Emmanuel Macron is going to talk about. The fact that the war in Ukraine may have brought them together, but Europeans need to be heard on what they believe is no longer a level playing field when it comes to energy, when it comes to trade. And more than that, Europeans are facing, Isa, a very cold Winter. They feel that they're bearing the brunt of the sanctions that have been brought to bear against Russia. What they want is more effort on the part of the Biden administration on energy prices. Now,  this comes of course, in the context, as Kylie was just saying, of the August disagreement. It wasn't just a substance, it was also the way that, that was heard by the Europeans. Europeans at this stage need to be reassured that they are being heard, and that they're being heard on the things that matter to them post- Ukraine.

We spoke with the Spanish foreign minister just a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, Russian lawmakers landed a major blow to that country'[s LGBTQ community. The upper house of parliament unanimously voted to an act of a controversial so-called propaganda law. It bans all Russians from promoting or praising homosexual relationships. This applies to books, films and media. The law was already in effect in with regard to sharing such material with children. Now it applies to adults as well. The bill now goes to Russian president Vladimir Putin to be signed into law. People found guilty of breaking this law or even publicly suggesting that homosexual relationships are, quote, \"normal,\" could be fined up to $6,600. For legal entities, it could mean up to $82,000 dollar fines. The bill says offending foreigners can be arrested and held for up to 15 days or deported. LGBTQ activists and human rights groups are, of course, pushing back. Earlier I spoke with Dilya Gafurova, the head of former charitable foundation, Sphere, which was Russia's biggest LGBTQ network.

Explain to our viewers around the world just how promising this new drug is. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SR. MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Isa, this drug is indeed promising. But I want to manage expectations. It is by no means a cure for alzheimer's. Let's take a look at the study. So the study authors they took 1,800 people who are in the early stages of alzheimer's between 50 and 90 years old. They split them into two equal groups. One group got a placebo. One group got the experimental drug. What they found is that the folks who got the drug, they did have cognitive decline over the next 1.5 years. But it was 27 percent slower than the folks who received the placebo. And their amyloid levels dropped. That is a good thing. Amyloids are the plaques that you see in brains of people with alzheimer's disease. Now the two big questions they see regulators, for example, the FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world, is are these, is that enough, those two things, does it mean anything in the lives of these alzheimer's patients? Do they feel different? Were they able to improve the quality of their lives? And if the answer is yes, is it worth the potential risk? There were adverse events. There were side effects with this drug. The folks who took the drug, 17 percent of them had brain bleeding; 12 percent of them had brain swelling. Now to be clear, there were folks who got the placebo who also had those two things. But not at rates that are that high. So we do expect to hear from the FDA, something within the coming weeks. It's interesting; the authors themselves said that longer studies needed to be done to look more at the efficacy and the safety of this drug.",
