I think he has long been a supporter of Israel throughout his entire political career, one of the most stalwart in Congress when he was in the Senate, and certainly when he was vice president.And he feels that the actions that the Netanyahu government is taking right now are actually damaging to Israel in the long run, hurting its relationships, not just with the United States, but with the allies in Europe and in the region. And I think he fears very much for Israel's future if those relationships are so seriously afraid that they lose allies in the future. And that includes the United States not losing us as an ally entirely, but if you, if you harm that relationship to the point where we can no longer have any kind of persuasive power with the prime minister, I think the risk becomes pretty profound in his mind.

Joe Biden won it by less than 1 percent in 2020, and it will probably be a low single digit race an outcome in this cycle.So, you know, these polls, really, as you know, Abby, you know, sort of measure the margins pretty narrowly. I think it is a positive sign, though, and I think it's a sign that voters are beginning to focus on the reality of the choice as opposed to the, you know, hope that there might be a different option, both in the Democratic and the Republican Party, that some members of those parties have felt. And I think that, ultimately, elections do tend to be decided by economic factors, not just how voters feel now, although that's very, very important, but how they feel the candidate might do in the future. And there's reason to believe, and certainly evidence that Biden can point to that shows he has done a lot for, you know, workers in America for, you know, manufacturing in America. And I think the Microsoft announcement today in Racine was a big deal for that state, especially in contrast to what President Trump tried to do with Foxconn in Wisconsin and that failure.

It puts the jury on the edge of their seat.

There were some bumpy spots in that testimony, just like with Stormy Daniels, just like with Keith Davidson, even Hope Hicks, who testified in this trial, who's a communications professional, had rough spots in her testimony.The same with Pecker. He had the fewest. He was very well prepared to testify. I think that Michael Cohen has the ability to come across to this jury as a truth teller. It's going to be a tough cross. No question. Yes, I think he has the intelligence, the discipline, and he's genuinely remorseful. Look, prosecutors have to make cases when there's a conspiracy with former participants in the conspiracy. Michael is better situated than the cooperators in some of my cases because he's not working off any jail time. There's one less vector of attack on him. So I think he's going to exceed expectations.",

Kennedy Jr. revealed that a doctor told him he had health issues, quote, \"caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died\".Yes, you heard that right. Kennedy says that since then he's recovered from his memory loss and brain fog and that the parasite didn't require any treatment ultimately. But that's not all that RFK Jr. had to say on the matter. He posted on X earlier today, I offer to eat five more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate. And I feel confident of the result, even with a six worm handicap. Joining me on all of this, Republican strategist Joe Pinion, CNN contributors Natasha Alford and Leah Wright Rigueur. What a thing to joke about. Weird. But just his campaign spokesman also says this questioning Mr. Kennedy's health is a hilarious suggestion given his competition. But this is a really serious thing. I mean, it's not just the worm. I mean, there's atrial fibrillation that was disclosed in the story. I shouldn't even say disclosed, revealed in this story.

John Fetterman, people, when they saw him being attacked over his health, they actually rallied around him. Hillary Clinton, she couldn't even get a stumble out after pneumonia without people jumping all over it. So I think at the end of the day, it comes down to the candidate. How invested are people in this candidate? What do they -- what do they get excited about in terms of this candidate?

All of these things are on the chopping block. They are under -- everyone is under the same amount of scrutiny. So it does matter. So the idea that he could laugh it off and kind of run his campaign as the healthy one, all of that goes kind of up in the air.

WRIGHT RIGUEUR; But I also and I also want to add on to, I think, Natasha's point that we do have to be careful in terms of thinking about what is the role that third party candidates play.

I think all of us collectively, when I say that, as if the votes belong to the Republican Party or they belong to the Democratic Party, if they belong to Joe Biden or they belong to Donald Trump, they do not. They belong to the people. And if you're having difficulty getting people to understand why they support your candidate, it's probably because you haven't learned from history. I mean, Van Jones famously wrote in his book about the fact that people who were basically on the front lines of Barack Obama had no idea where the campaign office was for Hillary Clinton in 2016 in Michigan. And so issue by issue, you have a Biden administration that refuses to even acknowledge that mistakes were ever made on their watch. A Trump administration that whether you hate him or love him can point to seven million jobs pre-COVID and say things were better when we were there. So that's where the election will be pitched.

Now, this is happening after the botched rollout of this year's new FAFSA form. That helps determine how much financial aid a student can get. It is the gateway to billions of dollars for students who need help affording college. It's now, in theory, simpler, with as few as 18 questions. That's down from a maximum of 108.But there have been problems, processing problems, glitches that have led to major delays. So many students don't even know what their financial aid will look like next year. CNN's Rene Marsh has been following this very closely and joins me now. Rene, this is a big deal.

But the 10,000 foot view on this is some high school seniors are still feeling the impact from the agency's bungled rolled out of this new simplified version of what has been a historically burdensome financial aid application known as FAFSA.Now, students typically receive financial aid awards letters from schools in March and they commit to a college by May 1st. And here we are, May 8th, and some students still have not received financial aid packages to determine whether they can afford to go to a specific school. And some students are deciding to essentially make a decision without knowing whether they will get financial aid or not because they fear losing their slot. But as you mentioned at the top, there are students who remain in limbo. They're unable to finalize their higher education plans for the fall. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona was on Capitol Hill yesterday. He was answering some tough questions from lawmakers on this. And he had this message for students and parents. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIGUEL CARDONA, U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY: Even the better FAFSA, which is frustrating and as challenging as it has been, delays and I apologize to the students and families that have had to deal with delays.

But either way, this represents a decline in the number of students applying for financial aid. And the worry is that some students may forego college altogether when you really drill down on the data. The drop in application submissions is not the same across the board.
