Yesterday's demonstration was an organized one rather than a spontaneous one with a little over a million participants across the country with large numbers of -- then later on in the afternoon, violence. And the reason he's standing so firm is really straightforward as far as he's concerned. Within three years' time the country will be facing a 12.5 billion euro -- a similar amount of dollars deficit on every year just on the pensions file. And he says that is economically unsustainable. The other day he gave an interview saying I don't want to do this. I understand why people are taking to the streets. I'm rejecting, of course, any kind of violent activity. But I am not going to do a U- turn on this. But because he forced it through using presidential feat (PH) effectively, rather than a parliamentary vote, the Parliament -- the government then survived last Monday a vote of no confidence -- indeed, two votes of no confidence -- the latter of them only by nine votes. But even in the face of all of this opposition with about two-thirds of the country opposed to these reforms, he's saying France simply cannot afford that kind of large, yes -- and ultimately, that's because they've got an aging population, Christine.",
