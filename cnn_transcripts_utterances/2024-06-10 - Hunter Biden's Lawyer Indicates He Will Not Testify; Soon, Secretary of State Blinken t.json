I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Breaking this morning, Hunter Biden's defense attorney indicates that the president's son will not testify in his own defense. That means closing arguments could soon get underway in his federal gun trial. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez joins us from outside the court. Evan, how big of a risk would it have been for Hunter Biden to take that stand?",

      "sentences": "It's a big risk, Jim. I think that's the reason why you had the defense spend the weekend weighing the pros and cons of this. One of the things that they wanted to do if he took the stand was to argue that and to tell the jury that Hunter Biden has been sober since 2019. And so that would perhaps, in their view, at least go a little bit of a way of reversing some of the damage from all of this testimony, these volumes of testimony from the prosecution about his drug use from 2015 through 2019. That's part of what they're trying to figure out how to limit the damage of.Now, if he were to take the stand, the prosecution had warned that among the things they are going to bring up was the fact that he was discharged from the Navy after testing positive for drugs about a decade ago, and also that he had pleaded -- agreed to plead guilty to all of these charges as part of a plea deal that fell apart last summer here at this very courthouse. So, in the end, we anticipate that when the defense and the prosecution rest their case and they go to the jury, we'll hear officially, formally that Hunter Biden is not going to take the stand. One of the things that the defense attorneys have been arguing behind the scenes and what they've agreed on is that the jury will be told that if the defendant doesn't take the stand, that they can't hold that against him.

We're going to remind people about some of his own family there's a lot of people who have testified that they believe he was doing drugs during that time. And in the end, what the judge has already ruled is that prosecutors don't have to prove that Hunter Biden was doing drugs on that day in October, only that he's doing drugs and using drugs around that time. What that around that time exactly means, it will be up to the jury to interpret that. Jim?",

And to the extent the defense wants to make the case, which they do that well, the prosecution has not proved that he was an addict at that key time in October 2018. They've already done that. They called Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden's daughter, to the stand. She testified that as far as she knew he was sort of in recovery then, she didn't see him using drugs at that point. That's more than enough if you want to make your defense. It's the right move not to call him. It's a constitutional right not to take the stand. They did the right thing.",

So, it's all going to come down to this term of addiction.And I was talking with Shan before.

When we would do these cases, there's a whole category of what we call prohibited persons, people under federal law who are not allowed to possess firearms. Far and away the most common category that's prosecuted is prior felons, people have previously been convicted of felony crimes.It doesn't come up that often, for one thing. It's also, like I said, there's fuzziness around the term and addict. And, frankly, they're seen as the less important of the prohibited person's categories. There's seven or eight categories, and this one is just seen as sort of small potatoes. So, it was something I never even really heard of when I was a prosecutor. It exists, for sure. And it is charged. Hunter Biden is not the only person ever to be charged with it, but it's rare to see this charge, especially in isolation. Hunter Biden has the tax charges separately in California, but it's rare that you see essentially a case entirely based on an addict in possession.",

This is just like a purely possession kind of crime.I do want to say this idea of him testifying, which I know you've touched upon this, but part of that decision, as Evan was reporting, was the idea that the prosecution says we're going to bring up disarmable discharge. They also seem to assert that they're going to bring up his plea agreement, which I just think is totally off. I mean, if they were successful in doing that, one, it's appealable. Two, you bring that up, you can all say, yes, well, you guys were willing to plea this out to diversion, you know? What's going on here? So, that seemed a little bit questionable to me too.",

This was in a refugee camp in the central part of the Gaza Strip in civilian apartment buildings.There were certainly Hamas militants who were killed as part of this raid. There were certainly scores, we believe, of Palestinian civilians who were killed as part of this raid. Israel and the U.S. will argue, and they are arguing, that this just goes to show that Hamas is hiding behind civilians and using them as civilian shields. On the pro-Palestinian side, this is going to reinforce the argument that Israel doesn't care about killing civilians as long as they reach their military objectives and getting these hostages home. So, it's obviously an extraordinarily complicated situation, but this will give a little bit more leeway to Netanyahu, who has been criticized for not doing enough to get the hostages home.

This certainly will be taken into account when the man, Yahya Sinwar, who is going to decide whether or not this deal will be agreed to by Hamas, looks at the civilian casualties of this raid.Now, as Alex was just saying, there were almost certainly Hamas militants that were killed in the raid. We saw from the images from our CNN producer on the ground of those coming into the Al Aqsa Martyr's Hospital, there were women and children everywhere. So, there were certainly significant numbers of civilians that were killed too. We don't have a breakdown of civilians versus militants at this point, but it will have an impact. Now, we've heard from the Israeli side. We've heard the missing families and the hostages' forum. This is the families of those that are still being held, saying that they hope this won't make a difference. We are hearing also from the mother of one of those Almog Meir Jan, who was rescued on Saturday, she has said beyond thanking the IDF and being delighted that her son is back, clearly, that there needs to be a deal. So, even those who have just had their loved ones handed back to them in this raid, in this mission, they are also calling for a deal that this is the way to get more of these hostages back.

CNN cannot independently verify the death toll. Could this have been done with fewer Palestinian deaths? What's your sense of it?O'SHEA:  Well, again, the reports I'm reading coming out on various number of signal groups that are coming from on the ground that the force came under attack and they responded in kind. So, again, when you're holding hostages in civilian locations that happen to be armed civilians that are firing at the rescue force, of course, there's going to be casualties. And that quote, civilian term, is probably exaggerated in terms of the numbers and the term civilian is loosely used because we know Hamas routinely fires from hospitals. They fire from churches. They fire from mosques and from school. So, this is part and parcel. You know, they are, in a sense, keeping the entire Gazan population under hostage themselves to their ideology. And this is the result when that kind of law of armed conflict is ignored and you hold hostages in civilian houses, you're going to have civilian deaths when you watch a hostage rescue mission.",

What does this tell you about the possibility that there may be more hostages alive than people recognize? I mean, it's very difficult to say conclusively.O'SHEA:  Yes. Well, there, I've seen multiple reports that a large majority of the hostages have been killed. There have been reports of 30, 40 that the Hamas has reported have been killed in IDF strikes. So, again, what is that number? Is it 30? Is it 40? Is it 100? We really don't know. But the fact that the IDF world that get the intelligence on the hostage location, again, not in Rafah with the center of the focus of IDF is right now, but in the center of Gaza, that was a daring raid. I mean, this will go down in the annals of the raid on Entebbe for the IDF. And it's a remarkable accomplishment, to be honest. And I know as someone who was in the special operations world for 30 years, pulling up these missions is fraught with risk, and it is a successful mission regardless of the numbers of civilian casualties, getting their hostages back as the end state. It's the stated goal of Netanyahu. And he's proving to the Israeli people that he's keeping his promises about turning no stone to get back all these hostages.",
