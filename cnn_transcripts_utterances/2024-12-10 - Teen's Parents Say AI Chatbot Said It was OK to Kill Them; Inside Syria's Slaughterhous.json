One of the families claims the app told their son it was OK to kill them for limiting his screen time. The parents are asking the court to shut down the platform until its alleged dangers can be fixed.These filings come after a Florida mom brought a separate lawsuit against Character AI in October saying the platform was to blame for her 14-year-old son's death after it allegedly encouraged his suicide. Character AI says it's implemented new trust and safety measures since then. Let's get the latest from Laurie Segall, technology journalist and CEO of Mostly Human Media. Laurie, thank you so much for being with us this afternoon. First, help us understand just what Character AI is and what it offers.",

An AI platform that lets you kind of handle different tasks and search for types of things.Character AI is almost like an AI-driven storytelling platform that enables you to pick a friend or a character that you almost want to do AI role-playing with, where you can talk to this character about anything. Think of it almost for us like an imaginary friend, but it talks back. It's always on. It's always there. It's highly personalized. And that's the rise of what they call empathetic artificial intelligence because, you know, Character AI, their tagline is AI that feels alive. These bots are created to seem like friends, to feel or seemingly feel empathetic. And that's essentially what Character AI is. And I would say millions of people are using it, many of those teenagers.",

Officials now tell CNN some of the people detained at the so-called slaughterhouse prison had forgotten their own names or where they were from. Despite hopes that a large number of missing people would be found inside the prison, rescuers now say only a few thousand were actually there.But before that confirmation, thousands of people rushed to the prison in a desperate search for loved ones condemned to Assad's dungeons. CNN's Clarissa Ward was there for their frantic search. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The stream of families never stops climbing towards Syria's most notorious Saydnaya Prison, pushed on by reports that thousands of people imprisoned by the regime of Bashar al-Assad are still trapped alive in a section underground. The red section of the prison they've been trying for days to reach it, Maysoon Laboud (ph) tells us. There's no oxygen because the ventilation went out, and so they all may die.

If you're talking about older workers, the workers who are over the age of 65 who are in the workforce are disproportionately going to be people who enjoy what they do, right? Because they do, they are of retirement age. They have the option to retire, perhaps to fall back on savings or on Social Security benefits and whatnot if they have enough savings.
