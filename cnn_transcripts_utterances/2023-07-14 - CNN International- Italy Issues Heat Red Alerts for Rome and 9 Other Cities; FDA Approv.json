Barbie for us in Rome.The World's Health Organization has classified the popular artificial sweetener aspartame as possibly carcinogenic. Officials say some research showed a potential link between the product and liver cancer but that the science was by no means conclusive at the stage. The organization says its guidelines for consumption remain the same. Aspartame found in thousands of products like Diet Coke and Pepsi Zero, some juices, low-calorie ice cream and sugar-free gum, also contain this artificial sweetener. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first birth control pill that can be purchased over the counter without a prescription. It is called Opill and doctors hope it can significantly expand access to contraception because it doesn't require patients to take the time to visit a doctor to get a prescription or pay for that doctor's visit. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell explains how Opill works. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You lose a few percentage points in the sort of typical use if you're not perfect at taking at the exact same time every day.Importantly the FDA put no age redescription on this here and that is something doctors tell me that is important because it is especially younger people who can often have trouble getting prescription contraception. The only people for whom it's contraindicated, who should not take it, are those who have breast cancer or a history of breast cancer because it is a hormone. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Leaders of Sudan's neighboring countries gathered at a regional summit in Cairo on Thursday.

The Chandrayaan-3 -- that means moon vehicle in Sanskrit -- is launching today 2And as the name suggests, this is India's third mission to the moon and it's part of the country's greater bid to be a space power. During the last mission that took place in 2019, the rover crashed after a hard landing. So with this mission, they are trying to land the rover softly and also land in pretty challenging terrain near the Moon's unexplored south pole. Now space officials say that the lander is due to reach the moon on August 23. And after the landing, the scientists they plan to deploy the rover and also to conduct some scientific experiments on the moon. Including analyzing the chemistry of the soil, measuring the temperature of the lunar surface and standing for moon quakes. Now earlier today -- this is launch day -- India's Prime Minister tweeted this -- let's bring it up for you. He said, 14th of July 2023 will always be etched in these golden letters as far as India's space sector is concerned. Chandrayaan-3, our third lunar mission, will embark on its journey. This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation.
