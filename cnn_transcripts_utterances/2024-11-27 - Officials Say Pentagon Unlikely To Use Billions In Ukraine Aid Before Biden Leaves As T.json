      "sentences": "The U.S. has been trying at a steady pace to send as much aid as it can to Ukraine, and it has roughly $6.8 billion left in the authority to send weapons, equipment and systems to Ukraine. But the pace was way off. They were only sending a few hundred million a month, right about $750 million over the course of the last few months. And it wasn't apparently going to be able to use all of those billions it has left.Now, five U.S. officials, with whom CNN has spoken, acknowledge the Biden administration is unlikely to be able to use all of that before January 20th. They will try to increase the amount going over, but all of that $6.8 billion, unlikely to all of it be used. Of course, that's a huge deal for Ukraine, which has relied on U.S. and NATO weapons to be able to try to fight Russia as well as it can across the frontlines. Ukraine and its military have very much relied on that weaponry. So, this could be a significant blow to them as they were expecting or at least needing some of these crucial systems. Now, one U.S. official we spoke with says it's up to the Trump administration when it comes on January 20th to decide what to do with what might be billions left over in that authority to send supplies. Either they could cut off the weapons and the flow of weapons that are already heading over in fairly large numbers until January 20th, or they could keep sending it or not announce any new military aid packages. That effectively will be up to the Trump administration when it enters the White House in 55 days or so.",

Now, it's not the only plan under consideration. One of the other potential picks, as we've reported, for the special envoy to Ukraine and Russia with Rick Grenell had his own ideas. He suggested setting up autonomous zones along the frontline there to try to bring this war to an end. Meanwhile, another member of the Trump team, who will be a member of the National Security Council, also suggested the U.S. might send even more weapons under the incoming Trump administration. Alex, in short, it'll be up to Trump in the end, but these are the ideas that are being presented to him and his team.

What is your reaction as a former military man to Kellogg getting this position? What could it mean, do you think, for the level of U.S. support and Ukraine's eventual possible NATO membership?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, that's going to be really interesting, Alex, to see exactly how this plays out, because a lot of the details, as we've talked about, are kind of vague at this point. But I think General Kellogg is a better choice than former Ambassador Grenell. It would have been because General Kellogg at least has an understanding of the military situation in Ukraine. He also has an understanding of some of the nuances involved in the Ukraine situation. Now, the one thing that I think would be positive for Ukraine is the idea that if Russia does not negotiate in a way that is acceptable to the United States, then, of course, the risk is that to Russia would be that the United States would reopen a spigot of aid to the Ukrainians. But as we've seen with the $7 billion, so that's in the pipeline right now, spending that wisely and spending that effectively will definitely be a challenge, especially if it's a short notice type situation.",

He thinks that although his economy is very strained and he doesn't have sufficient manpower and he doesn't want to call for a full mobilization of Russian men, which is why he brought in the North Korean men, he still thinks that he can hang in there and outlast the Ukrainians. But if President Trump is credible in basically threatening to provide Ukraine with what it needs to retake territory and to hold onto the Russian territory, then that puts pressure on Putin, because this war is not popular in Russia.So, every day he has to wait. And if he thinks that Ukraine now has time on its side, meaning President Trump will back Ukraine, he will then be more motivated to seek a deal.

And so I think it's about 7 million are still outside of Ukraine. Most of them, of course, are women, but that's part of the economy. So, they can't let all the manpower go to the front. That's a reality. And when I was there, what I found was, unfortunately, it's not just shortages at the front, but they have shortages across society and in government.The second reason is political because, of course, President Zelenskyy has now been in office five years. Every electorate gets kind of sick of their president and would like elections. The Ukrainian people understand that they can't have elections while they're at war. But if President Trump brings peace, then there will be elections. And if President Zelenskyy wants to run, and most people assume he would, he will be an unpopular president running after having lowered the age to 18.",

Also the judge pointing to these allegations that the government has raised about Combs engaging in witness tampering, the judge saying that there is serious evidence of that, including from behind bars where Combs is held for the past ten weeks after he was first indicted. The prosecutors have brought forward, you know, that Combs had been using other inmates' phone numbers in order to make calls to evade law enforcement monitoring, that he also was using three-way calling to get on the phone with one person and then have them contact someone else he was not allowed to be talking to. So, the judge saying that was all serious and that if Combs was violating the rules behind bars did not demonstrate that there was a good reason to believe he would follow them if he was released. Now, Combs' attorneys have been relentless in trying to get him out. They said he could have stayed in a three-bedroom apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side, that he would have 24-hour security, no phones, no internet. But that did not persuade the judge, who just found that between the allegations of violence, the allegations of witness tampering, that he was not prepared to let Combs out of jail as he is waiting trial. That trial is set for May 5th in this case. Of course, Combs has also been hit with dozens of civil lawsuits from John and Jane Does, as well as some people suing under their real names, who have accused him of sexual abuse. Combs has denied all wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the charges. We've reached out to his legal team on the ruling today, Alex, and have not heard back.",

      "sentences": "Brian Todd, thanks so much for that report.Let's get more reaction from Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and vaccine immunologist. Dr. Mina, thank you so much for being with us. Before COVID vaccines were available back in December of 2020, Dr. Bhattacharya argued that people at high risk should be vaccinated while those considered low risk should go back to living normal lives. And he wrote in the Great Barrington Declaration, and I'm quoting, we know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity, i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable and that this can be assisted but is not dependent upon a vaccine. So, Doctor, first, is it even possible to reach herd immunity with COVID? And second, should we have let the disease run through the low risk population as he suggested? DR. MICHAEL MINA, EPIDEMIOLOGIST: So, certainly, it's not likely that we're going to reach herd immunity. It never really has been in the cards for COVID-19 and SARS COV2 virus. And there's very good biological underpinnings. But at the time that he was saying that, actually, many across the whole public health ecosystem were expecting there was going to be some herd immunity at some point, whether it be from vaccines or from natural infections. So, it wasn't a completely out-of-place remark regarding the potential existence of herd immunity at that time. Whether the Great Barrington Declaration and its call to sort of rip open the economy was the right public health move from the virus perspective, I think the consensus has been no and accurately so. One of the interesting aspects, though, about Dr. Bhattacharya is he was coming at it from a different perspective, from the perspective of what would be the outcome from a -- not from a virus and from a morbidity and mortality of the virus infection, but what will be the extended consequences of the lockdowns we had in place? And I think that those were very important to be focusing on and probably were not focused on enough at the time.",

But not unlike Dr. Bhattacharya, they both are tied in their interest in thinking more broadly about society. So, I personally don't see this all bad.

And then just in recent weeks, when President Biden met with President Xi on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Peru. This was a concerted effort to bring these Americans home and to get Beijing on board with this prisoner swap and we saw that come together today.But there were indications a couple of months ago that things were starting to turn, that the wheels were turning when another American who had been detained in China, David Lin, was released and this was done very, very quietly. Now we expect these Americans to land on American soil later tonight and be reunited with their families. They are heading to Texas, where we've seen a number of Americans who had been formerly detained go and participate in a program to help them re-acclimate to their normal lives. And their families are overjoyed, obviously, at the fact that they're going to see their loved ones as the Thanksgiving holiday is coming around. Kai Li, who was one of the Americans who was freed alongside Mark Swidan and John Leung, put out a statement about an hour ago and he said in part, that they enthusiastically welcomed the news that Kai has been released from captivity after just over 3,000 days of wrongful detention. They thanked the president, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, for working together to ensure today's successful outcome even without the pressure of a looming election. They delivered just in time for the holidays. And Kai also pushed for Biden in his remaining days in office to bring home the remaining Americans who are held hostage and wrongfully detained, Alex.",
