But, so far, we -- what we have seen is that people's views on this are really baked in and that most people have made up their minds about how they feel about both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I don't know if it is a game-changer in any way. If it would significantly move voters who thought they were committed to Donald Trump away from Trump. The one thing that we've heard consistently in polling and focus groups is that the idea of a conviction, some voters say, would be pivotal to them. If this case is the path that leads to that before November it's possible it could have an impact, and I think that's why you're seeing the delay strategy.",

I think that's a real concern. I mean, right now, there's a motion before the court about -- a reconsideration motion to keep names redacted and not from going public.

I said hey, I was there. I'd like to tell you who I saw and what I saw them doing. And they said yeah, we'll get back to you. Two weeks later, they did not get back to me again. I contacted them again. And then -- and it just went on with that. And I had to go on my own volition. Rodney Davis -- actually, who is no longer in Congress -- was over the committee that oversaw that and allowed me to view the tapes in the tunnel, and I pinpointed and I showed the person who was doing it. And I still was not ever asked about it. And that was one of the key components if you remember. They were saying they were on it. Somebody was broadcasting, telling everybody where we were -- which, in fact, they were. And, in fact, it was a member of the media. And then, the January 6 commission -- when they did not allow then- Speaker McCarthy to rightfully appoint, I believe, Jim Jordan and some other people to it. And Speaker Pelosi did something that's never been done since I've been in Congress or since any of -- even the old- timers. And heck, some of those guys I think came over on the Mayflower.
