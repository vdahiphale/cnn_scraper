And they come by way of Ken Chesebro who's been described as the -- in many ways, the architect of the fake electors plot. And Chesebro has recently sat down with state level investigators in Michigan and other key battleground states. But when he sat down with the Michigan investigators he laid out the document and also in his proper interview how the Trump campaign including Trump campaign officials are at the top of the hierarchy were intimately involved in trying to get these fake electric certificates to Washington, D.C. on January 6, and specifically, the certificates from two key battleground states Michigan and Wisconsin, when they learned that those certificates had been stuck in the mail.Now take a listen to what Chesebro told investigators in Michigan when he sat for an interview a few weeks ago.

That was sort of the plan that was in the works. You know, these are the lengths to which Trump campaign officials were really making sure that these certificates got there on time. And it's -- you got to notice, too, that this specific episode is vaguely referenced in Jack Smith's federal indictment of Trump under the section about pressuring Mike Pence to throw out legitimate electors.So, really, it underscores sort of the connective tissue between two key parts of Jack Smith's federal indictment and the allegations of broader conspiracy.",

I mean, as far as the Trump -- the charges against Trump in the Smith case, if you think about Jack Smith trying to prove a drug case, it doesn't really matter if the drugs get there by Chevrolet or Ford. And so, the details of how they got there, what it does is it gives some color, and it gives some context, and it explains part of the scheme and the depth of the scheme.It doesn't necessarily change the crime but it certainly adds more to it. And even though Trump is not really mentioned in the reporting, it's always campaign people and lawyers and such as that. The question will be, does it now solely the credibility of folks who have testified before the January 6 committee or in other judicial settings and cause some problems there or does it simply give Jack Smith another pressure point to get people to come forward and tell what they knew about this scheme?

We also know that he's spoken with prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin who are investigating sham GOP electors in their own states, but only the people who should probably be the most concern based on what we've heard here are these Trump lawyers because Chesebro seems to have some real bitterness towards them, saying that he has, quote, \"No warm feelings\" towards them, that they hid things from them, lied to him, and then lied to Congress. They should not be sleeping well. It's notable that he is naming these lawmakers.

But when you look at the bigger picture, I mean, she has struggled on this issue in the past. You know, in 2010 CNN KFILE did an investigation where she said the Civil War was, you know, a fight for tradition versus change. And she said the Confederate flag was not racist, but part of heritage and tradition. Obviously, years later, as the governor of South Carolina, she took down the Confederate flag after that deadly shooting at a historically black church in Charleston. What do you make of how she's handled not just this issue in this moment last night in New Hampshire, but overall on the campaign trail?TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPINDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTE: Yes, it kind of boils down to a point Eva just made, which it sometimes comes across that she crafts her message to fit the audience. And quite frankly, she's being perceived with as cracking her message on issues of race in the Civil War in ways that can speak to conservatives but also speak towards the center when she's trying to run more of a general election type campaign. So you know, when she talks about the Civil War, the Confederate flag in ways that whitewash or gloss over some of the racist implications of fighting to own people, fighting to own black slaves, so you can't avoid the race part of that. You can't avoid the race part that white supremacist organizations use the Confederate battle flag as a symbol. You can't ignore the race implications that Civil War and the Lost Cause became a tool during Jim Crow era and later during the Civil Rights era, a tool to attempt to intimidate black people who were fighting for segregation. Those are just truth, those are parts of American history. And when she doesn't hit those head on, she's being perceived as trying to speak to audiences so she doesn't make anyone mad.

And I think what it underscores especially to the Independents who might have been looking someplace else other than Trump, they're going to now rethink, well, you know, if I support somebody like Trump, I'm going to support Trump. If I wanted somebody completely different than Trump, she's not it because she had the opportunity, perhaps in this specific area to really differentiate herself from Trump and her other competitors, and she couldn't do it, she bumbled it completely.And it's also ironic that somebody like DeSantis is coming after her because DeSantis is no better.

WILL HURD, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the first comment I heard was her comments this morning, when she's made it very clear that the Civil War was because of slavery. She's made that clear. She doesn't think slavery is a jobs program like other people that are running in this race. Her opinion has been very clear. Her record on this is very clear. And I think your last speaker is correct. People are trying to use this as a thing because she has momentum. And that momentum is not going to change. This race is between two people, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, and Nikki Haley is still the best person, the best Republican to beat Donald Trump. And of course, Joe Biden loves the fact that everybody's talking about this today. Because we're talking about this, we're not talking about the crisis at the border, where he had to send his Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security down to Mexico City to beg for help.

For more on this story we are joined by Elliott Gotkine live in Tel Aviv tonight. Elliot, I mean, obviously we've been hearing about just how terrible and tragic the conditions in Gaza are. And this image just really seems to encapsulate that just how desperate people are for food, for water, for basic human necessities at this point.",

As you can see thousands of them trying to get to the front of the queue, they were only carrying flour and water but they were all so desperate for sustenance that they were actually fights, we understand, that broke out in some parts as people were trying to get to the front of the queue or to ensure that they were not the ones that went without.Now we know that not enough aid has been getting through into the Gaza Strip. It's far short of where it needs to be today, fewer than 100 trucks got through from the rougher crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip. Now there were hopes that when Israel agreed to allow aid to go directly from Israel into the Gaza Strip, through the Kerem Shalom crossing, that this would significantly boost the amount of aid that was going through to Gaza. But according to COGAT, at least, that's the Israeli body that administers that's in charge of civilian affairs in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It says that it was asked to close the crossing today because of logistical issues on the other side of the border in the Gaza Strip. So there are also logistical issues in addition to just getting enough aid through when it's so desperately needed, Kaitlan.",

We know that she was wounded on October the 7th when she was abducted by Hamas as part of its massacre of October the 7th when it killed 1,200 people inside Israel. It seems now that she died on that day perhaps are coming to her wounds. Her husband was also killed that day. Now Judi Weinstein, 70-year-old grandmother, she had four children, seven grandchildren. She even leaves her 95-year- old grandmother. She was the last living American female hostage being held in Gaza.There are still six male American citizens being held hostage in Gaza, we understand, that out of 100 plus hostages still being held and although talks are continuing attempt efforts to try to broker another truce that would see hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. That doesn't seem any sign of that on the horizon. Even President Biden just the other day, speaking with the Emir of Qatar to try to help with these talks push them along, but no signs of another deal anytime soon at least not yet, Kaitlan.",

And this is what they had to say in the letter to Abbott. It goes says SB 4, which is what the measure is known, is preempted and violates the United States Constitution. Accordingly, the United States intends to file suit to enjoin the enforcement of SB 4 unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.So the Justice Department essentially saying in this letter to Texas, that they will work, they will sue to block this measure from taking effect in March if the governor doesn't pull it back. But as you mentioned there, this is part of an ongoing saga between President Biden and the Texas governor over the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.
