We are expecting him to make his pitch for war aid to both Israel and Ukraine. Biden says he secured a deal with the Egyptian president to allow some trucks with desperately humanitarian aid to start crossing into Gaza tomorrow where millions are of civilians are running out of food, water, and medicine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it.

And of course, we are expecting these protests to continue ramping up, to continue to intensify. An essential message that we were hearing from people on the ground yesterday is they are outraged, they are frustrated by the situation inside the Gaza Strip, by the mounting civilian death toll, which is well over 3,000 now inside Gaza according to Palestinian authorities there. And they are frustrated by the international response as well as the delay in getting aid to those most in need, and so many, of course, in need inside Gaza.Now, of course, this isn't just on the popular front. This has also translated to impacts on the diplomatic front, as we saw that planned summit between President Biden, King Abdullah of Jordan, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, and of course Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, was canceled following that explosion, that attack on the Al-Ahli hospital inside Gaza. But we do know that today King Abdullah will be meeting with President El-Sisi in Cairo, the key focus there, of course, trying to bring about an end to this war. Erin?",

Bases in Iraq. We still have several thousand soldiers there, and in northeastern Syria, at the request of the Iraqi government, in the case of Iraq, to help them keep an eye on the Islamic State, which is necessary, by the way, because even after you destroy the Islamic State, which is what happened finally in Mosul, by the way. And Mosul is a city about the size of Gaza City. It took nine months for the Iraqi security forces to clear all of Mosul with our direct assistance. So, again, it puts it in perspective as well as identifying the potential for regional escalation.

But then what's the other big idea here, which is just begging for an answer and that is what next? Who's going to take over Gaza? If you break it, you own it. And again, we broke a rock and owned it. And it turned out that our phase four planning, the post-conflict planning, was inadequate. I remember asking, actually in Kuwait, again, just a two-star. I said, \"Can you give us a little more detail on what happens when we get to did top of the regime?\" And they said, \"You just get us to Baghdad, Dave.

When we have sorted through, there is at least significant doubt, if not evidence to the contrary, and those facts aren't fully established yet.
