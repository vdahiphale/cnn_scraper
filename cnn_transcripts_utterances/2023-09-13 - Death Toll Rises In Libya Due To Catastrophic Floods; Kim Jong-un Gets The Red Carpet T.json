Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade live at CNN's World Headquarters in Atlanta. Welcome to One World. Well, it is one of the deadliest floods on record in North Africa. And an emergency official says Libya is simply not prepared for a catastrophe of this magnitude. The death toll from crippling floods in eastern Libya has soared to more than 6000. Another 10,000 people are missing, potentially either swept out to sea or buried beneath the rubble of crumpled buildings. Derna, a northern coastal city once home to over 100,000 people is completely devastated after torrential rain caused by storm Daniel caused two dams to collapse. Some of the images coming from Derna are graphic. Hospitals there are no longer functioning and the morgues are full. Dead bodies are piling up on the sidewalks outside. Aid is trickling in from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and other nations, but aid agencies fear the political fractures in Libya could hamper its distribution. The Prime Minister of the internationally recognized gulf men Tripoli says they need urgent help retrieving the bodies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDULHAMID DBEIBEH, LIBYAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We do not need aid, not even medication or equipment, nor doctors or ambulances. Thanks to God, we have 400 ambulances that took off. But we have a problem in retrieving the bodies from the sea. The Libyan Navy, divers and frogmen are putting all their efforts into retrieving the bodies. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But in a sense, this is at best a preliminary number because we're talking about thousands of people who are unaccounted for. What is not in question, however, is that this was a catastrophe for which this country simply was not ready. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): A wall of water rushes toward the Eastern Libyan city of Derna. Upstream, two dams have burst. Tens of thousands of people now in mortal danger after a freak storm dumped eight months of rain in a single day. An army spokesman said entire neighborhoods in Derna were washed out to sea.

Well, getting in touch with people onthe ground is almost impossible but our team have been able to get in contact with one high-ranking official and later this hour, I'll speak to her about what she's hearing and seeing. North Korea's leader has vowed to start a new era of friendship with his neighbor Russia. Kim Jong-un's message came after his five-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at Vostochny Cosmodrome, a space base in Russia's Far East. The two discussed military matters and Kim appeared to endorse Russia's war on Ukraine, adding that he is certain Moscow will quote, \"punish evil forces\", a veiled reference to the West. For years, Putin hinted that military cooperation with the North could happen soon. Before the summit even got underway, the U.S had warned of a potential arms deal between the two pariah nations. One U.S. official says it shows Putin's desperation. We want to bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks who is following the developments for us from Seoul. Good to have you with us, Paula. So, Kim Jong-un referred to Putin's war in Ukraine as a sacred fight. Just what sort of arms deal might be in the works and what else are you learning about the readout from this five-hour meeting?",

What we sawhere today was really two isolated leaders in the world who were heading up to heavily sanctioned states that were pledging allegiance to each other, a much closer alliance than we have seen in the past. And of course, the fears are that an arms deal has been done or is being done behind closed doors. Of course, we don't have details of that but we knew that it was going to have a military focus. These talks, just by the very fact of where they were held. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice-over): Kim Jong-un is given the red carpet tour of Russia's successful space program. According to one reporter present, he asked, quote, a lot of very detailed questions. KIM JONG-UN, NORTH KOREAN LEADER (through translator): Is it eight meters in total? HANCOCKS (voice-over): Russian President Vladimir Putin says he's happy to share the knowledge that Kim craves, a sharing of information Washington has been warning of. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The North Korean leader has shown great interest in rocket technology. They are also trying to develop space. We have good competencies. We will show them our new facility, the new Cosmodrome. HANCOCKS (voice-over): North Korea's last two attempts to put a spy satellite into space have failed. Putin showed Kim his presidential limousine, manufactured by Russian luxury automaker Aurus. Reminiscent of former U.S. President Donald Trump showing off \"The Beast\" to Kim during friendlier times in Singapore. Kim praised Putin for standing up against hegemonic forces, a thinly veiled swipe at the United States in the West, even appearing to toast Russia's war in Ukraine. KIM (through translator): I firmly believe that the Russian military and people will inherit the shining tradition of victory and demonstrate their dignity and honor on the front line of military operation. HANCOCKS (voice-over): U.S. and South Korean intelligence predict an arms deal, including North Korea providing Russia with much-needed ammunition to use in Ukraine. The symmetry in their weaponry means certain ammo could be used immediately by Russia. Another possibility, the very public meeting could be sending a message.",

So, what we're hearing from experts is that it was probably to show that even if Kim Jong-un is not in the country, the country is still able to defend itself. It's still able to launch these missiles, the delegation of command and control, if you like. So, certainly, what we saw in the past was Kim Jong-un was very much front and center when it came to these launches, certainly in maybe five, six years ago. But now this is more routine to be able to carry out these launches, and the leader does not need to be there for each one.",

A two-week manhunt that has left local residents huddled in their homes in fear is finally over in Pennsylvania. Escaped prisoner Danelo Cavalcante just a few hours ago -- there you can see those pictures coming into us, they were from CBS Philadelphia, an aerial reconnaissance plane spotted his heat signature and he was later found hiding in some thick underbrush. Cavalcante had a gun with him but no shots were fired. He was trying to get away when police dogs subdued him. He had been spotted numerous times over the past couple of weeks and some 500 law enforcement officers were involved in that manhunt.

He crab walked up and got out in May, and they captured him within about five minutes. Since that time, they had put in some razor wire at the top of that area where he crab-walked up, and then some other razor wire elsewhere on that the roof. That's not enough to contain Danelo Cavalcante when Cavalcante got out using the same method with the crab walk on August 31st. He was able to get through the razor wire, get across the roof, hop another fence on top of the roof, get through more razor wire and then get off the roof somehow. That was not, by the way, a short drop off that roof, but he got off the roof. He had an hour's head start because the guard who was supposed to be watching him was not, and the guard did not report him missing, They didn't know he was missing until they did a head count about an hour later.

Now, I'm in Philadelphia and we had tremendous thunderstorms last night. So, that shut down the aerial support. So, they had to just keep that area contained the best they could.

I think the reason it's happening now is because the Republican Party has become an arm of ex-President Donald Trump's re-election campaign for a second non-consecutive term and also his political movement. It's happening because the former president wants it to happen and also because House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is effectively a very weak speaker with a small majority who cannot stand up to the more extreme members of his coalition in the House and is therefore led by them. And it may depend on him keeping his job that he goes forward with impeachment. That's not to say there aren't questions to be answered about why Hunter Biden, the president's son, was, you know, active in business ventures in places like Ukraine and China when his father was vice president and dealing with foreign policy on those issues. But no expert that's looked at this from a legal perspective believes that the Republicans have showed evidence that Joe Biden profited personally from those ventures, and also that any of these questions yet reach the standard of impeachment, the most grave moment in the American political system which is essentially an attempt to unseat a President and overturn a democratic vote several years earlier.",

Our amazing community ofdevelopers have made the dynamic island even more useful by expanding what it can do. Now, you can track a pizza delivery and follow the big game at the same time. The announcement comes as Apple prepares for the annual sprint to the holidays and consumers get more particular about upgrading their smartphones. CNET's Bridget Carey says she's covered 13 iPhone launch event since joining the outlet. She says smaller smartphone upgrades, things not as visible to the eye as a new color or bold display, have become a tougher sell. BRIDGET CAREY, CNET SR. DIRECTOR: As I'm talking to people all the time, it is, well, I can still keep my phone. It's four years old. I could just replace the battery instead of buying a whole new one.",

France'snational frequency agency says the phone emits levels of radiation that are too high and it's not compliant with E.U. regulations. They add Apple must fix phones already in use or issue a recall. Apple disagrees with the order and says its iPhone 12 meets radiation rules. Well, for more on this I want to bring in CNN Business Writer Clare Duffy who joins us from New York. Good to have you with us, Clare. So, take us through the radiation levels that France are reporting and is the iPhone 12 the only phone they have issue with?",

The agency test for a measure called Specific Absorption Rate, which is essentially how much radiofrequency energy the body absorbs from a specific device. So, the agency said that it measured 5.74 watts per kilogram, that's the measure for this measurement, in exposure from the iPhone 12 versus the limit of four watts per kilogram. The agency, as you said, has ordered the immediate removal of iPhone 12s from shelves in France, and it's also calling on Apple to update any iPhone 12s that are currently in use by consumers in France, Lynda.",

The company said that it has already given the agency multiple lab resultsconducted by the company and independent third parties that show the device is compliant with France's regulations as well as global standards. The company also says that it's working with the agency to demonstrate the iPhone 12's compliance. And Lynda, I think it's also worth noting that the World Health Organization has also said that no adverse health effects have been linked to exposure to wireless technology. So, we'll see where this back and forth between the agency and Apple ends up, but I think it's not something that consumers need to be immediately alarmed about at this point.",
