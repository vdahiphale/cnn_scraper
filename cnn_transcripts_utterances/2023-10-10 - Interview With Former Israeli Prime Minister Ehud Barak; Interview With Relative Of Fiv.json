And I will get the latest U.S. military maneuvers from the national security spokesman, John Kirby. Then, I speak to an American Israeli who says five family members have been kidnapped by Hamas, most of them children or elderly. Also, ahead, the former Israeli prime minister and army general, Ehud Barak, on what a war will look like. And later in the program, the latest from inside Gaza with a doctor working in the city under siege. Plus, social media is letting the world see these atrocities in real-time. Hari Sreenivasan discusses the impact with Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Shock, trauma, and the agony of uncertainty as Israel unleashes revenge on Hamas, the fate of more than 100 hostages snatched on Saturday is still as unclear as ever. In Tel Aviv today, American families of missing loved ones spoke to reporters about their living nightmare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is -- if it's -- the pilots who is planning to bring down this building have some mercy on those people. But the many occasions, especially yesterday and the day before and today, so many buildings were brought down to the ground without any prior warning, and that blows up the number of Palestinian deaths from 400 yesterday to 870 today, including seven journalists. Three of them were trying to video a building which was hosting international news agencies and they thread in that building. They've given them 20 minutes to evacuate. Imagine to evacuate a 12-story building in 20 minutes. This is unbelievable. And while trying to film this building from far away harm this building from far away, the F-16 targeted those journalists, killing three of them today. This will add up to the other five who were killed in the other two days. And this will add up to the eight paramedics and one doctor who were killed in the previous three days.",

The drip, drip ofdisinformation that recolors the lens through which someone sees the world, makes them see the world in a different way and it gives them the precursors to hate. You see, lies and hate have always been deeply interconnected. They actually reflexively -- so, lies underpin hate, they create the conditions for hate, then they lead to the operationalization hate, they lead to -- they give people the motivation that act in a hateful way as well. The creation of fake emergencies of, you know, threats to life and say, well, we must do something about these people that I've been telling you about for a long time. So, the truth is that -- and no one knows that better than Jewish people, believe me, whether it be the (INAUDIBLE) 2,000 years ago or it be the protocols of the Elders of Zion that informed Adolf Hitler's ideology. Lies have always been a critical part of hate. Now, we've worked with platforms over the years urging them to adopt the most strict standards possible of not amplifying or monetizing the lies that underpin hate, the incredibly familiar conspiracy theories because we know they lead directly to people doing terrible things. And, you know, let's take the Great Replacement theory, which is the theory that most -- that Jews are trying to bring in Muslims and black people to destroy the white race through migration. That led to the slaughter of Jews in Pittsburgh, the Tree of Life synagogue, it led directly to the slaughter of Muslims in Christchurch, that very conspiracy theory, and it led to the murder of my colleague, Jo Cox, MP, a 35-year-old mother of two, in the British E.U. referendum, which started me on my journey in this work seven years ago.",

He lets thousands of them back onto the platform who previously been suspended. He said, this is a free speech zone. And in doing so, he gave them license to be as racist as possible, saying, we are not really going to enforce our rules anymore. And as a result, there was an increase in hate. And we quantified it. Now, I think that that was basically us putting up a mirror to these platforms saying, do you like the reflection you see in it? And whereas, you know, most people, you or I, if we don't like to reflect in the mirror, we comb our hair or go on a diet, you know, he sued the mirror. He said, this mirror, how dare you show my image to be ugly because I must be perfect, for I am Elon Musk. And I think that's the problem.

And, you know, five or six years later, they've delivered us something which is really interesting. It basically says there are four components to safety online, to a healthier and more productive and more prosperous existence online, transparency. And without transparency, you can't have meaningful accountability to a democratic body. Now, Lindsey Graham and Elizabeth Warren actually have a bill, a joint bipartisan bill for a new accountability regulator in the U.S. The U.K. and the E.U. have one now. But you need the transparency, otherwise, they are not looking at the correct data. And then, if they are harms and the platforms that clearly negligent in not doing anything about it, they should be held partly responsible. Because then you create an economic disincentive for them doing the wrong thing. Now, across all three of those components, transparency, accountability and responsibility, if you get them in place, then you actually don't need them anymore because you create a culture of safety by design. And that's what every other industry has. Every other industry has to think about safety before they release products. It's uniquely social media companies that believe they're free a bit. And that star framework, safety by design, transparency, accountability, responsibility is what governments around the world are implementing, and we'd like to see it in the U.S. too. I think we are some years away from it. But I'm going to spend the next few years showing its work overseas. It hasn't restricted freedom of speech.
