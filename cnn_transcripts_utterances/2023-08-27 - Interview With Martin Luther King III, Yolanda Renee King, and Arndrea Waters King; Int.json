I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is waking up to tragedy again.Authorities say three Black Americans and the white shooter are dead after a racially motivated attack in Jacksonville, Florida. The FBI is investigating it as a hate crime, and the sheriff there said the shooter hated Black people and wanted to kill Black people. The horrific incident caps off a historic and sad week in the United States. Donald Trump is now the first president in American history to have a mug shot and an inmate number to go along with it. Trump and his 18 co-defendants have all surrendered at the Fulton County Jail. And, tomorrow, the legal fights over who goes to trial, where they go to trial, and when they go to trial get under way. While the former president was finalizing his plans to turn himself over in Georgia, the Republicans hoping to replace him as the leader of their party battled it out on their first debate in the election cycle. And a lot of the not-so-friendly-fire was sent in the direction of my first guest, a Washington outsider who has been very much rising in the polls. Joining me now is 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Thank you so much for joining me this morning, sir.",

I think just a shame that we even have mass shootings like this, be it the one that happened in Florida, be it the recent one, the Nashville shooter in a Christian school, killing six in a school.

In other words, you can't be pro- labor and pro-worker unless you have the guts to take on these large, profitable corporations who are exercising an unprecedented level of corporate greed. The American people have got to know the reason that inflation was high last year was not because primarily of the war in Ukraine or a breakdown in supply chains.

Those stressors have been there, but they are being exacerbated. When people talk about the working class, who are you talking about? Is it all working-class people, or is it just a certain group of working-class people? That is important.",

Joining me now, Martin Luther King III, Yolanda Renee King, and Arndrea Waters King. Thank you so much for joining me, all of you. It's really an honor to see you all. I want to start, unfortunately, with the tragic news that we saw out of Jacksonville yesterday.

And it's so tragic. We have got to, as a society, find a way to navigate through issues. You don't have to like me, but we have to understand how to deal civilly with issues. And we have got to do something to change that. And we have not -- not tomorrow. We have got to do something now. I know there's hate crimes legislation. But it's unconscionable. It's unacceptable.
