The Israeli military's top general, General Herzi Halevi on Sunday conducting a situational assessment to approve plans for the continuation of the war in Gaza. Reading between the lines, what he appears to be talking about is a common ground offensive in Rafah and that was also the subject of this Israeli war cabinet meeting on Sunday evening. Israeli officials last week told me that they had delayed plans to begin evacuating Rafah a key step towards a ground offensive as Israeli leaders debated a response to that Iranian attack last weekend on Israel. But with that military response now out of the way, Israel's workout and it appears to be turning its focus back on that common ground defensive in Rafah and we know that this will have potentially deadly implications for Palestinians. More than a million Palestinians, many of them displaced from their homes elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, currently living in that southernmost city in Gaza. And there are still major questions about exactly where they will be evacuated to how that will all work. The Israeli government has provided assurances to the United States that people will be provided with food and shelter when they are evacuated, that these evacuations will indeed happen before military operations really begin in earnest in Rafah. But now the question is, how soon could that potentially happen? We know that this is likely the next step, but it's unclear exactly how long that evacuation will take. And then when we will see Israeli troops actually move in to Rafah. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is of course, the very first time in American history that a former president is standing trial for alleged crimes.This is all about a cover up in 2016, Donald Trump paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels the adult film star to prevent her from going public with allegations of an affair. He denies the affair. The alleged crime, the prosecutors theory of this case is all about the falsification of business records at the Trump Organization. How Trump org paid back, Michael Cohen, Trump's attorney at the time, paid him back for that hush money payment. According to the prosecutors, the Trump Organization and Donald Trump at the head, falsified business records, falsely suggesting that those were routine legal retainers and legal services when really, it was a hush money payment intended to prevent the voters from learning about Stormy Daniels allegations. It's a novel legal theory that will be tested and under the microscope for perhaps the next six weeks. That's how long we're expecting things to go. So opening statements are Monday, and eventually we will get into witness testimony and there is a big cast of characters that are expected to swear to tell the truth in front of the jury. Michael Cohen himself in many ways is the star witness of this case, his credibility will be crucial. There's also Stormy Daniels she is expected to tell her side of the story. There's also Hope Hicks, a Trump 2016 campaign official, Karen McDougal, who is a another woman who alleged an affair with Donald Trump. And then there's also David Pecker, he was involved with the National Enquirer, the tabloid that is central to this alleged scheme. According to the indictment, Pecker and Cohen and Trump met shortly after Trump announced his campaign in 2015. And they all agreed according to the prosecutors that they would, quote unquote, catch and kill negative stories about Trump, basically paying people off buying their silence, agreeing to purchase the rights to their story and burying it so that the voters would never learn of those allegations. And the voters did -- did not actually learn about the alleged Stormy Daniels affair until after the election after Trump had made his way to the White House. So that's what we're expecting from opening statements. The prosecutors will be telling the jury their side of the story for the very first time and of course, Trump's defense attorneys have their own opportunity as well. It all starts New York City Monday morning. Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That prospect unnerving many officials and politicians, not just in Washington, but in many Asian capitals as well at a time when tensions are running high on the high seas of Asia-Pacific between China and the United States and some of its key allies with the Pentagon repeatedly accusing the Chinese military of conducting unsafe, unprofessional maneuver hoovers targeting the U.S. and its allies when they conduct so-called freedom of navigation operations in the region. In more recent weeks and months, we have seen increasing confrontations and clashes between Chinese and Filipino vessels in the south China sea over disputed territory where the Chinese, obviously, outnumbering and outgunning the Filipinos. And the Chinese, of course, have been pushing back all these allegations very strongly, pointing a finger at Washington saying it's the U.S. and using its allies to provoke troubles in the region trying to harm China's security and interest and containing its rise. But nonetheless, the U.S. has been strengthening its military alliances with key allies in the region, including Japan, but also increasingly the Philippines.

And also on Monday, the two sides launching weeks-long, joint military drills for the first time involving the northern most part of the Philippines, less than 100 miles away from Taiwan.

They're churning out more worships like this one, not just destroyers, but also submarines and even aircraft carriers. So it is in this context that what brought us here on the ship, all the more timely and some would say relevant. The Western Pacific Naval Symposium hosted by China this year but gathering up naval commanders and officers from more than two dozen countries, including the United States. Whether or not they're discussions or exchanges behind closed door's cutting to any meaningful dialogues that could have impact on strategic and policy directions remains a huge question mark about the increasingly contentious waters of East and South China Seas.

Again, you can see some of these numbers, 200 -- even 300 millimeters of rain in just a 48-hour time period. Again, not just the rain, but also those gusty winds you could even see some of the small hail there in the video, but the rain was really what caused the most of the problems, especially as it kind of flooded over some streets and roads throughout many cities there. And the strong winds, those bringing down some trees and even causing some power outages in a few locations. Here's a look at the forecast though as we head into Monday. Notice there is still even additional showers and thunderstorms expected across southern and eastern portions of China. It won't be quite as heavy as we saw before, most of these areas, maybe about 25 to 50 millimeters of additional rain at best. But even still on top of what they've already had, that could still exacerbate some of the already ongoing flooding. So we do still have rain in the forecast, at least the first half of the day for Shanghai on Monday with a high temperature in the upper teens, but a lot of that rain is going to spread eastward. So Osaka, looking at some rain showers in the latter half of the day, Monday. And then by Monday night, we start to see more of that rain pushing into Tokyo. But also rain chances in Tokyo for Tuesday and Wednesday as well. Farther down to the south, again, notice Taipei and even Hong Kong, both looking at showers and thunderstorms in the forecast with a high in the mid-twenties. And for Hong Kong specifically, notice rain chances don't really let up for much of the week looking at all of those days with a pretty similar forecast of showers and thunderstorms and those temperatures in the mid to upper 20s.
