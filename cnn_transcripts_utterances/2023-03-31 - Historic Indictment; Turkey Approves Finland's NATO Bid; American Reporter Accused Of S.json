For the first time ever, a former US president is facing criminal charges as Donald Trump is indicted by a New York grand jury. How it could impact the 2024 race for the White House. An American reporter is arrested and accused of spying in Russia, what Moscow claims he was doing and how the US is responding. And Pope Francis is said to be responding well to treatment for a respiratory infection when the Vatican says he could be released from the hospital. Sources tell CNN Donald Trump will appear in a New York courtroom on Tuesday after a grand jury voted to indict the former president. It is the first time in history that a current or former US president has faced criminal charges. Sources telling CNN the indictment includes more than 30 counts related to business fraud. The grand jury has been hearing evidence about hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Payments Trump denied knowing about. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office says it has contacted Trump's legal team to coordinate his surrender. Trump calls the indictment a witch hunt that will backfire massively on President Joe Biden. He posted on True Social, \"This is an attack on our country, the likes of which has never been seen before. It is likewise a continuing attack on our once free and fair elections. The USA is now a third world nation,\" he went on, \"a nation in serious decline. So sad.\" Another person who disagrees with the indictment is Donald Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence. He spoke exclusively with CNN's Wolf Blitzer just a few hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One also around January 6 conducted by a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, and also an investigation into Donald Trump's actions after he left the presidency. Very recent actions related to classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago. And the fact that they weren't handed over back to the federal government after he left office as they needed to be. We've seen a lot of activity in all of these investigations in recent weeks and months. We know that there are charges being considered out of Georgia, and we know there are two grand juries, at least in DC, that are very active looking at the potential federal criminal charges he could face. And so, Donald Trump has a lot of things potentially coming down the pike for him that he is managing legally not only these charges in New York, but he's also trying to fend off potential criminal indictments in other jurisdictions.",

Thanks for being with us.It's important to say, we don't even know what these charges entail, the detail of the indictment. This wouldn't happen, would it, without evidence good enough to convince a grand jury? What's your read? AREVA MARTIN, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: You're right, Michael. The indictment is under seal. We may not know what the indictment actually contains until Donald Trump appears in that New York courthouse on Tuesday, which is what we're being told is the day that he's actually going to show up for an arraignment. But we do know that this district attorney in Manhattan has been investigating these hush money payments that were made to Stormy Daniels just days or weeks before the 2016 presidential election. So, in all likelihood, this indictment is related to those payments. And it's not just $130,000 that was paid to Michael Cohen -- according to the indictment against Michael Cohen. He was paid over $400,000 from the Trump Organization. $130,000 of it was the money reimbursing him for what he paid to Stormy Daniels. It was also money for the taxes that he owed on that $130,000. And he received some kind of bonus from the Trump Organization for making that transaction, that deal with Stormy Daniels. So it's important to note that the amount at stake in terms of what may be a part of this indictment is more than $130,000.",

I'd also argue that in the past several days or a week or so they actually thought that the Manhattan DAs case could be falling apart.We know that Donald Trump tweeted about a week and a half ago that he thought an indictment was coming, the Tuesday before last. Clearly that date came and went and there was no indictment. And so there was increasingly this thought that maybe is this actually happening. We saw Donald Trump himself put out on truth social less than 48 hours ago, saying that he has great respect for the Manhattan grand jury and thought that they were no longer going to be a rubber stamp and thought that maybe the tide was changing for him. But clearly, that was not the case. And I'll also just argue on the mood, I think within Mar-a-Lago and within Trump's team tonight, yes, they're all scrambling after this indictment. And I think we're seeing Donald Trump himself and his statement, try to project confidence and say that he's going to come out on top at the end of this. But really, as much as they think this could politically benefit him in the long run, I do think that his advisors, as well as Trump himself, are worried about an indictment.
