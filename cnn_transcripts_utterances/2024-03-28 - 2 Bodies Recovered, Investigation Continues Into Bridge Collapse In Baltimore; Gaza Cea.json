Bad weather and the mangled wreckage of the bridge have also made conditions too dangerous for divers to continue their search. But investigations into how this happened continue. Authorities have interviewed the ship's crew now have the voyage data recorder. The Dali was carrying 56 containers of hazardous material. Some were breached in the collision, while others fell into the harbor. As for the 46-year old bridge, officials say an inspection last May found no problems.

Well, that's easy to say with hindsight. Obviously, if they had probably two track to tugs on either end and a set of lead aft track to tug, that probably would have helped them quite a bit. And they could have missed the bridge. So these are something we're going to have to look at, new procedures to be put into place for vessels being guided, like we do with tankers using escort tugs when they're going through a critical, well, a critical point in the harbor.

The proposals between the parties continue to go back and forth.We hear this after the disappointment of Tuesday morning when Israeli, the Israeli delegation had left Qatar over Hamas rejection of the latest version of the deal, a proposal put forward by the United States so called bridging deal that sought to bring the parties together and that had seemed to make such progress on the key question, for instance, of the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be released for Israeli homes hostages. The other sticking points, far more problematic, things like the return to the north of Gazans who've been forced to flee to the south, the positioning of Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip and the question of Hamas insistence that the end of the war be discussed as part of the deal. All of these maximalist demands on the part of Hamas had appeared to kill the deal. But officials pointing out that part of the problem is that the delegation on Hamas part is having to wait for the answers to come back from Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip each time. Yahya Sinwar, from deep inside the tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip itself. Still far from being dead, it seems that the talks have been paused, not a stalemate, we're told, more of a pause with hope they might come back. We've been hearing also from the State Department spokesman explaining that it is because it is the hardest sticking points that are now being discussed, that things are going more slowly, but there is hope that progress might be made with those proposals going back and forth.

It's where Hamas still has a series of tunnels along the border between Gaza and Egypt, which is its oxygen pipeline. It's where it can use those tunnels to smuggle in some of those more sophisticated Iranian weapons that we've seen them use during the last almost six months of this war. And the idea is that if Israel can go in there and break the back of those battalions, take out those key tunnels. It won't have won the war in the sense that Hamas is eliminated, but it will have won the war in the sense of transitioning and moving Hamas from being this terrorist army to maybe lower level, counter terror insurgency style operations that then Israel will have to carry out over a period of time, but at a much lower level of intensity.",

A panel of judges Wednesday reversed a previous decision disqualifying Trump from Illinois primary ballot under the insurrectionist ban of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. It comes weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled states cannot enforce that ban on federal candidates. Trump easily won last week's Illinois primary anyway after his rivals dropped out.Some of the lawyers who assisted Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election are now dealing with the consequences.

Eastman can appeal the ruling in the California Supreme Court will review the case.
