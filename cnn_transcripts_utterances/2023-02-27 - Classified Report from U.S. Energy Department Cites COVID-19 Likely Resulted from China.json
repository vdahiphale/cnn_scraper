We begin with a laboratory leak in China likely caused the COVID-19 pandemic. That's according to a newly updated classified intelligence  report from the U.S. Energy Department.According to two sources, energy officials have low confidence in their latest assessment. That means the information is either not reliable enough or it's too fragmented to know for sure. It only adds to this big divide within the U.S. government over whether the pandemic began in China in 2019 as a result of a lab leak or whether it emerged naturally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's exactly what they just did with the foreign ministry official, saying it was, quote, unquote, \"highly unlikely\" the virus was leaked from the Wuhan lab.Based on the findings of a joint study by the W.H.O. and their own experts backing early 2021, calling those findings scientific and authoritative while urging the U.S. to stop smearing China and stop politicizing this issue. But the irony here, of course, is that China has never stopped politicizing this issue themselves with their officials and state media, time and again, insinuating the virus was leaked from a U.S. military environmental(ph) lab without any evidence. Not to mention that joint study they just cited was conducted in a very restrictive and highly choreographed environment and with its results also being doubted and questioned by many independent experts around the world. But one thing this latest assessment from the Department of Energy does reflect is the lab-leak theory has been gaining traction, especially with the emergence of some new information such as some researchers at the Wuhan lab fell mysteriously ill back in November of 2019. But the problem here, Christine, is with China unlikely to opening their labs to outside investigators any time soon, if ever, we just may never find a definitive answer on the origin of the pandemic. But the war of words between Washington and Beijing unlikely to stop any time soon.",

They say that they've been sort of given to the DPR commanders, these are the Russian-backed proxies that have been fighting in that region since 2014.And perhaps most disturbingly, Christine, they go on to say that these DPR commanders are firing with machine guns and infantry fighting vehicles at mobilized soldiers, at their own soldiers if they refuse to go into battle. Now, this obviously is shocking and we can't independently verify it, but it does tie it with previous reports that we've heard from the battlefield about sort of chaotic command control structures. The sources in the video also say that their commanders are far away from the battlefield and don't realize the level of casualties there. And also there's sort of brutal tactics that we've heard from the front emerging, and the unpreparedness of the Russian forces. Again, we haven't been able to verify this independently, but  it does back up the sense that we're getting from both reports on the ground and Intelligence assessments.",

So, certainly, those processes are under way. But this has drawn criticism from some, arguing that this is simply too hasty. We've already heard from the Turkish Union of Engineers and Architects they say, that there needs to be further geological investigation as well as further investigation into preparations needed for such a scale of construction, given the risks in this area for further earthquakes. We've seen thousands and thousands of aftershocks already since that earthquake on February 6th, the most powerful one last Monday, 6.3 magnitude. So there are concerns about the foundations of these buildings and whether or not they will be safe. And then, of course, there's mounting pressure on where those who have been displaced are currently being held. And we visited some of those camps that have popped up across Antakya and Iskenderun in the Hatay Province, which was among the hardest-hit areas by the earthquake. And there are thousands and thousands of people living in these tents. But there are also some who are still living on the street waiting to be given a tent. Now, the government has conceded that more work needs to be done. They're still almost trying to catch up really with the sheer scale of the demand. And many of the families that we spoke to in one of these camps told us that they've been on the street since the day the earthquake struck, many of them sleeping out in the cold.
