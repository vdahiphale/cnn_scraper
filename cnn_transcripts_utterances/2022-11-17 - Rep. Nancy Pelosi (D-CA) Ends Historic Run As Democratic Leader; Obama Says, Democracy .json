There's still a desire for generational change but it was notable to me that Pelosi really was able to -- you know, you saw Seth Moulton at the end of Manu Raju's piece a little earlier.

I'm not talking about racial diversity but diversity in terms of leadership style, in terms of policy provisions that they champion.So, I think that it is going to be sort of difficult for Democrats to come together. Also, I think that it is worth noting some of the most high profile, vocal, progressive members of Congress, the ones that challenge Speaker Pelosi the most, they have never been in Congress with Republicans in power. So, that is going to be an interesting dynamic to watch as well.

That is a total misreading of what happened in the midterm elections.The voters soundly rejected the kind of chaos politics that some of candidates who lost were peddling. And I think that senators like Romney and some of the more moderate House members are going to be very uncomfortable with a strategy that does not entail a forward- looking agenda. Some of this stuff is cultivated in this online Fox News world.

Listen to what he said just moments ago over at the Obama Foundation's first ever democracy forum in New York City.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Democratic ideas are currently under assault around the world. We see a manifestation of it in the unjustified and brutal war in Ukraine. We see it in the backsliding that's taking place in what were well established democracies. We see it in the escalating polarization and disinformation that's so evident in recent elections, whether it's in Brazil, the Philippines, Italy, Sweden, right here in the United States. And let me be clear here, the threat to democracy doesn't always run along a conservative, liberal, left-right axis. This has nothing to do with traditional partisan lines or policy preferences. What we're seeing, what's being challenged, are the foundational principles of democracy itself, the notion that all citizens have a right to freely participate in selecting who governs them, the notion that votes will be counted and the part that gets more votes wins, that losers concede, that power is transferred peacefully, that the winners don't abuse the machinery of government to punish losers and entrench themselves and make it impossible for other parties to compete in future elections, the notion that judiciary should be independent, that nobody is above the law and that our political debate should at least aspire to be rooted in facts and logic rather than fabrication and propaganda.

Voters took a pretty sophisticated view of candidates up and down the ballot, across the country, and said we are not, by and large, going to vote for people who they thought were essentially threats to democracy, election deniers, people running to be secretary of state to manage our elections, who didn't believe in the basic principle that votes should count and that you can't use the levers of government to stop the votes of people that you don't agree with from counting. I think that that actually was a kind of reassuring thing for the country just to say, first of all, voters are more sophisticated than a lot of people give them credit for.

And we have neighborhoods that have been declared the most overcrowded in the nation.And so the bottom line in L.A. is that we need to make room for more Angelinos. It's terrible the idea that people are dying in our streets and that people have encampments, which are groups of homeless people who have set up tents anywhere and everywhere. It's just not acceptable. It shouldn't happen. But we have a lot of bureaucratic red tape that needs to be eliminated.
