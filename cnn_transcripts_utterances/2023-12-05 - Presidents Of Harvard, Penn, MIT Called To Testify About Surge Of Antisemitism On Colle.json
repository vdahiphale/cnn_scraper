So, sir, for years, when students have made complaints or shared concerns about antisemitism that they have either witnessed or been victim of, they have been told, there's nothing administrators can do, because it's political speech, which is free speech. And rhetoric has been accepted for the most part, or ignored, or both. Why? LARRY SUMMERS, FMR. HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: Look, there's been a problem on college campuses generally. And it's been a problem at Harvard, as well, that there's just been a double standard in the way university leaders have responded to racism, to other forms of prejudice, and the way they've responded to what is pretty clearly antisemitism, or at least has antisemitism as its effect. And I don't know why that why those mistakes have been made. But they have been serious and there's something that Israeli students have been aware of, for quite some time. If there's any silver lining and the tragic events that have taken place recently, it's that it's brought antisemitism to the fore as a major issue. And I think it is being taken more seriously. But the problem is not to condemn antisemitism. The problem is to maintain a broadly tolerant and open community. And that means you have to make sure that students don't enter classrooms with megaphones and disrupt classes. That means you have to respond firmly, strongly and clearly when people occupy buildings. That means you have to set the tone for the discourse by condemning sloganeering where the intent and the effect is very clear --",

I saw that myself when years ago as president, I condemned the Boycott, Divest, Sanction, Israel movement, and saw how much controversy that statement generated.
