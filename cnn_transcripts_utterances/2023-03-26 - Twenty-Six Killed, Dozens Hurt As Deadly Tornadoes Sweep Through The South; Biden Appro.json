President Biden, we first heard from him on earlier in Saturday, where he issued a statement saying that he was praying for those who lost loved ones and whose loved ones are still missing. And he said that he also talked to a sizable portion of statewide officials there, including Governor Reeves, Senators Wicker, Hyde-Smith, and Congressman Bennie Thompson.The White House said the president asked them, what more can I do for you? What more can I do for the people of Mississippi? As well as pledging more federal assistance. Now, the president also spoke with FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell, who is expected to visit the survey site later today alongside DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Now, we know that in those calls the president, he really laid out exactly what he was preparing to do. And we saw that with that emergency declaration really going to four of those hardest hit counties doing things like providing temporary housing, money for temporary housing, money for housing repairs, also offering low cost loans to those who have uninsured property damage. Now, of course the White House said that this -- this really is ongoing as they're reviewing whether or not more counties will be added to this federal declaration later on to really free up more money for Mississippi and other affected states. Of course, the question here going on today is when or whether or not President Biden or more of his cabinet will visit that severe tragedy site in Mississippi.",

Residents told us it felt like an earthquake happens nearby. Now, again this area is the R.M. Palmer chocolate factory. It's a chocolate company that is well known in this area, well regarded. It employs more than 800 people. But again, that explosion was quite intense. This turned into a multi agency operation. The governor was even here on Saturday morning. He deployed state resources like structural engineers and search and rescue specialists to get out on the scene. And the challenge was here that there was some hope mixed in with all of the sadness. Overnight, on Friday night, one survivor was actually pulled from the rubble, and that's why search and rescue crews were working so hard all day on Saturday.

The prosecution is rigged. The facts are not there and that he should be left alone. Now, that doesn't square with the facts at all. And as he himself has put forward on social media the facts are damning enough that he's got every reason to think that the legal trouble is going to result in criminal indictment. That's how bad it is. But it's not enough to stand on the sidelines. He is demanding loyalty not only from the base but again from his opponents. And they're -- and they're playing along, which is probably not great strategy and saying that they think there's a problem here, and that Trump should not have been investigated or prosecuted.

That's how you do it.If you make it about Trump, you lose. That is the lesson of the 2016 Republican primary. That has been the lesson ever since that's -- probably if you think about it, the key to why the party did so poorly in last year's midterm elections. Trump candidates, Trump backed candidates lost in Arizona and Pennsylvania and Georgia. Trump himself lost Arizona and Pennsylvania and Georgia and with it the presidency in 2020. If you want to lose those three states and the presidency one more time, that's how you do it.

But I mean, to be clear, Russia can use its tactical nuclear weapons right now. It doesn't have to locate them to Belarus before they become viable for usage. So, in that sense, it's not a step closer necessarily to their use .And that's been reflected by the reaction we've seen from the United States, for instance, the State Department's National Security Council, basically saying that they don't see any moves underway that means that Russia is moving closely to the use of a nuclear weapon. And they're not changing their sort of nuclear preparedness status as a result of this announcement from Vladimir Putin. In terms of the Ukrainians, what they say is that more than anything else, more than threatening them, this potentially destabilizes Belarus because there's going to be a lot of people inside Belarus that don't want to move even closer to the Kremlin that they already are.",

Always great to see you, Janet. Good morning to you. All right, so the City Killer didn't kill anybody. So, we're in good hands. Tell us why this event was -- is so rare and then asteroid of this size is actually the unusual part, right? JANET IVEY, CEO, JANET'S PLANET: It is. And as you said, it usually happens once every decade. And this happened -- you know, it passed easily between the earth and the moon. It was about 100,000 miles from us. And it gave us a great opportunity to take a finer look at these objects. But the good news is asteroid near don't fear because it's like last fall, NASA successfully crash landed a spacecraft into an asteroid moving and changing its orbit by about, you know, 20 minutes or so. So, they feel confident that if anything were really ready to strike a city here on Earth, we could, you know, launch a spacecraft and kind of knock it out of the way. So, again, it gives astronomers great opportunities to take a look, see what these things are made of, and quite a spectacle if you were watching the live cast of it last night.",
