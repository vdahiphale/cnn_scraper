Trump denies the affair. Meanwhile, during cross-examination, Trump's attorneys tried to undercut Daniels' testimony by attacking her motivations, credibility, and demonstrating how much she hates Trump. Daniels testified she met Trump while working at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006. That's when Trump invited her to dinner. Later, in Trump's penthouse suite, she said they talked for two hours and Trump asked thoughtful business questions. She explained she went to the bathroom and, when I exited, he was just up on the bed like this. In boxers and a T-shirt, she said while demonstrating his pose for the jury. She noted, it was not in a threatening manner. Daniels said, the next thing I know, I was on the bed. She described their relationship in a 2018 interview with Anderson Cooper for 60 minutes.",

I do want to go first to this documents case. Does any of this sound legitimate to you in terms of what Judge Cannon is saying? What she's saying is twofold, one is she scheduled a couple of hearings. One is to try and parse through a lot of these documents, and a lot of them have to do with what can be displayed in court, divulged and disclosed in court, because a lot of this has to do with national security in the United States. And the other, that she actually scheduled a hearing to listen to arguments on what was considered a long shot legally that the Trump team was going to ask for records from the Biden administration.",

      "sentences": "Well -- and it's good to be with you, Paula. I think that there are two ways to read thesituation with Judge Aileen Cannon, who is the judge overseeing the classified documents case. If you want to read things in the light most charitable to Judge Cannon, you would emphasize that there is a procedure, there is a law in the United States called the Classified Information Procedures Act, and that law details the ways in which when a -- when classified information is to be presented at a trial, the ways in which it needs to be handled, the care that needs to be taken to determine what the jury can see, what can become public and what can obviously not become public. In fact, the very nature of the case is that these are the kinds of things that we don't want to become public. So, it's not as though these are not serious questions that she's wrestling with. On the other hand, at every single turn, since these classified documents case began and was assigned to Judge Cannon, she has ruled in ways that have treated arguments that the defense team, Donald Trump's team has made that most judges would find to be farfetched, and as you said, a complete long shot. And at every single turn, the result, the byproduct of those rulings has been delays, delays, delays. So, now, we're at a stage where, as the report just mentioned, it is highly, highly unlikely that these classified documents case could even conceivably take place before the election. We're essentially now one delay, even one minor delay, from a situation in which the voters will not be able to take into account whether Mr. Trump mishandled and then obstructed justice with regard to the inquiry into the mishandling of those documents.",

You're right to set -- to note that, in a sense, let's remember, thiscase is ultimately -- the charges in the case are about the falsification of documents relate -- and business records related to the cover up of the underlying allegation of an affair. But what was -- and so, Stormy Daniels doesn't have a whole lot of information to offer in that regard. But what she did offer today that was helpful for the prosecution was a stunning level of detail. An exactitude of memory, if you will, right down to the patterns on the floor tiles or the gold nail clippers in Mr. Trump's bathroom at his hotel room in Lake Tahoe. Mr. Trump has denied categorically that he ever had any interactions with her beyond the one golf outing related photo that they took, and she did a thorough job and the prosecutors, attorneys did a thorough job of detailing all the ways in which that's just categorically not credible. His denial, they're not credible. She had all sorts of very private phone numbers, including for his personal assistant who had verified earlier, Rhona Graff that she, Stormy Daniels, had been at Trump Tower subsequent to that golf tournament. She talked about meeting him in Los Angeles. She talked about taking phone calls from Mr. Trump on a regular basis, in which she would then put the phone on speaker phone. And so, there are additional witnesses to those calls, i.e., if Mr. Trump were to take the stand, as he has threatened to do, and I think it's almost inconceivable that he will. But if he were to take the stand Stormy Daniels had not testified, then you'd be face -- the jury would be hearing his denials that all of this ever happened. And they would not have heard, as an initial matter, Stormy Daniels' version. And I think that aspect, despite the lurid details and the salaciousness, and frankly, some aspects of her testimony that clearly irritated Judge Merchan and that were favorable for the defense, the net result of today was favorable for the prosecution for sure.",

Now, the yen has dramatically devalued over the last few months and that is both a plus and a minus as you're well aware for the Japanese economy. Take this knife that I bought yesterday. Look at this. It's Sakai, which is the famous knife place just up the road. Sakai sells knives. And when you look at this particular knife -- by the way, that's not blood that happens to be jam, strawberry jam. When you look at this knife, you realize that the cost of this splendid knife has actually reduced dramatically over the last six months. This knife would have cost about $230 at the beginning of -- middle of last year. Now, this knife is costing just about $194. Now, if you extrapolate that across the totality of the economy, you start to see that this knife and the way the yen has moved is taking dramatic slices out of the way things are going. You're getting a nice, clean cut, Paula. But at the same time, it has an effect on the way the Japanese economy will perform. The knife is an example of what's actually happening in the economy. Here in Japan, there is growth. It's not that great. Unemployment's coming down. Interest rates will remain fairly low for the foreseeable future.

There have been upgrades to the Switch over the years. But for the first time Tuesday, Nintendo is hinting that a whole new console is coming our way.

But Nintendo's in a pretty good spot. They're in a good spot because they're not just about hardware, they're about software.

We should really begin by celebrating and talking about the winners, but I think we just have to talk about PSG first because in this game, they absolutely dominated the possession. They peppered the Dortmund goal with shots. They had 31 shots to Dortmund 6. And would you believe, they hit the frame of the goal four times. And in the first leg, they hit the frame of the goal twice. So, they hit the woodwork six times over two legs. They just couldn't get the ball to go in. And they must now be thinking they are absolutely cursed in the Champions League. This is the one they really want. This is the tournament that their category owners have spent millions and millions and millions of dollars trying to win, and they just can't do it. So, they're out. And heartbreak yet again for Paris Saint Germain. On the other hand, what an amazing result for Borussia Dortmund, who have had a miserable season in the German Bundesliga. They're fifth in their domestic league, they were given no chance in the Champions League this season. And yet, here they are in the final for the first time since 2013. This was the decisive goal, a header from the unmarked Mats Hummels. They scored one on the night, winning 2-0 on aggregate. It sends Borussia Dortmund back to the final since -- for the first time since 2013. And it was almost preordained. Because the last time they were in the final, it was also at London's Wembley Stadium. On that occasion, they played their big German rivals Bayern Munich for the title, and they might do so again because Bayern are playing in the other semifinal against Real Madrid tomorrow.",
