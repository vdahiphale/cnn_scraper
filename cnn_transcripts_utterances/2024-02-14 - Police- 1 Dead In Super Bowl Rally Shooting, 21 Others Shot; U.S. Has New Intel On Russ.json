I'm going to speak to a father and his daughter who witnessed the shooting. The father tackling the alleged gunman. Also breaking this hour, Russia's space nukes. The House Intelligence Committee chairman sounding the alarm on the, quote, serious national security threat. CNN now learning the U.S. has new information on Putin's nuclear capabilities. And this hour, we are following more breaking news out of Washington. The special counsel, Jack Smith, pressing the Supreme Court to deny Trump's total claims of immunity, just hours before Trump's back in court for the New York hush money case. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight. The breaking news, a deadly mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl rally. According to police, 21 people were shot and injured. That includes children and at least one person has died. Gunfire erupting at the end of the Chiefs' victory parade where more than one million people had gathered. At least three people are now in custody and under investigation. In a moment, I'm going to speak to the father and daughter. They witnessed the shooting and sent us this video of the father. His name is Paul. You're going to meet them in a moment, tackling what he says is one of the alleged gunman. So you'll hear exactly what they saw and did here. And the video coming out of this event shows an absolutely chaotic scene, as I said, there were 1 million people there. And in this moment, you've got hundreds of people running for their lives. Nick Watt is OUTFRONT live in Los Angeles to begin our coverage tonight. And, Nick, police just wrapping up their press conference. What's the latest about what happened, who did it, where they are?",

The FBI would be front and center if this was even suspected or any shred of evidence of a terrorist incident. So I think we can put that to the side. So, this appears to be a criminal act there are three suspects in custody. This was a sort of a spontaneous event, if you will. It sounds like if they were planning something, it seems like and they were trying to inflict mass casualties. They would have done it on the parade itself for maximum impact. So, you know, Kansas City downtown, amongst a million people, mingled in there are probably some pretty bad people, perhaps some gang members. And it sounds like this might have been a dispute.

Now, keep in mind if nukes were launched to the U.S. from space, they would be undetectable.

So the idea to target U.S. or partners satellites in space, including surveillance satellites, nuclear, or early warning satellites with a nuclear component, which, of course, would expand the ability to destroy those capabilities in space, considered serious enough that the us shared it with its Five Eyes partners, its closest intel partners, including the U.K., Canada, et cetera.I should note this as well, and I've spoken to three people who are ready in on this latest intelligence, including to lawmakers. And they told me, one, this is not a clear and present danger. This is something that Russia is experimenting with looking into designing. It is not currently deployed and not considered something that will soon be deployed. That's key. Second of all, Erin, they've all said to me that this is highly sensitive intelligence, including the sourcing involved. So they were surprised that you have a member of Congress that was going so public with this, at this time. So that's very important. As you said, it was Mike Turner who started it was something cryptic about a new threat to the U.S. And it was reporters who dug into figure out exactly what he was talking about. But then later in the day you saw even one of his Republican colleagues, the Speaker Mike Johnson, saying in his words, there is no cause for alarm right now.

SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Well, look, I think the speaker is right. This is a serious issue, but it's something that we're working hard to address. And defense intelligence -- defense officials, some of whom I spoke with again today are working on how to address just to make sure we keep Americans safe. It's important to understand that what the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has done here, Mike Turner, is fundamentally leak information. He's an intelligence leaker because what he did is he decided to take highly sensitive compartmented intelligence. That means that so even if you have a very -- like a top-secret clearance or something, you only have access to the intelligence if you have a need to know. And he shared it with every member of Congress, people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who, of course, we all know cannot be trusted to keep the secret. And indeed it only took a few hours for the details of this weapon system to come out. So he may think he has very principled reasons to do this, but he's put our national security at risk. He's put the sources of intelligence at risk. He's raised a lot of questions with our allies who of course count on us to keep the safe and he's really inhibited our ability to respond.",

To New York trials, Kara just mentioned the criminal trial, the hush money case involving Stormy Daniels, and then that business fraud trial, which is moving along as well. The president already found guilty of fraud. The question is, how much will the judge says he have to pay? So, you see all of those happening, Erin, and they coincide right now, you have a presidential campaign calendar, right? The president won New Hampshire, he won, Iowa. He won Nevada. Well, guess what? As he's trying to become the Republican nominee, and he's on a pretty good path to it right now, look at all of this going bang. The president tonight, former president, a rally in South Carolina is Kara noted, the New York hush money hearing tomorrow probably get a trial date. There's also a Georgia hearing.

How much does the president have to pay? The Trump organization have to pay that could come Friday Jack Smith's deadline was Monday. He filed tonight.
