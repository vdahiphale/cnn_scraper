I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Fresh from the courtroom and back on the campaign trail. Donald Trump, whose campaign is being drained by his legal fees attends a fundraising dinner in Alabama tonight and visits South Carolina on Saturday. All of this after unprecedented allegations against a U.S. president, a day after pleading not guilty to four federal counts contained in a 45-page indictment. The most serious against him yet. Essentially, he is accused of a conspiracy to defraud the United States with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. CNN reports the president to be in a sour, dark mood since that indictment. And there's more to come, reportedly, in the State of Georgia, where he demanded election officials \"find him thousands more votes.\" And yet, he is still, by a long shot, way ahead of the entire field in the Republican primary. My first guest has her finger on the pulse of the grand old party. Sarah Longwell is a former Republican strategist. And now, she is the founder of the Republican Accountability Project.

And people expressed a kind of, you know, A, they said, we just don't care. Lots of people said they just don't care, they just see it as another attempt to get Trump, the indictments, they can't really tell them apart. A lot of these two-time Trump voters have made up their mind a long time ago about the insurrection and Trump's culpability, which is that they don't think it was his fault. They sort of range somewhere between saying, you know, that is the fault of the people who went in that day, to, well, that was bad, but what about, you know, the Black Lives Matter protests? All the way down to, that was a false flag operation meant to make Republicans look bad. And so, unfortunately -- and this is the reason Trump is still so dominant in the polls, is that so much of his base just thinks that every indictment is more evidence that the establishment and the deep state are scared of Trump because he is the most effective person and they want to take him down.",

And the fact is, you know, you can see why these voters believe them, because it's not just Steve Bannon, it's also Tim Scott, it's also the people running against Donald Trump and the Republican primary, his opposition. When people who are running against him are saying things like, you know, we've got to get rid of this two-tiered justice system, this is the weaponization of government against a political rival, and it comes from, you are right that there's people like Bill Barr who are out there saying that this indictment is a good indictment, but there's a lot of other \"sort of normal Republicans\" who toe the line that this is an attack on Donald Trump and a weaponization of the justice system.

But they're not that enthusiastic about him or any other challenger. And I think, like, you can't beat something with nothing. Like one of these people who are running against Donald Trump need to sort of capture the imagination of Republican primary voters. And because nobody is showing sort of the sufficient political talent or charisma, and they've all kind of internalized so much of Trump's messaging and they're so afraid of his voters that they all end up sounding sort of like a knockoff, bargain basement version of Trump, and voters aren't going to want that when they have access to the real thing.

Just take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. GOV.

And so, I don't think that that's going to make the ultimate difference. I will -- I do want to say that I think what Chris Christie has been doing, if the entire field were acting like Chris Christie and going at Trump and making these arguments, there'd be less of this collective action problem, right? I mean, Chris Christie is -- he's not going to endear himself, he's not going to win a Republican primary by, you know, talking about Trump all the time, because base voters don't like it.

How did you get all the elements? SASHA JOELLE ACHILLI, PRODUCER, FRONTLINE'S \"INSIDE THE IRANIAN UPRISING\":  So, I had, quite a few years ago, made a film -- worked on a film about the White Ones Day Movement, it was 2018 and some women had to remove their hijabs in public and had been arrested. And so, I kind of, you know, followed the events in Iran closely. And when Mahsa was killed, I was trying to figure out how we could tell a story about what was going on. And obviously, as you know, it's really hard for foreign reporters to go to Iran and to work there. But the extraordinary thing was that Iranian citizens themselves were filming the events and posting what they were witnessing online. And I got in touch with a friend and colleague, filmmaker, Majed Neisi. And I said, Majed, you know, what are you doing? How -- what do -- how do you think, you know, there could be a film about what's going on? And he said, Sasha, you know, since Mahsa was killed, every night for 12 hours I have been sitting and watching everything that's been uploaded and I'm downloading it and archiving it. And so, by the time he and I spoke, he had already archived, you know, over 70 to 80 hours of footage, which was pretty extraordinary. And then he put, you know, a kind of a teaser together, just to give me a taste of the footage of the things he had been seeing, which I didn't access to. I don't speak Farsi. So, I didn't have access to kind of some of the Telegram channels. And I was -- you know, when I watch what he showed me, I was moved. I was in tears. I was angry.

I think that after a year of this uprising, we candefinitely say that Iran has evolved, the society has evolved, that there's a huge gap now between the public and the Islamic Republic and the demand for overhaul all sale change has never been more clear. We've seen that, yes, the security forces and the government was successful in brutally crushing the mass protests that we saw all over Iran, but they haven't been able to really kill this desire for revolutionary change that we've see in Iran. You know, we've seen protests movements over the past 40 years sparked by different things. But this time around, I think it was very clear that the people in the streets, woman leading, young people at the forefront of it, the new generation were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. And if we were to just look at the way that the women continue to defy the hijab law, they continue to defy the government's attempt to control what they wear, to control how the appearance in society, we see that this movement is living through the people of Iran this desire for change lives, because despite the new law that's being considered in the parliament that you mentioned and, you know, criminalization of showing your hair and not wearing hijab, our reporting and evidence shows that women are still coming out not wearing the hijab every chance they get. I'd also like to point out, we see that every chance that people get, be it funerals, be it religious Ashura ceremonies, whatever chance they have, or Nowruz celebrations, when people can congregate in public that the -- these gatherings quickly become political, they quickly turned into a rallying cry against the oppression that they face.

It's a really good question because I think that what I have understood, and maybe Farnaz can back me up on this, is that Gen Z also doesn't have a desire to leave Iran like the previous generation probably did to seek a better future and to find that freedom that perhaps they didn't have in Iran.
