So, if you're looking for an amazing meal, lots of wine, then you want to head to a dinner cruise.Now, this boat is called Ducasse sur Seine. It is named after the chef, very famous French chef called Alain Ducasse. He has 19 Michelin stars. And whilst we glide along the Seine, we are going to see some of Paris's most iconic landmarks. We just saw the Eiffel Tower. We're going to see the Grand Palais. We're going to see the Louvre and then we're going to circle back and we're going to see the Eiffel Tower at the end of this trip. Now, whilst we do all of that, the guests here are going to be tucking into a seven-course meal. Now, I've managed to get my hands on a menu and let me take you through some of these delicious dishes. So, you've got the coquilles saint-jacques, sea scallops. This is a favorite for French families during Christmas, as well as New Year's Eve. Then you've got foie gras, my personal favorite. And then you've got canard sauvage, wild duck. And then to finish, you've got a chocolate creation, one of Ducasse's signature desserts. So, Boris, what else could you want? Food, the sights, good company, I just think it's going to be the best New Year's Eve ever.",
