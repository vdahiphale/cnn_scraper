So, I think that there's still a lot of pent up anger between thepresidential administration, the Zelenskyy administration and the military high command about the Russians. The Russian -- the ground that the Russians gained at the beginning of the war, specifically in southern Ukraine. Then we had the failure of the Ukrainian counter- offensive last year in 2023. And then we had General Zaluzhny last November, basically saying that the war looked like it was reaching a stalemate and that the Ukrainians had very little chance of a major breakthrough. And so, when all of those things combined together, added on with the fact that the Ukrainians are in a huge internal debate about whether or not to do more demobilization measures, specifically, General Zaluzhny wanted to mobilize several 100,000 more Ukrainians. And President Zelenskyy is reluctant to do that, unless there's a clear plan about exactly how it's going to aid the Ukrainian war effort, more details about how it's going to work, and very importantly, how it's going to be paid for by the Ukrainian government. And so, basically, those disagreements between them seem to have grown. So, we have kind of a combination of long standing grievances.

The U.N.'s key aid agency in Gaza is facing a crisis that threatens its very existence. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now calling for an end to UNRWA.

His comments come as Sweden joins a growing list of countries that have suspended funding to the agency after Israel's claimed that 13 staffers were involved in the massacre. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres says the U.N. acted immediately to terminate the staffers and if UNRWA is shut down, the humanitarian situation in Gaza will become desperate.

      "sentences": "Rosemary, to borrow a phrase from the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Israel's antipathy to the U.N. broadly and UNRWA in particular isn't taking place in a vacuum. Israel and the United Nations have had a pretty touchy relationship for decades with the notable exception of the resolutions that brought Israel -- modern day Israel into being in 1947 and 1949. It reaches Nadera (PH) in 75 with a resolution equating Zionism with racism, something that wasn't repealed for 16 years.And Israel will also point to other areas that it says show that the U.N. is against it, that is biased against it, such as the only country for which there is a standing item on the agenda of the U.N. Human Rights Council being against Israel. When it comes to UNRWA in particular, Israel has always not necessarily had it in for the organization, but has always been unhappy with it because it says that UNRWA perpetuates the Israeli Palestinian conflict by conferring refugee status not just on those Palestinians that were displaced, when Israel was created in 1948, but also all of their descendants, keeping these or assisting these Palestinians in refugee camps, and holding out the promise that one day they may be able to return to their former homes in Israel, something that Israel says is never going to happen. And so, what these allegations that Israel has presented to the U.N. and to the U.S. and others, which it says show that about a dozen staffers of UNRWA were complicit in the Hamas led massacre of October the seventh. I suppose this gives Israel something of a smoking gun with which to say to the United Nations, to the U.S. and others that UNRWA simply isn't fit for purpose. And so, we had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday saying for the first time, that UNRWA should be disbanded, saying that I think it's time the international community and the U.N. itself understand that UNRWA under his mission has to end. The problem for Israel, of course, is that there isn't necessarily anyone that can step into the breach. And we've heard from the U.N. Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Martin Griffiths, saying that those people in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are now displaced and reliant on humanitarian aid for food, medicine, shelter, and the like. He says that UNRWA, they are completely dependent upon UNRWA. And I suppose the problem from a humanitarian perspective is if it cannot continue its operations after the end of this month, as it says will happen if it doesn't find the financing the money to plug the gap that has now been created by the U.S. and others suspending its financing, then who or what will step into the breach. And that's not just a concern from a humanitarian perspective, but also from Israel's perspective. It certainly doesn't want to take responsibility for two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip if they're no longer able to receive humanitarian aid. And so, I suppose it could be a case, Rosemary, almost of Israel, needing to be careful what it wishes for, because if UNRWA isn't there, it's not clear, it's not obvious what organization or who will be able to step into the breach to provide that much needed humanitarian aid to most of Gaza's two million Palestinians, Rosemary.",

CNN's Oren Liebermann has details from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: The White House has now formally assigned blame for the drone attack on Sunday that killed three U.S. service members and wounded dozens more. They say they hold the Islamic resistance in Iraq responsible for that attack. That's not a specific group, but rather it is an umbrella of groups that are Iran backed, funded, armed and trained to some extent, and they say that group is responsible for the attack. That group is also worth noting includes Kataib Hezbollah that is the most powerful Iranian proxy in Iraq. The U.S. has said they have their fingerprints on this Sunday drone attack. It's also worth noting that on Tuesday, Kataib Hezbollah put out a statement saying they will cease their operations against U.S. forces in Iraq so as not to embarrass the government of Iraq. Asked about that statement, the Pentagon said actions speak louder than words. Putting in more than 160 attacks on US forces in the region, including a number of attacks after that deadly drone attack on Sunday. It is this to which the U.S. is responding. The White House says it could be a multi-phased response. Meaning, not just targeting one specific group or one specific area, but something that we could see play out over waves, perhaps, even a number of days as the U.S. has made clear its response will be forceful. When it carries it out in terms of timing or targets, the U.S. that is the Pentagon, the White House will only say the U.S. will respond in a manner time and place of its choosing.
