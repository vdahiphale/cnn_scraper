He knows that Jim Jordan cannot become speaker, given the direction that this is headed here, but did make some news as we were hearing there is going to be a Republican meeting this afternoon to try to assess what to do here. And he made very clear, they are not in a good place as Republican conference, which of course is an understatement. Given how bad things have gotten within the Republican conference about all of this. He continues to blame the same eight members, the Republicans who led this effort voted to oust him, here led by Congressman Matt Gaetz. He calls them the crazy eights, led by Gaetz. That's also shows you that if they were -- if he wanted any hope to get back in the speakership himself, he would need those votes to come back inside. There's no sign of that happening, either. So where do they go from here? Is not clear. You heard McCarthy there saying, that it depends on what Jim Jordan decides to do. It's up to Jim to decide what about, whether or not to step aside here. But acknowledging very clearly here, Republicans are in a very, very bad place. They have to figure things out. They have to get it behind closed doors again. They have had so many meetings behind closed doors that have gone absolutely nowhere that have just led to more and more division, more and more frustration, more and more chaos.

And yet, what we saw were hundreds of trucks, waiting in long lines now for three days and still a paralysis in terms of being able to get that aid to where it is so desperately needed.Now, the two main issues at this stage appear to be on the Israeli side. They want to be sure that they can verify those trucks, that they can go through the contents, that they can make sure there are no weapons or anything like that before they go into Rafah and beyond. The issue is where do you do that? Who does it? And how do you do it in a timely manner? The second issue is that the U.N. doesn't want this to be an isolated incident, one-time thing where 20 trucks go in. They want it to be an established and sustained daily humanitarian corridor. And what they're worried about is that if they can't get that kind of consensus from everyone at the table, that when they would go in with just 20 trucks, that they will be mobbed, that there will be a frenzy. And just to give you some perspective, it used to be before the violent attacks from Hamas of now almost two weeks ago, that over 400 trucks will go into Gaza every single day. So now, we're talking about 20 trucks, relatively speaking, it's a drop in the ocean. And that's why there's this concern that it could be violent or dangerous for U.N. staff. If it isn't agreed upon, that this is not going to be a one-off thing, and that the aid will start flowing more freely. Now what was interesting, Dana, is that the U.N. secretary general initially, I think, hoped he was going to go there with a good news story, at least hoped he was going to be able to go there and say, we're doing everything we can and meet with volunteers. Instead, he arrived at a full-blown protest, hundreds of angry people who honestly you could barely hear the secretary general's remarks. They were drowned out by the crowd. People demanding justice. People looking for loved ones inside Gaza who they had lost contact with. And a lot of people who are incredibly angry at Israel, the U.S. at international institutions that they feel had failed the Palestinian people. And also, Dana, a lot of anger at western media. I had one woman started shouting at me. I went up to her. I said, tell me what you want to say, engage with me. I'm willing to hear it. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAEL-AMERICAN PRESUMED TO BE KIDNAPPED: Yes. Well, thank you for saying that. Obviously, no decent human being can see the suffering of the civilians in Gaza and not feel that pain. And but the world simply can't ignore the fact that the series of events that's led up to this is still very much connected to its origin, which is a rampage of about 2000 heavily armed well-trained terrorists, into civilian cooperative farms and some small towns along the border with Israel, including my own kibbutz Nir Oz, a farming community and no military significance whatsoever. Killing of dozens of our residents from toddlers to elderly people and everything in between, and the taking of many more dozens of captives from the kibbutz, also from 10 months old to 88-year-old granny, including 35-year-old son.

And I very much hope that it's accurate. What I do know for certain is that the excruciatingly long list of missing and captive people from my kibbutz has incrementally gotten shorter over the last few days, as we've gotten notifications from Israeli authorities, that people that we thought might be captive had been confirmed dead, meaning murdered either on the grounds of the kibbutz or as they were being abducted into Gaza. So, time is of the essence here. It's clear. We are -- I don't know if I can speak for other families.
