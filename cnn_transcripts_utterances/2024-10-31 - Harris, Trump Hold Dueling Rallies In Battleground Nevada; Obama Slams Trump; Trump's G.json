Kamala Harris about to take the stage in Reno. Trump is in Henderson right now. This election, of course, is, as you know, a dead heat and new CNN polling tonight from Georgia shows that is the case there. As you can see, no clear leader, 47 to 48 percent, those numbers actually reversed in new CNN polling from North Carolina and both these states within the margin of error. This is, of course, an election where as of tonight, look at this nearly 61 million Americans have already voted and we do know the majority of voters to this point in the battleground states, they're women, accounting for 55 percent of the ballots cast, so far. Harris, just moments ago, taking on Trump when it comes to his recent comments about treatment of women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There's a saying that got to listen to people when they tell you who you are, where they are and this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said, women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not risk back the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions of courts accordingly. But we trust women. We trust women.

They're really focused on turning out their voters and seeing if they can make a difference on the margins with particular demographics.That's why you saw Donald Trump go not only is he in this West Coast swing, he's about to take the stage in Nevada later, hoping can Arizona, but he also visited New Mexico, which is a bit surprising given its considered a Democratic border saying. However, that was really where Donald Trump and his campaign thought that they could further make inroads with Hispanic voters in this country. Of course, a demographic that is crucial to both sides winning. And Trump's campaign is recognized and I said as of now, they want a race. Harris is lead with Hispanic men. So that is really something they're trying to further make gains on. However of course, that visit came as Donald Trump is still and his team are still trying to clean up some of what was said at that Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday and Trump himself acknowledged, kind of said the quiet part out loud in New Mexico, arguing that he came here to back up his credentials with Hispanic and Latino voters. Take a listen to how he put it, Erin. (BEGINVIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Don't make me waste a whole damn half a day here, okay? Look, I came here, you know, we can be nice to each other or we could talk turkey. Let's talk turkey, okay? First of all, Hispanics love Trump. I'm here for one simple reason.

MARC LOTTER, FORMER TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS: Well, I think there's multiple reasons. Number one, New Mexico really got close in 2016. I actually thought it might have been a state that could be flipped in '20. Now that didn't happen, so I think there is movement there, also a very competitive House race, and I think that's actually the bigger reason because the one thing people forget about these rallies as we get the data from all the people who were there, they can go to that campaign now that congressional campaign, you were at the rally, make sure you get out the vote, bring your friends.",

They repeatedly -- Kamala Harris's intelligence has been insulted again and again and again, including by Donald Trump, who literally called her mentally challenged.And so, I think that this is about -- you know, we've been talking but how there aren't really that many undecided voters where people are deciding vote or not. And I think for a host of women, for a host of people, the Madison Square Garden rally, which get, you know -- Megyn Kelly actually made this point. So did Nikki Haley. It was a bro-fest. It was a bro-fest and an election in which I think gender is going to be a real determinant of who wins. And I think that highlighting these comments and highlighting the fact of how much Trump's campaign seems to be going back to the well of working class white men over and over and over again and leaving even white women out in the dust, I think that that's something that Harris campaign is going to continue to do.",

They're worried about public safety and they know because Donald Trump is not a hypothetical candidate, he has a record. Things were cheaper. Border was secure, world was safer when he was in office.

Georgia on my mind as Ray Charles used to say.Look, as Jeff was talking about in the last segment, the big blue wall runs through the Great Lake battleground states. That's Kamala Harris's best path. You know, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, that would get Kamala Harris to 270 electoral votes. But let's just say there's some leakage in that great big blue wall. Let's just say the Kamala Harris loses in Michigan, will then she drops below 270 electoral votes. But you know what get a right back over it. Let's just say we give the state of North Carolina. She gets up to 271 electoral votes. So the bottom line is the Southeast states can very much sort of prove as a backup path potentially for Kamala Harris. Let's just say were going to put Michigan back in a blue, but we get Pennsylvania way to Donald Trump. Now, Kamala Harris is again south of 270 electoral votes. Well, what can sub in? Will why don't we give it the state of Georgia, right? It went blue last time. That gets Kamala Harris well above 270 electoral votes. The bottom line is this, look, Kamala Harris is best path to 270 electoral votes still runs through that great big blue wall up here in the Great Lakes states. But the southeast provides this backup to her. One little last nugget I'll sort of point out to you, you know, were talking about the importance of Georgia and North Carolina, when was the last time a Republican won without Georgia? You've got to go all the way back to 1980. Of course, Jimmy Carter was the Democratic nominee, not a big surprise. He carried assault. How about North Carolina? You have to go all the way back to 1956. So, the idea that Donald Trump can win without carrying the state of North Carolina. History would suggest that ain't going to happen. HILL:  All right. So when we look at that too, look, there's been a lot made about different voting blocs in this country. I know you specifically okay. Debt black voters when it comes to Kamala Harris in both of those states, why do you say there are warning signs?",

Banks are going to be pretty skeptical of refinancing and old aging office building where the occupancy is going down since COVID, or he can pay for it himself. He has about $400 million in cash. Also, these legal judgments hanging over his head is he really wanted to tie up, say, $120 million paying off this debt? That's going to be tough for him to do.
