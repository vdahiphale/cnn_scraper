President Biden and Speaker McCarthy also had what both sides characterize as a productive and positive conversation on Sunday as President Biden was making his way back here on Air Force One from that G7 Summit in Japan.But this meeting this afternoon, Boris, is going to be critical because heading into this meeting, these two sides remain very far apart. Not only on some of the policy sticking points of -- excuse me, what exactly would go into this deal in terms of work requirements, for example, which has been one of the areas of contention, but also if you just look at the broader top-line spending number where exactly to cap spending and for how long. The two sides still remaining very far apart on that notion. And so today, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy sitting down one on one, not that big congressional leaders' meeting that you've seen in recent weeks, which was also a notable change, just signaling the extent to which this deal is going to come down to these two men and their ability to bring along their various sides. That's one thing that these two sides acknowledged last week, this is going to need to be a bipartisan deal, which means that you need to get enough House Republicans but you're also probably going to need some House Democratic votes. And that is the balance that these two sides are trying to strike. A very tricky balance at that. We will see if they can get any closer later today, as you said earlier, just 10 days away from that potential default,",

And in Idaho, one of those aggravating circumstances can be the killing of multiple people at the same time. We know in this case, there were four college students who were actually killed in that apartment that was near this college, and that Kohberger is being charged with four counts of murder as well as burglary. So, there is enough in terms of aggravating circumstances already for the prosecutors if they choose to seek the death penalty.And even if they decide not to pursue the death penalty, I can't imagine that if he is convicted that he would face anything other than life in prison without parole. Very gruesome circumstances. Four college students murdered, two were able to be spared in what appeared to be is a very horrific attack on this college apartment-- in the student's apartment. And took investigators a long -- awhile, Brianna, before they were able to link Kohberger to these killings. They were able to do so, as a result of DNA evidence, as well as cell phone evidence, and some surveillance video that tied his car to a car that was seen near the apartment.",

I think the investigators, in this case, want to make sure that they have a very solid case, that when the case actually gets before a jury, we know a trial date has already been set in October, that none of the evidence and none of the witness -- witnesses have been compromised. We were expecting, Brianna, this very sweeping arraignment hearing where we would have been able to hear more of the evidence that the prosecutors and law enforcement agents had been able to put together.But by there being a grand jury indictment, that superseded this lengthy arraignment hearing that we were expecting. So far, all of the reports that have come out don't give us very much information about a motive. Why was Kohberger at this apartment? Why did he kill these four individuals? Was he targeting them? Did he have any prior connection to any of the victims? All of that information has yet to been -- to be disclosed.",
