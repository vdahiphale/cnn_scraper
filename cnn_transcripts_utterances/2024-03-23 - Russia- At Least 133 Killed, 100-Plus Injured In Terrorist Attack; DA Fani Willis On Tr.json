Now, President Putin is trying to blame Ukraine after Russian investigators claimed four of the alleged suspects were taken into custody near the Ukrainian-Russia border. Ukraine has denied any connection to the attack, and tonight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says: \"Miserable Putin is trying to blame someone else for his own problems.\" On Friday night, armed gunmen stormed the Moscow Music Hall shooting concert goers.  Here are some of the shots and the people running on your screen there and they used explosives to start a fire. Officials say more than 130 people are dead, dozens others injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the massacre. CNN's Matthew Chance has the latest from Russia.",

The number of confirmed dead in the Crocus City Hall attack has now risen to more than 130 people according to official figures.All day, mourners have been laying flowers outside the burned-out building in Moscow while inside, emergency teams have been continuing to sift through the debris and say they expect to find more bodies and with more than 140 people injured, the death toll is unfortunately expected to rise. In a nationwide security operation, investigators say at least 11 people have already been detained including four gunmen suspected to have carried out the mass shootings on Friday night. State media has been broadcasting grisly images of some of the men tied up and blooded being manhandled then interrogated. One speaking broken Russian is shown allegedly confessing to carrying out the attacks in the Crocus City Hall for money. But of course, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the assault, posting images of what they say are the attackers with their faces covered. The terror group says the attack was a normal part of its war against countries fighting Islam. US officials say they also have no reason to doubt the ISIS claim. But the Russian President Vladimir Putin vowing revenge for what he calls a barbaric act has attempted to link the attack to Ukraine saying preliminary data suggests the gunmen were attempting to escape there across what is an extremely heavily militarized border. That is something Ukrainian officials have strongly denied. One senior official there telling CNN that the Kremlin is trying to implicate Ukraine to rally domestic support for its brutal war and provide an excuse for ramping up attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.

So despite the fact that we -- that the Russians and us are fighting over Ukraine, there is still a strong sentiment in the intelligence community that if you know of a terrorist attack, you have a duty to inform other intelligence agencies. We did that and we admitted we did that. Russia came back and said that its fake news essentially because one, he didn't want to hear it. Two, he doesn't want to look like he didn't know it, right, because then what does that mean? And three, honestly, I don't know if there was anything he could do about it. I mean, the public safety apparatus as we saw in these pictures is depleted in Russia. It is remarkable to me that they had a large concert like this. It wasn't fortified. There were barely -- the terrorists just walked in. The response was very slow. So whether he pays a price for this is hard to tell, but he has an incentive to lie about what this was.",

It is still an active terrorist organization. Russia has thwarted attacks, and in Western Europe, there have been thwarted attacks. This was a huge success on their part. It seemed to me, looking at the pictures relatively easy. They walked in. These were not suicide missions, they were able to bring guns into Russia. Russia is not a heavily armed civilian society, so they got access to weapons and then they were able to do the sort of second wave, which was of course try to destroy the building and kill more people in the process. So it shows that they are -- ISIS is active in Russia.

So, off she goes on a trip to the tour to Kenya, and she becomes Queen while she is there because he dies while she is overseas. So always before, Royals have kept at this image of being in perfect health until the last minute. And what we had with Kate was this unprecedented announcement, this speaking directly to us, very much reminding me, Omar of the way that the Queen gave direct addresses, but also being so honest in talking about chemotherapy, about speaking to the children, it really was I think a significant intervention. She has been the story, hasn't she, for so long, all of these social media, very distressing and often very cruel social media commentaries and jokes, and now, she is taking back the narrative to herself and talking about her journey and her recovery and that, I think was so inspiring.",

Meghan suffered huge invasions into her privacy and really, Harry and Meghan was saying, we need to give them privacy as well, and that support, I think is very important and we do expect Harry to be coming over to the UK quite soon, connected with the Invictus Games. So I imagine that would be going over to see Kate and the support is going to be there. And there have been divisions. You know, the Royal family has been through a lot: The death of the Queen, Harry and Meghan stepping down from Royal duties and now, the King has cancer, and I think what we all hope is it is going to bring them together because Princess Diana, she is still -- she is longer with us, but she is part of the family and she always wanted her sons to support each other and it would be very important to her if they could do that.",

And look, we have seen a wide range of voices, even I mentioned in the story as well, a number of Democratic congressmen urging the Biden administration to find opportunities to do more. Because as you mentioned, any person killed is too many people in this country.Now, look, you were mayor of Baltimore, but also in cities countrywide, it does seem there's not a day that goes by without a shooting or mass shooting. And so what is the first thing from an administrative or policy standpoint that you believe needs to be done to try and make a dent in this dynamic of violence that, again, we've seen cycle over and over and over again at this point? RAWLINGS-BLAKE: I think the Biden administration is smart with the gun violence office that they've set up, because it does take a concentrated and collaborative effort to make a dent in gun violence. And it's no just one thing, it's everything. So I think that that approach makes sense. We all - in our communities across the country, we have to be on the same page. We have to be willing to work with the police and the police have to be willing to work with the community. We have to rebuild the bonds of trust so we can create a community where the police - when something happens that the community - the first person they call is the police. And in some of these communities where gun violence is ravaging them, their relationships with the police is so broken that they don't want to work in collaboration to create safer community. So there is a lot of work to be done. There's no one thing. I believe always we have to do everything and we have to do it smarter and in community.",

And Mayor Scott has told me that that's obviously not enough, but of course is progress.But I want to get some perspective from you here, because, in places like Baltimore, in places like Chicago, where people might say, oh, these cities have strict gun laws and yet we see violence. Yet we heard from the mayor here that a lot of their guns are coming from outside the city and trickle into the city. So from your time as mayor, what are those dynamics that you think are so unique to a place like Baltimore that does proliferate some of the violence that we see? RAWLINGS-BLAKE: Baltimore is uniquely positioned up along the 95 corridor. That's where these guns are coming from. The challenge is there are elected officials who want to hold mayors accountable in these cities for the gun violence yet they're not willing to work in an innovative way, creative way and in a strong way to limit the traffic of guns that are coming into our cities. We know that the guns aren't manufactured in Baltimore. They're not - I don't - I think we might have one or two gun stores, possibly, I don't even remember. But they're not sold in mass quantities in Baltimore. They are coming from other places. And that - and Baltimore is not unique in that way. So if the people who say that they want to hold cities accountable to be safer, they should be willing to work hand in hand with us to create the tools to do that.",
