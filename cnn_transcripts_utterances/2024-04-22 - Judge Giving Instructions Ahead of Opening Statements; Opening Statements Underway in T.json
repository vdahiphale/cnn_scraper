The jury just took their seats, the start of opening statements in the hush money trial of Donald Trump.Judge Juan Merchan just gave them instructions to consider the next few hours the grand preview of the case against the former president. The prosecution plans to run the men and women of the jury through Trump's alleged scheme seem to hide a sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels in the final stretch of the 2016 campaign. The defense will likely lay out their version of events, a version of events in which Donald Trump had no knowledge of payments alleged meant to silence the adult film actress. I want to go straight to CNN's Paula Reid who's joining me here along with Kaitlan Collins. So, Paula, we are getting for our viewers who are just joining us minute-by-minute accounts from our three correspondents in the courtroom and in the overflow room. That's what viewers are going to be seeing on the left-hand side of the screen.",

He's going to explain the burden is on the prosecution. In fact, there's many parts of this trial that the defense doesn't even have to put on. The burden is that of the prosecutors.He' s also going to talk them though you how they should operate throughout the next five to six weeks. He's going to tell them not to talk to anyone about the case, right? Don't read anything about the case. So, this is going to be their mission statement. He is laying out what the job entails.

Trump had people to handle invoices and such things for him. They'll also argue that Michael Cohen was Trump's lawyer at the time in question.

But just to note, is the judge is explaining to the jury how this is going to work, what they need to rely on, that it is not what he says that is evidence, it's what the actual -- what is presented to them that is the evidence that they decide to sign. Trump is in this room with the 12 jurors who are going to decide ultimately what happens here. And he's someone who the jurors last week, because they were being brought in, were describing that he was waving at some of them and they as they came in. He kind of is viewing this in the way that he does really the lens of everything right now, which is through this like kind of campaign lens of someone who thinks he is his own best campaigner, his own best spokesperson and his own best attorney, really.",

It is the question with the answer that is evidence.So, he's laying out exactly what they have to do as they contemplate these charges over the next five to six weeks.

Well, let me tell you this, and then attack.You want to try to make a connection with those jurors. You want them to like you. I believe Todd Blanche is the one who's doing the opening. You want to make some kind of a connection with them, and you just want to attack, attack, attack. You can't believe Michael Cohen. You can't believe Stormy Daniels. And then you want to embrace yourself with the judge and what the judge's instructions are, and say, the judge is going to tell you this, and the judge is going to tell you that, and we agree.

My approach is to really go hard in the opening statement.Years ago the New York Times did a study and jurors found that, 80 percent of jurors found that whatever they thought the verdict was going to be after the openings was their verdict, 80 percent.

And, again, you just have to attack, attack, attack those witnesses. And, look, what you got to say is Michael Cohen should be a co- defendant.

He never told his client. He just said, look, I need money for this, I need money for that. And, you know, one of the witnesses who's going to testify at this trial testified for defense, and he said that the money that was given to Michael Cohen was for Stormy Daniels' end for legal fees.

The former president of the United States is intermittently looking at the jury, the men and women, who will decide his fate as this hush money cover- up criminal trial continues.CNN reporters inside the courthouse have observed that Mr. Trump shut his eyes at one point, leaning back in his chair. Judge Merchan said there is no particular formula for evaluating the truthfulness and accuracy of witness testimony that is from our reporters in the courtroom. And if you look on the far left side of the screen, you can see you're getting live reports there from our reporters in the courtroom. CNN's Paula Reid is standing by in Manhattan. Paula, bring us up to speed. REID:  So, Jake, the judge is laying out for the jury the gravity of the task that they have at hand and the fact that these charges against former President Trump must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He said, if you find him guilty, that must be based on the evidence, not on speculation and not on bias. And he's going on to explain to the jurors exactly how this will work. And he notes that, for example, lawyers are not allowed to comment during witness testimony, telling the jury that that only happens in movies and on television shows, but not at a real trial. Now, our reporters inside the courtroom note that that drew a smile both from the prosecution and the defense, probably one of the few unifying moments in this case so far. The judge will continue to lay out what exactly is happening and what is expected of these jurors. This whole thing, this whole instruction is expected to take about 30 minutes and then we'll get into opening statements.",

This will come into play in having lawyers on your jury as well. We were concerned about, remember, can lawyers be on the actual jury? The reason he left concerns is because you might be deferential to them and say, is that what happened? Is that the issue here? It's almost a way of them reminding us, look, the prosecution and the defense, they have to build their case, they have to defend their case, but the lawyers and also note-taking is not going to substitute for you what you're hearing. And, again, there is no formula for evaluating accuracy. You have your varied life experiences to do so. So, much like the jury selection was kind of an art.

It's also interesting because the guy who's a defendant became known to people around the country and the world on a reality T.V. show.Obviously, it wasn't court related. It was business related.

He did not go to trial in federal court in the Southern District of New York of the following, first of all, of campaign finance violations, by the way, which is very relevant to this case, second of all, of making false statements to Congress relating to Donald Trump's efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Michael Cohen said that those conversations were fewer in number than they actually were and stopped earlier than they actually stopped.What Michael Cohen pled guilty called 18USC 1001 false statements, and it makes it a crime to, quote, make any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement to a government body, including Congress. He also -- this is important. Michael Cohen sometimes says, well, I only ever committed crimes for within for Donald Trump. Not true. He pled guilty to tax fraud related to hiding $4 million of his own personal income. He pled guilty to bank fraud in relation to multi-million dollar loans related to his bank medallion business. And then this is where it gets really crazy. When he testified earlier this year at the civil fraud trial, he testified, when I pled guilty back in 2018 to tax fraud and bank fraud, I was lying. I was not actually guilty, which led a federal judge to make this finding about Michael Cohen. He said, Michael Cohen's testimony, quote, gives rise to two possibilities. One, Cohen committed perjury when he pled guilty, the first case, or two Cohen committed perjury in his testimony in the civil fraud case. So, there's a lot to unpack there.

It's not the judge, if you think the judge is biased. It's not Alvin Bragg, if he doesn't like Alvin Bragg. It has nothing to do with Joe Biden. It's the 12 jurors who are sitting in that box. And they are 100 percent making the decision about whether or not he's guilty of these crimes.And so in this trial, like every other trial, the very first thing the judge does is he gives an instruction to the jury. And the instruction takes about 30 minutes where he explains the procedures. He explains that a defendant, every defendant, including Donald Trump, is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty, that every single day that he sits in that chair, he is innocent. And you have to not let your biases come in, not let your prejudices come in, and you have to evaluate the evidence and listen to the evidence. He's also telling the jury they are allowed to take notes, but don't let your notes substitute for the transcript, tells them a question without an answer is nothing. So, don't presume anything by a question that's being asked if there's no answer. He explains objections, right? There's sustained or overruled. And he's explaining all the procedures because they're not lawyers, or some of them are, but, typically, they're just everyday people in the community who will be evaluating all of this.
