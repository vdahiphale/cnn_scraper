      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with this breaking news. New York Governor Kathy Hochul now says drone activity in her state forced an airport to be temporarily shut down. For days, waves of reported drone sightings stretching across several states in the northeastern U.S. have been causing fear and frustration. Witnesses say they've seen drones some the size of cars, they say, hovering around residential neighborhoods. Restricted sites and critical infrastructure. But the White House continues to say there's no cause for concern. And at the moment, these drones do not appear to pose a security threat. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is looking into all of this. Gloria, what more are you learning from the governor's comments?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred, even though the White House officials are telling state and local lawmakers they have nothing to worry about, there is a lot of pushback, and now the governor of the state of New York, where many of these sightings have been reported, has issued a statement saying, in part, that there was a disruption to the airspace over an airport in Orange County, New York, yesterday.This is a small, local airport that has a military base not far from it. And she said that the airspace had to be shut down for about an hour after there were reported drone sightings. So, in order to respond, she's calling on the Biden administration to take action, and she specifically is asking for support of a federal bill that would enable local jurisdictions to essentially counter and do something about these drones. That is an area that is currently governed by federal law. So, Governor Hochul, in part, is saying about the bill, this bill would reform legal authorities to counter UAS -- that's an unmanned aircraft system -- and strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones. It would also extend counter-UAS activities to select state and local law enforcement agencies. And she said that the state of New York needs these powers in order to respond to these sightings. Now, it's important to mention that even though the airspace had to be shut down for about an hour at Stewart Airfield, their airport today tells us that there were no impacts to flight operations during the closure. Now, we have reported about these sightings not just here in the New York City metropolitan area, but also in New Jersey, in Connecticut, and in Pennsylvania. This is what the governor there had to say about it. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D), PENNSYLVANIA: We're obviously aware of the drones, and we're taking it seriously. Homeland Security at the federal level is determined, and these are their words, not mine, that they do not pose a national security risk. I've directed Colonel Paris and the Pennsylvania State Police to look into this further. I know they'll be flying helos, they'll be flying helicopters to try and determine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are. We've been conducting exercises. We'll be doing more this evening as well and try and get to the bottom of it here in Pennsylvania. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

While speaking with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last night, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was adamant that his agency has not seen a threat or nefarious activity. He went on to say that the federal government has sent state of the art technology as well as experts to New Jersey to investigate.

But on Wednesday, the couple, they were on their own and they were gunned down in that area of Michoacan. And according to authorities, the brother of Rafael Cardona spoke to officials and said that they were driving the car of his brother-in-law. His brother-in-law is actually a Mexican official there in that area and officials saying that they were driving this van when they were gunned down. Gloria Cardona, she died at the scene while Rafael was taken to the hospital and he was shortly after pronounced dead as well. Again, the children were not with them, thankfully. And officials are trying to piece together exactly what happened here. They have not confirmed the motive, even though we do know that they were driving the van of the government official. And unfortunately, this government official actually took office because of his predecessor had been kidnapped and killed in that area as well. So, again, no motive confirmed for this.

Now, some of that chatter has died down lately, but it's still quite a journey for DeSantis and Trump to get to the point where they are going to be taking in a football game together. His president -- Vice President-elect, J.D. Vance, will be there as well. And Vance invited Daniel Penny to join him at the game. That is the ex-Marine that was acquitted this week on charges of -- related to choking to death an individual on a New York subway. This is a case that the country has been watching very closely.

First of all, she is a former board member of the ACLU here in Northern California, which, of course, is anathema to Republicans. But she was doing it to represent her fellow Sikhs who were facing a lot of xenophobic discrimination after 9/11. That was a couple of decades ago.She also contributed $250 to Kamala Harris's first campaign. She said, you know, in San Francisco, she said you have to pick the most conservative, the more conservative candidate. And in that race, her first race for D.A. Harris was the more conservative. And she was originally not a Trumper. She was more in the Ted Cruz camp. So these are things you probably won't see in the White House biography of Dhillon. But she ran for office a couple of times here in California. She lost. It's very -- it's next to impossible for a Republican to win here. And then, but she -- what she -- how she got on the MAGA radar, the Trump radar, was taking on these cases, as you said, sort of aimed at skewering woke practices in California or -- and so, and she -- so, for example, she took on -- she represented a parent in the South Bay here near San Jose who was concerned that their child -- that the school had not told her that their child wanted to be known by different pronouns and different name. And, you know, and she said she accused the school districts and teachers of brainwashing kids to be transgender. And the school district actually settled that case for $100,000. I think they gave to the family. She also took on U.C. Berkeley and said that they were discriminating against conservative speakers by having them speak in daytime hours and on remote parts of campus. And she again settled. She won maybe 70 grand, I think, it was from U.C. Berkeley. And she also represented -- you see the family of the Hastings -- descendants of the Hastings family used to be called U.C. Hastings Law School. Folks here wanted to change that because of Hastings was involved in racism back in the day, you know, 100 years ago. And so the name change was -- and she represented the family on that one. And she said it was sort of, you know, she was opposing cancel culture in that way. So she is a culture warrior through and through. She is -- I think the things that she's going to face in her confirmation hearing are definitely the transgender issues where she's represented families. And she's also going to face it for her representation of Trump and a lot of the alleged election interference cases, which, of course, there were -- there was no findings of widespread election fraud. But she was representing Trump in a lot of states, Arizona among them. And even she went to dispatch to Arizona this year to sort of prepare for any possible election cases they brought there. So she is very devoted to Trump. She was at a start coming out of a fundraiser at the home of David Sacks, another San Franciscan in the Trump inner circle, whose tax (ph) is going to be his crypto and A.I. is our -- and his house here in Billionaire's Row in San Francisco, where they raised $11 million for Trump. A lot of crypto magnates were there and Harmeet was there. So she is very much in the Trump inner circle now. He definitely trusts her and often speaks very highly of her because she is very smart. She was admitted to Dartmouth when she was 16.",

So, you know, in the past, we've seen the Justice Department advocating for voting rights issues, to expand the ability for voters in the various states and make it more egalitarian. You might see that coming from a conservative perspective. And that's one major way that we'll see some changes. And also on transgender issues where the department previously has been trying to support the rights of transgender youth. And, in particular, that's -- you're going to see it coming from the parental perspective. Or as we -- as Republican conservatives call it here in California, parental rights.
