Right now on CNN THIS MORNING, Donald Trump closing the financial gap with President Biden with a record fundraising haul as he teases a big announcement on abortion this morning.President Biden preparing to bring a student loan relief to a new group of borrowers, plus, bad weather threatening to spoil plans for millions of Americans hoping to get a glimpse of today's solar eclipse. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington D.C., a live look-down at the National Mall, Washington monument and the Lincoln Memorial, good morning, everyone, happy Monday, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. Team Trump claiming they raked in more than $50 million at a Palm Beach, Florida fundraiser Saturday night, that is nearly double what President Biden raised last month at a star-studded New York event featuring former Presidents Clinton and Obama. Trump's campaign has struggled to keep up with Biden's fundraising numbers. The new head of the Republican National Committee, though, Michael Whatley says the former president is solid financially heading into the general election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of them stayed out of the primary, others decided to back some of his opponents. And now, we're seeing this sort of coalesce -- coalescing around Donald Trump.And so that indicates to me that, at the end of the day, these wealthy donors are starting to get behind Donald Trump, even if they have reservations. And so, that's important because it does indicate that he is able to get a lot of money. It's not going to be as much as Joe Biden. His campaign aides have acknowledged that, but there's certainly in a better position than they were a few months ago when they were really struggling with fundraising.",

So, I guess it's no surprise that he's investing in somebody like Donald Trump who is rooting for the economy to crash.

This issue, he has been pushed by many in the pro-life movement to be more definitive about where he stands on a nationwide abortion ban. But on the other hand, he seems to acknowledge that it is -- it has not been a winning issue for Republicans. And he has seemed to go back and forth about whether he wants to do something like this.

And so, this isn't necessarily something that they have been prepping for it seems for a long time. So, I'm curious to see what he ultimately ends up, but I think he recognizes that despite anti-abortion activists really pushing for much stricter restrictions, it's not what the American people want. And so, whatever he does come out with, I think both sides are going to be -- you know, there's no -- it's very difficult despite what he has said publicly to come to a consensus and to come to an agreement on this issue.",

So, regardless, that ends up affecting the candidates who maybe are willing to accept lesser restrictions.

Now, as you mentioned, those storms are really expected to be after the eclipse-viewing, but a lot of those clouds could roll in  ahead of time, and that could end up obscuring that optimal viewing time. But even after that, as people are heading maybe home to where they came from, they may be encountering some of those strong to severe thunderstorms. This is the target area you see here, the green, yellow and orange colors. We can expect large to very large hail. You're talking maybe up to baseball-size hail, damaging winds and also the potential for some isolated tornadoes. So, you can see a lot of those showers and thunderstorms already developing by 3:00 or 4:00, the bulk of them really ramp up after say, 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. But if you're headed, say, back towards Lubbock and Amarillo,   where maybe home is over towards Shreveport in Jackson, Mississippi. You are likely going to encounter some of those storms as you're heading back home after the eclipse. Some other places, again, Dallas specifically, still looking at pretty -- a pretty high amount of clouds for the eclipse-viewing today. Indianapolis going to be a much better spot, those clouds will actually be decreasing as we go through the day. So, once we get to that time of totality, we should only have just a very few amount of clouds in the sky. Niagara Falls also going to be about that 80 percent range for cloud cover, Burlington, Vermont, only of, Kasie, about 20 to 30 percent, much better viewing there.",
