      "sentences": "Well, the details are that he went in for this enlarged prostate procedure a couple of weeks ago. And whilst they were there, they did some tests, and they found a separate cancer during those tests. So this isn't prostate cancer, according to my sources. He has returned from Sandringham, his country house, to London and he is being treated as an outpatient, at home. And he is still carrying on the most senior constitutional duty. So he is doing all that work, which is signing laws, receiving documents from government and potentially appointing prime ministers, the really central parts to the British Constitution that only he can carry out.And if he doesn't carry them out, then the whole system grinds to a halt. I'm told, crucially, that he hasn't appointed what we call counsellors of state. These are members of the family who can step in for him if he becomes incapacitated. For example, having to go through an operation and being put under anaesthetic. So that gives you a sense of the seriousness of this. But they're being very careful, the palace, not to give precise details. They're saying, he does have a right to privacy, ultimately. But the public also has a right to know that their head of state is being treated for something potentially quite serious. So some level of alarm about what's happened and how little we actually know at the same time as the palace trying to temper concerns too widely.   SANCHEZ:   And Max, given the reporting that you've done on the fact that he is not picking counsellors of state, that he is going to continue most of his duties, does it lead you to believe that this isn't a dire situation?",

This is only a handful of people that really have access to that very private medical information. I think right now, it means they're quite confident and he's already talking about getting back to work.But of course, with medical situations, you don't know which way they're going to turn. They say they're not going to give us a running commentary, but they will need to tell us if there's a - if he degrades suddenly or if he has to have an operation or indeed if he gets a lot better as well. I mean, one element that has concerned some people is that I know that he spoke to his siblings and his two sons about this and informed them. Prince Harry is now going to fly over to the U.K. to see him. The bar for that is much higher than it is for the average father and son relationship, because, Prince Harry has been estranged and he hasn't been over that often. And there's a lot of tension, particularly with Prince William. But some tension with King Charles as well, although they have been working towards a level of reconciliation. I think, obviously, they've been in touch a bit. But for him to come over, that's raised some concerns. But all the wording we're getting from the palace is that this is in check and emphasizing the fact that he's actually at home rather than in hospital is one element of that.",

All we know is that it was found when its procedure was done, so all we can assume it has something to do with the urologic tract.",

If it was something that was found on the pathology, then kudos to the individual that looked at the stuff under the microscope.Prostate cancer is a very common cancer that's found in men. Some of the other rare cancers that are found within the prostate don't have the best research done on them because they're actually very rare, and they may not have the best prognosis. But I don't want to alarm anyone. We're kind of making a lot of assumptions here. I know in my own patients, oftentimes I'll go in for the prostate and I'll end up finding something in the bladder, and it may be like a low-grade bladder cancer. All cancers of the urologic tract we know have really good treatments. So if this is something that was found early and incidentally, then hopefully the treatments that he's initiating this week will lead him to have a normal life and a good quality of life as well.",

We're not used to this weather here, moving tarps around.The mayor said Angelenos are just not used to this, and she's right, but she says that we might have to get used to this due to climate change. So what's happening here, all of this water comes from the Pacific. The Pacific is a little warmer than usual because of climate change, so that moisture rises up in the air and becomes an atmospheric river. El Nino right now, that directs that atmospheric river at Southern California, and this storm has basically just stalled over L.A., 14 million people at risk of this extreme high rainfall. We've seen up in the hills, because listen, we've had quite a lot of rain over the past couple of weeks, so the ground here is already saturated. The rest of the city, asphalt, concrete, so this rain that's falling has nowhere else to go but to slide off the surface, and that's why we're seeing some houses actually washed off their foundations up in the Hollywood Hills.

This bill text is not even 24 hours old, and already, based on our whip count that we've done with our Hill team, there are already over 20 senators who are opposed to this package. And remember, they need 60 votes in the Senate in order for this bill to survive a procedural vote. And even if it does, this bill is dead on arrival in the House. Speaker Mike Johnson has been saying for weeks that this is a nonstarter for him and his conference. And just a little bit ago, he explained to reporters why he's opposed to the package. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):   Border Patrol agents, officers, long-time veterans of the agency, and they said you have to fix asylum, you have to fix parole, you have to end the catch and release, the mass release of immigrants around the country, illegals around the country, as has been happening and you have to restore \"Remain in Mexico.\" You also need elements of the wall being built.
