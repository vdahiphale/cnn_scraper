It is - it is embarrassing that a former president would say - even use that kind of language, that he just learned about World War II and - and, you know, his false impressions of how the records of the Soviet Union performed really at the backbone was support from the west and massive casualties that they took.But I think I would say that the - that we would be facing a different kind of disaster. It wouldn't be a complete collapse of the Ukrainians. The fact is that the Europeans are spending more money on Ukraine. They're putting more resources into Ukraine. But they don't have that defense industrial base to really provide the adequate support for Ukraine to gain ground. So, what we'd probably see is a shift to the Russians being more effective in their offensive operations, slowly grinding down the Ukrainian military and making, you know, incremental gains. But that would result in the Europeans recognizing that there is no longer U.S. support, doubling down and providing more aid, including troops. Why? Because they'd have to send a message to Russia that a Russian attack - more Russian aggression against Europe will not be tolerated. And the only way they could do that is by ramping up. They cannot be - they couldn't be weak-kneed at that point because they know that Europe would be the next target. So, it's a recipe for a spillover. And that's what Donald Trump would be creating. He would be creating a larger war. It's a war that's already expanding in different hybrid spaces, including like I said, these cruise missiles, these coastal defense missiles that are being (INAUDIBLE) for the movies (ph). And Donald Trump would oversee that. He would oversee a much more dangerous world that should not be underestimated.

But I do believe, as do most folks here, that Jacky Rosen is indeed running ahead of the ticket. She will be prevailing. Jacky has done a tremendous job for the people in the state of Nevada, and she's being rewarded for that by the numbers in the polls as they are showing. She's leading, again, a top of the ticket.
