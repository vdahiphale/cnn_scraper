And you can see, last night Adam Gray, the Democrat, went ahead as they are counting votes. He is ahead now by 182 votes over the incumbent, Republican John Duarte.Now, Republicans are going to control the House of Representatives, but this is sort of one of the only pieces of good news that Democrats have had in this election process. And it's still going on right now. Unclear whether or not Gray, the Democrat, will maintain this lead. They still have a few thousand votes more to count. But, you know, weeks after the election, when they're still counting, he just inched ahead there. So, what could this all mean? Because it actually has some pretty major implications. CNN's senior data reporter and chief Thanksgiving correspondent, which we'll get to later, which actually is true, Harry Enten, is here.

Joining us right now is Matt Priest. He's the president of - and CEO of Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a leading footwear industry trade group. One that represents dozens of companies that everyone knows, like Nike, DSW, Crocs, Under Armour, Walmart, to name a few. Thanks for coming in, Matt.

So, if you think about a kid's shoe making its way across the border, any time costs go up, whether it's for energy or labor or the tariffs that the U.S. government charges at the border, those costs go up for the consumers. It's an inevitable fact.And so, we even went out and surveyed Trump voters last week and asked them, how are you feeling about tariffs? And they came back and nearly 70 percent of Trump supporters said that they would not support additional tariffs on things like kids shoes. And so, we want to work with the administration to figure out ways to tamp down on inflation. And we will tell the president-elect and his team on day one, raising tariffs is not how you get that done.

It also gauges how Americans are feeling about some of his cabinet picks. The CBS/YouGov poll found that 47 percent of people who are familiar with the candidates think that RFK Jr. is a good choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. That's a better showing than Pete Hegseth for Defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence, and even Marco Rubio for secretary of State. And Marco Rubio not seen as a controversial choice.The idea of such a vocal vaccine cynic leading the country's public health department has alarmed many in the medical community who spent their years - their careers, rather, in public health. It also worries people who have covered Kennedy's anti-vax advocacy for years. Joining us now is Brian Deer, an investigative reporter who has covered the anti-vaccine movement for more than three decades. He's also the author of \"The Doctor Who Fooled the World: Science, Deception, and the War on Vaccines.\" Brian, thank you so much. You wrote an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" and it was titled, \"I'll Never Forget what Kennedy did During Samoa's Measles Outbreak.\" And you wrote in there, \"the consequences of his views and those in his orbit are not merely absurd but tragic.\" What is it about the measles outbreak in Samoa that you think is so important when it comes to RFK Jr., for people to consider? BRIAN DEER, AUTHOR, \"THE DOCTOR WHO FOOLED THE WORLD\": Well, firstly, the important thing to understand is that year, 2019, was a measles year. And there was a tremendous amount of measles around the world. And that was encouraged by Mr. Kennedy and his supporters at the time who were trying to promote fear of vaccines with suggestions that somehow American scientists weren't playing it straight. So, there's that aspect to it. And the way the measles virus then got to Samoa was by transition through New Zealand, Auckland, where there had been the worst measles outbreak in decades. The virus then got on a plane and got into the Pacific islands of Samoa where it caused the deaths of 80 people, overwhelmingly small children. And the thing that really moved me was spending a great deal of time, like, I think almost a whole week of the time I was there simply talking to the parents of children who had died. And it was a deeply, deeply shocking experience because here was an example where you could see very, very clearly the fact that vaccination levels had fallen and the disease just exploited that opportunity. It was like a natural experiment, if you like, of what would happen if measles vaccination wasn't taking place in America or anywhere else.",

And - and he's also made clear that he is not a fan of the now very popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic. He told Fox News that the drug maker was counting on - the drug maker was counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs. Also offering this as a solution. Let me play this for you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F.

He's consistently been an anti-vaccine campaigner going back now for a long, long time, at least 20 years. He's been an anti-vax campaigner. And that's really what he's interested in. So, any questions which really look deeply into his real views and hisreal activity and also the fact that he cannot be relied on to tell the truth. I've found time and again people coming forward and saying, well, I was talking to Robert Kennedy and he said this, and they come out with the most fantastic stuff. One, for example, was Louis Farrakhan, who Mr. Kennedy formed an alliance with. Louis Farrakhan of the nation of Islam, took from his conversation with Mr. Kennedy that the CDC was biologically and genetically altering vaccines in order to kill black and Latino boys. He spoke with Howard Lutnick the other week, and Howard Lutnick said he'd - he'd spent two and a half hours with Mr. Kennedy, and he came away with the idea again that - that - that children were being injured, the autism was linked to vaccines, and the same old Kennedy story.
