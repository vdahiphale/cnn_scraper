The U.S. and China trading sharp words after a close military encounter in the Taiwan Strait. We'll show you the video of a Chinese warship coming dangerously close to a U.S. destroyer.And all eyes on Iowa. A top Republicans storm the campaign trail to chase their presidential ambitions. We'll go to the site of CNN's town hall event with former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley just a few hours from now. Let's begin with this latest spike in the U.S.-China tensions. This video shot by Global News, you see it on the screen right now, shows the Chinese warship cut in front of a U.S. Navy destroyer yesterday. The Pentagon says the two ships came within 150 yards of colliding a razor thin distance for vessels of that size. CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann joins us now. Oren, this is the second close military encounter between the two countries in two weeks. How seriously does the Pentagon view this right now?",

      "sentences": "Jim, incredibly seriously. And it's not just that it is this incident on its own. Is that the Department of Defense and the U.S. view this as a pattern of aggressive coming from China in this military encounters. So, what happened in this latest one?According to U.S. Indo Pacific Command, a U.S. Navy ship was transiting through the Taiwan Strait, sailing through it, very sensitive piece of water for China, along with a Canadian vessel when a Chinese military vessel cut 150 yards in front of the U.S. ship and then circled back and cut again, this time a little farther, 2,000 yards away. But still a very close distance, especially for ships of this size as you pointed out. It is because of the Chinese action that the U.S. went ahead and called this an unsafe maneuver coming from China. But it's an entirely different narrative if you listen to Beijing. For Beijing, whose minister of national defense was speaking just hours after this at a defense summit in Singapore, it was the U.S., he says who wasn't there for innocent reasons and they were there for provocation. So, you see, what is essentially a difficulty in communication here to try to get on the same page. Two entirely different narratives about the same incident. Still, that won't deter the U.S. For the U.S. and under international law, these are international waterways. Commercial shipping, a lot of it goes through the Taiwan Strait as are U.S. Navy vessels and other vessel ass allowed to and that's the point the U.S. is trying to make and does make as it sails through the Taiwan Strait.

And this is why the U.S. views it as a pattern of more aggressive behavior, especially when it comes to two of the areas that are most sensitive for them. That is the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. So, this is just a couple of weeks ago. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, an RC-135 Rivet Joint flying in international air space over the south China sea when a Chinese fighter jet intercepted that aircraft to basically cut in front of its nose, very close at this speed.And in the video, you can see that it's wake turbulence disrupts the flight path essentially and shakes and rattles the U.S. aircraft. So again, the Pentagon is saying it will bring this up to the proper diplomatic channels to address this or at least try to address this with the Chinese. And that is what's important here, is to try to get some sort of communication even though that seems difficult at this point. China essentially trying to exert its influence, perhaps even its sovereignty over both the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.",

But nor now at least, the field is growing certainly and there is considerable enthusiasm among Republicans. That certainly was clear yesterday at a gathering at the Iowa State Fairgrounds where Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst hosted most of the Republican presidential candidates with the exception of Donald Trump who was invited but declined to attend.And these candidates were really making their cases to voters, introducing themselves to voters. Of course, foreign policy is a key topic in this conversation, in this campaign. And Nikki Haley, of course, the former South Carolina governor, but also the former ambassador to the U.N. in the Trump administration, has foreign policy experience. So that is something she often talks about. But yesterday she also talked about how it's important for Republicans to turn the page and look ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's what these long campaigns are all about. Sort of responding to the real-world events.So, I do expect that Nikki Haley will be perhaps questioned about that, either by our own Jake Tapper or by Iowa voters. And I should say that this town hall here at Grandview University will be filled by Iowa Republican voters, people who plan to participate in the Iowa caucus next year that launched this Republican presidential nominating process.

Ambassador, thanks for being with us. I want to talk about the campaign in just a moment, but let's start with these new tensions with China and this near collision between U.S. and Chinese warships. That is quite the provocation. What's your reaction to that? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, I think this is part of a concerted Chinese effort to try and intimidate us and obviously the government of Taiwan. These incidents as you have reported or indicated both on the sea and in the air, are part of a larger Chinese project. I think they're trying to warn the United States about keeping its commitments to Taiwan supplying it with weapons and the like. We saw a similar speech by the Chinese defense minister at the Shangri-La conference this past weekend. And so, I think what this requires is the kind of strategic response that shows that the United States, whether it's in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea or anywhere else, is simply not going to give up its rights to transit the straits, to have innocent passage for its naval vessels and to show to China they're assertion of sovereignty over any part of the world that we don't recognize already as China, something we're simply not going to accept.",

Certainly, there is nothing in the performance of Russian combat arms over the past almost 16 months to give any evidence that they'll do a good job in defending against the Ukrainian attack.And certainly, we've put a lot of effort into training the Ukrainians, but it's a very dangerous period because if the Ukrainians do well, there will be some in Europe who will say, okay, time to stop all of this and negotiate. And if the Ukrainians don't do well, some of the same people will say, look, this has gone on long enough. So, I think managing expectations here is important.

They are all in their 20s and 30s according to the nonprofit group that is taking care of them at the moment.And as you mentioned, part of their journey was going from Texas to New Mexico, and then getting on this private jet to California. Once they got to Sacramento, they were dropped off in front of the diocese of Sacramento, outside of the offices there. And what the attorney general is saying in terms of documentation, is that he believes it could be from Florida. I want to read that statement in terms of exactly what the attorney general says. He says, \"We can confirm these individuals were in possession of documentations purporting to be from the government of the state of Florida.\" And then in that statement, he goes on to say, \"State-sanctioned kidnapping is not public policy choice. It is immoral and it is disgusting.\" Now, we do know that the attorney general is looking at possible civil and criminal action against the people that transported these migrants and also the people that maybe arranged the transport for these migrants. He's looking at who paid for all of this. And he's also looking at whether or not these migrants were misled, were given false promises about coming to California. Now, this nonprofit faith-based group that is currently taking care of the migrants says they will continue to support them and help them in this journey.

But they said we are standing strong and we are going to hold out forwhat we believe we deserve, in terms of what they want with wages, what they want with hours, and how they want residuals and streaming and A.I. to affect them and how they want to see that going forward.

Now, we are told that the fighter jets did not actually shoot this plane down and that the aircraft crashed for unknown reasons.It's not clear, for example, if it violated air space around Washington, D.C., and if that's why the jets went after it. But we are told that they did not actually physically shoot that aircraft down. Now, the U.S. military aircraft did actually caused a sonic boom just because of the speeds that they were traveling at when they were kind of chasing this aircraft. And, you know, we reported earlier that the aircraft that was ultimately downed was a CESNA Citation that crashed in Staunton, Virginia. Now, the sonic boom was so loud that people across Washington, D.C., Virginia, and the surrounding areas actually heard them and we have video of that. (VIDEO PLAYING) So obviously it sounded very, very loud to a lot of residents around D.C. wondering what that could have been. Well, we are now told that it is the direct result of these aircrafts, these fighter jets chasing after this aircraft. And according to the FAA which released a statement about this aircraft that did crash in southwest Virginia. This was an aircraft that took off from Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Tennessee and was bound for Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York. The plane crashed into a mountainous terrain in a sparsely populated area according to the FAA, and we are expecting more information on this from the Pentagon and the FAA shortly, Jim. ACOSTA: And Natasha, I just -- because this is all coming in in the last several minutes here to us at CNN, did you just say a few moments ago that the plane didn't make it very far. It just made it from Tennessee to around Staunton Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley, but did not make it to the Washington, D.C., area, is that correct? If you can walk us through those steps again.",

But it is unclear if it actually made it all the way to New York. However, there was concern because the aircraft was unresponsive. And at that point, when it was kind of hovering near D.C., it's unclear if it actually violated D.C. air space.That is when the fighter jets went and scrambled it. And then ultimately, it is unclear what the exact sequence of events here that led to it crashing. But it did ultimately crash and we are told that that is not because of the jets themselves. They did not shoot it down. So, obviously we still need to wait for more information, Jim.",

So, the scenario that would be envisioned for this, so this is, you know, if, you know, why were they scrambled if it wasn't so close to D.C., is that now we're hearing or we're reporting that the Cessna was unresponsive. So, if that's the case, some air facility, air control tower would have known that, especially if it was flying too low.By that sense, all of these air control facilities are connected, and if they start to get worried that there is a Cessna that's being unresponsive either because it's nefarious or something happened to the pilot, they are going to notify DOD. Now, there's 10 military bases around the D.C. area. We don't know where these scrambled from. Likely Bolling if, you know, to be realistic here. But -- and they would have been scrambled because of the unresponsiveness. Now, once again, to people listening, the unresponsiveness isn't necessarily nefarious. Bad things happen to pilots that are not ill will and we will find out what happened. The fact that the plane went down before it reached D.C. at least to me suggests that -- and that it wasn't shot down, at least to me suggests that this -- something happened in the cockpit that made the pilot unresponsive and the plane just went down. a tragedy, and obviously scary to people in the D.C. area who are not used to these scrambles happening often.",
