This celebrity parade -- it reminds me a lot of what we saw in 2016 with Hillary Clinton at the very end of the race. Obviously, this contest, Harris has been saying all along that she's the underdog. Clinton didn't run her campaign that way. She was widely assumed to be on track to win the presidency back then. But clearly they are trying some of the same tactics that Hillary did in the final days. Will it work?",

It's notable considering Musk is currently a major figure in Donald Trump's campaign and because he works closely with the U.S. government on various space projects. \"The Journal\" reports this, quote: The billionaire's conversations with Putin and Kremlin officials highlight his increasing inclination to stretch beyond business and into geopolitics. He has met several times and talked business with Javier Milei of Argentina as well as former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he defended in an acrimonious online debate. Musk didn't respond to a request for comments and a Kremlin spokesman told \"The Wall Street Journal\", the only communication Musk has had with them was one telephone call where he and Putin discussed space as well as current and future technologies. He said no one from the Kremlin, including Putin, was having regular talks with Musk. According to \"The Journal\", Musk touted having a top secret security clearance at a rally in Pennsylvania last week but a Pentagon spokesman said this to the paper, quote, we do not comment on any individual security clearance, review or status or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual's actions. Joining us now, CNN international anchor Max Foster. Max, good morning to you. Always wonderful to see you. Musk, of course, has become fixture on the campaign trail, but he also, as they lay out, has now become a geopolitical player in many ways and, of course, the work that SpaceX does basically requires a security clearance for somebody like Musk, as you saw there, the Pentagon didn't comment. But what impact does this potentially have, especially as we barrel toward the 2024 election here in the U.S.?",

Some really fascinating questions.Max, I want to ask you about this other story we have this morning, which is an announcement from Canada's Justin Trudeau about immigration to that country and new limits on it. What can you tell us about what they're doing and what it says about the political landscape? FOSTER:  Well, you could look at this as an economic story or political story after the pandemic did open up its borders to some extent, because it had a shortage of workers then started pulling back on that, but there has been a reaction within Canada against immigration, the pressure on housing, the pressure on public services. It's the same story you've seen in so many other parts of the West, and he's had to respond to that, but he is a liberal figure so it goes against the grain to really start to not embrace immigrants. So it is a shift in economic policy, border policy, but also potentially in what he represents presents a big challenge for him, but maybe its part of political survival in a nation which is seeing some of the disadvantages of too much immigration.",

Happy Friday.The main story about this weather forecast is you can pack for summertime conditions because it will be very warm today, especially across the Deep South, 25 record high possible -- record high temperatures possible today and just to put this into context over the next week or so, a good chunk of our country is actually going to feel temperatures above the 80 degree mark. So, yeah, we're in the middle to end of October. It's feeling like early to middle September some of these temperatures here, Atlanta 84 today would be your advertised temperature for September 15. Very similar from Phoenix to Dallas. Remember, Phoenix is headed an extremely hot summer and fall so far. So, for Acela corridor, right here, this is going to remain mild to warm. It heats up the further south you travel, but it will remain dry for this location as well. And this has been the trend for the month of October. In fact, we could go for the first time ever with no who measurable precipitation in the city of Atlanta and New York City, we're working on 25 consecutive days without any kind of rain falling from the sky. We need it because the fire danger is increasing for the Northeast. Remember this is fire season for New Jersey, the month of October is when we typically get this dry stretch of weather but looking forward into the next seven days, there is some relief. A lot of it will start to form across the nation's midsection where they need it the most. Drought continues to creep in across a good majority of the central part of the U.S. Look at that, Atlanta, 25 days bone dry, no rainfall.",
