Earlier today he had a lengthy one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And a short time ago he wrapped up the NATO Summit with a sweeping speech that touted an alliance that is stronger than ever and reassured Ukraine that its fate is tied to NATO.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is in Vilnius, Lithuania for us following all of these developments, how is this speech received, Natasha?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. I think this will be pretty well received by the Ukrainians. Look, the overarching theme of it was unity and support for Ukraine for the long haul. He said that he is with Ukraine and the U.S. is with Ukraine, the NATO is for as long as it takes.And that is something that, of course, the Ukrainians are going to welcome President Zelenskyy appeared to soften his tone today following many meetings with NATO leaders. And I think that President Biden he was not looking to rehash the events of the day when it comes to NATO's - Ukraine's membership in NATO. But he did reaffirm that the U.S. is going to be with Ukraine for the long term here. And so one of the things that he really drove home in this speech as well is just how much Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has backfired. Because as we saw, NATO now has 31 members, soon to be 32, with Sweden joining. NATO's border with Russia has expanded dramatically. Something, obviously, that Putin did not want. And the message here that President Biden reiterated is that this just shows how important the NATO alliance is to the world. Its open door policy, the fact that countries want to join NATO because of the threat that Russia continues to pose globally. And so this will come as a welcome statement for the Ukrainians. But there was one moment in that speech that was really interesting. And that's when Biden kind of slipped up. And he did say there are 33 members of the NATO Alliance at this point, obviously, Ukraine would love that. Ukraine has been calling for it to become the 33rd member of the alliance, but there are only 31 at this point, soon to be 32 with Sweden. But the overarching message of Biden's speech in his remarks today in Vilnius is this message of freedom versus authoritarianism, democracy versus authoritarianism and the fact that freedom he believes is going to prevail. It was a largely optimistic speech and it was set against the backdrop of, of course, Lithuania, which was under Soviet occupation for so long, something that President Biden said that the United States and never recognized. So a very overarching message that was largely optimistic and positive in tone, but also warning the world that, of course, it's fragile. And this is not necessarily something that they can take for granted. Here's just a bit of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

NATO needs a strong Ukraine to essentially keep Russia from coming further into Europe, so that is a significant message from him. But we did see a very much appreciative tone from him today and that was that was different yesterday. I mean, he was going into negotiations.And when you go into negotiations, you got to start with everything you want and he was pushing incredibly hard to get something more definitive and actual invite into NATO. He didn't get that. But what he did get, I think, it's fair to say that Ukraine is closer to joining NATO after this summit than they were before it. And the reason for that is because of these long-term security guarantees that he's getting from these individual countries that are going to span over a long time here. And so reversing that relationship between NATO and Ukraine doesn't seem to be something that any country is interested in doing.",

But we heard from President Biden, you're talking about the fact that Ukraine still needs to take steps on democracy at home, and other things such as corruption in their government.So there's still work to be done. I think they're very far ahead, though, when it comes to the military relationship with NATO. And particularly after these long-term security guarantees that we're seeing come from the G7, because of what those guarantees include. They include air defense, artillery, long range weapons, armored vehicles and intelligence sharing. So when you have so much support in terms of military going into Ukraine, it's pretty assured that this isn't going to be reversed. And I also think it gives credibility to what President Biden said in saying at his final speech there that the NATO alliance isn't going to be backing away from Ukraine anytime soon. The fact that they're stepping up with more support is credibility to those words.",
