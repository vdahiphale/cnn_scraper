Evan Corcoran was hired to help the former president fight charges in the classified documents investigation but instead, he actually became a central witness after Trump allegedly misled him about the whereabouts of the documents over at Mar-a-Lago and encouraged him to lie to the U.S. Justice Department and withhold them. Also, the FBI has released the transcript from a 2022 interview with Walt Nauta, the Trump aide who now faces several obstruction-related charges in this case, not describing the boxes of sensitive documents.CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is joining us right now. Evan, this is all coming just ahead of another hearing today in this case. Update our viewers.",

Let's discuss what's going on with CNN Legal and National Security Analyst Carrie Cordero. She's joining us right now. How concerned, Carrie, should Trump be, Trump, the former president, about the potential for prosecutors to call Evan Corcoran, he's now a former lawyer as a witness?CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, he would probably be a pretty powerful witness. First of all, no lawyer really wants to have to testify against their former client. And so, it's a -- it would be a pretty extraordinary situation. But this case, really the key to it is the obstruction part of it. And that's the part that Evan Corcoran would be best positioned to be able to testify if it comes to that because the fact that he would have information that the president was trying to obstruct -- the former president trying to obstruct the investigation, and his knowledge, it's a really high standard to break the attorney-client privilege. But even attorneys if they are witnesses to evidence of a crime have to comply with the justice system.",

Of the many cases that have been brought against the former president, in my judgment, this New York case is on the weaker end of the cases against him if we compare him to the charges in the January 6 federal case or in the obstruction-related case in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. So, it is going to be very specific, it's going to be a jury trial, and so juries are unpredictable.We don't know which way they will go and whether or not they will go along with the prosecutors' theory that the falsification of records constitutes the significant federal crimes that New York has charged. But these are serious felonies that the New York D.A. has brought against the president -- the former president, and we'll see if -- how it plays out in both the jury selection process and the trial.",

Now, in exchange for that decision, we expect that U.S. prosecutors are going to drop several of the charges that were filed against him back in December. He was facing a number of charges including being an illegal agent of a foreign government, wire fraud, and lying to investigators.Now, it is still unclear exactly how Manuel Rocha helped the Cuban government while he worked at the State Department for over two decades. Prosecutors really did not detail this information in the indictment that was handed up against him in December, though prosecutors did note that Rocha was in conversations with Cuban officials. But then he also had access to top secret information as well as a high level of security clearance considering his role as the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia and the time that he worked at the Cuban Interest Section in Havana, Cuba. Now, it is important to note here that he has never been charged with espionage. Although prosecutors believe that he was acting on behalf of the Cuban government since at least 1981. Again, he was just -- he was arrested back in December, and he is expected to change his plea later today. And then sentencing will take place shortly after, Wolf.",

MARTIN ESTRADA, U.S. ATTORNEY: Mr. Mizuhara used and abused that position of trust in order to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani. WATT (voiceover): Ippei Mizuhara today charged by the Department of Justice with bank fraud which carries a maximum of 30 years behind bars. The biggest question has been how could Mizuhara have allegedly stolen that much money without getting caught. Well, according to the complaint, Mizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account and told all the star's other advisors that Ohtani wanted this one, which held all of his baseball earnings, to be private.

When he won, the money went into his account. When he lost, he covered his debts from Ohtani's. He lost over $40 million in all. This lawyer represents a bookmaker, Ippei Mizuhara used.",
