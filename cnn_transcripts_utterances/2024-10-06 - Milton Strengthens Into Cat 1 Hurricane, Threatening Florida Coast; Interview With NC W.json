We're going to start today with breaking news because yet another hurricane threat is facing Florida's West Coast. Just moments ago, tropical storm Milton became Category 1 Hurricane Milton and could hit Florida as a Category 3 storm in just a few days. Now, Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for 51 counties ahead of Milton and it could bring devastating storm surge to parts of the state still recovering from Hurricane Helene. CNN's Rafael Romo joins me. Now Rafael, Helene slammed into Florida just ten days ago. I know you were on the ground covering some of its devastation. Can you tell us what we're learning now ahead of this potential impact here.",

In addition to declaring a state of emergency in 51 states, you know, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has ordered management sites to be open 24/7, so that many areas covered by debris after Hurricane Helene can be cleared before the arrival of Milton, which is now, as you mentioned, a Category 1 hurricane. More than 800 guardsmen are currently deployed for debris removal but DeSantis said there would soon be up to 4,000 available. Governor DeSantis earlier said that Milton has the potential of causing greater storm surge than Hurricane Helene especially in the Tampa Bay area. That's why DeSantis says this is going to be on all- hands-on deck kind of effort to be as prepared as possible for the storm's arrival. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We have instructed assets currently assisting in North Carolina and Tennessee to return the necessary equipment and personnel home ahead of Milton's landfall.

This happens with 79 percent of our major hurricanes but it's happening even more in recent years as our oceans are warmer. And again, this is that climate factor that we've been watching so closely. Again, when it comes to the forecast, we're looking at it continuing to trek across the Gulf of Mexico. Its impact starts late Tuesday into Wednesday. Landfall looks like it'll be some time on Wednesday. But look at those winds. And again it matters exactly where that eye is. If the storm surge comes up into Tampa Bay or recedes out of Tampa Bay, something that we'll need to watch incredibly closely. Again, regardless of, you know, what category or what type of winds are, you don't need the winds to create the rain. We're talking about several inches of rain -- five to eight inches of rain across the peninsula. Some totals 10 to 12 inches of rain, which will cause flash and urban flooding again across the entire peninsula. You don't need to be on the coast to get the heavy rain, Omar.",

Honestly, everybody lost their jobs. My boyfriend and I don't have work right now. There's so many damages to the house that are not covered by insurance because we would need flood insurance, which we don't have. So I've got a GoFundMe up, donating directly to people, work relief funds like restaurant owners, business owners have funds up, GoFundMe just to help their employees. We -- I mean we need so much right now. We need as far as materials, we need -- we need answers on when we're going to have running water again, because that is a dire situation.

And local organization Beloved Asheville, they are doing so much work on the ground please donate to them as well as directly to people. We have not seen a single Red Cross truck.

Even as they are being directed to this expanded humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi, we have seen that the Israeli military has carried out strikes there as well. Now, as all of this is happening, the Israeli military and its government are also still currently deciding exactly how to retaliate against Iran for that barrage of ballistic missile attacks earlier this week.

He told me that even as the United States has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, that everything quote \"everything is on the table\" as it relates to potential retaliatory actions directed at Iran.

Trump was back in Butler yesterday, the site of his first assassination attempt, and we know this was a lone gunman, but Trump seems to suggest this may have been some sort of conspiracy.

CHARLIE DENT (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, it's not surprising that the former president would go off into another cul-de- sac, while he will make statements set are simply not supported by fact. He just does that. And that's how he is and I would expect nothing less. We know in Butler that appears to be disturbed young man who attempted to assassinate Trump. It was a hideous event obviously, but it was -- it was -- it seemed to be disturbed young man, unlike the case in Florida where the FBI -- the FBI, excuse me, the Secret Service stopped that potential assassination attempt and that individual seemed to be politically motivated based on what we've all read. But don't be surprised by Trump going into these dark places.

I, you know, I always kind of thought there like consolation prizes.Now I might make an exception for Taylor Swift because she is a cultural icon. So she might have an impact. But by and large, I'd say absolutely, there's no real benefit. There's a small number of persuadable voters out there, many of whom are being motivated, we think by economic issues. And so to the extent that candidates can speak to those concerns, all the better. But in the case of Donald Trump, you know, he really has a hard time staying focused on a message and I also caution people in these battleground polls, remember in 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump perform better than the battleground state polls would suggested. Now, also this is the first presidential election post-Dobbs. So in the course, Harris has a lot of energy and momentum behind her. Women are motivated. So anybody could tell you they're going to how they're going to handicap at this thing right now in states like Pennsylvania, I don't think they really know for sure. It is so tight and right now, it's I think it's still a jump ball.",

That's been put on pause based on some court rulings. And like you said, it's coming before the state Supreme Court.So, abortions have resumed in some in some respects here, but I think, you know, doctors are still concerned. I think women are still concerned. I think it's still a salient issue, maybe not as pressing as it was when it was first overturned, but we saw the way that that motivated voters in our state Supreme Court race here. I think it's still motivating voters in the presidential race in the U.S. Senate race. I think it's still very much an issue probably more for Democrats at this point that Republicans, but it's definitely still a salient issue.",
