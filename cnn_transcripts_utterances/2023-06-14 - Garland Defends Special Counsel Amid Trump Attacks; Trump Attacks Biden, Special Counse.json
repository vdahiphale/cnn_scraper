They can do whatever they want. They usually donate them to colleges. They can burn them. They can give them to passers by, whatever. So, he donated them.

Nobody is getting 400 years in this case or 40 years or anything close to it.The way he gets that number is if you take the maximum allowable sentences for all 37 charges in this case and you add them up, it does come out to 400. However, nobody is getting the maximum in a case like this. You have to look at the federal sentencing guidelines, which are influential, the judge has to consider them, but they're not binding. If you run that calculation, this case comes out pretty high, to about 8 to 12 years. Now, the judge can go above that, which seems unlikely to me. The judge can go below that, but, Jake, this seems to me to be no matter what, even if the judge goes below the 8 to 12 year range, it is hard to see a judge going down to probation, to no sentence. So, this seems to me if there is a conviction like it is very likely to be a prison sentence of some sort, maybe not eight to ten or 12 years, definitely not 400 years. TAPPER: Yeah.

One, it's not actually clear from the indictment that there were actual classified documents at Bedminster. There's two incidents referred to in the indictment, where Trump sort of alludes to or refers to or suggests that he has some classified information.But let's remember, the indictment does not actually refer to any documents recovered and a reporting is that DOJ was not able to recover any documents that match up. So, we don't know if DOJ has that or not, but if they don't, we're not going to see additional charges. The other thing is when prosecutors have a related set of charges, you're not supposed to charge them seriatim. You're not supposed to sort of charge one and then wait and maybe hold back the other for strategic advantage. So, I think if they had New Jersey charges based on those Bedminster incidents, they would have charged them altogether.",

That's different than taking classified records out of the White House or any records that are in the official business of the White House. And so, personal records are like diaries and journals and other records that are not circulated, not used for government business. Everything that we know of that are -- that he took with him seemed to be official records and classified records. And so, that's just not what he should do. The case law actually says the opposite. The cases that are cited here, there is D.C. Circuit precedent that says we did not hold that the president could designate any material he wishes as presidential records and thereby exercise virtually complete control over it. So, these claims are just absolutely not what the law is.",

Fred Pleitgen in Ukraine, please stay safe.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed to China this weekend after his original trip in February was scrapped over the Chinese spy balloon incident. Now, Blinken is going to meet with his counterpart in Beijing as new cracks continue to form in the U.S./China relationship. U.S. officials now say they have well-documented proof that China is currently spying on the United States from bases in Cuba, a practice that has been on the U.S. intelligence committee's radar since at least 2019. China and Cuba both vehemently deny the accusations. Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales joins us now. Congressman Gonzales, just so our viewers are aware, you served in Cuba at Guantanamo Bay when you were in the U.S. Navy and you say you used to worry about communist Cuba. Now you worry about communist China. Blinken says the Biden administration is taking a quiet but direct approach to dealing with these spy bases, Chinese spy bases in Cuba. What do you think is the best approach? REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): Yeah, thank you for having me back on, Jake. You know, five years ago today, I was at Guantanamo. And at that time at Guantanamo Bay, and at that time, we were worried about the Chinese. We've had -- honestly, this isn't a new topic. But you've seen them become more and more aggressive. You know, when I was at Guantanamo, we were also worried about the communist Cubans, but it was the iguanas that were everywhere that took a lot of our attention. Times have changed. What does that mean? It means communist China is becoming a more and more of a greater threat to the United States, a direct and clear and present threat to the United States. And it is important that secretary of state Blinken, when he goes to China, when he visits China, it is important he has a conversation, but he lets them know that we're going to be firm in protecting our allies and our assets.",

So I think that's part of what we can do is ensure that Taiwan has a the resources it already -- it needs. And there has been some military aid packages that have already been agreed to, already passed in Congress, and signed by previous presidents that still have not reached Taipei. That's a good start.

VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Good news for consumers, energy prices coming down and that's why you're seeing inflation continuing to drop. So energy prices meaning gasoline, home heating and cooling prices coming down as well. But what is still keeping inflation at 4 percent instead of 2 percent that the Federal Reserve wants to see is shelter, prices for rent still very high. You also have used cars and trucks still expensive. And you have food -- prices at the grocery store after falling for a few months back up. So, bakery goods, vegetables, meat, still high at the grocery store. Good news for egg lovers, a really historic drop, egg prices down 13.8 percent in May. We haven't seen that kind of drop since the 1950s. And that is because earlier in the year, we saw egg prices up 70 percent. That was because of the avian flu and concerns over inventory. So, good news at least on the egg front. But still a little bit of elevation on other key items that Americans are shopping for at the grocery store every day, Jake.",

And experts say that part of that is because Modelo has had really good advertising, great packaging, and they're riding the bump after Cinco de Mayo.
