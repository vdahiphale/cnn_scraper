You were looking at live pictures of the nation's highest court with the first case that could impact the 2024 election begins in just hours. The justices tomorrow morning will hear oral arguments there in an unprecedented case that could help decide the entire election. So Colorado's highest court, the Supreme Court in Colorado, has already ruled that Trump engaged in insurrection and is therefore disqualified from the Colorado ballot, disqualified from holding the highest office in the land. So that ruling removes him from the ballot in the state. This is ruling which just to state the very obvious will have massive impact. And not just in Colorado on the entire country. I mean, Maine is also removed Trump from the ballot, even though attempts to kick Trump off on the ballot at least nine other states have failed. What this could do tomorrow is set a precedent that could spread around the country, even though Colorado alone would make history and change this election. Now, one of the attorneys making Colorado's case, who will be at the Supreme Court tomorrow is my guest in just a moment. And in these final hours before the Supreme Court takes this first Trump election case, we're also waiting to see if Trump will formally appealed to the Supreme Court over whether he is immune from prosecution just because he was president. Twenty-four hours ago, three judges unanimously ruled that Trump does not have immunity from criminal charges against him, which means that the federal January 6th case can proceed, and that will likely have a verdict for election day, which polls at least indicate would dramatically and instantaneously transform this election, this according to polls. Now, let me give you the timeline. Our legal analyst, Ryan Goodman, and his team at Just Security came to this conclusion. They say that the appeals court gave Trump until Monday, February 12th to appeal this decision on immunity. So then the Supreme Court can decide whether or not to take the case and that decision they expect will happen around February 29. If the Supreme Court lets that three ruling stand without review than the January 6 trial could start the beginning of June, and a verdict could come by September 1st. Now, if they review the three court -- the three-judge ruling and as expected up hold it, but they do it through a formal review and they denied Trump immunity that way. Well, then it starts a little bit later. But Ryan, his team still say that trial would start by the end of July with a verdict of guilty or not guilty the week before the election. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT at the Supreme Court to begin our coverage tonight. And, Evan, obviously this is a crucial moment. This is the beginning here of what could be a lot coming before the Supreme Court. What are you expecting?",

Tonight's attack was specifically against militia leadership and the commander from Kataib Hezbollah, who was killed, we're told, according to three U.S. officials, his name was Wisam Mohammed Saber al-Saedi. He was in charge of logistical operations, which includes rockets and drones. Now, notably, Erin, this is causing some diplomatic trouble for the U.S. because the U.S. did not tell Iraq that they were carrying out tonight's strike until afterwards. That's the same thing that happened after Friday night strike. They hadn't told Iraq ahead of time. Iraq has called these strikes inside -- by the U.S., a violation of sovereignty. And earlier, we heard from an Iraqi security official who said that this is new aggression by the United States, saying that this undermines all understandings between Iraq and U.S. Major question, Erin, now is whether these U.S. strikes will deter attacks by these militant groups that have been almost 170 in Iraq and Syria since October -- Erin.",

We're talking about the country where people who are actually telling the truth and up behind bars, and have been treated as spies, foreign agents and traitors, like my husband Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years for so-called treason, for consistently denouncing the crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine, and consistently do not denouncing repression by the Putin regime inside of the country. This is the reality. In 2022 alone, over 200,000 independent online media resources were banned, were blocked by the Russian authorities. And the remaining independent media outlets were closed down and banned. And countless number of journalists were forced to flee the country fearing persecution. And those who stayed behind basically do they work anonymously because they are under constant threat of arrest or forced exile. This is the country that were talking about, where truth is been consistently persecuted by the authorities.

It's also a message to Russians ahead of the Russian election, which is -- which is next month. You know, no surprises about who's going to win that. But one thing that Putin has been trying quite a lot to do during the wars since Western countries sanctioned Russia is to try to show everyone that Russia isn't isolated, that Russia has friends in China and the Global South. So that is what having so many famous American that they can fawn over like Tucker Carlson (INAUDIBLE) Kremlin.",

What matters are facts and the first three years of President Biden's presidency, 8 million people across the southwestern border uninvited, he has not finished the wall, he has not maintained the wall, and we don't even know how many people got over that we're not encountered. So, the border fiasco, the open border is still the Biden problem. In fact, tonight's \"New York Times\" has a story on more on tomorrows paper. The number of aides that have been dispatched by team Biden to Michigan to try and stop an embarrassment up there because he's losing ground in Michigan and Tony Blinken basically backpedalled on support for Israel today.
