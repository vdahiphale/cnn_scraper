We're live with \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell in just a moment. Then, days of power outages. Electricity should be restored in Kyiv within hours, but how long until the lights go dark again? And after months of closed-door talks, the Venezuelan government and opposition agreed to restart negotiations regarding the country's political crisis. We begin today with the World Cup and the hotly anticipated match between the USA and England that ended in stalemate. A scoreless draw over just an hour ago. The match was a tight one. Both teams struggling for clear-cut chances. The draw means England remains in the driver's seat while team USA face a must-win match against Iran after the team defeated Wales earlier Friday. Let's bring in \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell who is live for us in Doha tonight. And, Don, credits to United States to remain unbeaten against England in the World Cup. But, Don, that was a pretty underwhelming performance for England, wasn't, who are obviously the heavy favorites",

And I think this game got to a point where both sides were kind of happy withdrawal. But I would say certainly the USA acquitted themselves very well. They had some really good chances in the first half. If we can see some of the highlights here, we will show you a couple of them. Of course, a lot of Americans players are actually very familiar with England's team, many of them played in the Premier League. So these guys all know what each other is about. Weston McKinney doing very well. Guiding that shot there. But Christian Pulisic, who is arguably the biggest star in the American team, he rounded across in the first half. England had a chance towards the end of the half, Mason mount John a good save out of matt turner, and then towards the end the England team carried live off of a free kick. And so that was that, honours even. It means that England are pretty much good I would say for the -- they have done pretty much everything that they need to do already. They just have to avoid a heavy defeat for Wales. For the USA, it is very simple. It really is winner go home in their final game against Iran. By the way, if you like your World Cup history, you'll remember that Iran beat the U.S. back in 1998 at the France World Cup. So, this one could go either way. Around looked really good today against Wales so that will be a tough game for the United States but at least it is in their own hands.",

They weren't too happy about speaking to the media that because obviously they felt like they were being watched. And it seems to have now escalated in the second game. We definitely had fans having issues with the protests t-shirts, we had a fan inside the stadium who was photographed with a Mahsa Amini image and there are now images of her being led out of the stadium, reports of other fans being detained and taken to police stations. We are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly what happened but this clearly is a very worrying escalation for football fans who are coming to these games. Of course, Iran is not very far away from catch our. It is just on the other side the Persian Gulf. And these fans are now warning about their safety and security at this World Cup tournament.",

They have said all along that theybelieve everybody should be free to attend these matches and everybody should be safe while they are visiting Qatar. That has always been FIFA's position. The interpretation of the local Qatari authorities sometimes seems to have been a little bit different. We saw it with the rainbow t-shirts and the rainbow hats where some fans and journalists were trying to get into games and meeting some pretty stiff resistance being detained for 30 5:40 minutes, some of them reporting that they were spoken to pretty harshly. So that is certainly not what FIFA wants to happen. On the rainbow flag on the \"OneLove\" issue, FIFA says that they have communicated with all of the local security and things should be resolves now. But I would say the still remains a very fluid situation and there are certainly some fans here wondering just how safe they really are in Qatari.",

And for the secondstraight day, China reported its highest number of new COVID cases since the start of the pandemic, reporting more than 30,000 new cases. And authorities are responding with more lockdowns, mass testing, and quarantine. And people here are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to that anger is a fire that broke out in Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building. Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fires sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos, which have now been censored in China, show that COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building. However, videos show fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents, and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The video shows flock and smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building with the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died of the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. This tragedy really struck a chord with the public here because the scenes of suffering and tragedy have played out over an over again since the start of the pandemic. So many stories of people struggling to get food, necessities, an emergency care and lockdown. Three years into these harsh policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into protests, which are normally rare and authoritarian China. So, last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. And then there were violent clashes as the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still, there is no end in sight to zero COVID. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is now a place where over 80 percent of the population still lives below the poverty line. Over 7 million people have left the country in recent years to try to find better fortunes abroad. And 7 million is almost a quarter of the entire Venezuelan population. I think both sides have realized after a year or so of uprising that they can't find a solution on their own. In fact, as the two delegations are traveling to Mexico City at this hour to hold talks tomorrow. We are expecting the government delegation to arrive in Mexico City in the next 60 minutes or so. The most talked about aspect of the negotiations is the creation of this international fund to address the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. It's worth about $3 billion U.S. dollars. Three billion is a heavy sauna for a country in dire straits like Venezuela. On top of that, of course, as you said, the international pressure with countries all around the reason, Columbia, Mexico, Argentina, all applying pressure to try to convince the two parties to go back together. And, of course, the U.S. which, for example, this summer freed to personal relatives of strong man leader Nicholas Maduro who were serving a sentence for drug trafficking in the U.S. Those were free to exchange for the releases of several U.S. citizens still detained in Venezuela. That has created a positive climate which now allows the two parties to sit at the same table, and, hopefully, find a solution to a crisis that has lasted seven years now -- Christina.",
