Look, I think the first thing is that this is what it looks like to have an independent Department of Justice and a president who is cooperating with, not obstructing an investigation. Second, I think that it is - there are a lot of facts that have to emerge and what occurs to me is we really need to have the intelligence community look at the bigger process by which documents get taken out of secure locations. I mean, this is something that I've been listening to some of the analysts who say that this happens often, it happens routinely. I don't think it should. And so I do think that there needs to be a bigger look at how this happens.

They were marked top secret.But the storage and the approach to this is completely different. That doesn't mean that there isn't a problem here and certainly there's a political problem for all of us as Democrats. But I do think that there are significant differences and I do think it's important to look at the fact that this President is cooperating completely with the investigation. He is not obstructing. He is not saying that this is a witch hunt. He is not doing any of those things. In fact, it is his Department of Justice that has appointed a special counsel who was appointed under Trump and who Republicans - and who was confirmed unanimously in the Senate and who Republicans and Democrats both respects. So there are significant differences. It doesn't take away my concern about the overall situation and I do think we have to continue to look at the facts.",

I'm used to that. I'm on the Judiciary Committee. I've seen it over and over again, when there's nothing to talk about. And you give them a little piece of information like this.

But I mean, I do think we have a responsibility to the facts here, which is just to point out that there are really significant differences in the handling of these two cases by former President Trump and by now President Biden.And those significant differences matter when it comes to the legalities of it all. And beyond that, I mean, I did listen to Speaker McCarthy's comments this morning and some of the things that he said about how this was handled, certainly, were just not true. I mean, the archives at the DOJ spent months and months working with the Trump team to get those documents back. And it ended in a search of Mar-A-Lago because the Trump team wasn't playing ball. That is not at all what happened here, even now that we found an additional batch of documents. So politics obviously, sometimes can be the lack of nuance. I don't think we necessarily have to play that game. However, I do think the reality of it is, is that if you're Biden and you want to draw a clear contrast in how classified documents were handled, full stop, this makes that harder.

Santos said he earned a 3.89 GPA from Baruch College and graduated at the top 1 percent of his class. Well, he never even went there. He said he earned an MBA from NYU, again, never attended that university. Santos said he was an asset manager at Citigroup. He never worked there.
