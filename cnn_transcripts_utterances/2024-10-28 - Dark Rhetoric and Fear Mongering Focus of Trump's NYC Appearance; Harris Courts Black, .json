More than 40 million people have already cast their ballots, with early voting underway in most states. CNN's latest national polling average shows little to no daylight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And it's a busy week ahead for both candidates as the campaigns blitz across the handful of battleground states expected to decide this election. On Sunday, thousands of people queued up outside New York's storied Madison Square Garden for a Trump campaign rally. The gathering featured a slate of Trump loyalists and included racist, profane attacks against Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, other Democratic leaders, and even the island of Puerto Rico. In a rare campaign appearance, Melania Trump introduced her husband to the crowd. During his disjointed and, as usual, meandering speech, the former president used dark rhetoric and invoked fear when talking about Democrats, women and immigrants; and made a slew of false claims or outright lies about his opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens. There has never been anything like it anywhere in the world for any country. (END VIDEO CLIP) M. HOLMES: It was quite something, Trump painting a bleak and frequently dishonest picture of the U.S. Our Kristen Holmes was there and has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In many ways, the question about the final days of this election is going to be what is the question?You heard Trump's attempt, almost in passing, to point toward the question that most Republicans want voters to be asking: are you better off than you were four years ago? Because most people will say no. I mean, there's a lot of frustration with the Biden economy. He's had a lot of accomplishments, but they've been overshadowed by inflation. And that, in particular, is opening the door for Trump with a lot of working -- you know, working families that are living paycheck to paycheck, including those in the minority community. But that isn't necessarily the question we'll be asking in the final days. The other question is: is it too much of a risk to restore to power this Donald Trump, who is talking so overtly in xenophobic, racist, and authoritarian language? And that rally tonight, you know, was a kind of -- potentially, a crystallizing moment for this small number of voters that we are talking about that are still in play, particularly in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, maybe Georgia, who are being reminded constantly that reelecting Trump entails more than potentially lower prices for groceries and gas. There's a lot more that goes with it. And tonight was a kind of peel- the-mask-back moment to remind everyone, really, of exactly all that is involved there. M.

Egypt, which has long played a key role as a mediator in ceasefire talks, is proposing to start with a limited deal and go from there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In Egypt during the past few days, efforts have been made to move the situation towards a two-day ceasefire, during which four hostages would be exchanged for some prisoners held in Israeli jails. Then, over the next ten days, negotiations would proceed to complete measures in the area, or to reach a full ceasefire and allow aid to enter. We affirm that our brothers in the Gaza Strip are facing an extremely difficult siege, reaching the point of starvation. And it is crucial that aid enters as quickly as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP) M.

Gaza's civil defense says several people were killed in a place where hundreds of displaced people are sheltering. This as the conflict in Lebanon rages on, as well. CNN's Jim Sciutto reports from Jerusalem.

Not all of those warplanes, but some of them. And that shows a significant Israeli capability to strike far away at Iran, hundreds of miles away. An operation that requires refueling in the air for many of these fighters. But also, in the course of it, to take out Iranian air defenses. And in this case, reach Iranian airspace.

But, you know, when it comes down to it, for every North Korean soldier on the ground, that frees up another Russian who might be involved in some type of logistics or a security type of a role to go out to the front. And so, we shouldn't discount the -- the impact that having these extra 5,000, 10,000 bodies will have on the war. But I don't think it will be a major game changer. M. HOLMES: Right.

We know missiles have gotten in there.And in exchange for this type of material assistance to the conflict, Russia was going to provide help in the areas of WMD program, missile -- missile technology, space program, as well as conventional weapons systems: ground, air, and maritime. And also, in terms of bringing -- modernizing North Korean munitions production capabilities to help support their war effort. And so, the benefits that Kim would be getting in terms of these advanced technologies from Russia, obviously, the cash and, of course, the international prestige of being seen as a major player, being asked to do a favor for a like-minded partner. This will translate into what Kim hopes, I think, is political and diplomatic capital down the road. M. HOLMES: Yes, fascinating.
