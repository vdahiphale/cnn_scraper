They do it under the cover of tank fire, just as we've heard this evening. We've seen that play out on previous evenings.And what they intend to do when they get there? Limited incursion or do they plan to hold territory and stay there for a while? Betanoon (ph) is just across the border from us here, about 2.5 miles from where we stand. 2014, that was the first target of the IDF incursion into Gaza. Back then, and the aim was to take control of the town and the IDF took control of neighborhoods of that town. We are being told that the big incursion here when it comes, will be on a scale and scope bigger because the IDF fully intends to take out Hamas, take out their tunnel infrastructures, take out their command infrastructures, their commanders, and the mechanisms by which they communicate. The phone systems, the rocket launches, all of these things are on the target list for the IDF when they go in. Precisely how they plan to achieve it and precisely how they hope, as they say they will, that they will keep down civilian casualties, which continue to grow through today, through the past several weeks, and that was one of the points of pressure at those, the peace talks that were underway in Doha about the hostages. At this moment, on this night, it is hard for us to say, standing here precisely what's happening on the ground. But the barrage of artillery fire and tank fire that we heard before, sustained close to this location really gave the impression of a military action in progress.",

We need to push Egypt, frankly, to open up that crossing to provide refuge and humanitarian supplies and basic needs to the Palestinians.And we need some time to make sure that this doesn't spill over into a regional conflict. I'm extremely concerned about Iran entering into the the conflict even more so than it already has by supporting proxies like Hamas. I mean, they could directly enter the conflict. The same with Lebanon and Hezbollah. The risk has never been higher, certainly in my lifetime, for a broader regional conflict. And we need some time to get our arms around that issue and prevent even larger, more devastating regional conflict.",

We're hearing the fighter jets, hearing explosions, some of them very heavy behind us here right now.Also, we just saw a flash on the skyline. Didn't hear an explosion from that, which indicates it could be some distance away from us. But if we had a sense here a few minutes ago that the intense bombardment of earlier might have been easing off, I think the last two minutes here while you have been talking to the congressman, it has really picked up and intensified again. I think it will do this for some time the fluctuation. I can hear guns artillery firing out from this direction. Possibly we'll hear the impacts in Gaza behind us. But some of the impacts have been exceptionally loud, exceptionally strong. You can feel them shaking the ground here. Not clear precisely what the targets are, other than Hamas and its infrastructure. Not quite clear how the rest of the night will roll out.

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, just like Nic, I mean, we are here -- we heard earlier in the day that there was perhaps some progress in these hostage negotiations. But now, what we are hearing are the sounds of war, the most intense bombing, at least in terms of what I can hear from my position here in Ashkelon, that I have heard in the nearly three weeks that I have been here covering this war.We are hearing intense and repetitive percussive thuds, bombing, artillery also clearly going out. And what we're also seeing is Hamas responding with at least two rocket barrages towards central Israel as well as right here towards Ashkelon within the last 20, 30 minutes or so. So this is certainly taking on a different tone and tenor from here. It's hard to say if this is the beginning of that invasion that we have been expecting from the IDF, that they have made clear that will be happening at some point. You know, we know, Dana, that in recent days, Israeli officials had clearly told the Americans that they were willing to give them a few days to see how these hostage negotiations developed. And while we don't know officially whether those talks have completely collapsed, what is clear is that Israeli officials were not going to wait indefinitely in order to move forward with their ground campaign. Again, we don't know whether that is what we are starting to see on the ground, but what we are seeing is certainly an intensification of strikes on Gaza. There are also reports of telecommunications being out in Gaza. And in addition to that, we know that in recent days, we have seen a stepped up pace, not only of the airstrikes, not only of the targeting of those Hamas tunnels underneath Gaza, but also increasing raids inside of Gaza. At least over the last two nights, there have been tanks going into Gaza to carry out targeted raids as the IDF describes them to take out some of those tunnels, to take out some of Hamas's infrastructure. And what we also saw last night was the Flotilla 13, which is Israel's equivalent of the Navy SEALs going into southern Gaza via the sea and carrying out a raid there as well. All of that in the lead up to what we are now hearing, Dana, which again is a very serious intensification of airstrikes, much louder bombing than we have heard perhaps in these nearly three weeks of this war.",

What are your -- I just want you to kind of expand on what the general just said about the potential for this being preparatory, but also probably not that far ahead of this ground incursion that the prime minister himself has been telegraphing for quite some time.",

But I also don't think we can overlook the possibility, although it seems stretched at the moment, but the possibility this military action is a big push to try to push along the negotiations about the hostages to -- from an Israeli perspective, to signal to Hamas, you'd have no room for maneuver. We are not about to back down. These are our actions. You're seeing our actions. You're feeling our actions. You're hearing our actions. The next move is on your part. You need to concede something.

Now, we just don't know the answer to that. But also, as -- you answer this question, I want to remind people where we are and how we got here. And we are almost three weeks to the day when the Hamas terrorists came into Israel and butchered innocent civilians, more than a thousand of them. And maybe part of the disagreement inside the War Cabinet, inside the Israeli government, is because it's this combination of anger and pressure and guilt, but also understanding that you need a strategy beyond just wanting to get rid of the Hamas terrorists.

On the one hand, you have the families of these hostages who are naturally demanding that they'd be freed and demanding that the Israeli government make getting them out of Gaza a priority over any other factor.And at the same time, you also have a really, you know, strong sentiment here in Israel that these shocking attacks carried out by Hamas must be the last ones, and that the Israeli military must do something to take Hamas out of the equation entirely. And so, the Israeli Prime Minister is facing those, you know, converging political factors as he weighs this decision making. And at the same time, even though we have heard a lot of bellicose rhetoric from Bibi Netanyahu over the years, he has tended to be a fairly cautious politician, especially when it comes to matters of war. And -- but what is also interesting is that he's now part of a unity, you know, an emergency government, War Cabinet, with his former political opponents Benny Gantz, who has been extremely hawkish on matters of Gaza --",
