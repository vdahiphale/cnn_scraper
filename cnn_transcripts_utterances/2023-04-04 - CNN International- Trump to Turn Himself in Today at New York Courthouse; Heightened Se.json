But we won't know what those charges are until the indictment is unsealed in court. Trump is expected to voluntarily surrender to authorities at a Manhattan court. But his arraignment will not be broadcast live. The judge in the case has turned down the media's request for cameras, but he will allow some photographers to take still pictures before the arraignment begins. FOSTERunclear if he'll have a mug shot taken due to concerns that it might be leaked, and the former president isn't expected to be handcuffed. More from Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump has seen it all and done it all, including run for the White House from here in Trump Tower in New York. But on Tuesday morning, he does something new. Faces a judge for an indictment and an arraignment in a felony case here in New York City for an old hush money case involving Stormy Daniels. Of course, this was litigated during his first presidential run back in 2016, but now the Manhattan district attorney has brought this up again, and a grand jury last week indicted the former president. This will all come to a head really the first time in a historic moment, whereas former American president faces an arraignment in a criminal court. Now I'm told that the former president was huddling with his advisers as after he arrived here in New York City after flying up for Mar-a- Lago on Monday. Meeting with his lawyers and his political team as well. He is not expected to speak on Tuesday here in New York. He's going to save his remarks -- I am told -- for on Tuesday evening at Mar-a-Lago when he plans to deliver a full-throated defense of this case, as well as other cases before him. But now this legal case is front and center in the 2024 presidential race. It is essentially brought this early stages of the campaign to a halt. He's raised some $7 million in the last few days alone, with his supporters coming to his defense, even his rivals have been standing on the sidelines, essentially defending him and watching this case unfold. But there is no doubt on Tuesday morning when the former president arrives at the district attorney's office and later goes into a courtroom. He is facing an uncharted territory, something he has never done before. In his long years of entertainment and political life here. He's standing in front of a courtroom in which he has very little control over. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

McCarthy will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to meet a Taiwanese leader on American soil. This meeting is guaranteed to further inflame an already fractured relationship between the U.S. and China. Beijing last week threatened to, quote, resolutely fight back if this meeting goes ahead. Now Tsai has been in Central America for an official visit to Guatemala and Belize. During her stopover in New York last week, she said that Taiwan's relationship with the U.S. has never been closer. China believes as we know that Taiwan belongs to China. It's refused to rule out the use of military force to bring Taiwan under Beijing's rule. And while the U.S. acknowledges China's position and has never officially recognized Beijing's claim to the island. Interestingly, the White House has declined to weigh in on Wednesday's meeting. And as you remember when former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year, China responded by firing ballistic missiles over Taiwan, deploying warships in the Taiwan straits and conducting a simulated blockade of the island.
