Cohen is, of course, Trump's ex-attorney and x fixer, who once said he'd take a bullet for his former boss. Prosecutors hope he can directly connect Trump to the $130,000 payment to former adult film star Stormy Daniels. She is at the center of this case. The judge had to warn Cohen on Friday to stop trolling Trump online. Something he has been doing quite a bit of.
