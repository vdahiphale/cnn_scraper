They walked ahead of the former president on the golf course, and they saw this guy with a rifle poking through the fence.You know, it's not the first-time people have poked through the fence. Usually it's with cameras, though, not with rifles, because there are a lot of onlookers. It's a huge, sprawling property with a lot of shrubbery. It's not like Mar-a-Lago, which is bordered on one side by water. This is in the City of West Palm Beach. It's really hard to close down the roads. And remember, he's an ex-president, not the current president. So, he has any Secret Service detail that's been stepped up since the first attempted assassination. But unless you're going to put like many more officers on the ground and start scoping out every place around this huge property, you know, you're going to have to depend on Secret Service to do what they did here, and they succeeded. So, I thought this was not a failure with Congress on this one. I think they should get a lot of praise for the way that the Secret Service handled this.",

And, Dave, I remember from my days covering Trump at the White House that I believe this golf course was one of those places where news photographers could even stick the cameras through the bushes and get footage of Donald Trump out there on the golf course.Does the golf course need to put up a wall or something to sort of harden the security there? Is there more that could be done from that standpoint? ARONBERG:  Yes, that could be a benefit. But, you know, how it is with walls, Trump would probably try to ask Mexico to pay for it. But eventually, if it does happen, it'll take some time and it could ruin the aesthetics. But, you know, that is something that they may have to consider because it's not totally realistic to have Secret Service people continually monitoring every bit of that property afterwards, especially after the election. Now, right now, perhaps that is a good idea because of the heightened threats out there. We're getting close to the election. But as far as whether Secret Service had a failure, no, I'd say no, unless you want to put many more millions of dollars into having a much larger Secret Service detail wherever he goes at all times.",

You know, he's trying to get Elon Musk to send him rockets, and he's recruiting Afghan soldiers to go fight in Ukraine. He was seen as a bit of a kook.Now, that doesn't mean he can get away with an insanity defense, Jim, because he'd have to prove he didn't know the difference between right and wrong. And when he fled right after he was caught, that shows he knew what he did was wrong and illegal. So, that's going to be hard for him to do. But this is what it seems to me, it looked like he acted alone. He did not get any shots off. There were no shells outside from his side. The only shots that happened came from the Secret Service. It's just a guy who just has a problem mentally, although not enough, in my mind, to claim an insanity defense.",

JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Kamala Harris used two separate programs, mass parole and temporary protective status. She used two programs to wave a wand to say, we're not going to deport those people here. Well, if Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call him an illegal alien.

Can you talk about the impact that it's having on communities across the country in a compassionate, empathetic way? You can. Resources are not unlimited. A lot of these counties and cities and municipalities are having issues with employers trying to find it -- find -- try to find workers. But why is that?

They don't care that this could result in somebody getting hurt. Relatedly, did you know that election workers across the country are being given panic buttons, active shooter training, bulletproof glass, fortified fencing, badges, magnetometers. I mean, this is America, and there's only one reason why any of that is happening around our elections, because of a lie that Donald Trump keeps telling.

That's a question that municipalities have to figure out. State governments have to figure that out. How much funding do they need? Can the states redirect funds? And if they don't have those funds, then what role should the federal government play in making sure those places that are attracting immigrants into their areas have the funding they need so that they have translators, more educators, so that they can build up the local infrastructure, housing, healthcare?
