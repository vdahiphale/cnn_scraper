And as you said, acting as a foreign agent for the government of Egypt. Now, once this jury gets this case, they'll have to digest everything that they heard, as well as go through these 18 charges. Senator Menendez is facing 16 of them. It's a complicated case, and they don't have it just yet. But once they do, then they'll be able to begin their deliberations. It's really anyone's guess how long it could take them to go through that, whether they think the government has proven its case or whether it's going to take some time for them to work through each of these charges. Remember, it's a jury of 12 people. They have to have a unanimous verdict. So we'll -- once this does get underway, then we'll be able to start the clock and see how long this is going to take. But a lot is at stake for the senator. You know, he had stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but as you know, he is still on that committee.

I said to -- I asked someone, well, wouldn't you like to see Harris ascend to the top of the ticket? They're like, well, she's already on the ticket. And that suffices. Younger black voters, you hear something different. They are more eager and willing to sort of see this shake up. But they think that President Biden should arrive at this decision on his own. I don't really see so much that they want to push Biden aside or cast him aside. So this time and time again has clearly emerged as his most loyal voting bloc. And I think it's so important to listen to black voters and it's so instructive because they're the ones that ultimately, as the reason why President Biden is president right now, right? It was that South Carolina primary. It was black voters that, in his own words, he says, brought him to the dance.

We've been seeing polling now, whether it's in the individual states or national polling showing Donald Trump getting anywhere from 15 and all the way up to 30 percent of the black vote, which would be historic if he were seeing these numbers. Now it's sort of averaging around 20 percent. Again, we haven't seen anything like that in recent history of a Republican getting that strong a share of the vote. And these were decisions made. But, again, this is all pre-debate. This is all pre the talk of him being -- no longer being the nominee. And it's really driven I think a lot by need for change, shaking that up and the economy and Latino voters the same. There's a reason that Nevada has been just so difficult for the Biden team to kind of get back into the blue category. It's been there for years and years and years.
