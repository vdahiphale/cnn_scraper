Despite that, national security officials across North America remained on alert for more of these. And let's begin there. CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand here with the latest. Natasha, what are we learning about the latest objects shot down, and I'm curious why they're seeing more of them, right? Are they looking more closely, it seems?",

The ones over Alaska and Northern Canada, we are told that they were balloon- like, they had features that were very similar to a balloon. And they also had small cylindrical, metal payloads attached to them.Now obviously we don't know whether these actually were balloons because that is the extent of the details we were given. But with the one that was shot down over Lake Huron in Michigan, that one is a little bit different. It was described as octagonal with strings attached to it, and it had potential surveillance capabilities according to the Defense Department. So very little it still known about where these objects came from, whether they're owned by a nation state or a private company. But the U.S. government says that they're going to be analyzing the wreckage and the debris and hopefully they'll be able to learn more.",

They're going to be by landline or even buried underground, so I don't think it posed much of an intrinsic threat.

But there are also 18 House Republicans from districts that Biden carried and almost another 20 from districts that Trump carried by five points or less, from much more competitive terrain.They theoretically have as much influence as the right does. McCarthy's calculation so far I think has been to concede pretty much whatever the right is demanding and expect those from more competitive districts to fall in line in the end.
