And our resources are on the ground, turning over every stone.There will not be a rock big enough for them to hide. This was an act of cowardice to come at a time when people are celebrating the oncoming of the new year, to get ready for a major football game with people traveling from all over the country. This was something that was timed. This person apparently traveled in a rented vehicle from Texas, sought and found a opening and went around police vehicles, jumped the sidewalk, gained speed, and sped into a crowd of revelers, a complete act of cowardice and one that we will demonstrate every energy we have to find them.",

And that reaction came after he had also released a statement. I'm going to read part of that statement to you.He said, quote: I am grateful for the brave and swift response of local law enforcement in preventing even greater death and injury. It goes on to say that there is no justification for violence of any kind and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities. Now, as you just mentioned, he has been working the phones. He has been talking to senior officials, being briefed by senior officials over the course of the day. That includes the DHS, with the NSC, with the FBI. He is now currently at Camp David. That was always going to be a stop on his way back to the White House from Wilmington, Delaware, where he spent New Year's Eve. And we are expecting to hear more from him today. He said when he spoke to reporters earlier that he would share more as soon as he himself learned more details about this attack. So we're waiting to see when he would deliver those remarks. But certainly the day has been spent, according to sources, getting these briefings and also talking to officials at the state and local level to, again, try to reinforce the message that we've heard repeatedly from the federal government, that they will be putting all their resources behind learning more about this attack.",

Now, it is interesting he posted on True Social, something that we now know in part seems to be untrue.The first part of it essentially kind of indicating that this person was somebody who had crossed the border illegally, saying that criminals coming in were more dangerous than the criminals in our country. We obviously have reported that the person who perpetrated this crime was an American citizen. So that part is not true. But then he goes on to say: Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones, including the brave officers of the New Orleans Police Department. The Trump administration will fully support the city of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil. Obviously, look, this is very important to Donald Trump and his team. We are just days away from him becoming the president. And as we have watched this unfold with more and more information, he needs to be kept up to speed on this.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, this is a tragic incident and that's been reported throughout today. And I'm joining with everyone and sending prayers and sympathies for those who are victimized by this. So let me offer these thoughts.First of all, the city should immediately conduct a fast, quick and comprehensive assessment of all of its safety protocols around the French Quarter and around the heavily trafficked areas to determine exactly what went wrong with an eye to not casting blame in as much as tightening, strengthening and fortifying the security protocols around the Vieux Carre, the French Quarter and the downtown area where people by the millions visit New Orleans each and every year. I think that's crucially important in this instance. I think number two, those who are watching who are not in New Orleans should understand that a terrorist attack of this type could happen in any American city, in any American shopping, in any American downtown community. And it is so crucial and critical at this point that everyone understand and assess and reevaluate their security protocols so we can balance appropriate security with our right to be free and unfettered by fee. Number three, I think it's good to see the mayor, the governor, the members of the Senate, the members of the House from New Orleans standing together, notwithstanding that some are Democrats, some are Republicans. They may not be on the same page with respect to many public policy issues. And I hope they will remain together and that people refrain from rhetoric that is designed to score political points and is, in fact, divisive. So what do we know? Some early suggestions were that this was an immigrant or someone who had entered the country illegally. We know that was a falsity, that this appears to be an American citizen who was somehow radicalized into doing something heinous and hateful. We need to learn what is radicalizing American citizens, what is impacting them to take not their thoughts and their views to the -- if you will, the institutions of democracy, which are peaceful, but to resort to the violence of the type that we have seen.",

That's what we heard from the FBI. So certainly we do want to get to the bottom of radicalization, but that is a problem that we have seen for years and that you've seen law enforcement struggle with, which is why fortifying these soft targets is essential. But also of the most acute nature right now in New Orleans is who are these additional potential perpetrators?
