It says. No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress or elector of president and vice president or hold any office civil or military under the United States or under any state who having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer of the United States or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or judicial officer of any state to support the Constitution of the United States shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. With me now is Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. Thank you so much for being with us. You say you are watching these court proceedings that are underway right now. For a kind of guidance, what do you mean? JENA GRISWOLD, (D) SECRETARY OF STATE, COLORADO: That's right. And good morning, John. We are hoping that this court case gives guidance to the state of Colorado, to myself in certifying the ballot, but also guidance to election officials across the nation. We've never had this type of situation occur where a sitting president incites the insurrection and then has the audacity to run again. So, there are real questions about whether Section Three of the 14th Amendment disqualifies him. And I look forward to the judge giving guidance on that topic.",

We should as a nation follow the rule of law. We should be following what the Constitution says and what state laws say. And if there's something unclear, it's an appropriate mechanism to file a lawsuit.

But I think given the situation we're looking at, it's clear that they're not entirely successful in doing so since October 17. So, 10 days after the Hamas terror attack in Israel, the U.S. has tracked a total of 23 attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria.Now, although they haven't given specific attribution individually for each of these attacks, the U.S., broadly speaking, holds Iranian- backed groups and groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for those attacks. What's important to note here is that the U.S. carried out strikes in eastern Syria, a pair of them on facilities they say, are used by groups affiliated with Iran in an attempt to first deter those groups from continuing to attack U.S. forces in the region, but also as a broader message to Iran. And you can see here with at least six more attacks since the U.S. carried out those strikes, that message of deterrence certainly hasn't had yet its intended effect. And that opens up the question, will the U.S. carry out more strikes? Is that better at getting the deterrence, or does that simply escalate the situation? That's part of what the U.S. has to figure out. And as it's working on those problems, we've heard from two U.S. officials, the U.S. is moving a marine rapid response force towards the Eastern Mediterranean towards the coast of Israel and Lebanon there. And that's important because that's a unit whose -- one of its mission -- missing -- mission essential tasks includes a noncombatant evacuation operation. The U.S. has said it's not executing that yet. But as it worries about a broader regional conflict, that's one of the contingencies it has to look at, Kate.",
