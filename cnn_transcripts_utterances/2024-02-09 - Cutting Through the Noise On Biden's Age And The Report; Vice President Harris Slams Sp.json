And America's left and right are both melting down over a report that raises some questions about President Biden's mental acuity, and it concludes that he will not be charged for his handling of classified documents. Senator John Fetterman is here and will join me in moments. But, first, I want to cut through the noise here and give you some context. Nearly 30 years ago, another presidential candidate faced concerns about his age. That issue landed him on the cover of Time Magazine. But here's the thing. Then, in 1996, Bob Dole was younger than both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are today. As they say, history rhymes. Now, President Biden, his number two and Democrats alike are all blasting Special Counsel Robert Hur for the remarks in that report about Biden's age and his struggles to remember things in his interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  How in the hell dare he raise that? They don't know. It has no place in this report.

He held a news conference about a traditional standard issue FBI.That was a breach of norms for prosecutors. But here's the difference here. Hur is actually a special counsel. He was appointed by Biden -- by Biden's own pick to run the Department of Justice. He's actually legally required to write a report detailing his findings. A more apt comparison, perhaps, might be Robert Mueller. He compiled a 500-page report highly critical of Trump, even though he wasn't charging Trump either. Now, while it's fair to question how Hur came to his conclusions, it's questionable to suggest that he shouldn't have included them at all. Now, as for Republicans, it's interesting how their view of special counsels completely depends on the letter next to your name.

So, you really can't have it both ways on this. CNN reports that his team is now divided on how to handle this issue. But one thing is for sure, they are apprehensive at best of putting him in the spotlight. And here's the proof. The difference is stark in the visibility here. When it comes to interviews, at this point in their presidencies, Obama did 422 interviews. Trump did 300. Biden so far, 86. It's worth noting also quality over quantity. That's fair. But when most of Trump's interviews were conducted by sycophants, that allowed him to platform lies. And, of course, there were these moments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One author reported that Jill Biden was furious a couple of years ago when one of his news conferences went on too long.Now in the end, both campaigns will argue over whose gaffes are worse. Just as an example today, Trump made more than his share of gaffes on a stage. Now, ultimately, though, it should be about the policies and the promises that drive both of these campaigns. The truth is, though, something Democrats can't seem to grapple with, you have to get elected first. Joining me now, the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman. He's a vocal supporter of President Biden's. Senator Fetterman, thanks for joining us. Last night, as you know, President Biden addressed the special counsel's report that alleged that he had memory problems. Do you think that that press conference will ultimately assure voters, many of them Democratic voters, who worry about the same thing? SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  No, I really don't think that the Democrats really aren't worried about it. And if they do have any concerns, they're still going to vote for the president. And that's really what we have right now and how we've always had it that way. You know, it's like we have a very stark choice here, and that's what '24 is all about. And now that's what people are going to have to decide, you know, what they're going to choose for their nation as well too. And I don't think we have to, okay, you know, they have their older guy, we have our older guy, and we have, you know, gaffes and they have their gaffes and they have their files and we have, you know, our files on that side.

But, you know, but he's irrelevant, as are any of the other third rate kinds of campaigns now. It's going to come down to that same choice between Trump and Biden. PHILLIP:  So, speaking of Trump, Trump is over at the NRA. He addressed them tonight. He promised that Democrats would not lay one finger on their guns if he's elected.

And if you think that really doesn't belong in the hands of civilians as well too given the kind of horrific events here at schools and businesses all across, you know, almost every other week now, or, excuse me, every hour day, excuse me.
