Consider that just 74 days ago, Dana Bash and I hosted that first presidential debate of 2024, that went so horribly wrong for incumbent President Joe Biden, so wrong it caused Democrats to do what is unprecedented in the modern age? They made the call to the proverbial bullpen. Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the brand new nominee. Now, tomorrow night, she will be the one taking the stage for the second debate. It will be the first ever face to face meeting between Harris and former President Donald Trump as the CNN poll of polls shows an agonizingly tight race with no who clear leader. Trump campaign for its part is previewing some lines of attack for the debate today, saying that the vice president, quote, owns everything from this administration, unquote. And moments from now, Harris will leave Pittsburgh where she has been in debate prep mode since Thursday. She is on route to Philadelphia now ahead of the showdown there the National Constitution Center. Today, two sources tell CNN that the Harris debate team has been preparing Harris for a range of potential insults and name-calling and derogatory comments from Trump. And a radio interview with the vice president released this morning gives some insight into her thinking.

Where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go, and -- and we should be prepared for that, we should be prepared for the fact that he is not burdened by telling the truth.

For the first time, we're seeing the text messages, Colt Gray's mother, Marcee Gray, wrote to family members after the shooting. I was the one who notified the school counselor, she wrote. I told them it was an extreme emergency and for them to go and immediately find Colt to check on him. According to a phone log also obtained by CNN, Marcee Gray urgently reached out to Apalachee high multiple times the morning of the shooting. One call lasted ten minutes and came in a full half-hour before the shooting. I don't understand what took them so long because the first shots were fired until 10:30, Marcee Gray texted. Gray told \"The Washington Post\" and a family member confirmed to CNN that her son center and alarming tax the morning of the shooting and read only: I'm sorry, mom.
