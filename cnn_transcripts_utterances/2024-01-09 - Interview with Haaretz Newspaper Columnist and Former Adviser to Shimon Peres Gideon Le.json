Then, I discussed the threat of a regional conflict with director of the Middle East program at London's Chatham House Think Tank. Also, ahead, is Israel actually listening to its strongest allies? Former British cabinet minister turned podcast host Rory Stewart joins me on that and the U.K.'s changing political landscape. Plus, \"The Upcycled Self,\" a new memoir from Grammy-winning artist Tariq Trotter. He speaks to Hari Sreenivasan about music and his childhood grief. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. One in every hundred, that is the staggering number of people killed in Gaza over the past three months, according to Palestinian authorities. That's more than 23,000 people, and nearly two-thirds of them are women and children. That human toll is as Western officials visit the region, expressing increasing concern about the situation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken today has been meeting top officials in Israel to get them to do more to protect civilians, allow humanitarian aid in and to try to prevent a wider war that might spread into Lebanon, for instance. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has visited the occupied West Bank, where she condemned Israeli settlers' violence towards Palestinians. And today, she spoke in Cairo, Egypt. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator):  If we are talking about permanent peace, then it must above all be ensured through security. We always spoke about that in the past. My country knows what that means. Security guarantees, so that violence and terror, and in Germany fascism, can never again become strong. That requires international responsibility. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But above all, answering your question, where do we aim to? What will it be any better for Israel's security if another 20,000 Palestinians will be killed in Gaza? If another half a million people will lose their homes? What does this contribute for the security of Israel? We have to realize that the goals that Israel had declared are unachievable, or at least partly unachievable.

The only one who ignores it is Israeli media, by the way, if you let me make a remark about them, because the Israelis are the only people in the world right now who are not exposed at all to what's going on in Gaza. Nothing. We were always laughing at the Russian TV covering the war in Ukraine. Ours is much worse because here it is voluntarily, nobody dictates us not to show the suffer and the punishment of Gaza and Israelis are not exposed to it. But that's just a, by the way, remark. There are goals, the prime minister had declared them, namely releasing the hostages and crashing Hamas. After three months I can tell you, we are not getting closer to both of them. I think about the releasing the hostages, which from my point of view, must be in first priority and they don't go together, I think that here we are going far and far. We are much more distanced now than few weeks ago from releasing the hostages, and this should bother any person who is conscious.",

And then, if it fails, let's think about something else. Why wouldn't we -- after this terrible war, why wouldn't we, once and for all, try another way that we never tried. Why not to start with diplomacy? Not -- why not to start with talking as first priority and shooting as the last priority? But Israel right now is very far off it.

It's very nice to talk here about expanding the war, but what can happen then, I think, is much beyond we ever saw in Israel, in Tel Aviv, in Jerusalem, in Haifa, and other places. Listen, I give Netanyahu more credit than most of my colleagues and friends in the way that I don't think that his personal ambitions are the only motivation which motivates him. I can't believe it. I'm sure that his personal motivation is part of his considerations. I'm sure that for him personally, expanding this war is the only outlet before elections, resignation and inquiry.

All the values that people believed in collapsed only because of this barbaric attack, which was a barbaric attack, but shouldn't change any values. I'm really whistling in the darkness for many years. I'm used to it. I don't think I have much influence, but I know nothing but to tell what I think is my truth. And I don't see any other field that I would like to be active rather than telling the story of the occupation for so many years to those who don't want to hear and don't want to read and don't want to know. But by the end of the day, the occupation defines Israel more than any other thing. The apartheid defines the regime of Israel more than any other thing. And we cannot continue with this blindness. Israelis are living very self-content, happy about their lives, which are usually quite good, not in times of war, obviously, and they are not even curious to know what is happening half an hour away from our homes. And half an hour away from our homes, even before this horrible war, there is an inhuman reality which must come to its end one day.

It talked about there -- it was from a couple of years ago, but talked about trying to disrupt any kind of normalization, whether it was at the time between Turkey and Israel, and it talked about, you know, their sort of strategy in the reason (ph). Then before there was also -- you know, I think Chatham House even put this out, Bronwen Maddox, who used to be a journalist, had interviewed years ago, Arouri, the Hamas leader who was assassinated. And he had said to her that our aim is to radicalize, in her words, the Palestinian population so that they do not go towards peace. And Hamas, you know, wants to delegitimize the Palestinian Authority and sort of disable any sentiment towards peace. Do you think that's still what they think?

So, that's, I think, primary task here. But beyond that what is urgently needed is a pathway that creates a process where Palestinian leaders can work together for reform, accountability, governance with elections at the end of this process, and an opportunity for Palestinians themselves to elect their future leaders should certainly be an opportunity given to Palestinians, not one that they've had for well over two decades now.",

And Iran has, over the past few years, restored ties with the Gulf Arab countries, it is looking to forge stronger economic linkages and be part of an integrated Middle East as well and that, of course, is hard to achieve with its oppositional stance with the United States, it's accelerating nuclear program, and of course, this underlying tension with Israel, that is, I think, Tehran is calculating will increase over this year in particular.",

But this event, KeirStarmer's refusal to call for a ceasefire, is damaging for Keir Starmer and Labour. There are perhaps 30 Labour seats where Muslim voters are swing voters and they feel very, very angry about this issue. And it's an issue where Keir Starmer, who's looking for ways to differentiate himself, is in danger of being outflanked. If the U.S. changes its position, if Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, changes his position, Keir Starmer will find himself left behind. So, there has to be a way to do something that politicians seem to find very difficult, which is to say the Hamas attacks were unbelievably brutal, horrifying atrocities that killed 1,400 people and Israel had a right to defend itself, and also, enough already, far too many people have been killed, there is no justification for these ongoing operations.",
