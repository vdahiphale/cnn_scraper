Ninety seconds -- ninety seconds -- that is how much time hundreds of passengers on a Japan Airlines flight had to escape from a burning plane. I want you to take a look at this incredible video coming out of Tokyo's Haneda Airport. You saw the fireball and the fire really erupt from that plane as it landed. What happened was a passenger plane collided with a coast guard plane immediately upon landing. The entire plane ended up engulfed in flames. All 379 people who were on board rushed, they evacuated immediately and they miraculously survived. Sadly though, the five crew members on the other plane were killed instantly. I want to join -- I want to bring in our Pete Muntean who has latest on all the developments. Pete, just the fact that so many people escaped -- and by the way, escaped alive is no small miracle, right? Just walk us through though, what specifically went wrong here upon landing.",

      "sentences": "There was a big success here in the evacuation that went so smoothly, but just by a huge failure of theJapanese safety culture that is so central to the life there. This is something that is really a wake-up call around the world, especially in Japan, and especially here in the U.S. We'll get to that in a second, but I want to walk through this incident. We know that this Japan Airlines flight, 516, an Airbus A350, was coming into land at Haneda's Airport 34 right, when it apparently hit a Japanese Coast Guard dash eight. That is a twin turboprop airliner. It was on its way to help relief efforts after the earthquake in a different part of Japan and they apparently collided on the runway there. The images that you're seeing right now will no doubt be a part of what will be a huge investigation that is just now getting started. We have heard that Airbus will assist in this investigation along with the Japan Transport Safety Board which will lead the investigation here. That is the fireball that took place only two seconds into that video in what appears to be this head on collision of this Airbus versus this Japan Coast Guard plane. We know that five people in the Japan Coast Guard plane have died. The captain at last check was in critical condition. He is the only survivor. Haneda Airport, a very busy airport on the Pacific Rim. This happened at 5:47 P.M. local time, about 3:47 in the morning on the East Coast here. Busy airport, four different runways. And so now, the question is, why was one of these airplanes in the wrong place at the wrong time, or was this a failure by air traffic control, something that investigators will no doubt want to dig into. The big success story here though is the evacuation, and the fact that this was done so quickly and efficiently without any injuries to those on board. Three hundred and seventy-nine people including the crew, and a major congrats to them, they were able to do this so easily. Some passengers reported not being able to get out of some of the exits. That's likely because of the fire that engulfed the airplane. They were able, in one of the videos I was watching, to get out of the R-1 exit that is the front most door just behind the cockpit on the right side of the airplane. This is something that flight crews train for all of the time, not just the pilots, but the flight attendants, they are there for your safety. The rules in aviation are written in blood and it is incumbent upon them to get all of these passengers out so quickly and so safely. They did a tremendous job.",

There is no heating right now so people are sleeping on mats. They're using thick blankets to stay warm. There's also no running water. So, the Japanese self-defense forces are just outside this building handing out water to locals. Now, we know that in Ishikawa Prefecture, which is very close to the epicenter and which is where we are now, at least 48 people have died. The Japanese Prime Minister has also said that 120 people are still stuck underneath their homes. Now, the Prime Minister has said that they've dispatched as many forces as possible to get to these survivors, to help them out from under their homes, but it's been very difficult. A, because we're on a peninsula. There are only so many ways to get here, but also B, because the main road leading into this peninsula has collapsed because of that very powerful earthquake. Now, people here in the shelter have told us that they're still feeling a lot of aftershocks from that initial very powerful earthquake. Even in this shelter alone, some of the cement pillars have rubble around them just again from that very powerful quake and the shakes coming afterwards. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Nanao City.

We have seen that dramatic video emerging appearing to show a car which exploded, building partially damaged in a suburb of southern Lebanon. The Lebanese National News Agency reported that was carried out just over an hour ago. And as you mentioned, one of the victims of that attack reported to be the deputy head of Hamas' political bureau, Saleh al-Arouri. This is a significant escalation. We have heard from the Israeli military officials, as well as Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in the past, over the course of this war, vowing to go after Hamas leaders wherever they are, not just in Gaza, not just in the occupied West Bank. But this certainly marks a dramatic shift and an escalation. Separately, of course, we have also been seeing escalating tensions between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. There have been mounting concerns that we could see an escalation more broadly in Lebanon, not just centered around that border region, where we have, over the last few days and weeks seen that exchange of fire. We have seen over the last few days that Hezbollah group targeting Israeli targets across the border, Israel in turn carrying out airstrikes, drone strikes in Lebanese villages near the border region. But this is a significant step up, the targeting of a Hamas official, a significant Hamas official inside Beirut. And, of course, the timing of this is also raising concern tomorrow. We are expecting to hear from the Secretary General of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group, again separate from Hamas. But we are expecting to hear from Hassan Nasrallah speaking tomorrow. He has in the past previously warned that if Beirut were to come under attack, Hezbollah would launch an attack on Israeli territory, even on one occasion warning to attack Tel Aviv. So, that will certainly raise alarm bells over the potential for, again, this conflict to escalate more broadly into the region. Of course, this will mark a deeply worrying development. We are still getting more details, as you mentioned, at least four people reportedly killed so far but again, the fact that a senior Hamas official is now confirmed to have been killed that will certainly be raising alarm bells around the region.

All right, Ukraine's foreign minister is urgently calling on the country'sallies to speed up their deliveries of more air defense systems and ammunition after Russia unleashed a barrage of attacks overnight. At least five people were killed, dozens more injured in the missile and drone strikes, which officials say mainly targeted the capital, Kyiv, and also the eastern city of Kharkiv, as well. Clare Sebastian is following these developments from London. So Clare, here you have Dmitro Kuleba saying, listen, we desperately need help, especially given the fact that Russia has stepped up its attack significantly, as Putin promised that it would. Walk us through what Ukraine really needs at this point in time. This is going to be a very difficult year for them. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Yeah, I think, look, it's clear over the last five days that this air war has really stepped up in earnest. And even before that, Ukraine was saying that air defense missiles and systems were its top priority. And the NATO chief warned at the beginning of December that Russia had been stockpiling missiles ahead of a possible winter attack. So this, we did expect, perhaps was coming. This was something Ukraine was extremely worried about. And now, over the past five days, President Zelenskyy says that Russia has fired more -- 500 drones and missiles at Ukraine. So, that is a significant uptake. And with every attack, those air defense missiles will be depleted. Now, having said that, the air defense forces in Ukraine had significant successes in Tuesday's attacks. The head of the armed forces saying to CNN in an exclusive comment that Ukraine had managed to shoot down all Kinjal missiles. These are these much vaunted ballistic missiles. Russia calls them hypersonic. Putin himself had said that they were unstoppable. Take a look at this comment from Valery Zaluzhnyi, the Commander in Chief of Ukraine's army. VALERY ZALUZHNYI, COMMANDER IN CHIEF, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): Today, the Air Force of Ukraine has shot down 10 of 10 Russian X-47M2 Kinzhal air defense missiles using Patriot surface-to-air missiles. This is a record. If these missiles had reached their targets, the consequences would have been catastrophic. I thank our servicemen for their work, and I thank our partners for their air defense systems. There is no reason to believe that the enemy will stop here. That is why we need more systems and ammunition for them. (END VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN (on-camera): So, echoing what we were talking about from Dmitro Kuleba, the foreign minister, using these attacks essentially to show the West what Ukraine is up against and how vulnerable they are going into the New Year, especially as we see the deadlock still there in Congress over providing more aid. So, that is the situation on the ground. Zain, I think it's clear that the strategy from Russia is, as we've seen over the past -- now some 22 months, is attrition, essentially, trying to exhaust Ukraine. President Putin's comments on Monday literally laying out the amount of artillery ammunition that Ukraine can fire versus how much its allies can produce shows that that strategy is very much front and center. He's trying to exploit the hesitation we see from Ukraine's allies.",

Courtdocuments set to be released soon are expected to reveal the identities of some of Epstein's alleged associates and some of his victims, as well. Until now, they've been known as John and Jane Doe's. It's important to note that inclusion on this list does not necessarily mean the person committed a crime. I want to bring in CNN's Kara Scannell covering this story. Just explain to us, Kara, why are these names being made public and what could we end up learning today, or at least this week? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Yes, Zain. So, these names are all part of a civil lawsuit that was brought by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. And as part of this litigation, there was a lot of documents that was collected. There were depositions that were taken, and that lawsuit was eventually settled. But news organizations had asked for the unsealing of many of these records and some of the names in it, which had been kept private because these individuals were private. Now, because there's been so much litigation about Jeffrey Epstein including the public file and conviction of his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, a lot of the material has come into the public records. The judge is saying that in many of these cases, these identities are already public, so it's fair to make the documents that incorporate their names public, as well. So, it could be a number of people that have been accused of being, you know, associates in Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking operation. It could also be some employees who worked for him where there's no salacious allegation against them. And it could also be some of these accusers. You know, there were depositions taken in this lawsuit, other people making accusations. So, all of this will come to light. Now, it's not really clear since so much information has come out, what new we will learn, but it -- there is certainly more to be told about Jeffrey Epstein's sordid life over 20 years of -- is the time span of when these accusations that he assaulted minors and underage kids had taken place. So, we'll be looking to see what new information we learn. We expect there to be some high profile names because Giuffre has made public accusations against Prince Andrew, against Alan Dershowitz, an attorney, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell and the former governor of Texas, Bill Richardson - - they all denied any wrongdoing. They denied ever knowing her or sexually assaulting her, though, you know, she did sue Prince Andrew. He did agree to a settlement, and he paid what they said was a substantial amount to a charity that Giuffre had selected. So, we might learn some more information about anyone else that may have mentioned any of these men. If there was more documents that would reveal, you know, calendar entries, things of that nature. So, we really won't know what it is until we see it. And we're told that this will be coming public as soon as this week. Zain.",

The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says Israel bombarded itsheadquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, killing several people, wounding a lot of others, as well. The group says about 14,000 people were taken shelter there and also in an adjacent hospital. It describes scenes of chaos and of panic. CNN has contacted the Israel Defense Forces -- the IDF for comment. All right. I want to talk about the historic ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court in a narrow eight to seven decision. The court struck down a controversial change to limit the powers of the judiciary. What does that mean? This means that the top court will once again have the power to declare government decisions unreasonable. Of course, you remember that last year, we saw tens of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets almost every weekend to protest the government's plans. A lot of them feared that by weakening and overhauling the judiciary and limiting the powers of the judiciary, that would damage Israel's core character as a democratic nation. The court's latest ruling deals a major blow to Prime Minister Netanyahu and his right-wing government, as well. Netanyahu, as I'm sure you remember, is still facing a corruption trial, and a lot of Israelis blame him for failing to prevent the Hamas massacres on October the 7th. And ordinarily, by the way, the court's decision would probably have sparked a lot of division in Israel, but the war against Hamas, rather, in Gaza after the October 7th attacks has completely overshadowed it. I want to bring in Ronen Bergman who's an Israeli journalist and also staff writer at \"New York Times\" Magazine. Ronen joins us live now. So, Ronen, a huge blow to Netanyahu, but of course the country has bigger fish to fry right now. Just walk us through what has been the reaction among Israelis to the course decision. RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" MAGAZINE: The reaction, even if you would ask me this before it was published, everyone in Israel could draw down the reactions. Immediately, the ultra-right main components of Mr. Netanyahu's coalition and government launched an attack against the Supreme Court with the peak today of one senior member of the coalition. And parliamentarians said that, first, they will deal with Hamas, then they will deal with Hezbollah, and then they will deal with the Supreme Court, as if the war between Israel and Hamas can be in any way compared to the relations between the coalition or the parliament or the government and the Supreme Court. And I think this statement that was not in any way pushed back by Mr Netanyahu, so far, I think, it reflects the amount and the depth and the gravity of hatred and war that has been launched by the coalition against Mr. Netanyahu. The opposition and much of the public has been, I think, very happy that the protest that you had mentioned before, hundreds of thousands marching every week with the protests accelerating after the decision to diminish the power of the Supreme Court that has helped and that has brought an outcome. It was one of the components that brought this outcome. And some Israeli commentators said that following the horrific attack of October 7th and the court decision, it's the end of the so-called judicial reform, which was in fact, an attempt by the coalition with Mr. Netanyahu to maintain the court power, limit their ability to criticize the executive branch.",

But he said that and his supporters, that the Supreme Court doesn't have the authority to cancel basic laws. And this was the point. And in that point, it was an overall overwhelming majority of 12 judges that decided in complete contradiction to anything that Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters and the coalition said. So, on the specific law, it is indeed a very small margin, but on the authority of the court, on this, the death authority that exceeds the ability of the parliament or the government to hurt human rights, to change legislation in a way that would serve only their parliamentarian and their ministers, that has been decided by overwhelming majority.

On top of that, he was Mr. Security. He was the guy who was supposed to protect the country against all eventualities. And then you had October 7th. And now you have this particular ruling that is a blow to Netanyahu, as I mentioned earlier. How does it impact Netanyahu politically going forward, do you think?",

They maybe put some parts of this attempt to change the regime in Israel, not just the coalition or the government, but the regime on hold as long as the war is going on. But if you hear, if you read their statements, they said, as long as the war is going on, we should be united all other statements that basically trying to justify not having any kind of criticism and not having any kind of court decision while the war is going on, basically just to delay that. So they would not face the criticism. I think, this is just another stone in a wall that is built against those initiatives, but also another pinpoint, another very important point on the timeline of the disassemblement of this coalition. I don't know where it would happen, but I assume that once Israeli forces are out of Gaza -- and I believe that they will be out of Gaza sooner than most people think, sooner than the Israeli army chief think. Then the focus will shift to domestic Israel. And there will be a political havoc. People that did not express their stronger position and frustration and anger, if not rage, towards Mr. Netanyahu and the catastrophe that he and his policy have created in Israel, I think they will start demonstrating. And this will change the political scene. And I think I've said enough about the future. I'm not very good with my optimism about life. Something distorts my ability to speak about the future.",

Take a look here, this is baby Owen, and at just 18 days old, he became the world's first patient to undergo a partial heart transplant. Meg Tirrell joins us with more on this life-saving procedure.
