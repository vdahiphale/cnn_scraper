It comes as the IDF says the majority of hostages captured by Hamas are still alive.I want to talk to Major Doron Spielman from the IDF. He joins me now. Appreciate you being with us. Can you tell us anything more about the condition of these two Americans? MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESMAN:  Well, what we know right now, Anderson, is that they're undergoing medical checks. They're in our army bases. Of course, they've been through a harrowing ideal. We know that this young woman, Natalie, she just graduated high school. She and her mom came to Israel from Chicago. Went for a vacation with some friends and family in the southern community, and at 6:30 in the morning, Hamas gunmen, terrorists broke into the home and dragged them out at gunpoint. So, they have been through God knows what over the last two weeks. We're making sure that they're, you know, as well as possible, and pretty soon they'll be back with their families which in the darkness that we've been experiencing a little bit of light.",

But, you know, these are the first two, and what we see and what we know is that Hamas is trying to paint itself as, you know, a human rights organization now by having given back two of the hostages.

Hamas, it's a very, very typical cycle. They attack and massacre, threw rockets at Israel, they run back to Gaza in the past. They hid under their own civilians waiting for us to kill them while trying to reach them and then they turn to America and the International Community and claim, you know, human rights violations so we'll stop so they can regroup.In this case, that would play right into this. They want to have us pause on eliminating them, which we've said we're going to do. We're at war with them. There's going to be no break. We are going to -- you know, we are going to eliminate them. And this is another tactic for them to try to get us to stop but they're mistaken. Hamas is an evil that has to be stopped completely, and that is what we're going to do.",

And as a result, he's going to have to pay $5,000, 100 hours of community service. But what's most important about this is explicitly he's going to have to testify against the remaining co-defendants in any future proceeding or trials, and that includes Former President Donald Trump. It was after that Chesebro agreed to this deal that I caught up with his defense attorney, Scott Grubman.

Initially the understanding was that it would be let through today, that apparently has not stood up. That was pushed back until at least tomorrow.
