But today, they got the chance to at least be heard. Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 years old when he killed four people and injured seven others, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. It doesn't have the death penalty. This is the harshest punishment possible. And in the hours leading up to that very sentence, family member after family member, victim after victim, recounted to the court how their lives had been irreparably shattered by the events of that day. And it was their words, directed right at Ethan Crumbley, that left the biggest mark, like those from the mother of Madisyn Baldwin, a 17- year-old senior who didn't live to graduate high school.

In addition to these four shooting victims, what do you say in response to the message that he conveyed today? C. GREGORY:  I think the first thing is it's too soon for many of us to forgive, although some made the message of they'll seek forgiveness for themselves, but not for the shooter. I think the note is that trauma does not respect time. And so, it doesn't matter that we were in this place two years later, and he decides now he's going to say, I'm sorry. The trauma is very real and it takes you back to that single day. And we don't get out of it just because he goes to life in prison without parole. So, I feel for what he did say, but I think it falls on deaf ears at this point. And it's a means to an end to get him processed through the system.

There were things that could have been done to prevent this. No one took an action. So that is what also frustrated so many there. But I think for the community, in any community, when you're able to come into a courthouse and do those victim impact statements, it's very powerful. It's a very important part of our justice system for the victims to come in and tell a judge how they feel, how they were terrorized by what happened to them. And so, in that sense, I think it does give them some closure, that they can come in there and speak about how they feel. But, you know, as you heard the family there say, they will never be whole again.

This was a 15-year-old kid at the time, 17 now, who will never see the light of day again, will spend the rest of his life behind bars. And so, I think that's probably why the judge did it with the understanding that it was potentially going to affect these victims. This is something that they will live with forever. The sights, the smells, the noises, the sounds of gunfire, seeing their friends dying. This is something this community will live with forever.

It's raising a lot of questions about what it could mean for his father's reelection campaign.Anderson Cooper recently sat down with President Biden for his podcast, \"All There Is,\" where the president talks about how the loss of his wife and daughter impacted his relationship with his sons. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (voice-over):  I remember riding, we were in the car, Hunter was I guess five years old, six years old. And we were riding along and the top was down. Those days you could put a kid in your lap. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST (voice-over):  I remember those days, it was crazy. BIDEN (voice-over):  And we stopped at a stop sign and we were in the country. And he looked up and looked out at all the cows around grazing. He looked, he said, daddy, I love you more than the whole sky, the whole sky. And, you know, I'd get home and they could tell too when I was down, and they'd just be there. COOPER (voice-over):  In your book, your last book on the back page was a beautiful photo of Beau when he was eight or nine -- BIDEN (voice-over):  Yeah. COOPER (voice-over):  -- and he's turning and he's waving to the camera. And you said somewhere that that's the age you always see him in your mind's eye, and I'm wondering, is that still true? BIDEN (voice-over):  Yeah, it is. The smile on his face just waving, he's walking into the garden. And look, Beau and Hunt, they'd finish each other's sentences. They're as close as they can possibly be, and I think the loss of Beau was a profound, profound impact on Hunter. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
