But Kevin McCarthy has indicated to me and others that this is a big priority of his to make sure that both sides are on the same page when it comes to the threat of China. That is the same approach that the leaders of the committee Chairman Mike Gallagher on the Republican side, the Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, both are trying to pursue this on a bipartisan basis going forward. Now, Gallagher indicated to me that this will be an overall scene setting hearing to try to make clear about the threat from China poses not just abroad but also here in the United States. And we expect to hear from some key witnesses, some people who worked in the Trump administration, Matt Pottinger, who was a Trump expert under a China expert under Donald Trump was expected to discuss about the ideological aspect, the political nature of the Chinese Communist Party. That will be part of his testimony tonight. H.R. McMaster, the former National Security Adviser under Donald Trump, going into detail about the military aspect, the military component of the Chinese government. And also we expect to hear from Tong Yi (ph), who was in Tiananmen Square, someone who was essentially jailed in a labor camp for two and a half years, detailing the brutal and some oppressive conditions that have happened during time over there.This all coming, Jake, as this committee plans to push ahead on a series of other hearings going forward. We don't expect today's hearing to really focus on the questions about whether the COVID-19 was originated in the lab in Wuhan. Gallagher indicating to me that's probably going to be a focus of a separate hearing or a separate issue, but they plan to dig deeper on specific subjects after this overall scene setting hearing and then issue a series of reports in the months and weeks ahead about what actions the U.S. could take, what Congress can take to try to confront this threat here at home, Jake.",

Thanks to both of you for doing this. We appreciate it. It certainly says a lot that you're appearing in a bipartisan way. We don't get that a lot. Chairman Gallagher, let me start with you. You've said that unity is America's greatest strength against China. So how are you and your fellow committee members going to keep tonight's hearing laser focused on China and going forward also and not into partisan politics? REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI), CHAIR, COMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC COMPETITION BETWEEN U.S. &amp; CHINA: Well, I think it starts with the tone that Raja and I set in terms of how we work together. The good news is we've worked productively together for six years on a variety of issues. I think we've grown to respect each other, and we recognize that we don't have to agree on everything but when it comes to the threat we've faced from the Chinese Communist Party, I think we see it clearly, and we want to identify that bipartisan center of gravity where we can push back against transnational repression from the CCP. And so, I'm cautiously optimistic that we can do that on the committee. If for no other reason than if you look at the list of members that we have on both sides, Speaker McCarthy appointed very serious, sober members, not bomb throwers. And as well, Minority Leader Jeffries appointed some very talented Democrats that I've worked well with on the Armed Services and Intel Committees.",

That's just some of the issues here. What's first on your agenda and why?REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL), RANKING MEMBER, CMTE. ON STRATEGIC COMPETITION BETWEEN U.S. &amp; CHINA: You're absolutely right. There are so many issues, and if you talk to Mike or my constituents, a lot of them have their own concerns about each of those issues. But you know, one of the issues that we're probably going to talk about tonight is the economic issues and the trade issues that have ended up hollowing out the manufacturing sectors in the heartland, whether it's Wisconsin or Illinois or other places because of unfair trade practices, because of industrial espionage, because of forced technology transfer that many of our small and other businesses must engage in in order to sue business in the People's Republic of China.

But just yesterday, the White House directed all federal agencies to ban TikTok on all federal devices within the next month. Clearly, the U.S. government doesn't want it on its devices.

So that's an area, we've got to find a way to onshore, near shore, French shore, whatever the term of the day we're using.When it comes to rare earth, when it comes to energetics, the things that are in our weapon systems, I think we can take some steps to reclaim our economic independence, but it's not going to be a total decoupling.

And how do you view it?TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: So, it's very consequential and it shows the consequences of elections. Governor DeSantis is -- has a second term. He believes he has a mandate. There is a Republican supermajority in the Florida legislature, and it's clear that Governor DeSantis wants to put his mark on public education in Florida from what we consider K through 20, essentially, you know, not just public education, but it's public colleges and universities, including its graduate schools. So, I think Governor DeSantis is -- knows that what he's doing is unique, but that's kind of the whole point of it. And the fact that they're starting out by overhauling what is arguably the most progressive of Florida's public universities is also by design. So I think all of this is part of his bigger plan as he kind of dips his toe into running for president. He wants to be able to speak to Christian conservatives and the hard right to say, yes, I agree with you, education is too woke to use terminology that I think he would use.

His third visit there since the disastrous Norfolk Southern train derailment. 38 cars derailed the night of February 3rd, including eleven tank cars carrying hazardous materials.The National Transportation Safety Board says more than 115,000 gallons of toxic vinyl chloride was at risk of exploding once the train derailed. Officials say that's why they ended up doing the controlled burn on February 6, three weeks ago yesterday. That burn, which formed a giant black cloud over the city. Now getting rid of the soil and water polluted by the disaster is proving to be one of the more difficult issues so far. CNN's Miguel Marquez is in East Palestine, Ohio for us. The governor is complaining of Indiana, Miguel, that he didn't know some of the hazardous waste was being moved to a facility in his state. What's the EPA doing there?",

And look at the local level here, the state and the federal level, there's a bit of puzzlement because these are all facilities that manage this waste every day, 365 days a year. Some of it much worse waste.So it can show you not only is it the waste that they are moving from the site itself, but it's also the streams that run through East Palestine as well. This one they have been treating and you will see these sites everywhere throughout the area. The EPA director is saying that in the future they will have a system in place to warn and let states know that waste from here is coming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
