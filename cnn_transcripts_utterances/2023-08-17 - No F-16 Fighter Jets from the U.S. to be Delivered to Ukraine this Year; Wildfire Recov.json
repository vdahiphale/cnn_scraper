The timing could work against his 2024 campaign. And we do begin this hour in Ukraine, where the country's military says it is not expecting American-made F-16 fighter jets to be delivered this year. Ukraine's air force says, quote, \"it's already become clear that we will not be able to defend Ukraine with F-16s this fall and winter.\" The announcement comes as Russia continues using missiles and drone strikes to hit Ukrainian infrastructure, and that includes power lines and grain facilities. Meantime, the E.U. says nearly $150 million that was initially earmarked for Russia and Belarus will now be sent to Ukraine and Moldova. The bloc cited Russia's war against Ukraine as the reason, and you'll recall Moscow used Belarus as a staging ground for its full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials say they are working with partners to take part in the upcoming G20 summit in India. The gathering is scheduled for September, and Kyiv has not so far been officially invited. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London. Getting to those F- 16s first, Nada. Ukraine is lobbied so hard for these jets. Where does this stand now? And there was seem to be a lack of reaction in the statement. I know that there has been training that takes quite a long time already ongoing. What more are they saying?",

The hope had, of course, been the supply of these U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets would provide a significant boost to Ukraine's counteroffensive and air defenses over the harsher winter months, but of course, according to Ukraine's air force spokesperson, that will not be the case.Now, of course, we've heard from U.S. President Joe Biden in the past been clear in his endorsement of the training of Ukrainian pilots on these U.S.-made jets that training was set to take place in conjunction with E.U. partners. And we've heard earlier this month from sources familiar with the matter that for the last couple of weeks, the U.S. has been waiting, according to the sources, for a final plan for this training before actually authorizing this program to take place. Now, while this is certainly a blow to Ukraine's air defense ambitions, there are some positive indications we've heard from the U.S. State Department saying that they intend to push forward with this program. And Ukraine's air defense spokesperson, or rather air force spokesperson, has said that they are moving forward. Progress is being made towards ensuring that Ukrainian pilots are fully trained on these jets and they can expect that training to commence in the near future.",

Sources tell us that message came from a phone call between Paul Whelan and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday. Whelan has been in prison for more than four years, and his family is becoming increasingly concerned that he may not be freed anytime soon.CNN's Kylie Atwood has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Paul Whelan spoke by phone today with the Secretary of State Antony Blinken from a Russian prison. And according to a source familiar with the call, the Secretary's message to Paul Whelan was to keep the faith and that the U.S. government is doing everything in their power to try and bring Paul Whelan, who has been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four years, home as quickly as possible. Now we're told that this is the second time that they have had a conversation. The first time was late last year. But we don't know the logistics that when into standing up this call, you can imagine it would be quite complicated to get Paul Whelan on the phone with the Secretary of State, even though he's able to make phone calls from the prison where he is. Getting him on the phone with America's top diplomat is hugely significant. Now, David Whelan, who's Paul Whelan's brother, described the conversation to CNN as a long conversation, a frank conversation. He also said it sent a signal to Russia that the U.S. is still working. Of course, secure Paul Whelan's release. And we should note that the U.S. has put an offer on the table to secure Whelan's release. That offer to Russia was sent earlier this year, more than eight months ago, according to a senior administration official. That is still a live offer. But the Russians have not substantively engaged as the U.S. continues to try and get Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, who's another American wrongfully detained in Russia, back to the United States.

They want -- they want each other's countries to see the other as being on the same side that they share the same vision. They're both liberal democracies, and we're already seeing that shift, particularly on the South Korea side in the way they describe Japan. So, I think it's a long, slow process. But in the meantime, there's a lot of areas for functional cooperation. There's a need to collaborate on securing supply chains, economic security resilience. These are all important for both countries. And also on the security front, they both have common threats coming from North Korea. So, there are a lot of issues that are pushing them together.

One month ago, King ran across the military demarcation line during a civilian tour of the demilitarized zone. Nothing had been heard from him since. Pyongyang finally breaking its silence on the incident claims King confessed that he quote, \"harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army.\" A U.S. defense official said they could not verify King's alleged comments, and the focus remains on bringing him home safely. King ran across the border at the Joint Security Area, a heavily guarded area. U.S. and South Korean soldiers were unable to stop him. Pyongyang claims King is, quote, \"disillusioned at the unequal American society.\" There are no direct statements from King or details of his whereabouts or condition. King had faced assault charges in South Korea, serving around 50 days in a detention facility. The army says he would have faced further charges if he had returned to the U.S. as planned. The day before he crossed into North Korea, King was taken to Incheon Airport by a military escort but did not board the plane, claiming lost passport to airport officials who escorted him back to departures.

This is a briefing that the intelligence agency gave to lawmakers and lawmakers briefed reporters. That's the process they have here. And they say they are seeing more indication of vehicle movements at one of these production facilities. So they say this increased activity leads them to believe that they may well be preparing for some kind of a launch whether an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile or others. They also had other assessments for example when there was a Russian delegation that visited Pyongyang last month including the Russian defense minister meeting with the North Korean leader. They believed that they were planning to increase cooperation between the two countries.
