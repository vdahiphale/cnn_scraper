Three in 10 voters say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion. That looks to be good news for Democrats with four in 10 preferring that party's stance on the issue compared to just 26 percent preferring Republicans. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen joins us with more. Elizabeth, it's interesting to see public sentiment on the issue of abortion nearly a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. What else does this survey reveal about public sentiment? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Boris, still such strong feelings on this issue. This KFS survey found six in 10 Americans said they did not trust the Supreme Court to make decisions about reproductive issues. We know that this case about Mifepristone, one of the medications used in abortion, that will wind its way to the Supreme Court. Speaking of which, in this survey, 45 percent of people were unsure about what their state law was about medication abortion. This shows how much confusion there is with court cases going various ways, laws going various ways. More than half of women who have abortions have medication abortions. The fact that nearly half of the respondents weren't sure what the status was in their state is really telling -- Boris?",

If you're out there on the roads, brace for some more crowded highways.AAA estimates that more than 37 million Americans are going to hit the roads this Memorial Day weekend. Hopefully, not all of them in New Jersey, where I'll be. Some context of the 37 million. That's up from 6 percent a year ago. But it's Friday, so let's focus on the bright side here. Despite the fact that there's a growing number of people on the roads, the cost of road trips, it's actually going down. The national average is now sitting at $3.57 a gallon. That's not cheap historically, right? It was lower in 2020 during Covid and even 2021, but it is down by more than $1 from a year ago. This is miles away from that record high of $5.02 a gallon last June. GasBuddy says drivers in all 50 states are seeing lower gas prices. Some of them, a lot lower. In California, the average is down by $1.31 over the last year. Alaska, $1.30. More than $1.20 in New York, New Jersey and in Florida. This is all evidence of cooling inflation. The cost-of-living crisis isn't over, but it is getting better. So, why are gas prices down? Not all of it is for good reasons. Some of it is because supply has improved. But also, it's because of those recession fears, which have lowered the price of oil and kept a lid on gas prices. Still, GasBuddy says that Americans are expected to spend $1.6 billion less on gasoline this holiday weekend versus last year. I'm going to leave you with one more piece of encouraging news. GasBuddy says there's a growing chance the national average will not hit $4 a gallon all summer. That, of course, would be great news.",

And of course, the federal aviation regulations that are very similar to other countries, including Korea. And at that particular time in flight, the plane was close enough to the ground that it was no longer pressurized. So, at altitude, you simply can't do it. There are thousands of pounds of pressure on those doors. You cannot open them. You can't open over the over-wing exits. But when the plane is down that close to ground, and it's depressurized, all that pressure is off the door. Then you have one other problem. The aviation regulations say that the doors and the emergency exits and the over-wing exits shall not be able to be opened in flight. So, on older planes, of course, the flight attendants arm them. That's when you fly and you hear, arm, crosscheck. They arm them because, when you open the door, the emergency slide comes out and you can slide out of the plane. But at this particular place in flight, and so close to the ground, this passenger was able to disarm the door. We know that from looking at the pictures. We don't see that the slide was deployed. So, it was no longer pressurized. It was low enough and slow enough that he could actually do it. And, you know, everyone says, well, this has never happened before. Well, actually, it has. Everybody -- well, us older aviators will remember that the infamous case of D.B. Cooper, the hijacker who jumped out of the plane and into infamy, opened a back door, the very tail cone door in flight. So, it has been done before.",

The third law, besides the law of physics that this guy got around because the plane was not pressurized,And the laws of the federal and aviation authorities worldwide, where you can't have these doors being able to be opened in flight, the third one is the law of computers, also called flight law. On more modern laws, it's actually the computer that will disarm and can open and make the doors able to be opened when the plane is depressurized and on the ground or close to the ground. But on older planes, there's an indicator in the cockpit when the doors are armed or not armed, but they are able to be disarmed by, in this case, a passenger. So, I do think the authorities will look into it. They will see if something more is needed because it's so rare. Maybe something is not needed. But there is a difference among aircraft and there's a difference among aircraft management systems and aircraft flight computers as to which ones are controlled by computer and which ones are not. It's a good question to look into. Or they will.",
