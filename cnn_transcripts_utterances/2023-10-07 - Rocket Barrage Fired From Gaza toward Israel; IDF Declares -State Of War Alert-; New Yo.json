Because all the way out here in Jerusalem, a place that's normally kept out of these conflicts, we've already heard five air raid sirens. Tel Aviv has been affected. The area around the airport has been affected.As far as we, know Ben Gurion Airport, the main international airport, has not been shut down yet. It is still operating. We do know that air raid sirens have gone off there as well. And now, we also have confirmation the Israeli military has started its airstrikes in Gaza. And we should expect a very, very heavy and strong Israeli military response to this because of this unprecedented attack, a combination coordinated these rockets plus these military infiltrations. Again, something that Israel has not experienced, a surprise attack, since the Yom Kippur war.",

But what is different is these infiltrations -- and there will be huge questions for the Israeli security establishment of how they let this happen. Just seeing these videos of militants on the backs of pickup trucks, driving through Israeli towns, militants on the streets, militants in army bases, managing to enter army bases and engage with soldiers there. These are firefights happening in civilian towns. I don't know if Israel's ever seen anything like that. And that's what's different about this. Rocket attacks, that's something that we've been accustomed to in these conflicts with Gaza. And Israel does have the Iron Dome defense system, that does manage to intercept most of these rockets. These infiltrations though, this is something new. I should make it clear that it's not like Gazans never go into Israel. Thousands of Gazans have permits to enter Israel every day to work. So there will be a major question whether some of those people are the ones who are behind this. Or if they're all, as Israeli military said so far, some of these infiltrations came from the air. We saw videos of paragliders. They came from the sea, they said, as well. And they came somehow, you know, in other ways on the ground.

First, I just want to start with the symbolism of the timing here; 50 years, pretty much the day of the Yom Kippur war in 1973. COL. MIRI EISIN (RET.) ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Most definitely at the exact same time that perhaps Israel and Saudi Arabia were getting closer and a time period which has been so difficult for Israel. You're seeing terror organization saying we're not going to allow a change in the situation. We're going to do something bombastic, not different in that sense from when they tried to blow up the Oslo accords in 1994-1995. We are seeing something here which is unprecedented, I said before also, hopefully won't happen. But if there is an alert I'm going to have to go off the air. I too have had several alerts this morning in the Tel Aviv area. And we're all feeling the 50-year weight of what was there. I was a kid in the '73 war but it definitely feels the same.",

The person who has come out and spoken until now in the Palestinian arena is the ever figure that we never see, Muhammad Al-Deif. He is totally an Iranian run person. Saleh al-Arouri, who is the Hamas person in Lebanon, used to sit inside Turkiye, another very strong Iranian connection.

Back here in the U.S., President Biden is facing criticism for moving forward with the construction of new barriers at the southern border. Critics say the president is breaking a campaign promise to never build additional border walls during his term. But Biden says he couldn't stop the move because Congress had already earmarked funds to construct the barriers, which will go up amid a rise in migrant crossings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was told that I had no choice, that Congress passes legislation to build something -- whether it's an aircraft carrier, a wall or provide for a tax cut. I can't say I don't like it, I'm not going to do it. If this hadn't been vetoed, this law. (CROSSTALK)",

Sources I've spoken with said the administration was essentially running up against a deadline and that they had to use these funds by the end of fiscal year 2023. Now in a notice to the Federal Register this week, the Homeland Security secretary said that he may have to break more than 20 laws to get this done in an expedited manner. And that this is also an area of, quote, \"high illegal entries.\" This is going to be up to 20 miles of border barriers. It also includes gates, cameras, access roads and lights. But the Homeland Security secretary maintaining as well this week that this is -- that the border wall is not the response. The administration's posture on this has not changed. But again, it was necessary because these funds were appropriated by Congress. Of course, all of this, though, putting a politically precarious issue at the forefront and leaving the president to defend barriers which he had previously spoken out against during his campaign.

So they will find a way to break the wall or break the barriers. And then, effectively, it hands people in the hands of smugglers more than deterring them.

And the most critical thing we can do is reform the asylum system. Almost all people coming to the border are invoking the right of asylum. They don't run away from Border Patrol. They arrive at the border, lift their hand and say, hi, we're here seeking asylum. And that asylum system today processes cases in an immigration system that is so backlogged that it takes years. We believe it would take up to seven years for your case to be heard. During that time, people get the right to stay here and they get the right to work here. That has become a magnet for people who actually are not eligible for asylum. We think we should reform the asylum system so that cases are adjudicated within months as against years.

If that was all combined, clearly that's what Hamas is hoping for, this could put Israel severely on the back foot. With that, Israel is now mobilizing a war alert state, not a declared state of war but something close to it, with the prime minister now calling imminently a Security Council security cabinet meeting, where they will decide what their response on the wider scale will be inside Gaza. Now clearly, if there are hostages inside Gaza, that could complicate their operations. But there will be a great deal of pressure from -- I think across the Israeli political spectrum for a very powerful military response from Israel against Gaza.

We have, in the past, seen ground troops going in, tanks, heavy weapons being deployed by Israel inside Gaza territory. But in some respects, that's kind of what Hamas is looking for, because that brings the war face to face for -- between their militants, highly trained militants, and Israeli soldiers, putting Israeli soldiers at greater risk. So there will be an option here for the Israelis to rely almost exclusively on airpower, where they have total dominance, effectively, over the Gaza Strip, to try to break the military back of Hamas and the other militant groups inside Gaza.

This was clearly a very well coordinated and planned attack. Hamas is calling this the Al-Aqsa Storm and they're connecting this directly to what's been happening at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. What's fascinating is there hasn't been a specific trigger moment. There wasn't a major raid or incursion into the Al Aqsa mosque compound, which is also known as the Temple Mount to the Jews, a place so holy for both of them. There was no other significant event that triggered this.

They always say that what worries them the most is what happens on the north because a conflict like this, the one we're in right now between Hamas and the Israeli military, a conflict like that with Hezbollah would be on a completely different level. So that is a major concern as well, is whether the north will get involved, whether Hezbollah or those other Palestinian military groups will get involved. We should expect a very, very heavy military response. Already, thousands of military reserves being called up to serve.",

Amazon has officially joined the space race to blanket the globe with internet access from satellites. The company has set up its first two satellites on a rocket that launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday. It's all part of the tech giant's Project Kuiper. Long range plans call for more than 3,200 Amazon satellites to beam internet connectivity to the ground. Elon Musk's SpaceX and Starlink already have more than 4,500 satellites providing internet to most of the Americas, Europe and Australia. Earlier, I spoke with technology consultant and president of TMF Associates, Tim Farrar. He gave his perspective on what Amazon has to do to be a player in the satellite space race.
