These are off-year state elections which are being closely watched at a national level for implications for next year.In deeply conservative Mississippi, the Democratic challenger in the state's governor's race, Brandon Presley, has just called Republican incumbent Tate Reeves to concede. Presley is a second cousin of the king of rock and roll, that would be Elvis Presley. And in Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear has been re-elected, making him one of the few Democratic leaders in red or predominantly Republican states. We'll have much more on these and other votes across the United States in just a few minutes. But we begin this hour in Gaza where Israeli ground forces are now said to be in the heart of the biggest city in the Palestinian territories. According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, IDF soldiers are now operating inside Gaza City, putting severe pressure on Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And to be perfectly honest, I don't think Netanyahu necessarily knows the answer to either, because what he said, of course, is that Israel would have overall security responsibility.  We don't know what that means. Does that mean Israeli boots on the ground for this indefinite period? Does that mean perhaps peacekeepers, international peacekeepers, maybe including from friendly Arab states on the ground there in the Gaza Strip?Well, Mark Regev was trying to kind of, I suppose, elaborate on was the way that this might work. And he was talking about something a little bit more, in his words, fluent and -- fluent, fluid and flexible, effectively allowing Israel to deal with threats as and when they emerge in the Gaza Strip. But of course, this is all based on a number of assumptions. The first and most important, I suppose, is that as the Israeli Defense Minister was saying there, that Israel does succeed in destroying Hamas, both militarily so that it can never again threaten Israel with the kind of pogrom that it did on October the 7th, and also politically so that it no longer governs the Gaza Strip. And, of course, to  ensure that Israel succeeds in getting those 240 or so hostages that Hamas is still holding inside the Gaza Strip. And to that end, the CIA director, Bill Burns, was speaking with his counterparts in Israel to talk about how to perhaps try to rescue or free those hostages that are still being held by Hamas after more than a month. So that's 1 of a couple of the assumptions. And, of course, the other 1 is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains in power to carry out whatever his plans, if we can call them plans, are. And as we've seen both from history, that seems very unlikely that Netanyahu will remain in power much beyond the end of this war when that comes about. And also, opinion polls in Israel say that most Israelis want to see Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu go. So, to that end, it may not actually be his decision as to what happens the day after this war between Israel and Hamas ends. John.",

Political scientists have long said that if you think about a presidential term, think of it as a U shape. You start high in popularity, you go down. And then once you get into campaign mode, again, it goes up again. Biden is counting on that. He's counting on that he's, number 1 coming out of the down period. And number 2, the economy is going to boost him as it gets closer to election time.We're a year away. So, we have a lot of things that can happen. But I wouldn't count Joe Biden out.

And so going into the general election, Biden is going to have a full war chest. Trump may not.

Welcome news to scientists, who are lobbying the Australian government to do more to protect the reef, one of the great wonders of the world.CNN's Ivan Watson has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nighttime on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The sea explodes in an otherworldly spectacle. This is coral spawning. One of the world's greatest natural wonders is made up of billions of living creatures that reproduce like this each year. And this season has scientists excited. ABBI SCOTT, CAIRNS-PORT DOUGLAS REEF HUB COORDINATOR: We were out driving until about 11 p.m. last night, looking at the coral spawning, and we were lucky enough to see some of the species spawning. Not all of them, but we saw the soft corals, and they filled up the water with bundles of eggs and sperm, which was really spectacular. WATSON (voice-over): The spectacular sight is a type of synchronized breeding. Coral polyps release millions of sperm and egg bundles into the water all at once. When two bundles from the same species collide, new life is born. It's a display of nature's resilience, repeated around this time of year across the Great Barrier Reef's nearly 133,000 square miles. But while some parts of the reef remain healthy, other parts are bleaching and dying, killed by temperature rise due to global warming.",

But nonetheless, it's really important that the process is happening. WATSON (voice-over): The coral spawning at Moore Reef near the city of Cairns gives hope that this wonder of the world might still be rescued.

An update on election night in America and the results from a number of off-year state elections are being closely watched for implications at a national level.In Mississippi, CNN can now project Republican governor Tate Reeves has won a second term in the deeply red state, defeating Democrat Brandon Presley, a cousin of Elvis, who conceded the race a short time ago. In Kentucky, Democrat Governor Andy Beshear is also celebrating reelection, defeating Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who'd been endorsed by former president Donald Trump. And in Ohio, a state Trump took in both 2016 and 2020 presidential races, a measure has passed which will enshrine the right to an abortion in the state's constitution. This continues a winning trend for abortion rights advocates around the United States, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. The U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution to censure Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for her comments criticizing the Israeli government and supporting Palestinians amid the Israeli-Hamas war. Tlaib is the only Palestinian-American in Congress. Four Republicans voted against the measure, but 22 of Tlaib's fellow Democrats voted in support of the censure resolution. Tlaib posted a video to social media featuring protesters chanting \"From the river to the sea,\" which the Anti-Defamation League calls a antisemitic slogan. Before the vote, Tlaib gave an impassioned speech on the House floor defending her remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I'm the only Palestinian-American reserve serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and my perspective is needed here now more than ever.

That phrase, she contended, was not -- meant as a more peaceful phrase, but that is not been how it's been interpreted here, especially in light of her recent criticism of Israel, and criticism that has come from even members of her own party. In fact, a bipartisan majority voted to censure her. Twenty-two Democrats voted in favor of this resolution. It was 234 to 188. There were four Republicans who voted against it. Essentially, this is a public reprimand of Rashida Tlaib. Censures typically were rarely used in the past. They've become increasingly used in recent years. But in the aftermath of this vote, Democrats were sharply divided on this question. When you're uttering phrases like from the river to the sea, you're not simply advocating for the creation of a Palestinian state. You're advocating for the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state. And that crosses a line that no member of Congress should ever cross. It's hate speech, and Congress has a right to condemn it. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): It is outrageous. I am embarrassed for those Democrats who voted to censure their own colleague, who voted against free speech. It is an embarrassment.",
