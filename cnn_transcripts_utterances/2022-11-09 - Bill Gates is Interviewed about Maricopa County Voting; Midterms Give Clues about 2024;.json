Mike DeWine won the state by almost a million votes and there were almost a half -- 400,000 folks who split their tickets and voted for Tim Ryan. So, we - we - that's why the election denialism is so outside democratic norms that it needs to be called out. And we need to track each one who says, yes, they'll accept the results if they win and no they won't if they lose because it's uniquely dangerous to democracy. And I think the fact that Democrats narrowly won independent voters last night, which is so outside the norm for midterm elections, speaks to them saying, this kind of extremism is too much. This is to dangerous. This is destabilizing to who we are. So I think why moderates -- moderates also went to Democrats. So it's a -- a lot of election deniers will win lower - lower state - lower ballots, but the top of the ticket having a bad night I think is a repudiation of Donald Trump and the kind of extremism that election denialism represents.",
