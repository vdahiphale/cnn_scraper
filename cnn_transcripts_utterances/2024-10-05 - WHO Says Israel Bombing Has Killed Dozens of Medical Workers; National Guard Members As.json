We understand, according to Hamas, in a statement they say that a senior commander, a leader of the Qashan Brigade, and three members of his family were killed in an airstrike outside the northern city of Tripoli. No word yet from the IDF about that.But I can tell you the airstrikes are continuing, intense bombardment in southern Lebanon, as well as the strikes continuing here in the southern suburbs of Beirut, as well as the eastern Bekaa region. But I can tell you that there's a lot of concern about catastrophic humanitarian situation in Southern Lebanon that has been under intense bombardment where you need the health facilities and the hospitals, the most right now, they've already been overwhelmed overstretched dealing with a large, large number of casualties. We heard from the world health organization on Thursday saying that the health care in Lebanon is under attack saying that at least 37 hospitals were out of service due to airstrikes and due to evacuation orders by the Israeli military. And today we are hearing of another hospital that was Hit in a strike according to the state news agency saying that this hospital in vintage bail in the south medical staff they say were seriously injured. The Israeli military says that it struck a mosque near that hospital that it ordered the evacuation of the hospital. They accused Hezbollah of using that mosque they say as a command center, but these are accusations Lebanese authorities have said that they have heard before that they have heard this in Gaza, and they deny these reports. They say that their health care, their medics, their hospitals are under attack in different parts of the country, especially in the south. I mean, yesterday we heard from a hospital in a Christian town near the village, not known to be a stronghold of Hezbollah in any way, that they had to evacuate that hospital because of an airstrike in the premises of that hospital. And also, today we have heard from the state news agency saying that a Red Cross volunteer, a young woman, was killed in a strike in the eastern part of the country. This coming as the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesperson posting a warning on X saying that accusing Hezbollah of using health facilities and vehicles, including ambulances, to transport fighters and weapons, and saying that they will strike ambulances and vehicles that they say are being used for those purposes. Of course, again, this really raising concerns here in Lebanon about what they say is this direct targeting of their health care.",

With all due respect, does Israel care and do you expect Israel to potentially target nuclear facilities in Iran? MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYSTand the political figures are providing input to the targeting package, whatever that might be. But that truly is a decision between the Israeli military and their political leaders. There are multiple targets that they could possibly strike, each one of them with different degrees of complexity, Amara. I'm sure that the Israelis are putting that together right now and then get it approved from their politicians. The fact of the matter is you can't much interfere with those kinds of things.

I actually thought that it might be possible that Israel would launch the attack this weekend. But the fact to the matter is, it has to do more with the planning of the target package. When you send a group of airplanes, fighters, bombers, into an area, it's not just the ones that are dropping bombs. You also have to have the fuelers, the intelligence collectors, the jammers, all as part of that package. If Israel decides to go inside the territory of Iran with fighters and bombers, they are going to have to have a very large package, and that takes a whole lot of coordination. Even though Israel likely has plans for these kinds of attack contingency operations, it still takes a while to pull those together. And we also have to remember that Israel is currently fighting on two fronts, both against Hamas and Hezbollah.

I immediately got texts and calls from people saying, hang on a second. Is this going to be revised lower next month? Well, it's true that we actually already got revisions for July and August, and they were positive. We also added 72,000 jobs over the past couple of months. If you add all those things together, it almost looks and you can see it in this chart, a mini acceleration in the jobs market, rather than the slowdown that we were fearing just a couple of months ago. It doesn't get better than this for the White House and the Harris campaign one month out from a presidential election, even if voters aren't really giving them the credit for it. In terms of what we saw in sectors, one in four jobs was added in bars and restaurants. Maybe, it's the threat of the presidential election meaning we're all going out there and drinking a bit more. Or maybe it's just a sign of greater business confidence at the back end of the summer, even as consumer confidence dipped. And remember, all of this is before the real impact of the Federal Reserve's half a percentage point rate cut even begins to kick in. It's all just a sentiment thing for now. This data consistent with another quarter of a percentage point rate cut in November, but that decision is going to be made two days after the presidential election. So, we have to assume we've even got a result in the election before that decision comes. But today, can't take it away. It was a great report. Back to you.",

The White House calculated that if this strike lasted longer than two weeks, it could have a profound impact on the economy, which would have been felt by consumers just as they were heading to the polls. Acting labor secretary Julie Su was able to get USMX and the ILA union to reach a tentative agreement on wages, which includes a $4 an hour per year pay increase over the six-year contract. So, with that, the ILA agreed to send its members back to work on Friday, while the remainder of the contract gets negotiated, including automation and job security. Now, the current contract is now extended with a new expiration date of January 15th. Ultimately, any deal will have to be voted on by rank-and-file union members. Now, consumers should not feel an impact from the three day port strike, but the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reports about $1 billion in economic losses because of the strike, but said it should be operating normally in just a few days, and it will have cleared the backlog of 35,000 containers with all kinds of consumer items by this time next week.
