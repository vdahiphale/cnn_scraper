I think he's very clearly calling on, you know, suggesting to his supporters that they do, in fact, engage in violence if he is sentenced to prison.Kind of similar to what we saw a couple of days ago from Speaker Mike Johnson, when he said in another Fox interview that he expects the Republican Supreme Court justices to overturn this in some way.

And it's partially in the world that Oliver can describe. I mean, they are living in a kind of a closed media bubble. But it's also, I think, because, as I said, they are pushing these arguments are pushing at an open door. They are affirming the core conviction that binds together most of the Trump coalition, the idea that America was great at some point in the past and that various forces have been kind of, you know, stealing that America from us, the real Americans. I just go back to what he said at his rally the night before the runoff in Georgia in in 2021, when he said, this is our country and they are stealing it from us through rigging and taking elections. And that is the argument. And that's why I think each time something like this comes up, it simply feeds into that preexisting narrative and kind of superstructure that he's built.",

This is where they're getting their news. And if you watch these channels, if you listen to the rhetoric that's happening on talk radio, it's very clear why they believe that the country is being stolen from them, why they believe that Biden is an evil man who's wreaking havoc on the country.This is what they're inundated with, the kind of rhetoric they're inundated with on an hourly basis. And so, I mean, I think it would be shocking, really, quite frankly, if they didn't believe this stuff, right? And so 86 percent of the Republican Party believing this stuff is not surprising. And you have to remember, too, that this has been going on for years and years and years. This has been a very lengthy disinformation operation, if you think of it like that.

So, in a sense, normally, intelligence services do their best work when they try to understand a problem. In this case, the intelligence community of the Soviet Union was trying to prove a paranoid assumption about the Reagan administration.

I suspect that the president will remind people of the cost of not taking fascist language seriously, how the world -- how the world did not deal with the threats to democracies in the 1930s and the cost, the huge human cost to so many countries in the 1940s in World War II.It's -- I'm sure it will be an opportunity for him to talk about the importance of liberty and democracy, and why dictatorship is a threat to us all. Why -- when you hear people who aren't interested anymore in the rule of law, who have doubts about the importance of courts, and who talk about the single value of one strong person being able to make decisions for an entire group of people, that -- that begins to sound a lot like the 1930s.

Florida facing the New York Rangers in front of their home fans Saturday night. Sam Bennett getting the Cats on the board first in the first with a thunderous one timer from the circle. Rangers had the NHL's best regular season record. Didn't matter. Vladimir Tarasenko adding an insurance goal in the third.

So, we're really excited.WIRE (voice-over): And check this out. Coach Paul Maurice telling his players, don't touch the trophy. Last year, they touched the conference's Prince of Wales trophy, then lost in the Stanley Cup final. It's longstanding NHL tradition that you never touch a trophy until you lift the Stanley Cup after winning it all. Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese facing off in the WNBA for the first time since March Madness, when 20 some million people tuned in to see their college games. Clark finishing with 11 points, becoming the first rookie to score 150 with 50 rebounds and 50 assists in their first 10 games. Reese making history to 13 rebounds, eight of them offensive, the most by a rookie in Chicago Sky history. But then controversy. Chennedy Carter making a shot and then blindsiding Clark.
