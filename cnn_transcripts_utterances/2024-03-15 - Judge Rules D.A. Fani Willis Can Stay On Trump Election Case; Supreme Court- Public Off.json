      "sentences": "And you are in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. This morning, we're following all the reverberations from the monumental ruling in the criminal case against Donald Trump in Georgia. The judge has just ruled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can continue prosecuting Trump and his allies in the Georgia election subversion case.But she may only stay, only stay if the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who had a relationship with Willis is removed. If Willis and her team had been disqualified, it would almost certainly have delayed a trial until after the presidential election in November. That is something Trump desperately wanted in all of this and as other legal cases as well. CNN's Nick Valencia is just outside the Fulton County courthouse for us. So Nick, can you walk us through this morning's historic ruling?",

He did say that there was no evidence of a through line that she financially benefited from her relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, but he was highly critical of that relationship between them saying that Georgia law does not permit an actual conflict for bad choices, even repeated ones.And here's what he's saying in part of that decision. This finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the District Attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. And it was during her testimony on February 15th earlier this year, that she was fired up going so far as to call Ashleigh Merchant, the defense attorney that brought forward these claims, a liar. But in this ruling, Judge Scott McAfee saying that Fani Willis had her own credibility issues on the stand. We did hear from Steve Sadow. He's the attorney for the former president. And we should expect an appeal. But in the meantime, big questions remain. When will we see Nathan Wade's resignation letter? That is one of the most principal questions. And will the District Attorney's Office be able to get this case back on track before the election? Wolf?",

Part of the ruling, very strong words from this judge, this finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment, or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing.

He found that he believed that there was a pattern of bad behavior. That's what a lot of this strong language is about. But ultimately, that Fani Willis was not engaged in some sort of scheme to profit off of this case, which is why he is letting her stay on this case. But he's asking for Nathan Wade to be removed or the office itself to just remove themselves from the case, but it's never a good day, Wolf, when the judge overseeing the most high profile case in your portfolio questions your judgment.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is bottom line a victory for Fani Willis but it's a pyrrhic victory. It's a very costly victory, both to her and to Nathan Wade, one of whom has to go now. Spoiler alert, it's going to be Nathan Wade, who leaves the case. But let's remember, these people are prosecutors. Nathan Wade is functioning as a prosecutor on the most important case that that office has ever brought or that they've ever seen in the State of Georgia.And now we have the judge calling out as you just showed in that segment, the veracity, the truthfulness of Nathan Wade. He all but says, Nathan Wade lied on the stand. And he has similar language, a little bit toned down from that, but calling into question whether Fani Willis was truthful when she took the stand. So Nathan Wade is going to get kicked off the case. He has to go. I actually think Fani Willis ought to think about whether she takes herself off the case, a conflict of interest is something that you need to monitor as a prosecutor to protect the case itself. And if it reaches a point where an individual's involvement in a case is going to shed public doubt on the case itself, comes down that our prosecutor, and I include Fani Willis, needs to think about whether the right thing for the case is for her to step aside, given these rulings.",

We will use all legal options available to continue to fight to the end of this case, which should never have been brought in the first place.That shows that there's going to be an appeal there, which Nick had mentioned. It also shows that they want this to be their official line that they wanted Fani Willis off the case that this is something they believe should never have been brought forward. However, when I'm talking to Trump sources on background who are not public, they are saying that this is a win. They believe that there is a lot that in this ruling that they can spin to their benefit politically. They believe that taking Nathan Wade off the case is good for them. They don't know who's next, who will be the next special counsel, special prosecutor in this case. It could be someone who they have more information on. We -- they just -- there's a lot of unknowns here. Also the other part of this, they're happy because they believe that this will delay it past the November election, which is something that they've been working on time and time again, in all of his various cases.",

But it's unclear if this case is going to go before the election. If former President Trump is reelected, it's unclear if that case would go in the next four years or at all.I mean, obviously, the Trump lawyers at some point are going to have to defend their client in a court of law based on the facts and the law. But until that time, they have two goals. One is to delay. They have succeeded with help from this process to disqualify her and these allegations, and then also to undermine the credibility in the prosecutors and in the justice system. And the conduct here has helped Trump achieve both of those. So, yes, the underlying case remains intact. Fani Willis continues to oversee it unless she steps aside. But it is hard to see how this is a win for Fani Willis or for the justice system writ large because I think a lot of folks are going to look at this and have some questions.",

But there's some specific counts where you lacked enough detail to allow them to prepare their defense. But when it comes to the Court of Public Opinion, this whole episode, this effort to disqualify, the allegations that came to the surface, the conduct, this isn't damaging, because to the average voter, they don't understand why you would be sleeping with the person heading up the most high profile case of your career and one of the most significant in the land.And they probably also have some questions about the hundreds of thousands of dollars he received. Now the judge said that the amount he was paid was not inappropriate. But again, we're talking about the Court of Public Opinion. This was a forced error and a gift, a gift to former President Trump.

Now, this refers to the church speech that I think Paula referenced earlier. A few days after the defendants made this motion to disqualify Fani Willis, she went in public in a church with cameras rolling, and essentially said that the reason that this motion had been brought was racism.And the judge says in his ruling that that was an -- a legally inappropriate statement for the D.A. to make. He's absolutely right. A prosecutor cannot make inflammatory public statements about the defendants. They're the ones who have their rights at issue. And the judge basically said, it may be necessary to put a gag order on the D.A. And that tells you something. I mean, look, Fani Willis has made, in my view, and in the judge's view improper public statements throughout this case. She's given dozens of public interviews. She's given her opinion on Donald Trump's guilt before the grand jury even voted on this, which is improper. And so it's pretty rare. I don't think I've ever seen it before, where a judge has said, we may need to slap a gag order on the prosecutor. Prosecutors are supposed to operate under gag orders anyway. Prosecutors like to say we do our talking in court. Here, Fani Willis has violated that principle. And the judge has taken note of it.",

And the question of the appeal is going to be is it going to be an appeal that can be taken interlocutory, which is now that will then tie up the case even further? Or do they -- are they going to have to wait until after the case to have the appeal heard. There's probably a pretty strong argument. And the judge would have to agree to this, that it gets taken up now. Because if the appellate court rules the other way, and finds that the trial judge committed error in this case, as far as the law goes, then the case gets, you know, moved on and it goes to that panel, and then could potentially get moved on to another prosecutor from another county.So that's the next step legally in this case. And you have to remember on appeal, the veracity of the witnesses, those types of calls that the judge made in his opinion, the truthfulness of those witnesses, the truth nobleness of Fani Willis, the truthfulness of Wade will all have to be taken at face value, as if they own the determinations of the trial judge. The appellate judge won't look into those determinations, but whether the appropriate standard was applied. And especially in this case, where you have, OK, one of them has to get off the case. So if one of them has to get off the case, because of the appearance of impropriety, what about the entire time the case was ongoing?

As it relates to the legality of case, I think it just -- this is just going to -- this will slow down the process.

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett, speaking on behalf of unanimous court has established a new test for when public officials are allowed to block their followers on social media.Now, these cases that she was deciding on behalf of the court, speaking on behalf of the court came from Michigan and California. But you'll recall that Donald Trump when he was in office, blocked people on Twitter, that case never was heard by the Supreme Court because he was out of office by the time it reached up there. But now deciding a matter involving I say two local -- two sets of local officials who had blocked followers who had complained about their activity, the justices establish a test. And it's a pretty -- it's a test that in some way splits the difference from where lower courts had been but pretty hard. The test says that a public official who blocked someone or otherwise prevent somebody from commenting on the official social media page is engaging in state action only if the official possessed actual authority to speak on the state's behalf on a particular matter. And here's another key part, purported to exercise that authority when speaking in the relevant posts. The court said this is a very fact bound question. You know, it doesn't matter if the person was definitely a public employee, or a public official, or the site appeared to look a certain way. The question is whether the alleged blocking or censorship is actually a matter on which the officials, it's within their bailiwick and if the official was purporting to actually exercise certain government authority. So both cases are being sent back to lower court judges to figure out whether these cases, the officials can be sued.",
