What -- this is really offensive that is looming into Rafah that they really want to carry out to eradicate the rest of Hamas, they say, but that the White House has said they do not yet have a plan for.And so, this is a continuing of the conversation for Israel to essentially trying to convince the United States that they do have a plan to get those civilians out of the way so they can carry out this offensive into Rafah and avoid frankly, scenes like the ones that we just saw in Jeremy's piece with 1.4 million people, many of whom have fled for safety down to Rafah.

They're targeting specifically, Iran's drone program, and those who are affiliated with the drone program.Remember, Wolf, there were more than one hundred drones that were fired by Iran at Israel on Saturday night. You and I were both covering that in real-time. So, these are drone, steel, and automobile companies that are being targeted by these sanctions, as well as those who maintain the maintenance on those drones, and who manufacture them. But this was done very much in coordination with the G7. That was important for the Biden administration. So, we're also seeing sanctions from the UK and the European Union, as these countries not only try to show Israel that they are taking action against Iran but also urging Israel to restrain and to not counterattack against Iran, Wolf.",

Kerry, thank you so much for joining us. Why have you decided to endorse President Biden today over your brother Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? KERRY KENNEDY, ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.'S SISTER: You know, I'm endorsing President Biden. And in fact, nearly every member of Joe and Rose Kennedy's grandchildren are endorsing President Biden today, for one reason. We are in the most important presidential election of our lifetime. This as Trump is a -- poses an existential threat to our country. He's said he's proud of packing the Supreme Court in overturning Roe v. Wade. He said he's going to be a dictator on day one. He said he wants to change the constitution so he can go after his enemies, members of the press, the fourth estate in our country, which keeps our democracy going. So, these are that -- we cannot have this help in our country. It would be a complete disaster if he is elected. Joe Biden, on the other hand, has been an extraordinary leader for us.

And they said they were not sure if it was definitely him and they were not sure what that said about the honesty of his answer.So, that juror arrived. He went into the courtroom with all the other jurors, excused. It was just the attorneys. The judge brought Trump's attorney and the assistant district attorney up to the bench with the juror and asked them some questions. It was inaudible to the pool of reporters who were in the room. So, we don't know what they said. We do know that whatever he said elicited laughter at some point. And so, they spoke for a bit. The juror was then escorted out of the courtroom and the judge told the attorneys to talk about it. So, it looks like they're still deciding whether they're going to keep this door or not -- keep the juror, you know, as we're now dealing -- we're down to six because we lost another juror earlier this morning who felt that some of her identity had been compromised. And so, the judge allowed her to be excused. You know, they brought in this new pool, 96. That was cut in half by the number of people so they couldn't be fair and impartial. And they've now questioned nine people going through the questionnaire just to learn a little bit more about them and their views on Trump where they get their news and includes the number of people who work in finance, a stay-at-home mother, a retired university administrator, you know, as we're building this box to 18.

That had caused this back and forth. There's also a tense exchange between him and another congressman, Derrick Van Orden, a congressman from Wisconsin, who's daring them to move forward with their call to oust Speaker Mike Johnson.And also very interestingly, they tried to press Johnson about whether he would agree to a rules change, making it harder to oust a sitting speaker. And they contended, both Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, just moments ago that Johnson would not guarantee that he would move forward and support, making it harder to oust him from the job. Listen.

Actually, Matt Gaetz at the moment is not on the same side as someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who does support voting -- moving ahead in ousting Mike Johnson.In fact, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was leading that charge just spoke to us moments before that interaction with Matt Gaetz. She's said that she wants to hear directly from the Speaker of the House whether or not he supports changing the House rules to make it harder to oust him from the position. And she did not rule out trying to call for that vote right now. Remember, one member of the House right now can actually call for a vote ousting -- to essentially as the speaker of the House. That's what happened to Kevin McCarthy for the first time in history last fall. Now, there's some discussion about perhaps raising the threshold, maybe half of the members, maybe even somewhere around that to actually -- who can call for such a vote because of the concerns that calling for a vote in pushing out a speaker causes grave instability to this institution. And because of Mike Johnson's decision to move forward on Ukraine aid, is why people like Marjorie Taylor Greene are now trying to push him out of this job. So, a critical moment here, Wolf, for the speaker, for the future of Ukraine, and for the Republican Conference, which has been in deep disarray for months and months and months. Mike Johnson trying to take the reins back from those folks on the far right. And we'll see if he's able to do that.

And for that reason, is why many of them say why would we kick him out of the speakership. They would -- are expected to vote to essentially kill this on the first vote -- of a procedural vote to actually stop Mike Johnson from being pushed out of office. Now, here's the one catcher though, Wolf. The Democratic leadership in the House has not explicitly endorsed saving Mike Johnson. In fact, the number two Democrat, Katherine Clark, privately told her members this morning, keep your powder dry. Use this as leverage in a negotiation with the speaker. So, we'll see how the Democratic leaders play out. But some rank-and-file members say, let's save Mike Johnson, Wolf.",
