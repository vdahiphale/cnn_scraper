The former president received an historic fourth indictment on Monday.He's been charged with 13 counts in a case alleging he and 18 others schemed to subvert Georgia's 2020 presidential election results. According to the Fulton County Sheriff, Trump is expected to turn himself in at the county jail. In the meantime, he's announced a, quote, \"major news conference\" coming next Monday about his false claims that there was widespread fraud in Georgia during the presidential elections. Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has wasted no time attempting to have the Georgia case move to federal court.

A former U.S. president facing a fourth indictment confronting a total of 91 criminal charges and this latest indictment is different of course to the others in that Trump faces state charges so he won't be able to pardon himself or his allies if he wins the 2024 presidential election but he may actually try to move this to a federal court as Mark Meadows is trying to do.

And so we're already in uncharted territory times 91. And that's what's confounding not just about this case, but the three that came before it, is we don't really have a playbook for how this plays out with an American president and Donald Trump is going to try to use that to his legal advantage, but also to his political advantage. So he's going to try to convince the courts to give him special treatment because it's exceptional, and it's historical precedent.And he's also going to try to convince voters in the GOP base and across the country that these are political charges and not based on fact. I think he's going to have a hard time doing that with the broader public, but so far it looks like that's resonating with Republican voters. CHURCH: Yeah, it does. And federal prosecutors have focused specifically on Trump in previous indictments in an effort to move this along quickly. While Georgia prosecutors went big, didn't they? District Attorney Fani Willis invoking the state's RICO Act on racketeering, naming Trump and 18 other defendants. Now, that will likely slow the legal process down. But is this approach problematic, or is it genius for laying out the breadth and the depth of these alleged crimes?",

I mean, their evidence is damning, and it's based off of testimony that they've received over many, many months from officials at all levels of government.But what's really crucial here, Rosemary, is that the vast majority of the prosecutors' witnesses are Republicans. They are people who served within the Republican Party, people who were elected Republican leaders, people within the president's own administration and in the U.S. Senate that are Republicans. And that's what I think is going to be really difficult for Donald Trump, especially if this case moves into a trial that, as we know in Georgia, is likely to be televised, as you're going to see, like you did with the January 6th hearings, a parade of Republican officials saying that the President of the United States was trying to get them to do something that at best was corrupt and at worst was criminal. So I think this shotgun approach with the vast array of charges that could be applicable gives the prosecutor likely more opportunity to make some of those charges stick. But more importantly than that, it seems very consistent with the reality, which is that a great number of violations of the law occurred in the course of this effort to overturn the election.",

And I think you may end up in a situation where people are calling for a brokered convention or trying to find other ways to potentially replace a nominee who may not be able to assume the presidency, but much worse than that and the greater concern of these conservative legal scholars is what if Donald Trump wins the presidency and he wins the race and that's very viable.I mean at this point the betting markets still have him at a 30 percent chance of winning the presidency in 2024. Then we are in a likely moment of constitutional crisis if somewhere in that window he's convicted in what you know rightfully Rosemary, is a potentially pardon proof case. You could end up hypothetically with an American from jail. This is the type of thing that the Republican Party wants to avoid or needs to avoid.

The U.S. Embassy in Libya expressed concern over the clashes and called on both sides to deescalate the situation. Well, now to a grim discovery in Sudan. A government forum in West Darfur with representatives from all ethnic groups in the region says there is evidence of 30 mass graves across the state, with more than 1,000 people buried in them. The group claims some of the bodies were dumped by the paramilitary rapid support forces and allied militia.

So Stephanie, what more are you learning about this discovery of mass graves in Sudan? STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SR. EDITOR, AFRICA: Rosemary, it's another grim discovery in this seemingly unending war that has claimed thousands of lives and left millions displayed. Community leaders are accusing the Rapid Support Forces of hiding bodies and forcing aid workers to hand over bodies so that they can be hidden and buried in hidden locations. And it's just another grim development in this war, particularly in West Darfur, which has seen the most violence -- which has been the center of the most violence in this conflict so far. And of course, you'll remember that 20 years ago, West Darfur was the site of a genocide that displayed, that killed millions. And history appears to be repeating itself here, Rosemary, but not much is seeming to be done. But the community leaders are asking for help from the U.N. and other aid agencies. And the U.N. itself has described this as a senseless war driven by a wanton need for power. Rosemary.",

Russian officials said two civilians died in the attack. Cameras on the bridge captured the first blast on the road section. The cursor shows the drone moving in.

Using these drones, we have recently conducted successful hits of the Crimean Bridge, a big assault ship, Olongorsky Gorniak, in Sigtanker. PATON WALSH (voice-over): This another Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian amphibious assault boat, the Olongorsky Gorniak, on which Ukrainian officials said 100 personnel were on board. It was a remarkable feat, carried out by a growing fleet of what they call the sea babies. Hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian bases and right in Russia's coastal heartland. It put the Black Sea's east suddenly at risk. MALIUK (through translator): These drones are produced at an underground production facility in Ukraine. We are working on a number of new interesting operations, including in the Black Sea waters. I promise you, it will be exciting, especially for our enemies.

You can see cloud cover still hanging on, but the bulk of the storm is staying offshore. That's the satellite imagery. So look at these rainfall totals over the last 48 hours. Some areas received more than 600 millimeters of rain. We saw other areas widespread amounts 500, 575 so well above what we would typically see for the month of August. The wind reports were also impressive. We had 115 to 130 kilometer per hour winds, so that's where we saw a lot of the structural damage from that. So this storm is going to continue to weaken as it heads to the north, that's going to enter some cooler water. It's also going to brush just these northern zones that's going to bring some rain wind very high surf, but we're not going to see the impacts that we saw across Japan as this just lists to the North. We also want to see some more spotty showers for Japan so the rain is not over completely, but at least the rain and the wind from Lan is far from over.

And just in the last three months, we have had multiple vessels and crews on site in order to conduct this operation.Right now, perhaps a little bit surprisingly, we are still missing about $21 million that we've had to provide in upfront bridging finance, obviously putting the United Nations in an extremely difficult position because other operations are therefore not able to draw on these funds. Our appeal goes out to the world that we have averted a disaster that could have cost the world 20 billion plus if we hadn't had an oil spill or indeed a breaking up of this vessel. So hopefully over the next few days we will still receive the remaining pledges or new pledges to close this funding gap. CHURCH: And of course this operation was designed to avert a catastrophic spill that you just referred to there that could have potentially destroyed marine life and communities across the Red Sea. So was there any harm done, was there any spillage at all in the course of that transfer operation?",

(VIDEO PLAYING) Oher's life story from poverty to NFL stardom with the support of the Tuohy family became a best-selling book. Then an Oscar winning film reportedly netting more than $330 million, Oher says he's seen none of that money and now nearly 20 years later is asking the Tuohy's for a full accounting of his share. The suit reads where other parents of Michael's classmates saw Michael simply as a nice kid in need, conservators Sean Tuohy and Leigh Ann Tuohy saw something else. A gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited for their own benefit. Sean Tuohy, telling a local Tennessee newspaper, We didn't make any money off the movie. His son SJ, not named in the suit, told Barstool Sports, he did make some money but it didn't make him rich. SEAN TUOHY JR., RESPONDING TO LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FAMILY: I've made like 60, 70 grand over the course of the last four or five years. GINGRAS (voice-over): The suit also claims Oher, who just published a book about overcoming obstacles this month, unknowingly signed over the rights to his name, image, and likeness in 2007 without payment.
