Plus, the White House pushes for a last-minute deal on border security and Ukraine funding, even as some in President Biden's own party say he is going too far on immigration. And Nikki Haley says the fellows, they don't know how to talk about abortion. We're going to have the latest from the campaign trail. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, December 14, just 32 days until the Iowa caucuses, 326 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Welcome in. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is making sure he is front and center with Iowa voters, less than five weeks to go before they'll decide whether they'll give one of his rivals a chance to take him down in the primary, or if they'll send some of his challengers packing. Trump was in Coralville, Iowa, on Wednesday, attacking Joe Biden who is of course the all but certain Democratic nominee. But, Trump was also watching his back. He again attacked Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds for backing Ron DeSantis, and he threw this jab at Nikki Haley after she was endorsed by New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: They've been talking about the Haley surge. So, she goes up two points, I go up I think 10 points, nine or 10 points. And they say that's a Trump surge. But, they don't want to say that. They said she is surging against him, but he has gone nowhere. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so,I feel like I know what he is -- something he is saying is a change, and this was a change. He talked about Nikki Haley more and attacked her more than he has, I'd argue, at any other point in his campaign so far. And I think that just in itself shows the increasing threat that Nikki Haley is posing to the other Republican contenders and to Donald Trump. And I will say, when I talk to Donald Trump's campaign advisors, his allies, they recognize that Nikki Haley's prominence is growing, and particularly in New Hampshire. I mean, they contend, obviously, publicly that they're not worried about her, that he is still doing so well, which he is. He is still leaning very heavily in the polls, but she is continuing to rise. And New Hampshire is a state that the campaign is a little bit more worried about, because you do have Chris Christie also doing well there. You have Nikki Haley rising there. She just got that endorsement from Chris Sununu. And the goal for them has really long been that they don't just want to win these primaries, especially in Iowa and New Hampshire, but they want to dominate them. They want to really build that momentum to carry him through the rest of primary season, but then also to force his other opponents to drop out.",

Right now what we're hearing is about arrests of possible Hamas members, Kasie, in Denmark, in the Netherlands, and in Germany as well. We just got a press release by the German Federal Prosecutor's office who said that four members of Hamas had been arrested, three of them in Germany, and one in Denmark. Now, what the information that we're getting is that they, apparently Hamas, has been working on filling what the Germans call an earthbound weapons depot, which seems to me like weapons that were buried in Germany, and that these four men, apparently, were looking for this depot to try and bring those weapons to Berlin. And this is where the federal prosecutors say that they were for possible terror attacks against Jewish institutions, possibly here in Germany, possibly elsewhere, as you know, here in Europe and most parts of Europe. The borders are open. So, it's very easy and very quick to get from country to country. It's unclear whether there were any concrete plans for attacks. But, certainly, the Federal Prosecutor's office does believe that attacks were in the works, as they put it, against Jewish institutions, probably -- possibly right here in Germany. At the same time, we're also getting information from Denmark where the Danish authorities are saying that they also conducted raids throughout the entire country, throughout the day, and arrested three people, they say, in Denmark, and they're also speaking about one arrest in the Netherlands, unclear whether the Germans and the Danish are speaking about the same person. But, they're also saying that they tried to prevent possible attacks against Jewish institutions in Denmark. They are speaking of cooperation with foreign intelligence services, unclear whether or not they mean the U.S. or possibly the Israelis. But, certainly, it does seem as though there is a flurry of arrests that are going on right now against Hamas. And it's very uncommon, Kasie, for Hamas to be plotting terror attacks here on European soil. It's not really something that we've seen. So, certainly, obviously, this coming right now in the wake of what's going on right now in Israel and Gaza. Definitely a troubling situation here on the European continent, Kasie.",

And I can tell you that what's happened in the past, Kasie, is that the Chief Justice has felt that he is going to decide Donald Trump cases, but Donald Trump cases always are very fraught. When you think of the administration during his four years, all of those cases came down to like five, four votes. Then, when Donald Trump was there on his own personal business, it was always an issue where Donald Trump would tweet things like, \"Do you think the court doesn't like me?\" And then, remember, the clashes that they had when Donald -- when Trump complained about a lower court judge as an Obama judge and the chief made that remarkable statement, we have no Obama judges or Trump judges. We only have judges trying to neutrally decide cases. As I said, anytime Donald Trump crosses their threshold, there is problems. But, they don't see themselves in that political context. They're just trying to say -- decide these cases one at a time trying to assess what the law is, Kasie.",

And I think there is no better way to demonstrate that than what they did in taking away Roe v. Wade. I think that Democrats are going to be making that argument, that message going into 2024, in terms of the Senate matters because of this, the President matters because of the Supreme Court justices and what they have become. And so, I think that Democrats can use this to their advantage and point to all of those things, right, not just the this case where they could completely take Donald Trump off the hook, obviously, Roe v. Wade, mifepristone, anything having to do with women's rights, healthcare. There are so many things on their screen right now in order to make all of these decisions that really affect people's everyday lives.

It doesn't involve the fundamental right toabortion, because frankly, they got rid of that already.

It might say that these challengers, these anti-abortion physicians who have challenged these regulations, that the Food and Drug Administration has had an effect for nearly 10 years. And I should say, Kasie, that this does not put on the table the year 2000 approval of the drug. It's just some regulations that loosened requirements of when women could access it, up to 10 weeks rather than just seven weeks by mail, rather than in person. But, that is not to minimize the scope of the case. It's just to say it's a different kind of case. And it also goes to the core of the FDA's expertise and scientific medical authority here. And I actually think this case is set up in a way that would be more likely to have a win for the FDA and for people who want greater access to this drug.
