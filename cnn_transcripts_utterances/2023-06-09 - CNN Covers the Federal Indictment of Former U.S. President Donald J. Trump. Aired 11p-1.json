And Paula, the indictment is out now. I wonder, what to you, as someone who has been following this in every single move and every single detail, what stands out to you as the most damning information that we've gotten in this document?",

      "sentences": "It's such a strong reminder of how little we know compared to investigators. One of the things that really struck me and I think will really resonate with the American people are the photographs that the indictment uses to tell the story of how some of the nation's most sensitive secrets were strewn about Mar-a-Lago.Prosecutors in this indictment say that these secrets were in a bathroom, in a ballroom. There you see the photo of them being in a bathroom, boxes stacked up there in the ballroom. I mean, these are cardboard, pretty flimsy carboard and boxes in a ballroom that is actively being used for events. There you see sensitive defense information, secrets that are only meant to be shared with a small handful of our closest allies, the five eyes, and they're strewn about the floor of a storage closet. It's one thing to say that in an indictment but it is another to support this with photographs. That was one of the things that really struck me in this indictment. But the breadth and the depth of the evidence that they've gathered in this investigation, it's incredible. I mean, for example, there are two incidents where they say the former president shared classified documents in person. One is a story that we broke last week, a meeting at his Bedminster golf club where he says that he has sensitive information and appears to be urging people to look at it. But then there's another that we were not aware of where he shared a classified map with someone at a political action committee. So, again, what really struck me is how many new pieces of information, how many new details were in this indictment but, of course, it was also good to see a lot of confirmation of the excellent reporting from the CNN team.",

They're talking to other sources, people who may be supporters of the former president, just sort of trying to get an idea of will people come to Miami.You know, the president telling folks to come out and support him, saying he's going to be here on Tuesday. Is that going to drive people who are his supporters to come out on Tuesday, perhaps upset over what's happening, and try to start some kind of trouble? Of course, you know, what's on the minds of many in law enforcement is January 6th, and that's why the preparations are underway. You know, we know that security officials here in Miami from the local level to the federal level all met today to prepare for Tuesday. So, it's really going to take a few days before they have any kind of idea or handle on whether people are going to come here to try and cause any kind of trouble. You'll remember in New York City when he was over at the criminal courthouse in Manhattan, they didn't get so many supporters. But it's a different place. So, we'll see.

In Miami, depending on the size of crowds or what they get or don't get, that's a much smaller police department. They're going to need more help from other agencies. But perhaps more on point, Josh Campbell, my former FBI colleague and current CNN colleague, reported today that the FBI, kind of mindful of the January 6th events were -- they had some intel but they weren't pushing it out to local law enforcement in any organized way that it was getting the distribution it should have. They've tasked all 56 field offices and their intel people to say, check with your sources, who is talking about doing something, not just in Miami but anywhere else. You'll recall after the Mar-a-Lago search, there was a guy who opened fire with a semiautomatic weapon on an FBI office.

But Ric Grenell, who was Office of National Intelligence director, former ambassador to Germany, tweeted at us while we were talking tonight, and it's the first person who is connected to Trump that made a substantive argument. He said -- for me, to tone down the clutching -- but said, I have personal experience that they lie about and dramatize classifications. They regularly call something a national security threat that is simply a public relations threat. So, I wonder over the next few days, is this going to be some some of what you see from Republicans basically saying the contents of this indictment can't be trusted because we have not yet seen the documents, which, by the way, we've seen a list, but we haven't seen the documents.

Florida is Trump's home state. In Miami- Dade County, Trump got 46% of the vote. Forty-six percent of a 12- person jury is 5.5 jurors.
