I'm Kaitlan Collins, coming to you live, tonight, from where history will be made, tomorrow.We are the birthplace of CNN, our headquarters, here in Atlanta, where exactly 24 hours from now, the moment that everyone has been waiting for, will finally happen, right here on CNN. As you can see, the stage is set. And for the first time, in four years, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will meet face-to-face, right there, at what you're looking at. They'll be standing eight feet apart, with former President Trump on the left side of your screen, and President Biden on the right side. We're going to give you a behind-the-scenes look from that stage, this hour. And this is also a live look at the spin room. This time, tomorrow, it will be packed with politicos, and those vying to be Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, and a bunch of reporters as well. There's a lot to talk about, this hour. And coming up, I'll go one-on- one with Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, who drew the ire of Donald Trump, survived it, cruised to reelection in spite of it, and is now voting for him in 2024. It's a fascinating conversation that you won't want to miss, on the eve of this debate, here in Georgia, where Brian Kemp will also make a bit of news. But we begin with our political all-stars, this hour, including the moderator of that first Trump-Biden debate, four years ago. That would be my colleague, Chris Wallace, who is here with us. Also joining us, CNN Commentator, and former Obama administration official, Van Jones. Former Special Assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings. And also, CNN's Special Correspondent, Jamie Gangel. And Chris, I think everyone wants to know what you are thinking. I mean, these clips of this debate have been -- being played back-and- forth, ad nauseam. What's it like for you, to watch that and to think about this, four years later?",

On the other hand, I actually think was one of the most consequential presidential debates in history. I actually think Donald Trump lost the presidency, in that debate, by his performance. He dropped about four or five points. He never regained it. And, he's -- the key question for tomorrow night is has he learned his lesson? I've talked to a lot of people, in the top echelons of his staff. They say, he finally understands how badly he did, in the 2020 debate. And the two words that are coming out, you don't usually hear from the Trump camp, are nice and respectful. He intends to be both. We'll see if both happens. But no, I'm telling you, he says the night may devolve the way it will. But he very much intends not to make that same mistake. And as far as Joe Biden is concerned, I think the key question is, are we going to see the Joe Biden of Old, or the old Joe Biden?",

As we briefly mentioned earlier, \"Bloomberg News\" reporting, tonight, on a document that it says was mistakenly posted on the Supreme Court's website, then quickly removed.If that is how the opinion ends up being officially released, if it stands to what we saw today, then that means the Supreme Court is poised to allow what we talked about earlier this week, emergency abortions in Idaho, when a pregnant patient's health is at serious risk. That would buck, for now, one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation that we've seen playing out. And according to \"Bloomberg,\" here, this is also important. It's an unsigned six-three draft opinion. And it shows Chief Justice Roberts, John Roberts, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, and also Brett Kavanaugh, joining the courts liberals here, in this decision, signaling a potential win, for reproductive rights, at least temporarily, while this case is going to continue to move through the lower courts. I should note, CNN has not been able to independently review this draft opinion, since it was taken down so quickly. But I do want to talk about this with our source, tonight, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, and the Biden campaign surrogate, Maura Healey. Governor, obviously, you and I've talked about abortion, regularly, and what that has looked like since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. If this is the decision that they stick with, and we'll see when they officially release -- release it officially, maybe tomorrow, what does it make you -- does it change your view of the court, if this is what they decide, if they do allow these emergency abortions to happen in Idaho? GOV. MAURA HEALEY (D-MA): Absolutely not. And I'll tell you why, Kaitlan. When we talked about this, two years ago, with Dobbs, and Trump's promise coming through? I mean, he promised to overturn Roe. He built the court. And they did just that. When we -- when that happened, we talked about how bad this would be for women. And since that time, more women had been put at risk, more women are dying now, pregnant women are dying at childbirth. And it's insane, what's been happening, with state after state, and extremists pushing an agenda, trying to take away abortion, contraception, IVF. I mean, we've seen a litany of things, right? All the court did, if this is indeed the decision, all the court did is say, oh, basically, if you're a pregnant woman, and you're in need of emergency care at a hospital, and that means having to receive an emergency abortion? You no longer have to be airlifted out of the state. They don't even actually decide the case, which is whether or not the federal law that requires hospitals to provide emergency care, whether that even trumps the Idaho draconian ban. So, people should take no comfort in this. We need to continue to talk about it. Because one in three American women, today, Kaitlan, live in states with abortion bans. That is outrageous. And if they come for women's rights, which they're doing it now, taking away our freedoms, everyone's freedoms are at risk.",

He's obviously also got to talk about the economy and his vision, and the two different worlds that a Biden presidency and a Trump presidency pose.But on the abortion issue, Kaitlan, we know this is something, once people understand it, it really matters. That's why we've seen these elections, and these ballot initiatives, with so many people turn out. The vast majority of Americans, Republican and Democrat, in fact, believe in and support a woman's freedom to choose, and to make a health care decision like that for herself. But unfortunately, we have zealots and extremists, who've just invaded state legislatures. And we have some Republican governors, who have been bragging alongside Trump, in efforts to take away access to abortion, and needed reproductive health care. So, I hope President Biden talks to the American public straight about this and continues to push this as an issue. Because, fundamentally, Kaitlan -- and I was a former Attorney General. I'm used to protecting people's rights, protecting freedoms. And women are bearing the brunt of this, right now. But no one's safe here. And that's what people have got to understand. Same with the economic picture, OK? And I don't know if you want to talk about that or not. But Donald Trump, he brags -- he brags about two things, right? He brags about overturning Roe, and he brags about his tax cuts to the wealthy, which he wants to renew, if he's elected. He also, at the same time, wants to raise costs for the middle-class, essentially, by cutting our Medicare and Social Security. So, I think these things have got to be really front and center, in tomorrow night's conversation and debate.",
