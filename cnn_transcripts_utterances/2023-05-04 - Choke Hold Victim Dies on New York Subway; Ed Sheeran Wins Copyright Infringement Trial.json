They are still deliberating related to the fate of one person who has also been already convicted by this jury of things that he did that day on January 6. But the big centerpiece of this case where prosecutors were trying to prove and they were arguing to the jury that these men came together, they made an agreement, and then they worked toward making sure that there was violence after the 2020 election, that they were radicalizing their followers, and that, on January 6, they had a plan to get not just their followers, but other Trump supporters on the grounds of the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol so revved up that those people would want to overcome the police force and get inside the building. All of that, the jury does seem to be agreeing with, especially with those verdicts returned related to seditious conspiracy, obstruction, and conspiracy to obstruct the proceeding on January 6. Those are very, very big things for the jury to have found at this point in this case. They are going to keep deliberating. But I did want to just make and underline exactly how serious this seditious conspiracy charge is. It's not one that the Justice Department brings often. And it's certainly one that is difficult for the Justice Department to secure in court, to have judges allow it to go forward to trial and then have juries find people guilty of it. And it is a charge that says that the Justice Department has to prove there was a conspiracy to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the U.S. government to levy war potentially against the government, to oppose by force the authority of the United States or by force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution of any law.

At the same time, the jury found that even one of these defendants who wasn't present at the time, but who was involved in discussions and planning and comments and things, that, in fact, he was guilty of seditious conspiracy. If you're a prospective defendant in some other cases, you would take no comfort in that, because it looks like you could be charged as well. So, there will be sentencing. There will be an appeal.

Last night, Kyiv saying that the last three nights are kind of the worst since the year began last night, and many drones taken down out of the sky, not actually hitting targets in the capital. Similar story over Odessa as well in the south of the country. So, compared to previous nights where we have seen cities across the country with civilian targets hit and loss of life, last night not the worst, but, yesterday, in Kherson city, recently liberated from Russian occupiers, 24 people lost their lives in the shelling of a shopping center and a railway station, clear civilian areas being hit by repeated shelling. Now, this isn't really, I think, the escalation Ukrainians are worried about. When Russia in that statement, where they presented no evidence, but said there'd been an attempted assassination on the president, said that they reserve the right to retaliate, even today, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, didn't go into what that wouldn't necessarily mean. He said that Vladimir Putin was calm and considered after this incident and even referred to how the damage to the Kremlin roof was two bits of copper that probably would get fixed later on today. So, a lot of concern here about what this may be teeing up in terms of a Russian response, but Ukraine's counteroffensive likely imminent.",

We're hoping that perhaps they will address reporters right here behind me. But this is a very significant moment for the music industry. Ed Sheeran said when he took the stand in his testimony that this was a common four-chord progression. And attorneys for Ed Sheeran laid it all out over the course of a few days, showing that this four- chord progression that is in \"Let's Get It On\" that's also in Ed Sheeran's \"Thinking Out Loud\" was commonplace, that it was in dozens of songs before \"Thinking Out Loud\" and also in songs that predate \"Let's Get It On.\" And so Ed Sheeran had said:  If you all do this and make it so that every time a musician has to go to the Townsend family to use this four-chord progression, that I'm done. I can't even be a musician anymore. [13:15:05] And it made a -- they made very strong closing arguments, Ed Sheeran's legal team, saying that this would stifle the creativity of musicians everywhere and that that is not what copyright law is all about.

She did also take time, Brianna, to mention in her statement just how much she believed that mental health was a factor in all of this, saying: \"This mental -- mental illness is real. And when we say it's real, from the medical standpoint, it is real. And when someone is saying they need help or you see that they are acting out of sorts, they need help. Help them. Just don't disregard them.\" So, you see the focus there being put on mental health by the mother. She did tell our local affiliate here WSB that her son became agitated after being denied a prescription for Ativan, which is an anti-anxiety medication -- Brianna.",

And we want to warn you that this video we're about to show you is very disturbing. A source says the man with the white T-shirt was homeless, his name, Jordan Neely. The witness who took this video said Neely had been -- quote -- \"acting erratically.\" And that's when another subway writer came up from behind and put him in that choke hold for at least three minutes. Neely was later pronounced dead at the hospital. CNN has not confirmed what happened before that video was taken. CNN's Omar Jimenez is joining us now. And, Omar, before you give us details, we know you just got some new information about this victim, Jordan Neely. Tell us.",

But part of what we're learning is, a witness is saying that, based on what he saw, there's no way that these two would have interacted before this actually unfolded. And that's because this witness says, as soon as Neely entered the subway car, he began yelling almost immediately. And, according to this witness, he was yelling: \"I don't care if I die. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't have any food. I'm done.\" Not long after, that's when the witness says that this other passenger came up behind Jordan Neely and put him in a choke hold that, at the very least, lasted several minutes. And once the train stopped, passengers ran off. And this witness says, despite any of the frightening behavior, is how he described it, that was happening beforehand, he didn't see Neely specifically attack anyone before this happened. But, nevertheless, Neely eventually lost consciousness, was later pronounced dead. The medical examiner classified that death as being because of the compression of the neck. As you mentioned, no charges have been filed at this point, but a law enforcement source is telling CNN this man has been interviewed and was released and that all of this is part of an investigation. I should also mention, a law enforcement source says this man is a 24- year-old former Marine with no apparent criminal record, Jessica.",
