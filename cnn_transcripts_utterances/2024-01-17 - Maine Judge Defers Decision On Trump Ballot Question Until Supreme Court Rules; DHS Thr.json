Your reaction to this news that a judge in state court decided to wait until the Supreme Court weighs in. TOM SAVIELLO, CHALLENGED DONALD TRUMP'S ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MAINE BALLOT: Judge Murphy is a very thoughtful justice and I am sure she went through all of this to try to understand best what she needed to do. I was trying to figure out what she could do. She could follow state law and say, hey, according to state law the secretary of state did the right thing. But I think ultimately her decision to send it back to the U.S. Supreme Court where it will be decided no matter what we do in Maine is the right decision.",

      "sentences": "In talking with Republicans, it depends on who you ask whether it is a Senate Republican or House Republican. There is a big split when it comes to how they are approaching these negotiations.Over in the Senate, there are some bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to work out a deal on the southern border. That is key to unlocking that additional aid for both Israel and Ukraine. So Republicans are insisting all of those issues be linked together. Moments ago, Mitch McConnell, the Senate GOP leader, expressed optimism that they will be able to have a deal and potentially could vote on a big package like that as soon as next week. Over at the House, I reported just recently Speaker Mike Johnson, on a conference call, said that the Senate deal, the details he has seen thus far would be dead on arrival in the house. And that he is insistent on H.R.-2, which is a House GOP border security bill and it would be the starting point for any negotiations. So the meeting at the White House today will be a tough sales job for President Biden in trying to convince Speaker Mike Johnson to go along with a border immigration compromise in order to unlock additional Ukraine aid. We expect the president to make a forcible case for why additional resources are needed to aid Ukraine in their fight against Russia. But that's a message that, up until this point, has fallen on deaf ears at least when it comes to House Republicans. Biden and Speaker Johnson do not have much of a relationship. They did have a brief phone call and brief meeting since Johnson has become speaker. This'll be the first time that Johnson is on a setting and a stage like this where he is part of this big meeting with congressional leaders. So we will see what comes out of it, if anything. As of right now, the prospects for a border deal and therefore Ukraine and Israel aid looking really tough at the moment -- guys?",

Sanjay, so many people are focused on this. They have so many questions about this. The first episode on now is about the relationship between body weight in our health. How should we be thinking about weight as it pertains to our health? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is really interesting. As you mentioned, about a decade ago, they started classifying obesity as a disease in and of itself but still drawing the connection between weight and health is a complicated one. Most people use body mass index, but we found out that that some 200 years old and was originally designed for Belgian soldier. It has increasingly less relevance into today's day and world. Still, that's how people will often qualify someone as being obese or not. I talked to Doctor Fatima Cody Stanford, who is an obesity medicine doctor, specifically about what she looks for in terms of trying to draw this connection. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. FATIMA CODY STANFORD, OBESITY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN &amp; SCIENTIST, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL: You can't just judge the book by its cover and assume that someone who is larger is unhealthy and someone who is lean is healthy, right? That is the assumption that they will make. I call that practicing streetcorner medicine. We are going to coin that today on the show, Sanjay. I want to look beneath this --",

Beyond the physiology, which we just talked about and all of those blood values, but also looking at the functional sort of aspect, how well is the person getting around. Somebody can be quite heavy but getting along quite well. And that physiology, she would not classify them as unhealthy.What is interesting, Boris, is obesity, we think of it as one sort of thing, but they are starting to think of subtypes, obesity subtype A, subtype B, subtype C. Because you find that different people respond better to different interventions. There are people who respond really well to lifestyle changes in type A, don't work at all for people in type B, who may be better candidates for medications. Or even Type C, potentially for surgery. So we are getting to that level of granularity in terms of figuring this out.",
