Well, perhaps that was why some of those drones, 15 of them fired at Odesa, the southern command in Ukraine, saying that they shot down 12 of those drones, three others falling on educational facilities. And on those drones, as you said, the words were \"for Moscow,\" \"for the Kremlin.\" So, is that the Kremlin's answer?City officials in Kyiv saying it was the heaviest bombardment there or have a series of missile assaults that they had witnessed this year. But none hit the city. They were all taken down by defensive systems. There were parts of those missiles that did land actually in Kyiv, but none of the missiles were able to get through the air defenses and hit their targets. But where it was the heaviest and most devastating strike by Russia in the past 24 hours was in Kherson in the south and east of the country. And there, according to Ukrainian officials, 539 artillery strikes, that is a massive ratcheting up. 82 of them at the train station there. President Zelenskyy's office releasing some devastate images of the civilian casualties -- 23 killed, 46 wounded, two of those children. And so, Kherson which is perhaps one of those places Russia expects of Ukraine potentially launching its counteroffensive, that came in with the heaviest bombardment and highest number of civilian casualties. [04:05:08] Response from the Kremlin not clear. Perhaps Kherson more likely preemptive Russian attacks trying to head off what they see as a coming Ukrainian counteroffensive.",

And we've analyzed the granular for the details of these videos, the times on the clock tower at Red Square, where you can see the drones flying past. The people on the ground, the car, all kinds of things to ascertain that there were two drones 16 minutes apart coming in from different directions.But we don't know where exactly they came from. We don't know who fired the drones. So, we don't know if the facts of the Kremlin are reporting, and that this came from Ukraine bear out in real life. But in a sense that doesn't really matter. What matters in Russia is what the Kremlin is saying. They went straight to the extreme option calling this an assassination attempt on Putin. Clearly that looks like an attempt to stir up sort of vengeful feelings among the Russian public ahead of Victory Day to sort of to have justification for this war. It has also sparked a reaction from hardliners in the Kremlin, several in the Kremlin sort of the political elites, including former President Medvedev, calling directly for the assassination of President Zelenskyy. And I think calling it a terrorist attack also a significant that we've seen an uptick in that kind of rhetoric from Russia recently. That will justify more surveillance at home. Things like border checks, law enforcement, all of that that we've seen increase throughout the course of this war. So, I think critical to watch how this continues to impact public opinion in Russia.",

And Nic Robertson, thank you in eastern Ukraine for us.Now there's increasing concern that another regional U.S. bank might be in financial trouble. Shares of Pacific Western Bank fell by more than 50 percent in after-hours trading. It came after Bloomberg reported the bank is exploring strategic options including a possible sale or split. But worst fate, a run on its profits back in March. But the bank says that customers have stopped pulling out their money and unlike other banks that have recently failed, most of Pacific Bank deposits are Federally insured. And we're keeping a close eye on U.S. markets after this PacWest report and the Feds latest interest rate hike. Here is where U.S. market futures stand right now. So, things are looking positive at this stage. Wall Street is coming off a down day triggered not so much by that rate hike -- which investors were expecting -- but by the Fed chairman's suggestion that the board is taking a wait and see approach to any future hikes. That's uncertainty and Wall Street doesn't like. This is the tenth consecutive time that the Fed have raised its benchmark interest rate dating all the way back to March of last year. It now stands at a 5 to 5 in its quarter percent. The idea is cooling inflation by raising borrowing costs. It will discourage demand, credit. And as the theory goes, that in turn will slow spending and keep prices from rising. CNN's Matt Egan has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He was captured in the suburbs here in Cobb County, Georgia about 11 miles northwest of where the shootings took place. Right here at a gated community, a condominium called Waterford Place, we saw police cars speeding down the street and entering inside there. We thought maybe it was just a tip. We had heard all day that the belief was that he was in the suburban Cobb County.15 minutes after the police entered, we talked to an officer who came out who confirmed to us that Deion Patterson had been captured. We talked to neighbors inside this condominium community. As we said, people have been saying all day, authorities, thought it was very possible that he was here in Cobb County. Cameras picked up the license plate on a car that he allegedly car jacked and it indicated the car that he then abandoned was only two blocks away from here. So, police were searching the whole area. They went inside and according to the women who lived there -- who we just talk to a short time ago -- they told us they heard dogs barking and they weren't stopping barking. It was very unusual because they knew this man might be in Cobb County. They were suspicious. One of the women had a hunch. She called the police and said we have a pool and gazebo area, it's possible that he's there. We heard the dogs barking there. The police entered. The next thing the ladies tell us, that the police yelled, get on the ground.\" And they realized that this man had been caught. And now he is in custody.

And then in addition to that, another militant operative who was with them.Now the Israeli Security Forces said that they were part of the Hamas military group. Hamas subsequently admitted as much, hailing the three -- hailing the two gunmen as heroes of the Jordan Valley operation. Now, I subsequently received a statement -- an audio statement from Leo Dee, in which he said: I and the kids were delighted to hear that the terrorists were eliminated today. Most of all, that it was done in a way that apparently did not endanger the lives of Israeli soldiers. Now subsequently we heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who tweeted over the last half hour. Saying, we settled the account with the murderers of Lucy, Maia and Rina. Adding, as is often the case with situations like this, it doesn't matter where you try to hide, we will find you. And Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, also saying that as he promised to Leo Dee, Israel's defense establishment will reach any terrorist that harms our citizens.

He is accused of shooting and killing five people including a 9-year-old at his neighbor's house on a Friday after they asked him to stop firing his gun so close to their house. The suspect's long-time partner is now facing a felony charge. Investigators say that she helped him evade police for days, giving him food and clothes and arranging transport to the house that he was later captured.Serbia is also trying to come to grips with a horrific mass shooting. A very rare occurrence in the country. Police say that it was committed by a 13-year-old boy who shot and killed nine people in his elementary school in Belgrade on Wednesday. Officials say that the suspect showed no remorse and his motive is under investigation. His parents were also arrested. Serbia's president is now pushing for changes to the law to hold young criminal suspects in cases like this accountable. For more, let's go to CNN's Fred Pleitgen. He joins us from Belgrave. Fred, I wonder how the country is feeling especially when there is this law in place that says someone can't be held criminally responsible until they're at the age of 14 especially when were learning more details and it seems that this attack was heavily premeditated.",
