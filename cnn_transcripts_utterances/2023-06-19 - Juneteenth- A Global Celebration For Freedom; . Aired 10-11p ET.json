Black folk joke around like Martin and have paintings from J.J. in the living room. It sounds strong. It looks like sacrifice, there will be flowers blooming in the summertime. Black sound like old songs, something like good food and taste like heart disease, it feel like Maze (ph) at jazz fest.Black sound like something that I heard, like a hard test. Black sound like skin, like something dark. Black sound like hair, yes, black sound like rub hair and good hair. It's sound like history, like spiritual, like years like working, like night, like Walmart, like Cornerstone, like cash register singing. But look it look like Oprah. It ages well like Cecily Tyson. It sing like Nina. It got a bad shape like Serena. Black like sound like broken homes and Section A, it smells like crack and collard greens, like big Sunday hats, some little black girl ribbons. Like Tyler Perry making money. Sound like Hayden (ph) feel frustrated and daunted, like they won't ever get it, huh, like America won't ever get it, huh, like you've got to push your personal feelings of racial injustice so far underneath the carpet that, whoops, you tripped over your own family history but I love me some black folk. I love to have Greece and the rental fees, the police, the projects, government assistance, (INAUDIBLE) black big bags are here, fake press, all nails, gold chain, gold teeth, black men, big feet. I just love me some black folk. They are the people that were made that from the darkest parts of the sky. And I pray every day that we can truly all return home because I for one truly love me, some black folk.",
