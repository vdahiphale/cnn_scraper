I'm Omar Jimenez in for Fredricka Whitfield.We've got a lot to get to, starting with just weeks -- we're weeks away to go until the start of the 2024 presidential race. GOP front runner Donald Trump just scored a major legal victory against Special Counsel Jack Smith in that the Supreme Court issued a one sentence judgment yesterday, bluntly rejecting Smith's request to fast-track arguments on the president's -- on the former president's immunity case. So, what comes next? CNN's Evan Perez breaks it down for us.",

      "sentences": "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by federal prosecutors to skip the appellate court and have the High Court decide whether Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution in the election subversion charges.The decision deals a significant blow to Special Counsel Jack Smith's effort to keep a March 4th trial date on track. That's a lot harder now that prosecutors will have to wait several weeks while the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs the same consequential questions. Now, Trump is arguing that he has immunity for actions that he took while in office to pursue his claims of election fraud. He also claims that because he was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate, prosecuting him would violate the Constitution's double jeopardy clause. Trump's attorneys urged the Supreme Court to stay out of the dispute for now, saying that the special counsel was, \"trying to rush to decide the issues with reckless abandon.\" The justice department had argued that the fact that this case deals with an unprecedented criminal trial of a former president, required taking the unusual step of bypassing the appeals court. The special counsel said, the public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate definitive decision by this Court. Now, the one sentence rejection by the Supreme Court on Friday didn't come with any additional explanation. There is no notice of the sense among the justices. But Trump's claim of immunity could make its way back to the High Court in the thick of the political calendar. The D.C.-based appeals court has scheduled or oral arguments on the immunity question for January 9th. And that is just days before the Iowa caucus on January 15th.",

In that case, the Supreme Court, they leapfrog the appeals court to quickly hear a case, in which the justices ultimately rejected then-President Richard Nixon's claims of presidential privilege in a subpoena fight over Oval Office tape.

So, it is set out in our constitution as a federal authority. And they need the opportunity to do that. We also -- it's not also helpful to treat those who are coming to our borders, though, is there an invading army. They are people who are fleeing to the border.

When you look at where these migrants are crossing, it's not just one particular sector, it's all across the border.And so, it is a major challenge for the administration that -- in that area, but it's also a major political challenge for President Biden, as it has been for so many presidents before him. This is really an intractable issue, that few presidents have really managed in a way that gains approval from all sides. One thing that President Biden is doing is trying to apply pressure on the Mexican president, they held a phone call last week, and what President Biden really wants to do is increase enforcement on that side of the border. So, it will curb some of these flows that you're seeing into the United States. The White House has also requested $14 billion from Congress for more enforcement along the border to bolster resources, to increase the personnel that are trying to manage these flows to process them when they come into the United States. But right now, that money is caught up in a back and forth between Democrats and Republicans who do want to reform some of these migration rules. And that has been in a negotiation that's ongoing. Congress did leave town for the holidays. So, it won't be until they come back until that money is approved. But, when it comes down to it, President Biden is caught in a bind here, certainly, from Republicans and even some Democrats who want him to do more to stem the flow of migrants. But also on the other side, from progressives, from immigration advocates who do worry that some of the rules changes that are being discussed would amount to a reversion to some of the highly restrictive policies in the Trump administration. So, certainly, as we head into this election year, this will be an issue that continues to weigh on President Biden as the election heats up, Omar.",

Whether it's positioning more troops in southern Mexico to sort of intercept the flows coming from Central and Southern America, but also ramping up personnel along the U.S.-Mexico border, on that side.This is something that the U.S. has been discussing with Mexico for some time. And in fact, administration officials do believe that they have made some progress on that front. They describe a level of cooperation with Mexico that they're pleased with.

But if I were to step just a few feet to the right, I would be drenched in a matter of minutes, especially about five minutes ago, when the rain was coming down so hard, you could hear it really pounding on the roof. People are living on the elements right now in Gaza in these conditions, maybe they've been able to put up makeshift tents, in some cases. Just imagine now having to be told that you have a matter of hours to pack up your family, when everybody is hungry. The entire population of Gaza 2.2 million people facing acute hunger right now. It's exhausting, when you don't have enough food to eat, to have to pack up, and then, be told to go somewhere else in this kind of weather. You have no idea where you can go, you have no idea where it's going to be safe, where there is not going to be airstrikes, with airstrikes happening all around you. That is the situation that people in Gaza are facing right now. And yet, Israel insists that this is what they have to do to carry out their military objectives of eliminating the Hamas leadership. And you mentioned, one of the officials that in charge of smuggling weapons, the IDF says was killed in a jet fighter strike, within the last day or so. I want to also tell you about what this -- what people are saying. What the United Nations is saying about these force movements of Gazans. Some of these families have had to relocate not just once or twice, but three or four times. 80 percent or more of the population at this point is displaced. So, let me just read you this quote from Thomas White, head of the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees. He says, \"People in Gaza are people. They are not pieces on a checkerboard. Many have already been displaced several times. The Israeli army just orders people to move into areas where there are ongoing airstrikes. No place is safe, nowhere to go.\" So, misery on top of misery, and now even more uncertainty for so many families in Gaza with these new -- with these new orders to move, or else, they could die.",

The IPC says this is the highest catastrophic level of food insecurity they have ever classified for any given area or country, since they have been keeping records. Let that sink in for a moment.And it's impossible to get supplies like food in, because safely, you just can't -- you can't do it. You can't do it when there is a constant bombardment, there is -- there is intense ground fighting happening right now. And so, people are essentially trapped in Gaza.

And that's comes in straight from Israel. So, there should be more trucks that can get in. But as you just heard from Will, that doesn't help you very much if you're in an active war zone.

They're getting squeezed, and they just are family farms.

California's State Water Board has approved a regulation that aims to turn recycled sewage into pure drinking water.It may sound extreme, but officials say it will help fight climate change and cut the state's dependence on the Colorado River. The wastewater would, of course, be extensively treated before going from a flush to the faucet. But for more perspective, I want to bring Heather Cooley because she's the director of research at The Pacific Institute. Heather, walk us through this process. How would this actually work?",

We recycle about 25 percent of the wastewater that we generate each year.Much of that is happening by taking the water and then using it, treating it, using it for irrigation, using it for agriculture. We are also already treating that water to a high degree and then putting it into groundwater or putting it into reservoirs. And then treating that water again and using it for drinking water. What these regulations are allowing us to do is to take that highly treated water, using the most-sophisticated technologies we have available to purify that water. And instead of putting it into groundwater or a reservoir, putting it directly into the drinking water system. So it's using reverse osmosis membranes, it's using advanced oxidation, and it's using carbon filtration. It's really three layers of protection to provide, again, a safe, clean, reliable supply of water.",

Initially, there was a yuck factor, I think, particularly back in the 1990s, which is when that phrase \"toilet to tap\" came about.But there's been a lot more experience, there's been more comfort with recycled water. We're already using it for lots of different purposes. What we're seeing is that there's growing public acceptance of recycled water, and now reuse of recycled water, direct reuse of recycled water. That being said, there's still, I think, a need for greater education and outreach about the technology, about the plants that are already doing this.
