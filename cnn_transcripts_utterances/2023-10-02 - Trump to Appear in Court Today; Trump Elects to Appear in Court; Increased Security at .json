Donald Trump is about to leave Trump Tower in Manhattan to be present for opening statements in a civil trial that could cost him control of much of his business empire. Now, as you are watching everything unfold this morning, remember, in a sense this is a campaign event. Trump is choosing to be here. He did not have to attend this trial, but he is, and he is publicizing it. We're going to explain why. And the first major ruling we expect in just a few minutes is whether cameras will be allowed in court.",

In the lawsuit the attorney general accuses Trump of falsely inflating his wealth by as much as $3.6 billion. She says that he engaged in decades-long fraud, essentially to pump up the value of his businesses to get better interest rates and secure better loans. Inflating values when it suited him and also deflating values when it helped him as well.",

So, you can't see what's to my left but what is to my left is a podium for New York Attorney General Letitia James. We are expecting her to make some comments before she heads into the courtroom, which is going to be an interesting face-off when Trump does arrive, and as you guys just said, sit in the courtroom for the opening statements for his -- the civil trial as well. Remember, she is the one who brought this case against Trump, his organization, his adult sons, asking for $250 million and other penalties for falsifying business records allegedly for many of his fortune, his mass fortune, his business empire.And it's going to be an interesting trial because he is also on her list of witnesses. He's on the defense side as well. But it's possible, and we are told he's eager to testify in his own defense, although we don't expect that to happen today. What's also going to be noteworthy today is the fact that he is going to be in front of this judge. Now, remember, this judge made a huge ruling last week in deciding that he and his sons and Trump Org are liable for fraud in inflating some of those assets and striking some serious penalties, like stripping their business certificates, as well as saying that they are going to basically pave the road for the fact that they are going to owe the state of New York money. So, Trump said he wants to be here, he wants to fight for his name and reputation, and he's going to see that judge face-to-face. And that is key because, remember, this is a bench trial. That judge is going to call the balls and strikes. He is going to decide the penalties. He is going to say how much money will be owed. It is not a jury trial, so there's a lot to look out for in these opening statements. Again, we are waiting for Letitia James to come here to make some comments and we're also waiting for Trump to arrive as well. Guys.",

So, I've talked to a number of his allies and advisers who say that Trump has become increasingly agitated about this specific trial, particularly the valuation of his properties made by the judge, who talked about how Trump has sold himself as a successful and rich businessman. It's not just his business, it's also his brand. And it's not just his social brand, it is his political brand.When he was running in 2016, a big part of his argument to voters was, I am successful. Look at all of my riches. I can make you rich. I can do all the things for you that I've done for myself. Obviously, if he has been inflating that, that is going to conflict directly with the message that he has been sending about the kind of president he would be in the middle of a campaign again for president in 2024. Now, you talk about this being a campaign event. It really is. Just moments ago, right before we started speaking, they blasted out an email attacking Letitia James, just like they would a political opponent. We know that they are weaponizing these trials, saying that these are because he is running for office, that these are Democrats, that this is election interference and it's going to be no different with this. Now, I am told that he wanted to have a show of force by showing up today. Obviously, as we continue to say, he's not expected to testify today. But we are told that he has indicated to lawyers he would like to testify. Now, whether or not he'll be called, whether or not his lawyers would even allow him to do that, that remains to be seen. He often says that he would like to testify, but then ends up not doing so. And then one post on Truth Social I just want to show you, because this is really part of this fixation here. Of course, he talks at the top here about, I'm going to court tomorrow to fight for my name and reputation. But then he goes on to say this, \"he,\" being the judge, \"values Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach,\" his home, \"$18 million.\" This particular valuation has driven Trump crazy according to many people who have talked to him in recent weeks. He continues to say it's not true, that it's worth more money. And again, it goes to not just this idea of his business, but his brand as a person and as it relates to him running in 2024.",

This is the civil court, the civil supreme court. And viewers looking at this courthouse may find it familiar because it's very famous. Many movies, \"Law and Order\" something that has been shot here. What won't happen is that Mr. Trump will not be taking the 32 steps up into the courthouse. What we believe is going to happen is, he's going to be entering here on the side, on Pearl Street. There's an entrance here. There's Secret Service agents and NYPD officers all up and down this street because that is the street we believe he's going to go in. There's a side door there. But when you look around, Kate, you can see, this is the area where a lot of the anti-Trump protesters have gathered. We are not seeing a lot of Trump supporters out here. We're mostly seeing just a few, there aren't many, anti-Trump supporters. And then when you look this way you can see more security all along here with NYPD and, of course, all of these barriers that are set up all across this courthouse and this street. They've blocked most of the street off to pedestrians. People can't really walk up and down the street. They're still allowing some traffic.

There's not going to be a jury in this case, but ordinarily you would want the jury or the judge to see the person there to say they care, they're invested in this.

So I think probably, first and foremost, is going to be the amount of the penalties, monetary penalties. But then there are other penalties that the attorney general has sought as well, including barring Trump and his sons from holding certain offices, and corporate offices in the future in New York state, as well as just the mechanics of what's going to happen if the businesses are dissolved, as the judge has already ordered, what does that mean? Will there be a receiver appointed to unwind them? Can they have - still be the beneficial owners in certain ways? So, there are a lot of specifics to address.

And Donald Trump actually appears on his own witness list and on the attorney general's witness list.If and when it comes down to time for Donald Trump to testify, if the attorney general tries to force him on the stand, and his children - his adult children, who have been named in this case as well, Donald Trump will have two choices, one is to testify. And it's worth noting he already has given a deposition in this case. It's a videotaped deposition.",

I think they're probably maybe still on -- they might be heading on to the FDR now. But you have traffic continuing along the other side as life in Manhattan must continue. Talk about all the security, all the planning that has to go into this. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, this has become a bit of a well-worn path. You know, they have had to bring him through New York on these cases a few times already. But what you're seeing is, as the motorcade moves through the street, it has the police escort, it has the Secret Service vehicles. And while the route, as you point out, is not a frozen route, as he would have received as president of the United States, and that's a motorcade that I used to actually be the leader of the team that put the New York part of that security together, what you do see is they were holding the intersections, they had motorcycle outriders to go ahead and stop traffic. They intend for him to arrive there no later than 9:45. So, he's going to enter the secure area, which is a locked-down area between the place where he's going, the state supreme court at 60 Center Street. Next door is the federal courthouse. So that side street is frozen, as are the streets behind it. So, they've got a built-in basically secure zone to bring him into, into that courtroom. Now, the question for the NYPD, the question for the Secret Service is, right now they have him scheduled to show up at a hearing, which as Elie pointed out, he's not required to be at, and to hear these allegations and arguments. But how long is he going to stay? Is he going to be there all day through all the proceedings, or is he going to make that appearance and at some point say, OK, I've heard enough and I've made my appearance? So, they're in a very flexible mode in terms of when they have to move out of there and go back to Trump Tower. But so far the schedule has him staying overnight tonight and possibly returning to court tomorrow. So, we're in a little bit of a float when it comes to what that schedule is going to be. As for demonstrators down there between the pro demonstrators and the anti-Trump demonstrators, the numbers are very small. They've created pens that keep the groups separated but within earshot of where they want to call out to and that is where we are now on this move.",

He will be present for the opening statements, we believe, which begin very shortly. We are waiting to hear if the judge will allow cameras for the opening statements.
