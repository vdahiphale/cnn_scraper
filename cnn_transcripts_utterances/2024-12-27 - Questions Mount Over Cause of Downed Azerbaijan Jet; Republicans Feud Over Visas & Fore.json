Azerbaijan Airlines suspending flights from its nation's capital to seven cities in Russia. That's according to the government-owned Azerbaijani press agency, after a passenger jet crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas day. Now, a U.S. official is telling CNN that early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft system may have downed the plane, adding that it may have been a case of mistaken identity in which poorly trained Russian units have fired negligently against Ukraine's use of drones. But a second black box was actually recovered from the downed plane. Authorities hoping it will provide insight into just what led to the disaster, which claimed the lives of at least 38 people. But officials in the region are urging not to speculate about the crash until the investigations have wrapped up. CNN's Bianna Golodryga has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, early indications suggest that a Russian anti- aircraft system may be responsible. A U.S. official told CNN the aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at Southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said.",

The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's federal air transport agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes, and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): The Kremlin expressed condolences for those impacted by the crash and urged against speculation into the cause until the investigations have concluded. Of the 67 people on board, 29 survived, including two children, authorities said. In Azerbaijan, a day of mourning was declared for the dead. Some relatives of the survivors remain on edge, waiting for news on loved ones' recovery. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I don't know what to say, honestly. I spoke with my son today. Thank God his condition is good. If everything goes well today and tomorrow, he will come to Baku. Let's see what happens next. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): For many families of the at least 38 people killed in the crash, answers can't come soon enough. Bianna Golodryga, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, the process of joining NATO means that you have to have both a professional military, and all NATO members have to vote to include you in. So, that's a long process. And Zinke is referring to the fact that that's going to take some time. But it also points out the political headwinds that the Trump administration is walking into. You know, Russia is waging this war and trying to win as much territory as possible before Trump takes office. And this civilian airliner downing could be part of that.",

On the one hand, you have the new addition of Silicon Valley pioneersand businessmen, billionaires, many of them. And then you have that stretching across right to the traditional Trump working-class, grassroots MAGA base. And that's something the president-elect is going to have to deal with during his administration. I think that there is -- there is a need for a discussion about whether the U.S. education system is turning out enough science and technology graduates that can filter into the Silicon Valley industries. I just think that the way that Ramaswamy approached it was not very artful, and it does show some of his rawness as a politician. It's not necessarily contradictory that you can discuss the Trump administration's desire to crack down on border issues and undocumented migration, and consider the need to get more highly- skilled immigrants into the country. You know, immigration legislation has been trying to do that for years but has always failed, because this issue has been so politically polarizing. But it's just the way that this was brought up, I think. And you saw that on social media, as you mentioned. It's going to be very divisive in the Trump coalition.",

Look, I mean, immigration is -- is a -- is an interesting issue here in America. A lot of people have a lot of different opinions. I agree with Stephen. I mean, I think the comments by Vivek Ramaswamy were inartful at best. Look, this H-1B visa program, I think, many people would argue, has been abused by corporations to get these blanket exemptions out there. And I think the problem is it's taking jobs away from many Americans and particularly minorities. And I think if you look at what the voters spoke to, I think their first and foremost priority is, one, stopping the flow of illegal immigration in this country, getting the border closed and under control; and then asking ourselves, OK, who's coming into this country? Why are they coming into this country? How long are they coming into this country? That, to me, is the voters' first priority when it comes to that. And then we can have this discussion about H-1B visas as we go along. But right now, the No. 1 priority is that and getting some of these illegal immigrants who have come in over the course of the last several years out.",

They cut against each other. So -- so, to deal with the cultural anxiety, it's really about white -- traditional, white, Christian, heterosexual male culture, being able to kind of be dominant in America. On the other hand, in the economic side, you've got to have more diversity. You've got to have more immigration. You've got to go out and recruit engineers from different places. Because the truth is, we do need more engineers as global competition for engineers is taking place in the country. So, if we don't have more talent in the United States and get the talent, more skills, and have that talent come from more communities, it's going to be pretty tough for America to compete on the global scale. So, we've got to solve that. But it cuts right against that traditional cultural anxiety that a lot of the folks who joined up with the MAGA coalition are feeling, and it's hard to reconcile those two things.",
