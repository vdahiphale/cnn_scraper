So, it's talk, talk, fight, fight, and convince Putin he has no alternative but to pull out completely.

We're going to have that story and what doctors are doing about it coming up.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:45:31] Right now the U.S. is seeing a shortage of key medicines to treat common childhood illnesses, such as the flu, ear infections, and sore throats, just as an already severe respiratory virus season is getting worse in this country. CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula joins us now. So, I wonder, and God knows my own family and others, we're seeing a lot of cases like this in the last few weeks, what drugs specifically are in short supply and what's being done about it? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you mentioned, it's really an unprecedented combination of RSV, Covid and the flu that is slamming the country, and in particularly children as well. And so when we're talking about the medications that we're seeing in shortage now, we're talking about Tamiflu, which is an antiviral that's often given for the flu to reduce symptoms, reduce severity and shorten the duration of illness. We're also talking about anti- bacterial agents, like amoxicillin and augmentin, those are used typically to treat things like ear infection, pneumonia, strep throat, and then also albuterol, which is an inhaler that many people use who are asthmatic or have reactive airway disease. It does appear like these are rally spot shortages mostly caused by this increase in demand. We know that prescription requests for Tamiflu are at a ten-year high for this time of year and the CDC is really reporting that more than half the states are having high or very high evidence of respiratory viruses. So, we do think that this will resolve hopefully as companies begin to ramp up manufacturing in response, but it's going to take a little while because certainly they made their orders based on their projections earlier, which nobody could have predicted that we would be seeing this.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, don't panic. I mean there are certainly alternatives to many of these medications and they are available. It may require calling the pharmacy, calling to different pharmacies, driving further than you would have hoped. The other thing is that there are other options. So just because you can't get amoxicillin, there are other antibiotics, for example, that can treat. They may be more expensive, they may be broader spectrum, which is not often ideal or have different side effect profiles, but it's worth a discussion. And then there may be different ways to formulate the drug. So, actually, the FDA has released guidance to pharmacists about be able to take amoxicillin and make it into a liquid form which is palatable for kids.And then, finally, Jim, I'll just add, testing your child is so important. We have tests for RSV and Covid and the flu, and we know that in general 30 percent of antibiotic prescriptions for kids are inappropriate. So, lots of people are receiving antibiotics when they don't need them.",
