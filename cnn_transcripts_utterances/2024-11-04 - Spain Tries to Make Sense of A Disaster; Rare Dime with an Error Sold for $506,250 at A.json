VALENTIN MANZANEQUE FERNANDEZ, LOCAL VOLUNTEER (through translator): The storm hit in the morning but the water didn`t get toward until 8:00 in the evening, yet nobody warned us, nothing. Nobody cared. At 70 years old, I had to go with these old clothes to change but I haven`t even been able to take a shower.

As young girls, Simone and her sister, Adria, spent time in foster care before being adopted by their grandparents, Nellie and Ron Biles, whom they now call mom and dad. Simone began gymnastics at six years old, bursting onto the world scene in 2013 before making her Olympic debut three years later in Rio at the age of 19.

The 32nd president of the United States has been on the front of the dime since 1946. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10. When is a dime not worth 10 cents? Apparently, when it`s worth half a million bucks because it`s missing a single letter. Our Jeremy Roth explains. JEREMY ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Take a look at an ultra-rare dime that just sold for half a million dollars. Let me explain. Normally, the ubiquitous 10-cent piece is, well, a dime a dozen, so to speak, nothing special. But according to auction house Great Collections, this 1975 dime is a very rare exception indeed. Why? Because of this. The absence of a tiny letter S that adorns all dimes struck at the U.S. Proof Mint in San Francisco. See? There it is. Right there. Great Collections says the S-less dime is infinitely rarer with this error. It`s certainly more interesting, or should I say inter-ret-ting? In fact, it`s one of only two examples known to exist and was purchased by an Ohio family in 1978 and held for almost 50 years before being consigned and garnering more than 200 bids, ultimately selling for a record-setting $506,000 and change. See what I did there? (END VIDEOTAPE)",
