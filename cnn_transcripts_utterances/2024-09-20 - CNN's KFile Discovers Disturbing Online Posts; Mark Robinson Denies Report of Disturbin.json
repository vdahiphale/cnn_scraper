We're seeing lots of reports coming out of Israel that the target was Ibrahim Aqil, who is a senior member of the military aspect, the military part of Hezbollah, and this comes just a month and a half after another -- the senior leader of the military part of Hezbollah was killed, Fuad Shukr. And it certainly comes in a week that has seen, you know, first the pager blast, then the walkie-talkie blast and now this.So, it really does represent a dramatic escalation in a week where we've already seen dramatic events here in Lebanon. Really, the tension is boiling over at this point. We could hear ambulances rushing to the scene. So, we'll just try to get you more details as they come in.

      "sentences": "Listen, you have all the ingredients for an escalation here. The U.S. and others view strikes inside Beirut as fundamentally different from Israeli strikes in Southern Lebanon, which are quite frequent. In fact, when I was in Israel last month, in retaliation for that attempted Hezbollah attack, U.S. officials noted, well, Israel's concentrating its fire on the south, not in Beirut. We look at that as, you know, avoiding escalation.So, here, you have strikes in Beirut. You had this massive unprecedented pager and walkie-talkie attack, which is -- can be seen certainly as an escalation by Israel. And keep in mind, it was only a few weeks ago when Hezbollah attempted a massive escalation of their own, this massive missile and rocket barrage that was only caught about a half hour before it took off due to U.S. and Israeli intelligence. So, Israel was able to snuff out that attempted escalation. So, from each side, you have them raising the level here. Add to that Israel saying quite publicly now, we're turning our focus from the south in Gaza to the north, which is not new. Really, it's been a matter of time. When I was in Israel after October 7th, Israeli officials, soldiers, and residents of the north said, once we're done in Gaza, we have to deal with the problem in the north, go after Hezbollah, attempt to push them back from the border. So, all those Israelis who've been forced south can go back to their home. So, it's really been a matter of time before you reach that point of escalation as well. It's a nasty mix. And it's hard to see how we avoid this turning into something much bigger.",

But do they have insiders providing information to the Israelis, which was part of the reason, it's been theorized, that Israel got a heads up prior to that attempted Hezbollah attack last month, right? They -- listen, they infiltrate Hezbollah. So, they're assessing that and might want to do that before they attempt any major escalation.I suppose the one thing that might hold Hezbollah back, and you've heard this for months going back to October 7th is that, Hezbollah doesn't really want a full-scale war with Israel because it calculated that it might very well lose that war, plus they have enormous public opposition within Lebanon to going to war again with Israel. And Hezbollah, it's a terrorist organization, but it's also a political organization in Lebanon. They have to be conscious of their base, as it were as well. But listen, as the attacks escalate, it's hard to see how they don't respond.",

But the talk of a ceasefire there was seen as one way to avoid an escalation in the north. And that that might hold Hezbollah back from an escalation.

It is a tie right at this particular hour. In the governor's race, even before this scandal rocked everything, the Democrat Stein was ahead by 10 points. So, the bottom line was, look, Mark Robinson was very likely to lose this race even before the scandal. Now, he's likely more likely to lose this race.But let's talk about the tie in North Carolina and the importance of that state in this election. All right. So, this is the chance of winning the election if you win North Carolina. The bottom line is this, if Kamala Harris wins in the great state of North Carolina, she's got a 95 percent chance of winning the election. There are many maps in which she can win the election without North Carolina. That's less so for Donald Trump because he has only a 77 percent chance of winning the election if he wins in North Carolina.

Referring to the ongoing fight and uncertainty around, well, keeping the lights on. The battle over passing a government funding bill by the October 1st deadline before the government starts shutting down. House Speaker Mike Johnson's first move failed. He told reporters Thursday, now, we go back to the playbook. There are 10 days to that deadline.What's the playbook? Where are they headed? Joining me right now is Republican Congressman Mike Lawler from New York. Congressman, thanks for jumping in. You told Manu, I think, it was yesterday, that you said, obviously the Speaker's going to have to recalibrate. Bottom line, you said, there's not going to be a shutdown. What is the plan today? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Look, ultimately, I think the speaker's going to have to put a three-month clean CR and maybe have some disaster relief or a -- you know, anything that needs to be in there over the next three months. But we're not having a shutdown with, you know, 46, 47 days to go in election. We will obviously have to complete our appropriations work when we come back in the lame duck session and ensure that the government is funded. Government shutdowns don't help anybody, they actually cost more money there's no savings there. So, to me, this is not a function of saving money and it would be the height of stupidity to shut the government down just before an election. BOLDUAN:  It's refreshing to hear that candid and accurate assessment of what shutdowns do. Axios though is reporting that some conservatives like Ralph Norman, he said -- like here is the -- what their take on a short-term CR, a three-monther and a clean one. Ralph Norman saying that there'll be a lot of disappointment if Johnson goes bipartisan. Asked if Johnson would face a revolt if he moved ahead with a clean three-month bill. Jim Banks said, I sure hope so. And then, you have Donald Trump, who is pushing for a government shutdown when it comes to a clean CR. To that, you say what?",
