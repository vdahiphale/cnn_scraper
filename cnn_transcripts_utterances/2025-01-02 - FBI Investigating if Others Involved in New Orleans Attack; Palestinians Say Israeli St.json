It is 06:00 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, first trade -- trading day, of course, for the New Year. We'll look at the markets as they open. And at natural gas, as Ukraine has now officially cut off the Russian gas supply to Europe. That story also coming up about a half hour from now. Right now, authorities in New Orleans are trying to piece together what led to the deadly truck ramming that shocked the city on New Year's Day. We now know that at least 15 people were killed and dozens were wounded when this vehicle plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street. The attacker identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar was killed in an exchange of fire with police. He was a U.S. Army Veteran with an affinity for ISIS. The FBI called it an act of terrorism and does not believe the driver was solely responsible. This Congressman from New Orleans spoke to CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY CARTER (D-LA): We have evidence that there's more than one. There is an ongoing investigation with limits our ability to talk much more than that, other than to clearly say that this coward did not act alone, and our resources are on the ground, turning over every stone. There will not be a rock big enough for them to hide. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Minutes later, the pilot called out, May Day, May Day, May Day, and then bird strike the plane would then crash a short time later. Now as for the police searches of the airport and airline offices, a search warrant was issued on charges of, quote, professional negligence resulting in death and injury.

President Zelenskyy and other leaders have called on their allies to support to Moldova through this. In terms of Russia, I think, look, Robert Fico has a point. This was about 5 billion in revenues a year, and Russia expects to make over 200 billion from its energy exports in the next year. So, 5 billion here or there is not going to make a huge difference, although Russia is, of course, watching its revenues very closely under sanctions. Now, as for the impact on the EU going forward, there is a concern around prices. They have ticked up slightly today, about 3 percent higher. They're at a point now that we haven't seen since the autumn of 2023, but how much higher the prices go, I think, will depend partly on the weather, on the gas storages in Europe, they were at a pretty healthy spot before this, about 95 percent full by the first of November, but people will be watching what happens going into the next winter.

So, it was interesting, as President Zelenskyy responded to what had happened Ukraine's decision, not to renew this gas transit deal on in a post on X, he had this to say about the U.S. He said, we also hope for an increased American gas supply to Europe, which President Trump has already mentioned. Cooperation and maximum supply from partners will result in more comfortable prices on the market. The wrinkle here is that even though the U.S. has really ramped up LNG supplies. The Biden Administration had paused new export permits because of climate concerns and concerns about what it would do to domestic prices. President-elect Trump, has promised to reverse that so we see President Zelenskyy sort of appealing to Trump there, as he has done since the election. I think the question is, will that happen? And what will it mean for Europe in the short term? It's unlikely that we'll see new supplies appear immediately. And another part of this sort of political wrangling that we see around this gas situation, Becky, is that Russia has turned around today. Foreign ministry spokeswoman has said that the U.S. was behind this decision by Ukraine because it stands to profit from this.

These bollards that are full of water weigh hundreds of pounds. They will stop or slow down a vehicle, to which point law enforcement can interdict and mitigate the threat. So, the fact of saying, you know, how do we there are answers. There are solutions. The fact that New Orleans had a patrol car protecting the street of a known area where there would be hundreds of party goers is very concerning, because they were fixing the barrier that was there. Put a dump truck, go to the DPW, the public works, put it in front of that. And then putting water barriers is definitely the answer. So, there's a solution to it.",

These command posts are man by numerous agents, command staff, analysts that are looking at all the data, and they are rapidly moving through leads. So, if something is developed and analyzed and found in New Orleans, they can immediately contact Houston division for that lead via the system that has been created and utilized the FBI has trained for this to figure out, to find out, and mitigate the threat. That right now is the number one thing for law enforcement is to mitigate any threats, figure out where in Houston he was conducting his planning, where he prepared the bombs, and see if there are any individuals who were working with him, where he was radicalized, individuals that may have supported him. All these things are being worked, multi angle, multi-agency in to figure out at all at the same time to find out mitigate the threat, how it happened along the pathway of violence, and to make sure that this doesn't happen again.",

This obviously turns out not to be true. The attacker was born in the United States, was a U.S. citizen, and came from Texas, but it was clear that Trump was trying to make some political advantage. He seemed to be seizing on a false early media report. Today the House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, also brought up the issue of what he said was the open border and the terrorism threat when asked directly about this attack. Johnson is from Louisiana, where the attack took place, obviously in New Orleans. So, Republicans are still trying to make this political case, even though the facts don't seem to support it. Biden came out and gave that speech yesterday. It was he said all the right things, but he's right at the end of his mandate, the American people haven't seen him much lately. So, I don't think necessarily it was a kind of robust, determined performance that is going to put a lot of minds at rest.",
