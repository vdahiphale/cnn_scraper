Congress now returned to that building. You just saw after their holiday break, the entire House Democratic caucus greeted yesterday with a letter from the president responding to calls and his campaign saying in part, quote, the question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now, and it is time for it to end. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump. There will be a pivotal meeting of all House Democrats later today. It's going to be their first in-person gathering since the debate. So far, six House Democrats have publicly broken ranks with President Biden calling on him to leave the race. Illinois Democrat Mike Quigley is one of them. He says that there will be more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL):  That is quite a few. They have to come to terms with that on their own. I know it's a tough choice. I suspect you'll be hearing from quite a few this week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think yesterday I touched base with a lot of evan. They said we are continuing to support Joe Biden no matter what. And this is across the ideological spectrum within the CBC. And I think that again, they are probably his most loyal supporters are backers on the Hill. And I think that today, during that big family meeting is what they're describing. It adds Democrats are going to come around and listened to a lot of the CBC members talking about what they heard yesterday. And I think that that's probably going to rally a lot more support for the president in the House, like we saw yesterday.",

Here's what Senator Tim Kaine, who is also a Democratic senator from Virginia, like Warner. He's been a little bit less critical of President Biden. Here's how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA):  He is a patriotic person who will put him the country over his own needs and I think he'll do that as he makes this decision. If he believes fully that he can do this, I will respect that judgment. But I also completely believe that if he has doubts about whether he can do it, he'll level with the American public about it.

And he did say, I've talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign. He says, I will keep listening to people. So, I mean, I think that gives you a sense of the nerves and the stress that this places on -- I can't let -- someone like Sherrod Brown here. How do you expect the Senate meeting to go and impact what the president may or may not do?",

I mean, except for those like handful of one to call it for him to step down. But then on the Senate, you have a bigger range of position in terms of Senators being very real about what they would like President Biden to do.I think we saw Patty Murray yesterday. She's like one of the top Democrats in the Senate saying, you know, I do want him to show me that he can go and win this thing. And I think that that's not a thing that is new amongst senators. I think we have, you know, Bernie Sanders the other side being in behind Biden 100 percent. So again, this meeting today, it might come out, maybe not as a full surprise that Mark Warner is not the only one who has been really considering what they're going to go tell their people and what they want President Biden to do. But I think you're going to see stronger calls from Senate Democrats asking for Biden to go out and show them that they -- that he can win this.

So give us the view from where you sit of everything that has been unfolding here in the U.S. as this NATO summit gets underway. Of course, President Biden has held up the expansion should of NATO as possibly the primary reason why he should continue at the top of the Democratic tickets. Certainly one of the top two reasons, he mentioned it every time. But the reality is his performance at the G7, the way some European leaders looked at, at it, then heading into this week really did actually underscore many of the challenges he has around his age. And this of course, all looming as the problems facing NATO are as acute as they possibly have ever been in the post-war period. What do you see as being the most important things for the president this week? And how are these other NATO leaders looking at the job that he's doing right now? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  I think on the outside, you'll see lots of positive support for President Biden, because as you say, certainly hear from Europe, there's a lot of support for NATO. [05:15:03] He's the key figure within NATO because provide so much resource into it. So I think outwardly, there will be lots of positivity Keir Starmer, who's the new British prime ministers actually got a full bilateral meeting with President Biden, which is seen as a big honor. So, he's got some proper time with him. So he'll probably have a pretty good sense of how President Biden is performing. I think behind the scenes, I think there was as much shock in diplomatic and government circles as a was in the rest of the world about that performance on the CNN debate and when -- when it comes to NATO, of course, that's particularly pertinent when you consider that if they do make big decisions, around security, it's about pressing buttons, it's about quick decision making. I think they oh quietly looking for reassurance that the president is still strong, a stable in that position. And I think there's major concern, but I want to know that anytime that they get with him as well served and that he's focused on the job it's a lot of pressure on President Biden as well, isn't it, Kasie? You've covered these events as well in the past, so lots of meetings, pretty intense rounds of discussion, lots of different countries and types of policies to consider and big ideas. So it's pretty intense for President Biden.",

Well, and he's expected to give a press conference later on in this week, but that his aides are really holding up as a chance for everyone to see that, again, they're trying to prove that the debate was a bad night and not a sign of some sort of conditions that is impacting him broadly. So that's going to be another one of these moments where I think we're all going to be watching every single word.Max, this also comes, and let's talk for a second about kind of where things stand in Ukraine, because, of course, we saw those horrible, terribly sad images of children outside of a cancer hospital that was hit by the Russians. They were striking in ways that are perhaps a little bit unusual for how they have been conducting. The war is -- are these moves designed to be ahead of this NATO summit to try to send a message to NATO. I mean, how do you -- how do you view Russia's conduct in this moment?",

It was in daylight, it was -- its a very advanced missile that can be carefully targeted. It hit a children's hospital where there are cancer patients inside.So it's absolutely brutal event and you can just see those -- everyone's still trying to recover from it, combined with other attacks as well across the country, we just don't have the insight into what the Kremlin strategy was here if indeed it was their missile. I mean, investigations on the ground suggest it is they're not in the room, are they NATO? But it certainly does raise that raise awareness of what's going on in Ukraine as they go into NATO. But the big elephant in the room is will President Biden be there in November? Will there be a completely different strategy if President Trump comes in? So I think there are lots of caveats going into this meeting. Yes, we know who were dealing with. President Biden, and he's behind Ukraine, but we don't know if he'll still be there in November.",
