Let's get to CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, who's outside the courthouse in New York. And, Paula, the judge issued instructions to the jury.

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, we're looking for any sign of life from this jury.It is widely expected that they will likely have some questions about the case before they reach a decision. This is an unprecedented case, incredibly complex. And they have a laptop with a lot of the evidence, but not everything that they heard, so highly possible we will hear from them maybe even a few times today, as they come back and ask for clarification. Now, the judge has provided them with a road map for how to approach this historic task that they are about to undertake. The most important thing that the judge explained to them this morning is the burden of proof. He told them that -- quote -- \"It is not sufficient to prove that the defendant is probably guilty. The people,\" so the government, the prosecution,\" must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime, including that the defendant is the person who committed that crime. The burden of proof is never on the defendant.\" And the judge reminded them that, even though Trump opted not to take the stand, that should not be held against him. It's not his responsibility to establish that he is not guilty. But when it comes to folks who did take the stand, the judge gave another really important instruction, and he told the jury that, if any witness has intentionally testified falsely to any fact, they can actually disregard that witness' testimony either entirely or just the portions that they found to be false. And this is incredibly significant because, of course, the defense attorneys have argued that Michael Cohen lied to the jury on the stand. We know Michael Cohen is such an essential part of this case. So, if you have some jurors who believe that, yes, he did lie on the stand, and they believe all of his testimony should be discarded, and you have some jurors who believe that only a portion or none of it should be discarded, that is something that could really complicate these deliberations. So, at this point, nobody knows how this is going to turn out in the end, or the big question now, how long it will take them to come back to the courtroom.",

The judge has given the jury their final instructions, took about an hour this morning. And now what's happening is, these 12 people are alone in a room. There's no court reporter. There's no judge. There's nobody else. The alternates have been split off in case of emergency. Now, jury number one is the foreperson. In a lot of courts, the first thing the jury does is elect a foreperson. But in New York state court, it automatically is jury number one. There's no magic powers associated with the foreperson. That's who will communicate with the judge. And, usually, that's who will lead the deliberations. Now, crucial point, they have to be unanimous to reach a verdict. Guilty has to be 12-0. Not guilty has to be 12-0. Anything other than that, 11-1, 6-6, that is not a verdict. Now, they're working off the indictment, which we know count -- charges falsifying business records in the first degree. Now, there's 34 different counts of this. And I want to make this point because it's really important. The jury is going to return not a verdict, but 34 verdicts. They're going to have to consider each count, 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, 11 checks separately. And it's possible we see a split verdict. It's possible they find guilty on 20, not guilty on the remaining 14. One possibility that I just want to flag, it is possible, if the jury wants to split it -- nine of the checks are signed directly by Donald Trump himself. So, if they do end up splitting it, it could be that they split along that, those nine counts perhaps guilty, the rest not guilty. Now, what's going to happen for the rest of today, it could happen during your show, we are going to get notes. Now, it's possible we don't hear a thing between now and the end of the day. It's possible you get five notes between now and when this show goes off the air at 4:00. And those notes are going to break down into a couple things. One, they may ask for more info on the legal instructions. The judge took an hour, but he didn't give them the actual written form, which happens in a lot of courts. Here, maybe they took notes, but they could say, Judge, can you give us the definition of reasonable doubt again?",

They probably know what each other, what the other fellow jurors do for a living about their kids, their family, but nothing about the case. So, what typically happens when jurors start to deliberate -- and, like Elie said, we do not know. It's the jury's fiefdom, and nobody's in there. We can't know for sure. But what I have typically seen in mock jury deliberations and talking to jurors after verdicts, once they get in, they just unburden themselves. They just start talking about the case. They talk about what they liked. Oh, this witness was persuasive. Oh, did you see what the defense lawyer was talking about during his closing or any aspect that struck them. Or some might just come in and say, well, I really think he's guilty or I really think he's not guilty. And then, after some semblance of this cathartic process happens, then, usually, there's an initial poll taken just so jurors get a lay of the land, and they have a bit of a road map in terms of what they're going to do. And, at this point, leaders emerge. Personalities play a prominent role in how the jurors proceed through the verdict form. But it's so fascinating and it's exciting. And, hopefully, after the verdict, we will get to hear from the jurors to hear how it went down. But that's typically how jurors receive a case.

And whether or not they insert themselves during the discussion, if jurors have a question about the law, well, who are they going to ask? They're going to ask the lawyers that are sitting right there on the jury. And they will defer to them on questions of the law and maybe even some of the other aspects of the case that they're deliberating on. Now, what's really interesting is, there are two lawyers on the case, on the jury.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think if you were to boil down the strategy here, it's trying to meet black voters where they are.Really, the underlying strategy that the president will lay out today and announce today is trying to use these trusted networks, these trusted voices to reach black voters, whether it's in barbershops, whether it's in churches, whether it's on block parties, to really try and make his case. And I think there are two key facts that the Biden campaign are looking at. One, black voters were absolutely essential to his victory in 2020, particularly in a place like Pennsylvania, in a place like Philadelphia, where black voters can really close the margin and put the state over the top. The other fact that they're looking at is that there is no guarantee that black voters will go for Biden this time around. And, certainly, polls have shown a softening of support, particularly among black men. And I think that's the reason that you're hearing the campaign say today that they are not taking any voters for granted and that they will speak directly to those communities. Now, I was just speaking with two people. They co-founded The Collective PAC, which is part of this organizing effort. And I asked them, what are the challenges in reaching black voters specifically? Listen to what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEFANIE BROWN JAMES, CO-FOUNDER, THE COLLECTIVE PAC:  I think the challenges are similar to many other communities. And that's making sure that you can reach everyone where they are. Knocking on doors is important. Texting folks is important. Being on social media is important with a message that resonates for that community. So we know that black folks are not a monolithic community. So, having specific information about what the Biden/Harris administration has done is important. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Why are they worried?I mean, take a look at the numbers now and compare it to where we were four years ago at this particular point among black voters. And we see a clear decline in support. At this point, Joe Biden's just getting 70 percent of the black vote. Four years ago at this point, he was at 81 percent. Look at that doubling of support for Donald Trump from 10 percent up to 21 percent. Boris, Brianna, if that held through the election, it would be the best performance for a Republican presidential candidate among black voters in 64 years, since Richard Nixon back in 1960. Now, if you want to break down the black electorate and figure out where exactly is this declining support for Joe Biden coming from, take a look at this age breakdown. Look here. If you look at those black voters age 50 and over, they're still overwhelmingly supporting Joe Biden. Look at that, 85 percent to 8 percent. But look at black voters under the age of 50. Donald Trump in a recent average of polls is getting -- get this -- 27 percent support from them, Joe Biden at just 64 percent. So, you know, we were talking about -- you heard that interview -- can't treat black voters as a monolith. This age breakdown shows it. It shows that younger black voters are far less supportive of the president than older black voters are.",

What type of damage would that do to him in the Electoral College? Well, if you just took that into account and you didn't shift any other voters, take a look here. In 2020, based upon the current apportionment, Joe Biden would win 303 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 235. But taking into account that shift among black voters, now, with just this shift among black voters, Donald Trump wins in the Electoral College 291 electoral votes to 247. Why is that? Take a look at the states that shift. You would see that the states that shift are Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, where Kevin is right now, and Wisconsin. That alone would do it. And that is why black voters are so pivotal to Joe Biden's chances to win reelection.",
