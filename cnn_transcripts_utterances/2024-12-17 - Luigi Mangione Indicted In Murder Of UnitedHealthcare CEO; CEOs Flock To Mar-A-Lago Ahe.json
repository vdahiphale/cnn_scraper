He said that based on the evidence thatthey have obtained, they feel that it can support this charge of murder one in the first degree in the furtherance of terrorism. And he pointed to, as he said, the writings that they discovered through this investigation, including on the bullet casings and the casing of one live bullet that they found at the scene of the alleged shooting that they said \"deny, delay, depose.\" Those are words that are used in the insurance industry. There were also, as CNN has reported, writings that were recovered with Mangione on his person when he was arrested in Pennsylvania that also talked about the health insurance industry and focusing on that. So Bragg connecting those dots here, saying as he said, that \"... this was not an ordinary killing. This was a killing intended to invoke terror.\" He also pointed to where this occurred, Midtown Manhattan, early morning, busy time of the day commuting in Manhattan and he is that that all is part of the picture of why they think that they can bring this case as murder in the first degree, an unusual charge in New York, but a very serious one, which carries with it a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.",

But as you point out, the real distinction there with murder in the first degree is that there would be no parole if convicted. And so that is where the district attorney is taking this. That is what really distinguishes this, even from the felony arrest warrant that we had already seen in this case that had charged him with murder in the second degree.",

So really trying to send a message to the public that the celebration of this is not okay, and it is something that the investigators are clearly aware of as they pursue this investigation.

First of all, a number of these tech leaders, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, were at odds with the president-elect, so a lot of them coming down to Mar-a-Lago we are told by these senior advisers, is them trying to save face, trying to mend fences, basically trying to erase the past with the president-elect who could be very helpful or potentially very harmful in this administration. Now, some of them have asks, we are told these CEOs, these tech titans, but some of them are just there to try and get into his good graces. It has been interesting to see Donald Trump react to all of this. One, it seems as though the past eight years is water under the bridge for him. He is allowing these conversations. He is looking forward to these conversations. In fact, one of the things he said in his press conference yesterday, Richard, was that it seems like everyone likes him now. That's what he said when he was talking about the difference between now and back in 2017 and not just 2017, but really throughout his entire tenure and when he left office.",

He has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates for years, so it is understandable that he might feel he needs to have a conversation with Trump.

These lawsuits are an early indication that he is being much more aggressive this time around. When it comes to suing \"The Des Moines Register\" and this pollster, lawyers, and media experts are decrying this suit as both an attack on free speech and as a total stretch from a legal perspective. He is using an Iowa Consumer Fraud Act to claim that this pollster might have made up the poll and deceived consumers. But we spoke with Rebecca Tushnet, a Harvard Law School professor, who says this is total junk from a consumer protection point of view, and it is deeply concerning to see the law abused or misused in this way. I think this is a stretch. It will probably be thrown out by the courts, but Trump is getting what he wants, right? He is getting the headline. He is getting the scrutiny.

Others said they thought that her husband's consent was enough. Now, exclusive access to French Police reports reveals exactly how her husband found men to rape his wife.

But again, we need to see it. Across Syria, people are starting to uncover mass graves. Digging up remains, using everything from heavy machinery to bare hands. And for good reason. Families have no answers about what happened to the loved ones who disappeared, detained by Assad's secret police. The new rulers are pushing for international legitimacy. Remember they are sanctioned as terrorists. The rebel leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, met the British in Damascus on Monday. He's hoping to convince them the group no longer deserves to be labeled terrorists. The former jihadist has been meeting foreign dignitaries since the ousting. Kirsten Fontenrose is the senior -- was the senior director for Persian Gulf Region in Donald Trump's National Security Council, with me now. Good to see you. Grateful for you. And I guess at this point it's best case, worst case. How does either the E.U., the U.S. navigate towards best case? And do they even have a vision of what best case looks like? KIRSTEN FONTENROSE, FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR GULF AFFAIRS, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: That's such a good question. There is no best case yet, especially since many of our partner countries are taking these divergent approaches to what's happening on the ground so far. You have countries, including even Israel and Turkey, kind of doing land grabs, very likely hoping that they can use these potential land grabs and exchange in negotiations about border peace deals later on. And then you have some European countries rushing and kind of this very hopeful attempt at removing designations, removing sanctions. And the U.S. sitting back, a lame-duck president, an incoming president who's making ultimatums, and the world trying to navigate this. So if you're the Syrians on the ground, it's really confusing. And we don't see -- we see one vision coming out of statements the countries are making about what they expect from HTS and partners in a new Syrian government, but we're not seeing one approach by the international community towards Syria at this point.",
