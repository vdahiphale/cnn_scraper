And my good friend and colleague Boris Sanchez is in Washington.The torch has been passed from President Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, and now the anticipation is building here at the United Center, as Democrats await speeches from two of the biggest stars in their party. Tonight, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama will be taking the stage, making the case for why Americans should elect Kamala Harris president. Harris will not be in attendance at the convention tonight. She is headed for the critical battleground state of Wisconsin, which Donald Trump flipped to his column in 2016 and Joe Biden flipped back in 2020 on the path to that all-important threshold of 270 electoral votes. Harris will be holding a rally and a DNC watch party tonight in Milwaukee. Her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, will be speaking here in Chicago tonight ahead of the Obamas. And I'm joined now by CNN's M.J. Lee. First off, M.J., the night is going to be starting a little bit earlier than it began last night. There were some speeches, there was a James Taylor performance that was jettisoned. And even then, we saw Joe Biden speaking later than was intended. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. It was a long night. It got started a little bit later than anticipated. When we got to the point in the evening when the keynote speaker, President Biden, took the stage, that started later. And it was a long speech. I was looking from the floor at the teleprompter, and he was doing a good amount of ad-living, which is not unusual, but I think that contributed to how long the speech ended up going. And, genuinely, there were so many moments when he was getting really fired up, cheers and chants of \"Thank you, Joe,\" and all of that. I think all of that just made for the evening being a lot longer than the organizers had planned. And so there were speakers that didn't end up making the cut. James Taylor ended up getting cut, which I know people were upset by. And he was here yesterday too. We saw him doing... (CROSSTALK)",

And let's talk a little bit more about this other big night here with Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Big night, because we are going to be hearing from former President Obama. I wonder what you're expecting to hear from him tonight. SEN. BRIAN SCHATZ (D-HI):  Well, he's still the best communicator in Democratic politics. And that is saying something, because, last night, we had Raphael Warnock, we had Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, we had Chris Coons, we had a number of people and the remaining leader of our party in President Biden. And yet it's still Barack Obama who is able to just tear the roof off of a convention hall. So I'm very much looking forward to that. I think he's been giving space to our current party leaders to allow them to kind of spread their wings and become the leaders that they are. Our bench is growing. And I think the vice presidential selection process allowed a bunch of regular voters to understand we have got a bunch of talent on the bench. But Barack Obama is still the GOAT.And I'm expecting to see that.",

And I think this kind of overly precious view about politics that the other party is going to be basically insane and we're going to be the civilized party, I think, worked to an extent. But, right now, I think people want to see fight. People want to see joy. They want to see a little bit of improvisation. And they want to see a little bit of swagger and the Democratic Party being on its front foot. And over the last month, that is exactly how it feels. The polling is bearing that out, but I think, more importantly, vibrationally, everywhere you go, the Safety in Manoa in Honolulu to the convention hall, everybody has a spring in their step. And that's because we're going to charge up the mountain together. We're not going to let consultants talk us out of what we want to say and how we feel. This party is unified and pretty fired up.",

And it is an essential part of our strategy, not just as a party, but as a country.There are a lot of Republicans, Reagan Republicans, center-right Republicans in the suburbs across the country who do not like what they see in Donald Trump, but they're very deeply uncomfortable with joining the Democratic Party. And I guess our message is simple. We can fight about the rest of it later. We can fight about the size and the scope of government later. We can fight about Libertarian issues or social issues later. We have freedom and democracy to preserve together, and there are certain principles that are bigger than party politics. And I think that's what we're trying to demonstrate not just as a retort. I mean, listen, I'm a partisan Democrat. It's not that compelling hearing it from me. But if you hear it from Adam Kinzinger and other Republicans in otherwise good standing, that creates a permission structure for people who have maybe never cast a ballot for a Democrat to say, look, just this once, I'm going to join your coalition, and then we will get back to fighting about the other stuff.

They said she was not sick enough to qualify for an abortion under the state's laws. And, last night, she made it clear that, as she sees it, lives depend on who wins in November.

ZURAWSKI:  Well, thank you so much for having us today. It's an honor to be here. The reaction has been really overwhelmingly supportive. People resonate with this issue because we know it's happening across the country. There are so many folks that have a story like mine, like ours.
