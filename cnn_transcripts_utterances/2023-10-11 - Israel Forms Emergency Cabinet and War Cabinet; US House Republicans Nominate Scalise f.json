The evening has begun, and you can see the whole area is blackened out. The electricity has stopped in Gaza, because the only power station has run out of fuel and with the siege, the blockade, or whatever you want to call it by Israel, preventing further fuel from going in, so now everybody is -- those who have them rely on generators. Otherwise, that's the scene in Gaza as in Israel, the government there is to form an emergency government and a war cabinet is to be put together. We have a very busy hour ahead, I'm delighted that you're with me. I'm Richard Quest. A good evening to you. Tonight, Israel is to form an emergency government and war cabinet. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu and the former Defense minister, Benny Gantz, made the announcement saying the new government's sole purpose will be decisions related to the war. We've also learned more about the horrific attack on a kibbutz in Kfar Azar, Israel says it found the bodies of babies and toddlers beheaded. Officials say they are among the 1,200 victims killed by Hamas. The Palestinians say in Gaza, the number of people who have died is at least 1,100. The area is under heavy bombardment at the moment and the UN says, there is need for access to food and water. Becky Anderson is in Tel Aviv this evening. Becky, before we get into the sort of, whatever we are talking about. It is noticeable, Tel Aviv's skyline lit up fully tonight as usual, as one would expect, contrast that with Gaza, where the power has failed, largely because of the failure to get fuel supplies. But tonight, Israel again attacking Gaza.",

So these diplomatic efforts to try and get their release is incredibly important. Diplomatic sources confirming to me now that the Qataris are in touch with both the Israelis and Hamas on the release of the hostages, and these discussions are very much focused on getting the release of the women and children in exchange for Palestinian women and teenagers who are held in Israeli jails. And I've been told that this exchange certainly hasn't been rejected by either side. Any exchange, of course, has a precedent, not least when the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit was released in 2011 in exchange for over a thousand prisoners. His release coming five-and-a-half years remember, after Shalit was captured in Southern Israel along the Gaza Strip. And with regard the Qataris, let's remember, the important context here. The Qataris were the key interlocutors, on the recent US-Iran prisoner exchange. They have an open line of communication with Hamas, that was opened in the mid-2000s, at the behest, let me tell you, of the Bush administration, and we know in the past conflicts, not least 2021 here that they worked alongside the Egyptians to help secure a ceasefire. So bottom line, you know, the attention is very much focused on these hostages. The Israelis still haven't released the actual numbers, but we are now aware, it could be between a hundred and a hundred fifty men, women, children, the elderly being held, you know, sort of littered around Gaza being used as human shields effectively. Let's be quite frank about this. And we can now confirm that there are ongoing discussions between Israel and Hamas about what is described as a prisoner exchange at this point -- Richard.",

And so we need to go in and fortunately to get the hostages that they've captured, some of them are babies and children.

But as Jeff pointed out, all 435 members have to vote and there will be some Republicans who are already saying that they don't want to vote for Scalise because he hasn't committed to this or that. And the Republicans have such a narrow majority in the overall chamber, that any five people can throw a monkey wrench into this whole thing. So there could be horse trading, there could be demands, they could be trying to make Scalise behind the scenes to make certain promises as it relates to say Ukraine funding, for instance. So those conversations are going on behind the scenes. And I think that's why they're not voting today because although Scalise got a majority of the vote in the conference, he doesn't have the necessary votes on the floor just yet. But I hope he gets it soon because the Republican Party needs to act like the majority party and they need to lead and they need to be prepared to do what's necessary for the US to support its allies in Israel and in Ukraine.",
