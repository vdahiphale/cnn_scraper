For example, saying that Congress needs to ask first, or arguing that the president isn't included under the 14th Amendment because he isn't expressly mentioned. In your view, is there a way to do that?",

      "sentences": "As you say, there are off ramps, and you mentioned two of them. The first one is that the justices might hold that the president of the United States is not an officer of the United States under Section 3. The second off ramp is they might hold that Congress has to enforce Section 3, that states and courts can't enforce it on their own. The third is they might hold that January 6th was not an insurrection. Or they could hold that President Trump didn't engage in it, that his speech was somehow protected under the First Amendment.It's such a complicated mix of constitutional pragmatic and political considerations. Remember, Bush v. Gore ended up being decided on grounds that were completely different than the ones that it was originally argued on. So, literally, anything could happen. As viewers listen to these historic arguments today, listen to all those off ramps. See - see which justices are interested in which arguments in particular. And we'll see at the end of this morning whether any consensus seems to be converging or whether we're just going to have to wait until the court's decision.",

In the end, the president believes that this is a decision that will be made by the court system.But what we've seen from the White House and this campaign is really them adopting this stay silent strategy. They tried to avoid commenting on the legal issues facing the former president for fear of giving any perception of political interference. But what the campaign is focused on today is charging ahead with their plans to take on Trump in the general election. We have heard from President Biden this week trying to really turn this race into a referendum on Trump, painting him as the one existential threat facing this country. The president has also leaned in to highlighting the Republican dysfunction on Capitol Hill to highlight the way that the party still has a strict adherence to Trump's will. And the president, of course, will be keeping tabs on this as it's unfolding today. But for the most part, the team has steered clear of trying to weigh in on these issues due to trying to avoid any appearance of political interference.",

People -- all morning I've been banging my head against the table talking about democracy. We have a constitutional democracy because the framers recognized that crazy people can be popular. Bad people can be popular. So, our Constitution says, certain people can't serve.People love AOC in my party. She's 34 years old. No matter how much the democracy wants her to be president, she's too young. People love Harry Styles. People love Paul McCartney. People love Arnold Schwarzenegger. They're popular, but the Constitution says they're not natural born citizens. You cannot be president. And the framers of these amendments understood traitors can be popular. People who took an oath and threw it in the garbage can be popular, but you can't be president. So we're in -- we're facing a situation now where a big part of our Constitution could become a dead letter because people are afraid to put -- to do what the Constitution says, which is to say, this guy is no longer eligible. And so the politics now, not just for a Biden or a Trump, but for the ability of this country is on the line today.",

And I think there'd be massive write-in campaigns to elect him anywhere in places where he wasn't on the ballot. And, of course, I don't have to tell you what kind of crisis that would create in terms of counting votes and sending up electors and so on and so forth.So, I think the political reality is, is that taking him off the ballot would cause a meltdown in this country that it would be hard for us to even describe what would occur in the aftermath. I don't think they are going to do that, but I don't think the Republicans are interested in the Supreme Court telling them who they can and can't nominate.

The argument there is that there are certain folks that are enumerated. And even when they were debating this, when this was passed, they actually had president and vice president in the legislation, and they took it out.And typically when you -- when legislation is passed like this and you enumerate certain offices, the top office holder is first. Here, they started with the Senate, they went to the House, they went to the presidential electors, they went to the state officials. They walked all the way down the line and then they used -- and they used the catch-all phrase in between. The question is, does the president fit into the catch-all phrase. And the argument there is, no, he doesn't. He doesn't fit into that catch-all phrase. I think that - you're going to hear that today, number one.",

And the answer to the question of, why do you take out president and vice president, the reason why you take it out is because it's unnecessary, because they are both officers of the United States. So, once you've got them covered by officers, it doesn't matter. And then you have people -- when they refer to members of Congress, well, that's a little different because they're not considered to be officers of the United States.So, there's a perfectly good reason. And, in fact, there's also a -- there's a discussion I think on the floor of one of the houses of Congress about, well, doesn't this apply to the president? And the answer is, oh, yes, it is, he's an officer of the United States And it would be really, really bizarre to apply this provision to everybody except the person charged with executing the laws.",

It was interesting to hear from Van Jones about the 35 years old, the qualification there. That's self-executing. There's an argument here that it's not self-executing. This is what you're going to hear from the Trump team is that this - there has to be some other act of Congress. The argument will be that, yes, Congress acted. They passed the Insurrection Act. And when they passed the Insurrection Act, that directly applies here.Here, the president wasn't charged with insurrection. Jack Smith had an opportunity to do it. He didn't do it. And -- and in this case, so now you leave it up to the state courts or state officials or partisan officials to willy-nilly make that determination? This isn't just about Donald Trump. They're going to argue that this is going to be more about, OK, could, for instance, the border crisis, right Joe Biden isn't sufficiently supporting the border crisis. You have a Republican governor in Texas who says, you know, we want -- their officials are going to strike Joe Biden from the ballot because they're allowing -- and this is not out of the ordinary, you have a governor in Texas who could make -- who would make this argument giving kind of the stances that he's taken on the border, that they're - that Joe Biden is allowing for some type of invasion into the United States, and, you know, Bill Barr made that argument in his brief that this just kind of opens up the door for will nilly for state officials to be able to make these determinations without having, you know, a federal case brought or a criminal case brought where the - where the defendant faces charges.",
