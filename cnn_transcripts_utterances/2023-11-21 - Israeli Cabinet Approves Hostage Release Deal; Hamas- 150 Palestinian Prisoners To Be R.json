      "sentences": "This is THE SOURCE. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins, on assignment, tonight.Israel's cabinet just approved a deal, to free some hostages, held by Hamas, in Gaza. It was approved by a significant majority, according to a source. And as part of the deal, at least 50 hostages, women and children would be released, in exchange for a four-day halt, in Israel's air and ground campaign. The statement, from the Israeli government, made no mention of the release of Palestinian prisoners, thought to be a key part of this deal. We have team coverage, with the very latest. Matthew Chance is live in Israel. Becky Anderson is in Qatar, which has been a mediator, in the talks. And Chief National Security Correspondent, Alex Marquardt is with me here, in Washington. But let's start with CNN Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance, in Tel Aviv. So Matthew, the cabinet met, for several hours, finally approving the deal. What do we know?",

There'll be what the Israeli government says is a lull in fighting. They don't want to call it a ceasefire. But that's effectively what it will amount to, for that period. And it was -- there's a possibility of that lull in fighting, being extended by a day, for every 10 further hostages, the Palestinian group, Hamas, decide to or agree to release. And so, that was the essence of the deal. In exchange for that, of course, the Palestinians will be getting the release of -- they didn't mention this, the Israeli government didn't mention this. But the expectation is, is that some 150 or so Palestinian prisoners, in Israeli jails, will be released, in a staggered way in, alongside the releases of hostages. And so, that deal has now been done, it seems. There is a pause, a legal pause that has to be implemented now, for at least 24 hours, to allow appeals, in the Supreme Court of Israel, appeals relating particularly to the release of Palestinian prisoners. That's something that is a legal obstacle that remains. But it's not expected to stop this deal, going ahead, because as far as we're concerned now, a significant majority, as we've been hearing, from our Israeli sources, of the Cabinet, approved this deal. And it has essentially been greenlighted, Pam.",

A 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, is effectively three prisoners, for every one civilian hostage that is being released. And hundreds of trucks of aid are expected to enter Gaza, much needed aid, at this hour. Now, I'm told that this deal was approved, by an overwhelming majority of the cabinet, although I am told that Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security Minister, far-right member of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet, voted against the deal, along with another minister, from his party. I also just spoke with Gal Hirsch, who is the Special Representative for Hostage Affairs for the Prime Minister. And he told me that this is only the first phase of hostage release. He really wanted to emphasize that point. And in fact, tonight, I'm told that he delivered a message, directly to the families, of those hostages, to let them know that the government will do everything in its power, to bring back all of the hostages, beyond the first 50, who are expected to get out, over these four days. But if Hamas releases additional hostages, 10 hostages per day, could earn them an additional day of truce, for every 10 hostages. And that could certainly materialize, as we look forward to this. What's also important to keep in mind is that the Israeli Prime Minister, and his government, tonight, making very clear that this pause in fighting is not a permanent ceasefire. And that in fact, they will resume their fighting against Hamas.

Hamas tried to break that into groups, in previous weeks. So, at this point, this is -- seems like this is going to happen. Of course, when it happens, we'll believe it, because Hamas has been playing with our emotions and psychological warfare throughout this time. And it has broken its promises, many times before.

And tonight, they have, in fact, Israel has approved this deal, to move forward. Now, President Biden is here now, in Nantucket, where he's spending the Thanksgiving holiday. We're still waiting to hear specifically, from the White House, if there will be any type of statement, this evening. But it comes after President Biden had been personally engaged, in these talks. That's according to senior administration officials. Since the beginning of this attack, that Hamas had launched, against Israel, President Biden has repeatedly spoken, to Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. And today, Netanyahu said that he had asked the President to get involved in these negotiations, and said that the President himself had helped improve these talks. Now, in addition to speaking to Netanyahu, President Biden also spoke with the Emir of Qatar, twice, last week, and really pushed him, as Qatar has served as the main mediator in these talks. But this all comes as people will be watching, very closely, to see how many Americans might be included, in this deal. This deal is expected to include 50 women and children. It's possible the U.S. says that three Americans could be released. And that includes that 3-year-old girl, Abigail Edan, someone that President Biden himself has talked about, in recent days. And the hope, the Administration says, is this could also potentially pave the way, for other releases, down the road. But it's clear that this is welcome news, for the White House, as President Biden had been quite hopeful that they would be able to get to this moment. It will take, they say, about 24 hours, to implement this deal. And then, it's a question of exactly when and how many Americans, will be included, as part of this release.",
