Of course, this could continue over the course of the weekend. And we're still the timeline here has always been that Tuesday rally when they want to unveil the running mate.But they're working against the clock here. And what we're learning from a source is that Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, will be meeting with the Vice President. He has been one of the people on the shortlist, as she also weighs others. You see pictures of them there, including, for example, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Now, we got to this moment after days of a team pouring over documents as they worked on this accelerated timeline to vet her potential running mate picks. That was led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has been working with a team. He was seen going into the Naval Observatory, the Vice President's residence. And the plan was to present presentations, so 60 to 90 minutes of walking through each of the contenders. Now, of course, that could go long or short. The Vice President is known over the course of her political career to ask a lot of questions and to drill down on the details. And the follow-up has been that there will be interviews formally conducted by the vice president. So we're inching closer to that, especially learning now that Tim Walz will be one of the people she interviews. But, of course, one of the top considerations for the Vice President has been electability. So who could strengthen her chances and help Democrats across the electoral map? But then, too, is what chemistry she has with them. Of course, she does not have a personal or close relationship with these contenders, so that is also part of the calculus and something that the team has been working on in addition to the focus groups and the polling done on all of these candidates. So the Vice President, working around the clock here. She knows what the office entails, she holds it now, and that is going to partially inform how she makes her decision moving forward. But, again, going back to sort of the new detail here is that she is going to interview Tim Walz. He's expected to be one among others who will be interviewed after they had a day hunkering down on these presentations, on each of those on her short list. But certainly a very tight deadline.

But remember, the economy had just completely fallen apart and we'd had eight years of Republicans. McCain was going to face an uphill battle no matter who he picked. And he was up against a once in a generation political talent in Barack Obama. So, again, it's very hard to say.

And so they're really trying to work on what works with the crowd, what is the energy in the room when he delivers those types of attacks. And we saw that on Saturday night. Now, I will note, Donald Trump did argue that he found Harris' speech and rally earlier in the week also in Atlanta, Georgia, not even just in the same city but at the exact same venue. He criticized that she had celebrity performers like Megan Thee Stallion perform. He said that he thought that was phony. That is a line I can tell you from my conversations with Trump's team that he is planning to use in the coming weeks in an effort to frame her. He also tried to tie her to his former political opponent, Hillary Clinton. He said he would never forget that Clinton also had celebrity entertainers name-dropping Bruce Springsteen and saying that he has a bad trait. He only likes people who like him. Now, another thing I want to point out that I found interesting was that he repeatedly went after Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, as well as the State Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger. Remember, they were both key to trying to deny reports of fraud during the 2020 election. Trump repeatedly called them disloyal. And I also will note that Kemp, meanwhile, even though he said he wasn't supporting Donald Trump in the primary, he did ultimately say he would support him in November.

France has joined the U.S., Britain and Jordan, urging their citizens to leave as soon as possible, while Sweden is now temporarily pulling out its embassy staff from Beirut. Saturday night, Israel said it intercepted a barrage of 30 projectiles coming from Lebanon, which didn't cause any damage or casualties. Hezbollah said it was responding to multiple Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon earlier on Saturday, reportedly going after Hezbollah targets. A Lebanese news agency says one teenager was killed and six civilians wounded.

We've heard from the Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran issuing a renewed warning. They have said that they will inflict severe punishment, in their words, on the state of Israel, adding that this response will come at an appropriate time, place and manner. In their words, this will be blood vengeance and that that response will be certain.But there are real questions around when this will happen, what that response could look like. We've heard from a U.S. official saying that they believe this could be imminent in the coming days. But it remains to be seen whether we see a direct response from Iran, perhaps in the manner that we saw in April, drones and missiles targeting Israeli territory directly from Iran, or whether perhaps we see a broader, more complex, more coordinated attack targeting Israel in coordination with Iran's regional proxies, namely Hezbollah and Lebanon, perhaps the Houthis in Yemen. So these are all key questions right now as the region stands on a knife edge waiting for this retaliation. Of course, there are questions around the calculation that will go into that response from Iran, whether perhaps they are seeking to restore deterrence against Israel without provoking an all-out war directly against the state of Israel, or whether perhaps we will see a retaliation in response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week that could trigger a broader regional conflict. And that is certainly a fear that is held by many in the region, many internationally even. And we've seen a flurry of diplomatic activity over the last few days. Just yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held calls with his British and French counterparts, again focusing on efforts to de- escalate tensions in the region, but also crucially, of course, focusing on trying to restore attention on the ceasefire negotiations, which at this point feel somewhat dead in the water given the events of the last week. And, of course, we have learned in the last few hours, according to Iranian state media, that Jordan's Foreign Minister is set to pay a visit to Tehran today to hold talks on regional and international issues. So certainly a huge focus for regional leaders. The U.S., as well, deeply concerned around these rising tensions, already bolstering its military preparedness in the region, sending in warships and military squadrons as well into the region. So it certainly feels as though the region is on edge at the moment.",

At least two people now confirmed to have been killed, a 66-year-old woman and a man said to be approximately 80 years old, both killed in a knife attack earlier today. At least two others injured.According to police officials in Israel, the stabber involved in this incident was said to have been, in their words, neutralized. They say it was a resident of the West Bank. We are still waiting to get more details around this attack earlier this morning. Of course, as you mentioned, we've also been seeing ongoing airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. Just yesterday, we saw multiple strikes targeting two schools in Gaza City, more than a dozen killed in those strikes. And, of course, many more injured, distressing images and videos coming out from that attack. But earlier, overnight, rather, we have seen, again, yet more airstrikes, this time targeting an area near the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. This is one of the last few hospitals still able to receive patients. We've seen it on a daily basis, completely overrun with patients. But it was actually the courtyard of this hospital where thousands of people have sought shelter, have been living in these temporary tents, encampments around the hospital in the hope that the hospital would remain a safe space. But, again, that simply has not been the case. We've seen strikes now targeting this area where the camps were, videos emerging showing tents engulfed in flames, civilians desperately trying to rescue people from the fires. At least five people so far, according to authorities in Gaza, have been confirmed to have been killed, at least 18 others injured. But, again, that figure could continue to rise. The Israeli military, responding to a question from CNN, says they are looking into these reports. But, again, this was an area not only known to be housing and sheltering civilians, but also, of course, one of the crucial hospitals still providing life-saving support to civilians in Gaza. Kim.",

AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT:  DAVIES: Absolutely and it is such a pleasure to be here to do it. I was there at the pool last night. And did you know there is a new name for August the 3rd? It is 800 Freestyle Day. That's what Katie Ledecky has dubbed it anyway and rightly so after claiming a fourth straight Olympic gold medal in the event here in Paris on Saturday. On the same date, she won her first all the way back in London in 2012. I was there watching on. It was awesome to see her in action, the power and the speed holding off Australia's Ariarne Titmus to join the great Michael Phelps as the only athlete, male or female, to have claimed gold in the same event at four straight games. It's her 14th Olympic medal overall. What does she plan to do next? Well some ping-pong apparently and visit her grandma and then take a breather and why not? I think she absolutely deserves it. There was another Olympic record, this time in the 200 meters individual medley for 17-year-old Summer McIntosh and a world record for Team USA's 4x100 medley crew, the American dream team of Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske taking the gold in style but a pretty unusual position to be in for home favorite Leon Marchand finishing in fifth for France. The massive weight of home support not enough to roar he and his teammates to a medal against the squad depth of the others. Guess who took the gold in the gymnastics women's vault? Yes of course she did, Simone Biles reigning supreme once again displaying just a superior level of difficulty to the others and nailing it to take victory ahead of Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and U.S. teammate Jade Carey. So it's three golds down, potentially two more to go for her here in Paris and how about this for exciting news? She's not ruling out sticking around for the next Games in LA in 2028 as well.
