How this former president keeps defying the odds with Carter Center CEO, Paige Alexander.Also, ahead, as Donald Trump heads back to court, this time for a civil fraud trial, Hari Sreenivasan speaks to reporter Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter David Cay Johnston about the future of his business empire. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Peace in Kosovo has long been fragile, and tensions with its neighbor, Serbia, are right now drawing international concern. Washington says it saw an unprecedented buildup of Serbian troops on the Kosovo border. But Serbia's army chief today says, they have now withdrawn some troops that was stationed there. It comes after one of the worst outbreaks of violence in years, when a Kosovo police officer was killed in an ambush last weekend. A stand-off followed between police and 30 heavily armed Serbs in which police said they killed three of the attackers. The roots of tensions run deep. In 1999, the United States and allies defended Kosovo Albanians from brutal ethnic cleansing and abuse by Serbia. Afterwards, Kosovo declared independence in 2008, which Serbia does not recognize. Although the E.U. has been mediating dialogue aimed at normalizing the relationship. Serbian president, Aleksandar Vucic, now joins me from Belgrave for an exclusive interview. Mr. President, welcome to the program. Let us get a status report right now. As I said, the U.S reports an unprecedented staging of advanced Serbian artillery, tanks and mechanized infantry units. You've been in dialogue with members of the U.S administration. Have you withdrawn them as your army chief says?",

And we agreed upon the fact that we can use that freely with no restrictions ground safety zone and, of course, Serbia's territory itself with no restrictions towards equipment, towards repair. But you need to know something. A year ago, we used to have 14,000 people at the administrative line with Kosovo. A few days ago, we used to have less than 8.4 thousand. Today. we have 4.4 thousand, which is a regular number of people. And we always hear and we always listened when our partners were asking us to did de-escalate a situation and we did it this time.

All of these things were consistentwith Donald's long history of just creating his own reality. He says it in his mind, that makes it so. And the overvaluations, I'd written about a number of them in the past, you know, he claimed that his -- a state in Westchester County, just north of Manhattan, was worth at one point $291 million. His highest appraisal put it at about $30 million, but that was based on the idea that he could carve it up into a group of other mansions and yet, local authorities said no, we're not going to let you carve it up, which means it's not even worth what the appraisal says. So, he was valuing this at about 40 times what it's probably actually worth. And, you know, a little edge here. If he'd said his 11,000 square foot Trump Tower apartment was 12,000 square feet, but he said it was over 30,000 square feet, that's fraud plain and simple.",

But the difference is criminal fraud requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas in a civil case, you only need a preponderance of the evidence, more than half. And so, Letitia James took the easier route here. I think it's a very good question. Will the Manhattan district attorney or the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutorial agency, go back and look at this as a criminal fraud matter? I don't expect them to.
