So after the Trump-backed board passed these new rules, Democrats and others went to court and judges have now stepped in to block or strike down these new procedures. Republicans now want the Georgia Supreme Court to reinstate the rules allowing for post-election inquiries. RNC chairman Michael Whatley blasted the ruling that declared those new procedures to be unconstitutional, and he called the decision, quote, \"The very worst of judicial activism.\" A message went out to Georgia's counties on Thursday instructing them to ignore the new rules because of the court decision. Those instructions came from the office of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, as well as the GOP appointed chairman of the State Election Board. Their letter told counties that, quote, \"These rules and amendments are void.\" All this fighting, though, has not gotten in the way of Georgians doing their civic duty.

People upset because not everyone of course so was able to get bread after waiting for hours.So this is something that Cubans are used to. It is in an island that is all too familiar with shortages, and yet this feels very, very different. Officials say they are working around the clock to restore power. Last night, there were some pockets of the island where power had briefly been restored. They say that they've started restoring power again after -- again the national system collapsed this morning. So you do have these little pockets of electricity that people have for a couple of hours maintaining those pockets and expanding it to the rest of the island is going to be very, very difficult because these are power plants that are old, that are poorly maintained. The Cuban government blames U.S. sanctions for the fact they've not been able to maintain them well for over a decade. So this is a problem that really doesn't catch anyone by surprise. And then as well, because of the recent hurricanes, the government says they've been unable to bring in diesel fuel, which they need to run a lot of these power plants. Diesel fuel that's often donated by countries like Russia and Venezuela.

In some more potentially bad news for Cuba, a new storm, Oscar, formed earlier today and is now a category one hurricane. The Turks and Caicos and southeast Bahamas are already under hurricane warnings. While small in size, Oscar is expected to bring up to 95 miles per hour in winds, heavy rain, dangerous storm surge in the Turks and Caicos before Oscar drifts west toward Cuba. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns over fire danger in California. CNN meteorologist Tyler Mauldin joins us with more on what's happening out west.",

Climate change is not a future threat, but a daily reality. And one California college is taking a bold move in an effort to combat it. UC San Diego has become the first major public college in the U.S. to require undergraduate students across all majors to take a course on climate change. That's about 7,000 students.Wayne Yang is a professor and provost of UC San Diego's Muir College, named after the environmentalist writer-founder of the Sierra Club, John Muir. All right, Professor, good to see you. You spearheaded this initiative. Why was this important to UC San Diego? WAYNE YANG, PROFESSOR AND PROVOST OF UC SAN DIEGO'S MUIR COLLEGE: Right. Yes. Thank you so much, Fredricka. I'm one of many people on the shoulders of giants so UC San Diego actually started climate change science with the Keeling Curve. So that's Charles David Keeling who's -- that's why we know how much carbon is in atmospheres because of his work. So -- but this is really a student-driven initiative. It was the number one issue with our students before COVID. And this requirement is unusual because it's the only time we've ever asked students for their opinion, to be honest. We don't ask them if they want to take (INAUDIBLE) sign it. But this went before our students for a vote. It was unanimous and they're trying to spread the word to other universities.",

Professor Leo Porter teaches this class that takes our devices and everywhere from the life cycle of the advice from extraction all the way to use and disposal, and how, what the carbon footprint is of every stage so that we can learn how to reduce that.We've got biology courses in climate change. We just hosted the second Heat and Human Health Summit with all the doctors from Kaiser and the nearby hospitals. Obviously, urban planning, we can study climate solutions for regional transportation. But even in arts and humanities and writing programs so currently we have a couple thousand students reading climate optimism. So I think the idea is that there isn't one solution for climate change. There's 100 solutions. So we're hoping to get (INAUDIBLE) courses.",

Singer Liam Payne's family and friends and fans, they're still trying to make sense of the devastating loss of the singer who fell to his death this week from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. Ruth Gibbons, the sister of the former One Direction singer, wrote a tribute to her brother in a post on Instagram saying, \"Liam is my best friend. No one could ever make me laugh as much as him.\" But questions now still linger as local authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding Payne's fatal fall. I'd like to bring in now CNN's Dario Klein, who is in Buenos Aires, where a whole lot of people, fans who are continuing to mourn his death, are gathered behind you.

They are still waiting for the toxicological analysis, which we still don't know when they would be released. We spoke with a judiciary source who told us they could not confirm nor deny that it may be this weekend they will have the results but what they did tell us, they could tell us is that the body will not be released for the family, for Liam's family before having those results on site.So that's what the investigation is waiting for to know exactly what happened, what was going on in Liam's body before his death. While that happened here in this hotel, this sanctuary is keeping growing and growing and growing every hour, like thousands of people we can say right now have been coming to this place in front of the hotel to pay tribute, to leave candles, to write one and another and another letter to Liam, asking him for forgiveness for not being able to help him. Telling him that he could be able to save many of these girls through his music and singing his songs all the time and lighting the candles, and trying to comfort themselves being together in this place. Ad as you said, in my presentation, looking for answers, the same answers the justice is looking right now to the investigation -- Fredricka.",
