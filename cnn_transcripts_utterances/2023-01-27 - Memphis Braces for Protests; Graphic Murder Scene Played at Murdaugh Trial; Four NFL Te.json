So the games this weekend are expected to be tighter than any weekend slate of any AFC, NFC championship games ever dating back more than 50 years. But there's another reason why I'm interested in these weekend's games, and that is because the AFC championship is a repeat of last year's between the Bengals and the Chiefs.

I talked to him this week about what his message, what his style is going to be to make sure that this narrow majority doesn't go off the rails, that they can actually accomplish legislation. He said he has a lot of experience, both in the state house and actually as a youth hockey coach back in Minnesota. And he said one of his styles is to be direct, to tell people what he knows and what he doesn't. He also said his message to conference this week was simple, I need to know your personal business. He said, quote, we are not in the business of discussing your business, but you've got to view us as a small-town law office. Information comes in but it doesn't go out. And the reason he said that it's so important he know if people are - have children who are getting married, if they have illnesses, is the fact that absences really matter when you have a tight majority.
