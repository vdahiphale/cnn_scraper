So, we've got a lot of weather that's going to impact coast-to-coast. I'll try and take you right through it so you can plan accordingly.Here's just kind of a broader perspective, storm system moving through the Great Lakes right now and one impacting the west coast. Still, the east coast though looking very nice, so all in all, about 80 million Americans traveling, whether or not it's on the roads or in the skies, the majority of people traveling by road, that's for sure, over 90 percent. But several people trying to hit the airports right now across the Great Lakes, we do have snow flying across international falls to Marquette, Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, and then over the west coast. This is the -- just kind of the ongoing barrage of storms we've been contending with, certainly weaker than last week's atmospheric river, but it is bringing rainfall to San Francisco, southward towards Los Angeles. And so that rain could lead to some localized flash-flooding, especially for the in-land areas near the mountains. But as that air starts to cool off, as it goes into higher altitudes, that precipitation changes from rain to snow. And we are talking about several feet of snow for the mountainous areas. Great news for the ski resorts. So, if you're hitting the airports, no travel delays because of the weather on the east coast, the west coast, that's a different story. As this storm system moves inland, could impact Denver International. And taking you through the week, here's the first initial storm system today, that moves off the east coast, bringing some rainfall on Tuesday, perhaps into Wednesday, though, this is the storm we're going to keep close eyes on because as you head home from Thanksgiving, it could impact a large portion of the eastern seaboard for Thursday and Friday.
