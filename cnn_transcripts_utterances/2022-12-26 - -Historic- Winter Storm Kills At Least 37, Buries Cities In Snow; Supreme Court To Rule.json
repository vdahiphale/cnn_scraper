It is going to a war zone and the vehicles along the sides of the roads are shocking. It's not just small vehicles, it is literally snow plows. It is major size recovery vehicles and utility vehicles and tow trucks. So we have a real challenge right now where we have roads blocked. Roads are literally blocked by emergency vehicles. So that has made it extremely challenging for us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is really what the streets look like. That's because the plow trucks spent all of yesterday basically clearing the way as soon as visibility was restored, as soon as conditions improved. The goal here is to reassess as we begin the work week, to reassess the situation in terms of the travel and driving restrictions, to see if those could perhaps be lifted. The main priority for authorities all weekend long was to make sure that they didn't lose any more people. Yesterday, they confirmed a total of at least seven weather related deaths in and around Buffalo. Some of them were some of the most vulnerable homeless individuals, while New York Governor Kathy Hochul and also local authorities here confirmed that some of the dead were also found inside of stranded cards. So it gives you really just an idea of the sense of urgency that we experienced this Christmas weekend in around Buffalo, what is widely considered as ground zero of that massive winter storm that affected not just people in New York State.

So if you're not familiar, Title 42 was a COVID era policy and allows the U.S. to stop people from coming into the country during certain public health emergencies. The Biden administration wants to roll that back. The justice is expected to rule on an emergency bid by GOP led states to keep that Trump era pandemic border restriction in place while challenges play out. The decision, though not expected before tomorrow. This is still a huge story across the country. Hundreds of migrants stayed overnight in an El Paso convention center as the community tries to accommodate a growing number of asylum seekers. Here in Washington, busloads of migrants dropped off were dropped off in front of Vice-President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, D.C. on Christmas Eve. The weather was 18 degrees. The first two busloads were taken to local shelters Saturday evening. More busloads arrived later that night. A lot of those migrants -- again, it was 18 degrees -- a lot of those migrants were only wearing t-shirts in this freezing weather. They were, though, given blankets and sent to a local church. It's not clear at this point who's responsible for sending the migrants, but we have a team looking into all of that, so we'll keep posted there. Law enforcement in Washington State is searching for the burglars who vandalized three power substations in Tacoma. Lights went out for about 14,000 customers on Sunday. Police say at least one of the substations there was a forced entry into a fenced area and equipment was vandalized, causing the power outage in that area. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SGT. DARREN MOSS JR., PIERCE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: All three happened in the middle of the night on Christmas Day, causing power outages.

And this comes after we heard those comments from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken over the weekend, saying he is deeply concerned by this latest development in Afghanistan.The U.S. government's special representative to Afghanistan, Thomas West himself saying that this is an irresponsible decision and also poses a mortal risk to those who so desperately depend on the work and support of those female NGO workers in Afghanistan. But, of course, this comes after a wave of attempts by the Taliban to really curb the rights and freedoms of women across the country. Just last week, we heard from the Taliban that women would no longer be permitted to attend university. And, of course, we have seen that crackdown on women's education over the last year and over the last few months since the Taliban's takeover. And this has sparked wide spread concern within the country. We've seen women now taking to the streets, bravely defying the Taliban's severe restrictions and protesting against these decisions. In response, there has been somewhat of a crackdown. We've seen video emerging showing the Taliban using water cannons against these protesters in the streets. But it's not just women. Men are also standing in solidarity with their female counterparts. We've seen male students protesting across universities, across the country. Some even boycotting their exams. This latest development, this ban on female NGO workers, has set the tone for what could be a continued repression of women's rights. We've already heard from the U.N. say they are working to communicate with the Taliban to see what more can be done to ease these restrictions. Whitney?",

And his strongest argument for it has been the Donald Trump argument.Ultimately, for President Biden, his biggest weaknesses are -- is the hesitation inside the Democratic Party about him being the nominee again. Most -- I mean, many, many Democrats say that they just think it's time, you know, for a change and to bring in the next generation of Democratic leadership. But in those hypothetical runoffs, it's very early now, but in those hypothetical runoffs, that would effectively be a rematch that would pit Biden against Trump. Biden still performs more strongly than Donald Trump.

So here's my question. It goes back to this January 6 report. Democrats, obviously, are going to use that, especially if Trump is a realistic potential nominee for the Republican Party. But my question is, do you think other Republicans use that report? Do you think Ron DeSantis says, look at this report, he's not electable.

When do I do it?So most Republican strategists I talk to say, no, not overtly. You're not going to see, like, Republican candidates, you know, saying, let's talk about January 6 some more. But the kind of -- it's baked in to the extent that everybody is aware both of January 6 and kind of Americans fatigue about it, wanting to move on from the 2020 election, but more importantly, the outcome of those midterm elections and the damage to Donald Trump's brand. And so. you're going to see House Republicans when they come into majority in January, investigating the investigators, like taking on January 6 by trying to find wrongdoing or overspending or overstepping or that sort of thing in the investigation that we're talking about. And so, I think you're unlikely to see that many of the 2024 candidates, you might see a couple. But the Republican hopeful thing, hey, let's go back and revisit this thing and talk about it some more. But they may talk about it in part of that larger argument about who is electable in 2024, which Republican nominee is most likely to be able to win a general election.
