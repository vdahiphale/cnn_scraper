And we found at least 140 people who were authors or contributors had prior experience working for the Trump administration.Now, this includes people who rose to the highest levels of his government, including six people who served as cabinet secretaries, including HUD Secretary Ben Carson, who remains very close to Donald Trump, as well as the cabinet secretary in charge of the Office of Personnel and Management, that's Russ Vought, who I should also point out, recently helped put together the RNC platform that Trump approved. There's also several ambassadors he appointed. There are people who worked very closely at shaping his immigration policies, as well as someone who served as a deputy chief of staff. And there are also more than a hundred organizations that are heavily conservative that helped advise this project. We found many Trump allies in those organizations as well, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, one of his top advisers, Stephen Miller. And we took this information to the Trump campaign. They said, look, these people may have worked for Donald Trump in the past, but they don't work for him now. They certainly don't speak for him. The party platform, as well as the agenda he has posted on his website is what he is looking to do in a second term. Trump himself responding to all these attempts to link him to the Project 2025 by Democrats on social media. This morning, he posted, quote, I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and unlike our very well-received Republican platform, had nothing to do with it. He then went on to criticize Democrats for trying to link him to some of Project 2025's more controversial policies. That's not going to end anytime soon though, Sara.",
