They claim they found a stash of gold, cash, weapons and wigs, but not Prigozhin. A former Putin ally led his Wagner mercenary group in a short-lived revolt against Russian military leaders last month, but the president of Belarus stepped in with an offer of exile for Prigozhin and his troops. Now, the Kremlin says it has no comment on Prigozhin's whereabouts, claiming it doesn't track his movements, but the police raid in St. Petersburg has left many observers skeptical. CNN's Melissa Bell reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Weapons, cash, bars of gold and an impressive collection of wigs, at least four, presumably used as disguises. Hints of the life of the Wagner boss, a garish interior complete with an indoor swimming pool, hot tub and a giant stuffed alligator, as well as ammunition and many, many guns. The alleged St. Petersburg home, an office of Yevgeny Prigozhin, purportedly raided and displayed on Russian state television, presenters calling it scandalous. UNKNOWN (through translator): He was holding a defense in this house. Look at the office. Yevgeny Prigozhin's office, a flag and all. It's outrageous. Why would a man have so many guns? BELL (voice-over): Among the object seized, several passports apparently belonging to Prigozhin using different aliases. The man himself hasn't been seen in public since his attempted coup last month. The Belarusian President and Putin ally Alexander Lukashenko, who says he'd given Prigozhin refuge, now claims he's gone back to Russia. The Kremlin refused to comment. But immediately after the attempted coup, Vladimir Putin had hinted that the finances of his former ally would be investigated. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I hope nobody stole anything while all this was going on, or didn't steal much. But of course, we will deal with all of this. BELL (voice-over): According to the Russian president himself, Prigozhin's catering company had received almost two billion dollars in military and government contracts. But it was Prigozhin's propaganda machine that Russian authorities targeted first, blocking media companies and websites linked to the man behind the failed push last week. YEVGENY ZUBAREV, RIA FAN DIRECTOR (through translator): We are closing down and leaving the country's information space. BELL (voice-over): Yet in many ways, Prigozhin's empire may be too big to fail, as the mercenary group still has a significant presence in Africa. SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): The fate of the agreements between those African countries and PMC Wagner is up to the leadership of those countries to decide. BELL (voice-over): As to the fate of Prigozhin himself, his apparent home is now empty, the giant sledgehammer that symbolized the brutal Wagner group abandoned and its name, so long lionized and feared, now being erased as quickly as authorities can manage.

      "sentences": "This was a significant landmark agreement back when it was signed last summer between the delegations from both Russia and Ukraine. As you mentioned, they're brokered by the United Nations as well as the Turkish government.But of course, it is set to expire in the next 10 days. It's already been renewed. It was actually set to expire initially in May of this year. And there were significant concern about Russia's continued participation and cooperation in this deal, particularly, of course, from international partners and those in the United Nations who have serious concerns around a perhaps resurgence of the global food security crisis that we did see last summer. Many countries, of course, highly dependent on Ukraine's grain exports. And essentially what this deal has ensured is that vessels carrying grain and other vital agricultural goods, fertilizers from Ukraine have safe passage through the Black Sea. There are delegations from both Russia and Ukraine as part of the Joint Coordination Council which take part in inspections of these vessels in order to allow them to pass through the Black Sea. But there is concern that there could be a holdup if Russia fails to agree to a renewal. Now, of course, we did hear from the Russian Foreign Ministry earlier this week raising questions and concerns over whether they would in fact resign on this deal. They have suggested that they believe that the grain exports that are coming from Ukraine are not going to those countries most in need of Ukraine's grain exports, but rather, in their words, well-fed countries, namely European and other Western allies of Ukraine. But of course, President Erdogan has, over the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, maintained communication with President Putin, sometimes at the expense of relations with his Western allies, NATO allies. But of course, this has placed the Turkish government in a unique position as a potential mediator in any sort of peace agreements between Russia and Ukraine, and namely, of course, in the Black Sea Green Initiative deal, which was a landmark success last summer of course. Now President Erdogan will be meeting with President Zelenskyy later today in Istanbul there will certainly be a lot of focus on the renewal of this deal and certainly perhaps a lot of pressure from President Erdogan's western allies when it comes to bringing President Putin and the Kremlin on board for that renewal that is of course so desperately needed by those countries most dependent.

It's not prohibited by the United States. The United States considers those bombs as legal and basically as a standard ammunition. We'll see how it works. We haven't got much experience yet with using this. So we will look at this. Regarding the generally the risks for civilians, I mean the risk for civilians right now is huge in that area in any way. We have over two millions of mines. This is unofficial assessment, but very close to probably what is true. Two million landmines around the area right now. It's extremely dangerous to be there anyway and there will be a massive effort of demining the whole area later.

And our security services, intelligence services, suspected that they may instigate the, actually, the substantial explosion, which will destroy the power plant and obviously will create a massive environmental disaster. And that's why we were flagging, I mean, the Ukrainian government were flagging everywhere about this risk and about the fact that it may happen. Russia, at the same time, were sending messages propaganda that Ukraine wanted to do that, we of course delivered the messages that there's like zero benefit to Ukraine to do that.

This time, it occurred early Thursday morning, and the commander of U.S. Air Force Central Command, Lieutenant General Alex Grinkovich, says those Russian fighters got dangerously close to the U.S. drones.In this video, you can see this encounter as it happened. You see as the Russian fighter jets get close and fly above and faster than the drone, one of those jets begins dropping a series of flares. And it almost looks like the fighter jet is attempting to hit the drone with those flares. This is very similar to what we saw the Russians do one day earlier. That's when three Russian fighter jets approached three U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones and conducted very similar activity, which the Department of Defense called unsafe and unprofessional. In that case, one of those Russian fighter jets dropped parachute flares in front of the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone, while another lit afterburner in front of the Reaper drone, which made it difficult to operate the drone in a safe manner. Crucially, it's not just the U.S. that appear to be the target of these aggressive Russian activities. The French said they were also essentially harassed by a Russian fighter jet. This time the French, on the official Twitter account of the French Armed Forces, say they had two of their Rafale fighter jets operating near the Iraq-Syria border when a Russian Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jet came up and operated in a nonprofessional manner. The French, according to this tweet, essentially averted any sort of risk and flew away. We've seen this play out over several months back in April, a U.S. official told us it was essentially the Russians trying to operate in a new and more aggressive manner here, ignoring the deconfliction protocols that were specifically set up to avoid any sort of conflict or miscalculation between two of the most powerful militaries in the world.

But it's the climatologists who study ice cores and corals that can go back thousands of years and tell us, we're the warmest we've been in 100,000 years on planet Earth. Shocking to think about that. And then the speed at which that has happened, unlike climate change swings of many millions of years past, doesn't have anything to do with the wobble of the Earth or super volcanoes.
