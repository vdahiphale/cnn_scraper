Look, let's just be honest about what happened. Trump missed some opportunities. Absolutely true. The poll said he didn't win, but he was also debating three people. To a lot of Republicans, it didn't feel like it was a debate. It felt like he was on trial and there were three prosecutors. And I promise you that no matter who moderated another debate, the pressure would be on those moderators from the mainstream media to be harder on Trump than they even were over at ABC. So if you're Donald Trump and you're looking at like, what am I going to do to change a narrative? What can I do to impact a more positive outcome? There is no way to get a better outcome out of another set of moderators after what happened with the ABC debate. And on top of that, if Kamala Harris is going to be allowed to go to debates and ignore questions, flat ignore questions about the economy and immigration and not be pushed on that, that's not fair. And if the moderators are going to be able to try to fact check Trump with things that they say that turn out not to be true, that's also not fair. So to me, there's a ton of risk in it.

And despite the fact that he hasn't acted on them, there's still serious concern about the fact that he very well made. And those threats should be taken seriously. Alex, it is a significant moment, if we do expect, President Biden to agree for Ukraine to use long-range weapons. France, the U.K., appeared to have signed off on that as well.

But to your point about Putin,just moments ago, there was a White House briefing in which the National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said exactly what you did, which is these threats from Vladimir Putin, we have heard these before, that there's -- that there's nothing new there. What is new is this consideration of the U.S. to allow Ukraine to use these longer range weapons. Now, make no mistake, Ukraine can already use U.S. weapons inside of Russia in a limited way and missiles that are a shorter range. What we're talking about now is the longest range missile that the U.S. has given to Ukraine. It's called an ATACMS. And in parallel to that, we're also talking about French and British missiles that are basically within the same range. So this is a decision for those individual countries to make, but they like to make these decisions as a collective because they want to show a united front. Another thing that Admiral Kirby just said is that we should not expect to hear any kind of announcement from the White House today. So these two leaders will be talking about this issue of long-range strike capabilities inside of Russia with their weapons, but we should not be expecting an announcement we are told. But no doubt there has been a full court press from Ukrainian officials who have come here to Washington, who have met with Secretary Blinken and Foreign Secretary David Lammy in Kyiv in the past few days. They are pushing the West, those countries in particular, to allow them to use those weapons. We have heard the door open to the possibility. Secretary Blinken saying that as the battlefield changes, there's an -- there can be an evolution. We have seen this evolution in the past. But there are significant reservations. There is the fear that Russia will escalate, whether it's inside Ukraine or elsewhere. That goes back to what Putin was just saying. There are concerns over the limited supply of these weapons. There is not an infinite amount of these ATACMS missiles. And the U.S. believes that they could be used better elsewhere, perhaps inside Eastern Ukraine and Russian occupied territory in Crimea down to the South, rather than these one-off strikes inside of Russia. So there is a bit of daylight between how the U.S. and Ukraine see the military strategy, but it could also be that Ukraine wants the political victory, the symbolism of the U.S. allowing them to use these very formidable missiles inside of Russia, which would not only be effective, perhaps in a limited way, but really send a strong message to Russia and the rest of the world about U.S. support for Ukraine.",

State Department is set to reveal declassified information that suggests RT and Russian intelligence operations are actively working together to try to sow division and harm democratic processes. The White House is also expected to announce a major effort to blunt those efforts. CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us now live from the State Department. And, Kylie, the former doesn't seem that surprising. The collaboration between RT, which is part of the Russian propaganda machine anyway with its own intelligence. Well, what is a bit notable is that the U.S. seems to have prepared a response. What do we know about that response? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. So they - - we've known this for a long time, as you well point out that RT is deeply enmeshed with the Russian government. But what's new here is that there's going to be actually declassified U.S. intelligence that makes that case in a more robust way. That points to some examples of how RT has operated fully integrated with Russian intelligence operations globally for quite some time. Watch and see what those examples are. One thing that sources tell us is going to be included in what's rolled out today is the fact that Russian intelligence embedded a cyber-unit inside of RT for quite some time. That is one example. We'll watch and see, as I said, what more comes out. But it's also significant that the United States is trying to reveal this information publicly. They're also going to be engaging in a global diplomatic effort to tell other countries the risks associated with having RT on the airways in their country. And they're also trying to blunt to the influence that RT has globally. Of course, RT isn't on the airwaves here in the United States. It's not on the airwaves in the European Union. They banned it after Russia invaded Ukraine, but it is increasingly on the airwaves in places like Latin America and in places like Sub-Saharan Africa. And so those countries are really kind of the target, the focus of what's going to be announced today. The backdrop, of course, is that the Biden administration, just last week, rolled out new information, DOJ indictments and the like going after RT's operations and efforts associated directly with the Russian government, Kremlin-directed here in the United States to try and undermine the 2024 presidential election process. So what the United States is saying with these two actions, simultaneously, is it's not just happening in the United States, it's happening around the world and the United States has intelligence to share with folks to make that case more aggressively than they have in the past.",

So no doubt a significant announcement expected, not today, but soon. We would imagine from the White House President Biden now allowing essentially Ukraine to use long-range weapons, notably not ATACMS, but U.K. long-range weapons as well as French. We'll see if Germany follows. But I'm wondering what the significance of that would be aside from symbolic, given that it's taken the U.S. so long to finally sign off on this. And there is concern that announcing exactly what you're going to use them for could only lead Russia to have time to really move its assets even further out of their range to avoid the significant damage which they could inflict.",

The previous weapons they provided were pretty much for use in Ukraine or right on the border. And when you're talking about a move inside somebody's country, it's harder to guess what their reaction is going to be. I actually think the Russians have been milder on this, so far, than I would have expected. But President Putin's statement yesterday was pretty fiery in saying that this would be an act of war. They could well help -- the Russians could well help the Iranians or Iranian proxies work on better targeting against American forces in the Mid-East.
