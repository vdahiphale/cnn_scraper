      "sentences": "The man, arrest in connection with the apparent second assassination attempt on Donald Trump is due to appearin federal court in Florida within the next few hours. That's according to sources familiar with the matter. Ryan Wesley Routh was detained Sunday on a Florida highway. It's unclear at this time exactly what charges he may face. The Secret Service, as a witness saw Routh fleeing Trump's golf course after an agent spotted a gun barrel in the bushes and fired. This was all happening just a few 100 meters from where Donald Trump was playing around of golf. As for Ryan Wesley Routh, he has criticized Donald Trump on social media. We also know he spent time in Ukraine, hoping to fight there, and also recently wrote about other global hot spots, including Afghanistan and Taiwan in a book that he self-published. The acting U.S. secret service director is in Florida and will be staying there indefinitely, we're told, as investigators reach out, including across the globe, to find out more about Routh and his possible motives. CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, is back with us this hour. And John, we're just learning too, confirming that, in fact, the director of the secret service will be meeting with the former president later today. There have been so many questions, certainly, since the first assassination attempt just two months ago in Butler, Pennsylvania, involving the former president. Given where things stand now, is it likely -- you and I talked about the issue of personnel, and the issue of protecting the former president, is it likely, based on your sources and who you have spoken with that they will be increasing the protection here?",

Meaning, they actually have credible threat information, A. B, they have actually had an assassination attempt. C, they have had another assassination attempt. So, even before what happened yesterday, happened, the people in that detail were pretty much up to the standard they would use for the vice president of the United States. They are going to have to look at in this environment, adding to that again, because if there was any doubt about whether this threat picture was a one off yesterday, seems to dispel that. What they have done, and this is remarkable, Erica, is they have borrowed people from the presidential protection detail, from Biden's own detail, and they have pushed them towards the Trump detail on the idea that Biden isn't traveling as much now that he is not the candidate, spending more time in the White House, which gives them some access to personnel, and that those people are already trained on how to protect a president or candidate on the road.",

Number one, the easiest charge is the unlawfulpossession of a firearm by a convicted felon. That will be enough to hold him, at this point, until they can finish their investigation and determine whether they have enough for an attempted murder of a former president, which is a life felony in federal court. And what -- the basis of that has to be, what's known as the dangerous proximity test. That is the test that he was very, very close to completing the crime that he wanted to commit, and all the preparation that went towards committing that crime may or may not be enough for it to be an attempt. So, they are going to have to take a look at that. They are also going to try to take a look at whether this was can be considered a threat towards the former president, and that is a separate and distinct charge, which carries a 20-year maximum penalty. So, I think they need to take a look at the sequence of events. They need to take a look at what evidence they have, how close he came to being able to complete the crime, and whether, in fact, his -- he went beyond mere preparation towards committing the crime, and actual acts, what we call overt acts, towards completing the crime, and setting himself up with a scope at a fence, and all the preparation he did, may be enough to take him to the point of attempted murder.",

So, they are still relatively short of where they want to be.

So, a very long distance that it had got so far into central Israel before it was knocked out of the sky, intercepted. It didn't explode in the sky, but it's disintegrated and came down and lit fires in farmlands that burned for hours after, as we were on the side of one of them. It was literally ripping through the undergrowth on the woodland there. But the prime minister really quickly, essentially, saying that there would be a reaction that when Israel, Israelis are targeted for harm by groups, as Hamas has learned, Israel will strike back. And there was an echo of that in the phone conversation today between Yoav Gallant, the defense minister here, and Secretary of -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. When the Israeli defense minister told him, again, as he said before, that the Houthis represent a regional threat and that Israel has shown how it responds to when people try -- when terror groups try to harm Israelis. So, it's very clear, it appears that Israel is positioning itself, is letting its friends and allies know that it will be striking back at the Houthis. Of course, the U.S. has been taking down Houthi drones, Houthi missiles as they try to intercept shipping in the Red Sea, along with a coalition of partners. But it's not often that Israel has got involved striking directly into Yemen, but that appears to be the case now. And when we talk about those three hostages whose bodies were recovered on the 14th of December last year, the explanation that their families have now finally received from the IDF is that when the IDF targeted a senior Hamas commander, the northern Gaza battalion commander, on the 10th of November, he was in a tunnel, what the IDF didn't realized was, when they killed that commander, that in the tunnel, the three hostages were there. In fact, they say they weren't aware of any hostages in those tunnels, and thought the three were located somewhere else. But this is a rare admission by the IDF that their airstrikes, because this is a hugely contentious issue, that their airstrikes are causing the death of hostages, and that's, of course, partly at the core of what worries hostage families so much right now about the ongoing war and the risks their loved ones' face.",
