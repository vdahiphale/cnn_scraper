Right now the U.S. is working to identify exactly which militia group carried out a deadly drone attack on a small U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three U.S. Army troops. More than 30 U.S. service members were injured, including eight who had to be medically evacuated. This happened near the border with Syria and Iraq, as you can see on that map right there. President Biden is blaming Iran-backed militant groups and vowing to hold them responsible. This marks the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. And CNN's Natasha Bertrand is here in the studio with more details. Natasha, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Well, we know three U.S. Army soldiers they were killed in this drone attack that U.S. officials are attributing to Iran-backed militias, that we don't know exactly which one was responsible for this attack. And upwards of 30 U.S. service members who were at that small outpost in Jordan kind of little-known base in northeast Jordan on the border of Syria, they were wounded, including eight who actually had to be medically evacuated because their injuries were that critical.Now at this point the U.S. is debating, of course, how to respond. It remains to be seen whether they're going to retaliate immediately or whether they're going to respond by striking these Iran-backed groups, or whether they're going to do a larger, kind of broader response to this. But they are vowing some kind of response. That is what President Biden has said. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made that very clear in a statement that he released as well, saying that this is not going to go unanswered here. And so the administration has really been trying to avoid getting into this broader conflict, but even though these Iran-backed groups have struck U.S. and coalition bases and tried to hit them over 150 times since October, never before have they actually managed to do what officials believe was their goal all along, which was to kill U.S. service members until today, and so this incident really marks a significant escalation here. And right now what we're waiting for is of course how they're going to respond. President Biden did meet with his National Security team today to discuss the incident, including some of his most senior officials, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown, so clearly they're taking this very seriously and weighing how to respond -- Jim.",

I mean, the administration has been attempting to deter a larger regional conflict that could easily turn into a global conflict. You've got to remember that Iran is connected to not only Russia but also China and other nations, so when you're talking about the deniability that Iran has in support of somebody's popular mobilization forces, the PMF forces, these are militia groups.It's one thing, as Kim said, to go after these groups. It's very difficult to go after the launch sites of a drone or the launch site of a rocket, but you can certainly hit the supply capabilities and the command-and-control elements. The Biden administration has been doing that. I think what we're going to see as an effect on this is probably a much larger strike against some of the headquarters and other areas within Syria as well as perhaps some of the other PMF locations. But I also think you are going to see some covert actions against the operations of Iran in different parts of the country. We all know that Iran is the head of the snake and it needs to be stopped from supporting these groups, but it's one thing to try and stop that versus going inside of Iran, which could cause a regional conflict, and I think Kim would agree with that.",

So from Iran's perspective, we hit some Houthi targets and killed some Houthi troops, who are trained and backed by Iran, now they are hitting a location that supports our advice and assist mission of various troops that work against Iranian interest.So from their perspective, from Tehran's perspective, this is more tit-for-tat. And again, trying to track it back, as Mark was saying, to who was exactly responsible for ordering this, that's really hard to do. Iran does have a lot of deniability. So if you strike something inside Iran like the Revolutionary Guard headquarters, you better have a smoking gun showing that they ordered this particular strike, or you are going to create a lot of international antibodies against that action.",
