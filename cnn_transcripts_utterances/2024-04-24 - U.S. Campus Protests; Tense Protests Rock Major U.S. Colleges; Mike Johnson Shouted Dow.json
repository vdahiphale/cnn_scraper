They place a target on the backs of Jewish students in the United States and here on this campus. A growing number of students have chanted in support of terrorists.

We've had our issues.This is the challenge for all colleges and universities. I think it's incumbent on them to make it clear what is permissible protests, where students, whatever their age, they're allowed to protest and where they are allowed to protest versus what is impermissible behavior. So, putting up tents, you know, the day before graduation is not permissible. They will be evacuated. They will be dismantled. The gray area, as you've described, is one that is, there's no like, you know, great rule. It is though -- it is that there is a line between feeling uncomfortable or not liking what you hear and feeling that your identity is under threat of violence. And that line, if it's crossed, or it's not perfect, that is when public safety steps in. But I will tell you, just -- I've been on air all day, just looking, it's - - I don't -- the threat, the physical threat, is going to increase the quicker that these colleges and universities are sort of deploying massive law enforcement there. We have this technique and safety and security called de-escalation. These colleges and universities know how to do it and we should go back to those tactics. It's engagement with the students, even if we don't like what they're saying, it is setting rules of appropriate conduct, and then they face the consequences. There's no perfect answer. Every college and university is struggling through this. But the idea that protest, per se, is antisemitic is not accurate. We know who's protesting. We've interviewed Jewish protesters. And also, that this can be solved by the single firing of a university president is ridiculous. I mean, it is -- this is a very difficult issue. And it is incumbent on the colleges and universities to also try to deescalate because it's dangerous for everyone.",

Tesla shares had their best day in more than a year, however, rising 12 percent. As we told you on yesterday's show, investors are revved up by news that the firm is still working on that lower priced car.

Of course, her post was announced just weeks after that horrible plane collision we saw on January 2nd when five Coast Guard crew members died after colliding with a commercial flight from JAL. So, that incident, she said, and of course, all of her experience as a flight attendant, right, a career that spans several decades, she said, really reinforced and reaffirmed her belief that safety should be the number one priority for Japan Airlines going forward. Here's what she told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY (voice-over): An entire plane swallowed by flames. Smoke and fear filled the cabin. These are the dramatic scenes from Japan that unfolded on screens across the world when a Japan Airlines flight collided with a Coast Guard aircraft on the runway. But mass tragedy was avoided that January night. Five Coast Guard crew members were killed, but all 379 aboard Commercial Flight 516 escaped unscathed. A miracle Mitsuko Tottori, Japan Airlines' incoming president, attributes to passenger cooperation and a well-trained crew. MITSUKO TOTTORI, PRESIDENT, JAPAN AIRLINES (through translator): We are constantly updating our operations based on the lessons we have learned from past case studies. I think we were able to put these lessons to the test. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But for Tottori, safety isn't just a priority, it's instinct. Starting as a flight attendant, she rose through the ranks in a country where women hold less than 13 percent of senior and leadership roles, the lowest among G7 nations, according to the World Economic Forum. She's now the first woman and former flight attendant to become JAL's president. But her rise, she says, shouldn't come as a surprise. TOTTORI (through translator): I hope that Japan will soon become a place where people are not surprised when a woman becomes a president. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Tottori's remarkable career began in 1985, just four months before the deadliest single aircraft accident in aviation history. JAL Flight 123 crashed and killed 520 people on board. Leaving just four survivors. And Tottori with the haunting reminder that safety is irreplaceable. TOTTORI (through translator): Safety must be a priority for everyone working at JAL. That important value has been engraved in my heart. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): But her dedication to safety faces another critical test.

MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Her faith in Boeing strong, but the manufacturer must prove that its aircrafts live up to her indispensable value. (END VIDEO CLIP) MONTGOMERY (on camera): So, Mitsuko Tottori, Julia, has a career that started in 1985 when she started as a flight attendant to now as CEO and president of the company, which is really extraordinary. And just to note, I think, you know, we talked about how she was the first woman to ever lead Japan Airlines, which is one of Japan's biggest airline companies, but also, she's the first one with any experience as a flight attendant. Her predecessor had a background in maintenance, and the man who came before him had experience as a pilot. So, really, she has a remarkable career that is breaking boundaries and really setting an example for women in Japan, but also across the world. Julia.",

Liverpool, as you know, Julia, have been kind of hemorrhaging points over the last few games. They've dropped now eight of a possible 12. That is not championship form. And it's certainly not in a season where they're going up against two teams on such brilliant form. Manchester City, of course, are the defending champions who seem to always come through at the end. Arsenal are playing brilliantly as well. Remember, they thrashed Chelsea just 24 hours previously. So, I think it's going to be so, so difficult for Liverpool to win this title.
