What did he tell them about Trump and the 2020 election?Plus, a deadly barrage of missiles strike Ukraine, leaving raging fires and at least a dozen dead at the hands of Russia. And destruction after a tornado rips through a Florida town, parts of the South bracing for more severe storms today. (MUSIC) All right. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Happy Friday, everybody. I'm Christine Romans. We begin with Vice President Mike Pence testifying before the grand jury looking into former President Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Grand jury testimony is, of course, secret, but we have a very good idea of what Pence was likely asked about his former boss, now his Republican rival. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Former Vice President Mike Pence testified before a federal grand jury on Thursday for more than Thursday for more than five hours. That testimony would have been what happened after the 2020 election leading up to January 6, all of those conversations he directly would have had with Donald Trump, the president at the time, at a time when Donald Trump was pressuring him to overturn the vote, Pence refused to do so.Pence has also spoken about those conversations publicly. He has written about them in his would being that is he is on a tour about now. He is talking about them really regularly, but never before has an investigation, has a grand jury and has prosecutors gotten Pence under oath to reveal exactly what he thought, what he felt, and what was said between him and Donald Trump on those crucial days part of this investigation. So this is a really significant moment in the January 6 criminal investigation being led by special counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department. It is also quite a momentous moment in history, there has never before been a vice president called to testify under subpoena about the president they served alongside. That didn't happen in Watergate with Richard Nixon, it didn't happen in Whitewater with Bill Clinton which both had very active grand juries. So this is different. It also has a very crucial moment putting Mike Pence here because the Justice Department had to fight for this testimony. They went to court over this. Donald Trump tried to block the testimony. He tried to limit what pence could say about the direct conversations. He lost those court battles. Mike Pence also went to court to fight on this and did not want to testify under subpoena, but he did get a bit of leeway from the court being able to protect what he was doing when he was the presiding officer on January 6. But today, that federal grand jury did hear from Mike Pence for more than five hours one-on-one. The grand jurists would have been able to ask him questions. They would have been able to piece him into the investigation, a very active investigation that they have heard from many, many witnesses on and now the prosecutors will take that testimony and see how it fits, try to fit it into potential charges as they look towards the future. It will become at least part of the record of what will now be known about January 6 to the Justice Department and to potentially to the public later on. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

It doesn't take long and much to spin up a brief tornado in the panhandle of Florida because we get the friction with the lands, the storms moving off of the Gulf of Mexico and they were able to literally topple trees and power lines like they were tooth picks.We had seven tornado reports, the majority of them in the Florida Panhandle, with the exception, one tornado report in southern Georgia. Plenty of wind reports and hail as well. That has been the story. Here is the storm system, just rain across the mid-Atlantic, severe threat died down for the moment across the panhandle, but that will change, marginal risk for this area through the course of the day today. And then we start to focus our attention across central Texas, Austin to Dallas. That is the area we need to keep weather aware. There is an enhanced risk and you see the line of thunderstorm that's coming through with a powerful, fast-moving cold front, it's going to help trigger off a few stronger storms and we could see an isolated tornado across that region today. So, keep an eye of the sky. Here is a look at the wet weekend outlook across the east coast. Heads up D.C. to New York, you've got rain in your forecast. And then our flood warnings continue across the Mississippi river as our slow moving disaster continues to move further and further south of lacrosse heading toward Davenport and Dubuque, Iowa, region. That is where we anticipate a cresting Mississippi River by later this weekend and early parts of next week. You can see some of the flooding impacting homes and businesses -- Christine.",

And prosecutors in Massachusetts are urging federal magistrate to hold a suspected leaker in jail without bond. They say the national guardsman charged with posting highly classified documents to social media has a history of violence threats and owns an arsenal of weapons. More now from CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tonight, 21-year-old Jack Teixeira in custody after appearing in court for his detention hearing. Prosecutors portrayed the suspected leaker of classified documents as a risk to flee, incapable of trust he promised to uphold as a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. There is no integrity in Teixeira's character because there can be none when there's a profound breach of trust, said Nadine Pellegrini, from the U.S. attorney's office. In a dumpster at Teixeira's home, authorities found a tablet, laptop and Xbox, they've all been smashed. Prosecutors said it was a way of them to stopping understanding the seriousness and scale of Teixeira's conduct. BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY:  The department is looking not only at our intelligence processes and procedures as it relates to security or sensitive information and who has that information, but also looking at the process by which we clear and vet individuals for security clearances. And that work is ongoing.",

He also asked another user what type of rifle would be good to conduct a shooting in a crowded urban or suburban environment. Teixeira's lawyers argued in court he poses no danger and is not unique in collecting weapons. Some people are car guys. Some people like boats. And some people like guns, his attorney said in court, defending his client as the Pentagon defended the process that led here. The leaked documents have exposed classified U.S. intel including about the war in Ukraine. Documents revealed the limitations of Ukraine's air defenses and manpower, while also detailing Russia's efforts to recruit more troops to plug its military's ranks, valuable info the prosecutors say other countries would covet. And authorities warned Teixeira may still have more sensitive intelligence hidden away and could still be capable of causing extraordinary damage to U.S. national security. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera):  Teixeira remains in custody at this point. The judge didn't rule on whether he would be kept in custody yet. That ruling expected soon. But the judge may have given an indication which way he was leaning when he said he found the prosecution evidence, quote, fairly compelling. Oren Lieberman, CNN, in the Pentagon.",

PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  E. Jean Carroll grilled on her allegations that Donald Trump raped her in a department store in the 1990s. This on the third day of her civil battery and defamation lawsuit in a federal court in Manhattan. Trump defense lawyer Joe Tacopina cross-examined Carroll for hours today about her story and her motivations. Using your own words, the facts that you have alleged in the story you have alleged here are odd, Tacopina said. Carroll responded: Certain parts of this story are difficult to conceive of, yes. The exchange becoming heated when Tacopina repeatedly asked Carroll why she didn't scream during the alleged assault. I'm not screamer. I was too much in panic to scream. You can't beat up on me for not screaming. Tacopina shot back, I'm not beating you up. I'm asking you questions, Ms. Carroll. Through tears, Carroll asserted, I'm telling you he raped me whether I screamed or not. I don't need an excuse for not screaming.

Those are the two most likely charges against Trump if he is charged under January 6, mainly that they want to know if Trump admitted to Pence that he knew the election wasn't stolen. They would want to know Trump knowingly told Pence to violate the law. Did Trump know that the Eastman memo was legally bogus?Now, I'm convinced, Christine, that the Department of Justice will seek an indictment against Donald Trump and the Mar-a-Lago documents. This is a direct tie between Trump and alleged criminality there. When it comes to January 6, I'm not so sure because there's multiple layers between Trump and the violence on that day, so I think it is 50/50 whether he gets charged over the attempted insurrection.",

I thought it was more performance art. I always thought Pence wanted to testify. This is a little payback for everything that Trump did to him.But he had to pretend to fight the Department of Justice in court to placate the MAGA base because Pence wants to run for president and he doesn't want to be seen as a willing accomplice in the supposed persecution of the leader, Donald Trump. So I think Trump has something to be worried about. In the end, Jack Smith, the special counsel, got everything that he wanted from the court because the whole speech or debate clause Pence was trying to invoke, yeah, that doesn't stop him from testifying about what Trump told him before and around the time of January 6.
