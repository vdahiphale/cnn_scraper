And who is behind the drones the Kremlin says were sent to kill Putin? A top Ukrainian official speaks exclusively to OUTFRONT. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Erin Burnett tonight. And OUTFRONT, breaking news, Trump tapes at Mar-a-Lago, sources tell CNN, special counsel Jack Smith is now asking questions about the handling of surveillance tapes from Trump's home in Florida, and whether the tapes could have been tampered with. Smith, of course, is leading an investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. We're told, prosecutors want to hear from one or two of Trump Org executives, and these are people who are said to know a lot about the inner workings of Mar-a-Lago. It was just a week ago that Trump went on Fox News, as you may recall, to boast about the tapes he handed over to prosecutors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, good evening, Pam. Our colleague Katelyn Polantz and I have learned that prosecutors working for special counsel Jack Smith have been asking about security footage from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. And specifically, how it was handled after Trump Organization received a subpoena for it last summer.Of course, this footage is critical to understanding how classified materials were handled, once they went down to Florida, and, of course, the special counsel is not just looking into the possible mishandling of classified documents, he's also looking at any efforts to obstruct this investigation. And we have learned that tomorrow, two top executives from the Trump Organization are expected to go before the grand jury to ask questions related to this exact subject. Specifically, Matthew Calamari Jr., he's a longtime Trump Organization executive, he's worked for decades, he's currently the chief operating officer, executive vice president. And during his time there, he is primarily overseen security. Now, his son, Matthew Calamari Jr., also works there. He's now officially the director of security. Both of them are expected to appear before Smith's grand jury tomorrow. And we have learned that they are expected to be asked about this security footage and how it was handled, and any conversations among Trump Organization employees once they received that subpoena. Now, we've also learned that other lower level Trump Organization officials have also been asked about what happened to this footage after the subpoena, how was it handled? And the Calamaris tomorrow, they are among several witnesses expected to go before this grand jury. Pam, this is a significant development for the special counsel, to go this far into Trump's inner circle. Calamari is widely considered to be one of his top and most trusted advisers, so, for him to go before the grand jury in this investigation is significant, and also a reminder, they're not just looking at how this materials were handled, but they're also very closely examining whether anyone tried to get in the way of them having all the evidence that they had subpoenaed.",

I think as a prosecutor, one does not want to go with on what you call a fishing expedition to find new evidence or simply to look for things that may not be there. So, my guess, and again it's just a hunch, they have some basis before going into the grand jury. They believe that there must have been some obstructive act with regard to that surveillance video footage.Now, picking up on where Ryan left off, you are looking at a potentially very serious crime if there is alleged obstruction of justice. It carries up to a 20-year penalty in jail time, including fines. And to Ryan's point, once the subpoena came, everyone in the orbit, in Trump's orbit, would have been on notice that there was an ongoing investigation. That's the first element you have for obstruction of justice, that the person doesn't just temper or falsified something, they know there's an ongoing investigation. And then the act of sort of falsifying or obstruct -- destroying a record for the purpose of impeding the investigation. That's what they'd have to prove their. So, my guess is, they might know something, but we'll just have to see if any charges come down from this.",

That would be very important to know if they had any other footage dating further back in time.And it also sounds as though, what the special counsel wants to hear about is how people like Walter Nauta, who was caught on the video and others like the Calamaris may have been discussing the video surveillance, and when they're about to handed over to the Justice Department, they know it has incriminating evidence on it -- this aide moving the boxes out after they received a subpoena in the direction to keep the boxes in the storage room.

The defendant intended to commit the act. And again, sort of like Ryan's point, were their conversations, they have evidence, that people knew what they were doing here?

What else could they possibly do? That's something we're definitely hearing from Ukrainians who have been witnessing parts of Ukraine bombarded heavily over the past 48 hours, specifically Kherson region, where we've seen over 20 lives lost in a bombing of a railway station, and a shopping center there. Devastating scenes, an area just recently liberated from Russia, discriminate shelling it seems in a place to which is so concerned about potential counteroffensives launched by Ukraine. And it's asking residents to potentially stay indoors, for 58 hours from Friday. A lot of questions still to be answered, Pam, as to exactly what occurred above the Kremlin. Very little evidence provided by Moscow to support its claims of an assassination attempt against Putin, a lot of videos that appear to match up together. Backing up some of their accusations, still, very little else supply to them physically, about the existence of these drones. And so, two possible theories emerging here, is this an awful security lapse that we've actually seen over Moscow? Where the center of power has indeed been attacked by some form of drone, that would be deeply embarrassing for Vladimir Putin, certainly, an ex-KGB men priding himself on security and is tight control of Russia, or are we perhaps seeing something here put on by Russia to suggest it under attack in a new, unprecedented fashion? That it seat of power, it sovereignty, is under threat? Is that, as many Ukrainians are concerned about here, potentially heralding some escalation, if Moscow can find it in its arsenal against civilians or Ukraine itself? Pam?",

Do you think Russian partisans were behind these drone strikes, as you heard from this former Russian lawmaker? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Pam, I don't know. It is certainly a possibility. We've all been watching the last 14 months, on and off, these sort of attacks and incidents, of deep in Russia, and close to the border, oil refineries, and several other types of infrastructure attacks. And then, just most recently, trains have been knocked out, and again, more oil refineries, there is thought, and there is seemingly a resistance. We saw how many people left Russia, that meant a lot remain. So, something is going on. We just don't know. I don't know if it was a Ukrainian attack, it doesn't appear to be, the more we dig into it. Is it partisans? There's a long history, historically, of that in these regions. Was it a false flag?

That ought to be a heck of a good starting point for us to get something across the line with 60 votes. Without permitting, in the United States of America, it takes to five to 10 years to get any project into basically reality or it's going to be built. The rest of the developing world takes about three years or less. So, I'll give you a perfect example, if somebody wants to build a windmill out in the Gulf of Mexico somewhere, if they started today, it would probably take them eight years just to do without any permitting. You put permitting on top of that, you could be anywhere from 18 years or longer. That's ridiculous. You can't do that. We need pipelines, we need fossil fuel. Everyone's playing the game, which side are you on? You have to have energy security, and you have to be energy independent if you want to be the superpower of the world. And we can extract the gas and oil and the coal and do it better and cleaner than anywhere else in the world, and replace the dirty fuels that come from Russia or Venezuela or keeping -- preventing Iran from getting back into the market where they are the greatest terrorist supporter to do more harm to humankind. So, we have a piece of legislation that was all part of the permitting to bring it to fruition. The Inflation Reduction Act has brought more job opportunities, more manufacturing back to America, and we've got to make sure that the administration does what the bill says it does, and they shouldn't try to pass a piece of legislation and basically that they couldn't pass, and then write some rules thinking they can sneak that in. So, we're making them stay honest. We're going to keep them on track to stay honest. And we're going to get permitting done to make sure that we can build the pipelines, the transmission lines, everything we need to deliver the energy this country must have.",
