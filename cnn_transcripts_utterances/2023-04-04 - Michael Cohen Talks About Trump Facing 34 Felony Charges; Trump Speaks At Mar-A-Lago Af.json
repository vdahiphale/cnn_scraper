He's the Author of the book, \"Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the US Department of Justice Against His Critics.\" He's also the host of two podcasts. \"Political Beatdown\" is the first. The other is called \"Mea Culpa.\" Michael, my understanding is that you were not watching his remarks, this evening. But today is obviously a day that you've talked about, and thought about, for a long time. Was anything that came out, today, in any way, surprising? Was there anything that stood out to you? MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP, \"MEA CULPA\" &amp; \"POLITICAL BEATDOWN\" PODCAST HOST, AUTHOR, \"REVENGE\": Well, when it comes to the District Attorney's case, this is the District Attorney's case. I was merely someone who provided testimony and documentation. And this is for Alvin Bragg, to make the case, before the judge, and the jury, if in fact that it gets that far, which I suspect that it will. At the end of the day, you're right. I wasn't watching, today. I had some personal things, to take care of that took me out of New York. Obviously, as soon as I came back, I started to read all of the nonsense, with the typical Donald Trump rallies, despite the fact it was inside of Mar-a-Lago. It's the typical grievance, complaining, moaning, and bellyaching, about how bad the industry, how bad this country, has been treating him. TAPPER: Yes. One of the things that I thought was interesting, that you can speak about now, that the indictment is public, comes in the statement of facts. One of the criticisms of the potential case, against Donald Trump, is not the misdemeanor charges of business fraud that by all accounts seems pretty solid. It's the question of whether or not this rises to become a felony, which it does, if these, this business fraud can be proven, to have been done, to hide other crimes. And the argument, although Mr. Bragg did not specify, what those other crimes might be, the argument was, it might have something to do with the campaign election financing, and whether or not these were campaign contributions--",

They felt as if they were able to deal with this well. And then, he gave a speech, where he didn't really talk about that indictment very much at all. He did do exactly what he was warned against doing, by the judge, which is, talked about the prosecutor, and his family, and talked about the judge, and his family. And I don't know how that's going to go over. It has a feeling of Trump is almost daring the judge, to issue a gag order, which a lot of Trump supporters had been predicting, defiantly, would happen. Trump, as we know, pushes the bounds of conduct over and over again. I expect you will see that here. Basically, his argument is what it has been, which is \"Any investigation into me is unjust.\" I was really surprised at how much time he spent talking about the Mar-a-Lago boxes investigation, the documents case, which we know he is very preoccupied with, and concerned about, and talks about a lot.

We know Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, has been moving very aggressively, very tight deadlines, not just for Trump attorneys, but for witnesses that they've been subpoenaing. We confirmed the other day that they have called him members of the Secret Service to come in and testify as well. They're basically asking anyone and everyone. His comments, tonight, seemed to indicate just such a high level of concern, when it comes to the documents investigation, in a really notable way. Obviously, the New York case is top of mind, because that is where he was, today.

And that was certainly what we saw here, tonight. Almost everyone here was a rabid Trump supporter, the Matt Gaetzes, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes. He exists on a social media platform, Truth Social, which is, again, an echo chamber. It's all people, who are supporting him, who are repeating his ideas. And there is a concern about what this means, politically.

As, I know, both Maggie and Kaitlan said, he spent a lot of time, on what he called the documents hoax. We know that he is concerned about that investigation, that's one of the top investigations he cares about. But those kind of in-the-weeds details were not something that elicited the cheers. The cheers came for the lobs at Alvin Bragg, the lobs at the prosecutors, the lobs at the Special Counsel. That's what actually got the cheers, here in the crowd. And I do want to point out one thing that one of the biggest cheers I heard, all night, was actually before he even spoke, when I heard the crowd breakout, chanting \"Kari won!\" when Kari Lake walked in.

So, in the context of what he's saying, yes, he needs to be very careful. I will - I would expect the judge to continue to admonish him.

There are text messages, and documents, and Mr. Cohen said that earlier, on your show, that are going to corroborate Michael Cohen. But notably, that's - a lot of that material is new. And I think what we lose sight of here is that the Trump Organization forced the prosecution, the District Attorney's office, to go to trial, in tax and other fraud-related charges. When prosecutors prepare for trial, they dig in much deeper. And, I think, I suspect that some of this new evidence that became available to the District Attorney, probably related to that trial, that the Trump Organization, as is their right, forced the District Attorney, to prepare for. And I'm not saying that they shouldn't have done it. They did it. They were convicted, very swiftly. They will have to pay a fine.

And all indications are that Fani Willis is getting towards the end of her case. Now, if we look at DOJ? Donald Trump just made a series of false claims, about Jack Smith, and his investigation. He said, \"Jack Smith is out there threatening people with prison, if they don't cooperate.\" That's not what's happening. Jack Smith is going after people with lawful subpoenas. They're claiming executive privilege. And Jack Smith is cleaning their clocks in court. Jack Smith is winning these executive privilege, at the Federal District Court of Appeal - federal district court level, at the Federal Court of Appeals level. Just today, he won at the Court of Appeals level, with respect to Mark Meadows, and various other close aides. So, Jack Smith is playing hard and playing clean here, so.
