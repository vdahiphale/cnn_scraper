Tens of thousands of people statewide are without power. The system is so strong, a wind gust of 140 miles per hour was reported in Northern Texas in the town of Memphis. More than 115 storms have now been reported across the Southern Plains and more than 65 million people are under high wind alerts.

So, it appears to be posing, I think, for the sake primarily of its own people, but also in hopes that it could perhaps convince enough Europeans and it might be able to appeal to parts of Europe away from the United States.

They resent having to work with the global system that they think the United States dominates in favor of its own interests, against their own. They also deeply resent worldwide media system, what China calls a worldwide discourse power system, in which the United States is able to define Russia, China, Iran, other countries as bad actors. They see the United States as an existential threat, and they need each other as partners to combat that threat. That was why Xi Jinping stood with Vladimir Putin before the Beijing Olympics last year and pledged a no limits partnership.

There's a lot more to it than that, an awful lot more of detail. And part of the situation today is no one knows the details, and that may be announced later today.

Their hope, of course, is that there will be a long term solution for them. And President Erdogan and his government have pledged to rebuild the affected areas within one year, but we have been speaking to aid workers on the ground. They tell us that these camps could be in places for years, some of them two to three years, and that is the expectation from those supporting the response effort on the ground. And there has been some criticism, some backlash, against the government's plans to rebuild quickly. There has been warnings from the union of architects and engineers that this is simply too hasty. We are already beginning to see excavation work in part of Gaziantep, plans for 30,000 apartments to begin construction in March. So there is clearly some work to already underway and many are saying that there needs to be more geological investigations, more preparation to ensure that these buildings are safe. And, overall, there is a growing sense of frustration, a growing sense of anger directed at the government, particularly with elections looming. In fact, just yesterday, there was a football match, a soccer match, between two Turkish teams, Besiktas and Antalyaspor. Both of those teams, of course, they're marking their show of solidarity. We saw teddy bears and thousands of stuffed animals being thrown onto the pitch, but there was also calls for the government to resign. And there was a moment there where the match was paused at 4 minutes and 17 seconds to correspond with a that the earthquake struck, at four of the morning. And those calls for the government to resign, for President Erdogan to step down, could be heard then. So, there is clearly a growing sense of a backlash against the government. The government itself has conceded that more could be done. There is still more work for the government to do. But they said this is a work in progress. It will take time. And they are still pushing ahead with that investigation over allegations of construction negligence. Around 188 people so far arrested and more than 600 people identified as potential suspects.

      "sentences": "Yeah. And it was -- there were -- these attacks are rather unusual, I would say, in terms of just unprecedented in sort of how they played out. So, the day essentially started with an attack on two Israeli brothers, 19 and 21 years old, who were driving along a route that passes through Palestinian town known as Huwara. This is a flash point place often because this route was used so often by both Israeli settlers and at Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.And from what we understand, an attacker essentially came up to this call while it was sitting in traffic. And officials say they shot at the two brothers at point blank range and they both died. The attacker then managed to flee, and there is a massive manhunt by Israeli authorities underway to try to catch the attacker or attackers. And no claim for responsibility by any militant group as of yet, although several celebrated the attack. Then a few hours later, there was the summit (ph) in Aqaba, where Israelis, the Palestinian authority, Jordanians, Egyptians, and the Americans all down for what has become a very rare summit. I think the last time a summit of the sort took place was more than 10 years ago. And the whole point of this meeting was to try and calm the situation on the ground, especially ahead of the overlapping Muslim and Jewish holidays of Ramadan and Passover that are coming up towards the end of March, beginning of April. And you know, there were good statements coming out of this meeting, both sides in a joint statement agreeing to have essentially a joint security committee to look at reestablishing security cooperation between the Palestinian authority and the Israelis, a commitment for Israel is to stop discussion on settlements expression for a few months, while the Palestinians saying that they will not try to go after Israel at the United Nations and an agreement to meet again in March, ahead of Ramadan, in Egypt. But then as night fell, almost as soon as the statements came out, we get word of Israeli settlers essentially rampaging through Huwara where the earlier attack took place through other villages, setting fire to homes, setting fire to cars. We heard of scores of injuries, including one Palestinian mid killed, apparently shot, possibly by Israeli settlers in what is being deemed revenge attacks. And from people that I've spoken to who have been watching this for sometime, they cannot recall violence like this, especially the sort of revenge attack by Israeli settlers. The Israeli military saying that they are reinforcing the forces in the West Bank, both to try and find the person that carried out the attacker earlier in Huwara against those two Israeli brothers but also to try to keep the calm between Israeli settlers and Palestinians over there.
