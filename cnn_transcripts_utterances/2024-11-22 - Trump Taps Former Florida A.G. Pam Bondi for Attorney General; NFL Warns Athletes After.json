This morning, the Republican reviews, so far so good, as Pam Bondi, Florida's first female top prosecutor, takes embattled ex-Congressman Matt Gaetz's spot as Trump's new attorney general pick. Gaetz's downfall, the question is, will he be the only one to fall?And there is new scrutiny this morning over other controversial picks with four key cabinet positions still left to fill. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering it all for us. Alayna, just hours after Gaetz withdrew and people's jaws dropped, Trump announced Bondi will be his new A.G. pick. What's happened behind the scenes and why, Bondi, who is an A.G. in Florida?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Yesterday was a huge day for Pete Hagseth. He has been tapped to lead the Pentagon in the Trump administration. And he met with a number of members who serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee trying to make his case to them with J.D. Vance, the incoming vice president in the room. And I think one of the things that senators are trying to impress upon all of these nominees that are coming to Capitol Hill is, A, yes, they have an open mind about their nomination, but that this process is going to be rigorous.This is a process that requires a public hearing, background checks, vetting of these nominees, as well as a series of questions that can range into the hundreds that they have to respond to all these senators in writing after the hearing has taken place. And so I think part of this process, and I talked to somebody who had met with Gaetz the day before, is really trying to keep a sense of how serious this process is for these members, because, yes, members want to keep an open mind, but they also have some concerns. Yesterday, Kevin Cramer, who's a conservative from the state of North Dakota, said that he does have a lot of questions about Pete Hegseth's record, especially related to that police report that came out yesterday. So, this is an issue that lawmakers are looking at. It is a long time for this vetting process to take place. And here is what Senator Mike Rounds said about what he's looking at right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  My first impression was that it was a good pick. You've got an individual who has experience as a prosecutor and was an attorney general in Florida. Those are good signs. I think he trusts her. I think he would feel comfortable with her as the attorney general. I want an opportunity to visit with Pete. I want to visit with him, see what his thoughts are, how he would handle the department. He's going to have to answer those questions with regard to anything that's in his record. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, I was talking to Senator Susan Collins yesterday, a Republican from Maine, and we were talking a little bit about recess appointments. And she said, you know, one thing that I'm really concerned about is the fact that I have seen our power chip away in the Senate over the course of the last decade that I've been here in Washington.And I think, Kate, we just can't overlook the fact that for senators, they do take this job seriously, they do have questions. And despite the fact many Republicans do believe Donald Trump has a right to have who he wants in his cabinet, the underlying reality is they have some questions about these nominees. They're going to be asking them and this is not going to be a cakewalk for the folks who are going before these committees and going through this process. Kate?",

You know, if you're going to go somewhere, don't go on social media and say, hey, I'm here, because that tells burglars I'm away from home.And then also this doesn't just apply to athletes, but to anyone, you know, don't post images of your homes and expensive items. You're essentially telling potential burglars out there here are all the things that you could possibly get, you know, from my home if you were to stage one of these robberies. And you know, at the end of the day they're saying that, you know, have a home security system.

Because what's happening today is the State Board of Education is voting on a menu of curriculum for K through 12 schools in the state of Texas. One of those materials is the state created material. It is called Bluebonnet Learning. It was created by the Texas Education Agency, and critics say that it is infused with Christianity more so than other religions, and that it just has a lot of references to the Bible. Now, throughout this week, there have been dozens of people who have gone to Austin and presented public comment on both sides of this issue. Some say that this is a violation of the separation of church and state. Others say that there's nothing wrong with biblical teachings and that they should be included in school curriculum. Here are some of those individuals who have spoken out in their own voices. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
