This is the former president's lawyers move to stop prosecutors in their tracks.Plus, Putin's spin. Russian state TV in overdrive after a top general slams the country's military leaders and is fired for it. This as we learn more about Putin's alleged meeting with the man who tried to overthrow him. And tonight, an arrest in serial killings that terrorized New York for more than a decade. The suspect is 59-year-old married father of two, and established architect. The shocking details about how police tracked down their suspect. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, closing in. CNN learning exclusively that the special counsel has met with more top officials from states crucial to Trump's attempt to cling to power after the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors have now interviewed the secretary of states from Pennsylvania and New Mexico. These are the latest of course in a growing list of state officials whose cooperation with the special counsel is now public. The high profile meetings come amid an uptick of activity in the investigation, a sign that charging decisions could be near. It's also clear former president Trump may be feeling some of that pressure tonight, taking a page from a familiar playbook to derail the multiple investigations he is facing in Georgia, where a grand jury was selected to look into Trump's efforts to interfere with that state's 2020 election. The former president's lawyers are now asking the court to toss out the evidence gathered last year by a special grand jury, claiming the investigation not only violates Trump's fundamental constitutional rights but also, quote, it is one thing to indict a ham sandwich, to indict the mustard stained napkin that it once sat on is quite another. Trump's team trying to delay a case where the Fulton County, D.A. Fani Willis has indicated criminal charges could come in a few weeks. Now, all of this, of course, is happening at the same time that Trump's lawyers submitted a request to delay the criminal trial that he mishandled classified documents. Let's begin tonight with Evan Perez. He is OUTFRONT live in Washington. So, Evan, what more do we know first of all about these interviews with these top election officials in Pennsylvania and New Mexico?",

He was appointed as the secretary of the commonwealth, and he, in his interview with the special counsel, Jack Smith's team, he talked about some of the pressures that he and other officials there in Philadelphia faced because of the efforts of the former president and his allies.The other person who was interviewed is the secretary of state of New Mexico, Maggie Toluse Oliver. Again, it's a similar thing we have heard from other officials about the pressures these officials face as a result of the efforts of the former president to overturn the elections there. As you pointed out, seven states was the focus of this effort and now we know that Jack Smith has subpoenaed records from all seven of those states -- Erica.",

So I think that that is really where all of these cases turn, and, you know, he does have a First Amendment right to make certain statements, hyperbolic statements.But when you are crossing into the territory of actually conspiring with other people, to take actions to subvert processes, that is going to be a big question here.

They went before the judge who had overseen the special purpose grand jury asking that judge to toss out the findings of the grand jury. Now he's essentially doing another Hail Mary pass, trying to go to a higher court.

Neighboring Belarus was where Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was supposed to be exiled to after his aborted insurrection in Russia, throwing his fate and that of Wagner's into doubt. In a new interview released today, Putin proclaimed, we do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist. The group exists, but legally, it does not exist. Putin is referencing Russia's law against mercenary groups, but also stating a new reality. Wagner, as it has existed in Ukraine as a fighting force, could be done.

Putin offered the Wagner leaders the chance to continue fighting in the Russian army, under their commander, nicknamed Sedoi or gray hair. Andrei Troshev, a retired colonel and founding member of Wagner. Troshev is sanctioned by the E.U. and U.K. He's fought in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Syria, earning Russia's highest military honors. The men, Putin said, nodded affirmatively, but Prigozhin sitting in the front said after listening, no, the guys do not agree with this decision. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (on camera):  So what happened after Prigozhin apparently openly disagreed with Putin? That we don't know. Prigozhin may be out of Ukraine but he certainly wants to hold on to his business interests both in Africa and in the Middle East. As for what happened to his men, the Pentagon says the bulk of them are back here in Ukraine in Russian-occupied areas, back in their barracks, but the Defense Department says they are no longer taking part in military operations here in Ukraine -- Erica.",

Now, Putin is a guy who will imprison somebody who gives a speech about him in a negative way for 25 years. Here you've got a guy, Prigozhin who are led a rebellion of 15,000 of his own mercenaries, took over a bunch of Russian military bases and he has a meeting with Putin, and Putin says I'm trying to convince him to repent?

About 10 years ago, they froze $20 million of that money, and they're going to return that money to the Russian criminals, people who are already on the U.S. sanctions list, on the Canadian, U.K. and Australian sanctions list.

There was a car that they got information right around the time when the bodies were discovered of a potential suspect that this vehicle he may have been driving, and somehow they were able to connect this vehicle to the suspect here, and that was one of their big breaks. Once they made that connection, they started doing more work, looking at phone records, search warrants, the police today saying they did over 300 search warrants and subpoenas in just the last year, year and a half that they restarted this investigation. And then they started connecting the dots, and then, as you said, the pizza box, the DNA, and the other key evidence was from the garbage at his home when they got DNA from his wife, and they connected it to some of the hairs that were found on these women who police say were tortured, were -- their arms were taped, they were in other ways just tortured and that's how they essentially started to put everything together. And keep in mind that the suspect here, he had been under surveillance for probably about a year or so. So they were zeroing in on him, and really ultimately led to DNA.

There have been, a fair amount of Democratic insiders, doubters, naysayers kind of wringing their hands over President Biden's age, approval numbers, a lot of concern about early fund-raisers and a feeling that maybe he wasn't delivering. This new fundraising haul, though, some $72 million in the second quarter, what is the message that sends? JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST, \"THE LEAD\":  Well, it's interesting because he raised more than double what Donald Trump was able to raise in the same period. But four years ago, Donald Trump was able to raise, I think, $110 million during that same period. So, there's still stuff for Democrats to wring their hands about.

But he was a huge hero. And there is something of the same DNA of Evel Knievel in Donald Trump, in their abilities to be these quintessentially American salesmen, showmen, people who get media attention, people who shoot from the hip, say controversial things and get away with it. And so, I play with that a little bit. The bigger parallel is in this book, one of the characters, Lucy, works for a fictitious media mandate, a British one who starts a tabloid in D.C., and he is really very, very loosely based on Rupert Murdoch. And tabloid journalism popped in 1977 with the son of Sam murders in New York City. And so, there are a lot of parallels about 1977 and what we're living in today.",
