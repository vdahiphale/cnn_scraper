There's no grand agreement on a final deal for funding the government. But even this short-term move, just to keep talks going is a hard sell in the House for Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline Republicans balking and pushing back. Listen to some of these comments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ANDY OGLES (R-TN): Now it's a fight.

Ultimately getting pushed out as a speaker in historic fashion. And then leaving Mike Johnson with having to deal with funding the government. Johnson essentially cutting a similar deal. Almost the same deal that McCarthy himself caught last spring on funding levels. That is what's causing all the problems at the moment. And when I caught up with Speaker Jack -- Johnson, I asked him if he's concerned he's facing the same fate as Kevin McCarthy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because what they did yesterday is they took procedural steps to essentially sink what's known on Capitol Hill as a rule.That essentially scuttled legislation moving forward on the floor. That is rarely done but it's been done with increased frequency in this Congress to protest majority when members are not happy with the way their leadership is dealing with things. At the moment, they're trying to figure out if there's any sort of accommodation from those very same members who simply have stopped all legislation in his tracks. And of course, Kate, the big question, can they avoid a government shutdown by the end of next week? That is what Speaker Johnson is struggling to try to avoid. But can they avoid one, given the demands from the right flank for new border restrictions, as well as deeper spending cuts? That is a big question. And then with days here, Kate.",

These charges as they're charged right now, he's facing up to 17 years in prison.Of course, we don't expect that it'll be anything like that if he is found guilty. What Prosecutors allege or they accused Hunter Biden, they say that during the -- during this period, he was taking a lot of money, millions of dollars from clients, both in Ukraine and in China. And he wasn't spending any of that money paying his taxes. They say that he was using it to fund a very -- an -- a -- an elaborate lifestyle. Including paying for exotic cars, and exotic dancers. A lot of personal problems during the time that he was struggling with substance abuse. Hunter Biden, for his part, says that he paid those taxes. And he says and his lawyer -- legal team says that the only reason why he's facing these charges at all is because Republicans have been putting pressure on the Justice Department. You remember, Kate, just a few months ago back in July, Hunter Biden was minutes away from sealing a plea deal on these very same charges. He was going to be able to get away with only a misdemeanor -- pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors. And now, here we are.

We're outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan. You're looking at live pictures from inside that courthouse just outside the courtroom where closing arguments are now being delivered in the civil fraud trial against Donald Trump. They've been going on now for about an hour and a half. Trump's attorneys have until 12:45 to finish laying out their case. One thing we still are waiting for, Trump had asked to be part of the closing arguments himself. He wanted to deliver part of them. The judge said no because Trump won't agree to certain conditions. There's still a small possibility Trump's team, we think, might try to sneak him in at the end. That may be unlikely. We are watching very closely. In the meantime, Paula, lay out the case that Trump's attorneys are making right now.",

He also insists that his client had no intent to defraud banks when his financial statements and misrepresented the true value of his assets.Now, they also went after Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. Now, Michael Cohen has played an important role in the origin story of this case. Because in 2019, he testified before Congress that Trump had lied to banks and insurance companies trying to get more favorable terms both for loans, insurance, and also taxes. That is part of what inspired this investigation that went on for four years and has resulted in this civil case. But they also attacked Cohen pretty personally.",

Inflation closing out the year, we have the full picture now, up 3.4 percent in the past 12 months, and up about .03 percent in December. That was a little higher than analysts were projecting. But just look where we came from. We came from inflation at 9.1 percent in June of 2022. And in December of last -- of 2022, it was at 6.5 percent. It's sort of like if you set a weight loss goal and you want to lose 10 pounds, the first eight pounds may be easier to lose, some water weight off, but those last two pounds, are really difficult to lose.

We're not going to see the prices that we saw in 2019. However, cooling inflation means that prices are just rising slower. And that is good news. We are headed in the right direction.
