He appeared in front of a judge in Brooklyn Criminal Court, and it was there that we got an opportunity to learn some of the details that were reported by the detective that initially investigated this incident.It happened early on Sunday morning, and as we've been reporting, there was a man who now stands accused of murder in the first degree who approached a woman who was asleep inside of a subway car. He pulled a lighter out of his jacket pocket and lit her on fire. That woman died. Now, the suspect was in court just a few hours ago and we got some additional detail, including what you mentioned at the beginning, that at one point they have video evidence showing that the suspect actually was fanning the flames by using a t-shirt to fan the flames as the woman was becoming engulfed in fire. We've also learned that the victim's cause of death has been determined by the city's medical examiner. She died of smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. The woman who died in this incident has not yet been identified. Now, the suspect, Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, is 33 years old. He's originally from Guatemala. And he is facing murder in the first and second degrees - degree and arson charges. He was remanded back into custody, and he is expected to appear back in court next Friday. We have heard from the Brooklyn District Attorney, Eric Gonzalez, in this case. He has said that he expects to prosecute the case to the full extent of the law. And it is a case that has just really put a focus on a big issue here in New York City, and that is the safety of the public transit system, as well as public safety in general, mental illness, as well as homelessness. Both the suspect and the victim in this case are believed to have been homeless. The suspect has spent the last few months checking in and out of homeless shelters. And the woman, who has yet to be identified, also believed to be homeless by law enforcement officials. We have reached out to the lawyer, who is representing the suspect in this case, but have not heard back, but just learning some really horribly graphic details in the last few hours about how this incident unfolded.",

That is part of the reason we do not know who she was. Just the fact that her body was left in a condition where she was not able to be recognized or anything in her belongings to figure out who she was.So hopefully we will learn her identity soon. It's something that we know the medical examiner's office is working on. In fact, it was part of the reason why the arraignment was so delayed. They were waiting on the autopsy to be completed, so that could be included in the testimony that was used in the arraignment.",

And it all goes to the level of being - between a second-degree murder or first degree murder. And this is one of the few times you might get that first degree murder indictment, because if you cause the death of a person and you actually - through torture, you know, it definitely elevates the charges.So we always try to make sure that motive is a key thing when it comes to charging any criminal charge.

But so far, we've had nine murders this year in the subway system at this same time. So that gives you an increase of over 60 percent. At this time last year, we only had five. So, you know, there's certain felonies that we could say, you know, it wasn't really a larceny, it might've been a robbery. And we could kind of change things around on paper.

They've delayed about 1,200 flights today. If you have another option to potentially fly with a different carrier, you could get that full refund from American and then go and voluntarily choose to book a last minute ticket. And in some cases, those tickets aren't as expensive as some people might think, especially on some of the lower cost carriers that could be operating on time and getting you to your final destination in time for the holidays.",

It's the airline who is now responsible for processing these things, for telling you what's included, whether you're bagged, how much it costs, what's the seat assignment fee.

Ideally, you have those alternative options already thought through before you get that cancellation. But I'm going to Expedia, Google Flights, starting to see what other airlines are out there. If they're on time, it's locking in those seats as soon as possible, and then handling the compensation and the refunds afterwards.Because when time is of the essence, such as when you get that notification, you and all of your traveling companions who may be on that flight are also doing the exact same thing.

And for him to direct the Justice Department to do anything is a little unusual.But look, people disagree on the death penalty. We disagree on the death penalty. I don't support the death penalty, no matter how heinous the crime. I actually think spending the rest of your life rotting in a jail cell is worse than being put out of your misery through the death penalty. But that's a disagreement that we can have. It is absolutely the right of the president to issue a pardon or issue clemency. I don't love that provision in the Constitution. I don't think we should have it. But nevertheless, the founding fathers disagree with me. And so as a result of that, the same way that Donald Trump could pardon anybody he wanted to on his way out the door a few years ago is the same way that Joe Biden can pardon or give clemency to whoever he wants.

Believe it or not, the same way the Ukrainians miraculously don't want to be part of Russia. I mean, there are people who don't want to join other countries, no matter how much those countries want to annex them. And yes, you're right, the Russians have access to the Arctic, that's because their country borders the Arctic. We don't, for the most part, because our country doesn't, for the most part. And so we can't force somebody to annex themselves to us just because we want more access. The way to do it is to work with the Danes, our allies, cooperatively for mineral rights, for access to Arctic, for national security. But it's not by saying that we're somehow going to just grab Greenland and just annex it any more than we're going to annex the Panama Canal, which you may disagree or agree with Jimmy Carter and relinquishing back to the Panamanians. But nevertheless, here we are. The Panamanians own it and we can't get it back - short of what - a military strike? I don't know what the proposal here is. So look, there's a way to do this diplomatically and there's a way to have access to both the canal and to Greenland without suggesting, as Donald Trump is, that we are going to just go and grab it. And that's the difference between a president that knows how to do diplomacy, especially engage in diplomacy with our allies, and a president who just wants to stomp all over our own allies to get to a point that he's never going to get to because short of us sending the United States military to nationalize the Panama Canal, again, or to annex Greenland by force, I don't know what his plan here is with the way he's conducting himself.",
