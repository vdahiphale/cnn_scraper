In the Senate about a third of the seats are up for grabs and Republicans could also win the majority there. So far, more than 20 million pre-election ballots have been cast nationwide. And to attract more votes, both sides of pledging to fix the struggling economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  Democrats can't run on anything they've done. People don't like what they've done. They don't like high inflation. They don't like gas prices. Food prices up. They don't like it. The public doesn't like an open border. They don't like -- they don't like high crime, and that's what the Democrats are known for. I mean, they've done all these things. Democrats did it. They did it. They're going to, and they want to run away it. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Democrats have concrete plans and we have taken action to address the prices that I hear from voters. They care about healthcare costs, and we've got candidates on the other side of the aisle who say they would work to repeal what the president just signed into law that will help with prescription drug prices.

Violent clashes broke out between security forces and student protesters at university campuses across the country on Sunday. That is according to reporting from activists of human rights groups inside Iran, and it comes despite a warning from the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. He said protesters needed to end their weeks of anti-government demonstrations by last Saturday. CNN obtained this video from the pro-reform activist outlet IranWire. And CNN's Anna Coren joins me now live from Hong Kong. Anna, a brave and a flight protest continuing across Iran even in the midst of a deadly government crackdown and what appears to be this threat.

Five Israeli soldiers were injured after an attacker slammed a car into them, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The driver then continued to another location and rammed a bus stop where he was shot and injured. The attack took place less than 24 hours after a shooting in Hebron left one Israeli dead. The weekend's violence comes ahead of elections in Israel where security is often among voters' top concerns. Well, al-Qaeda-linked extremist group al-Shabaab claims responsibility for two car bombings in Somalia on Saturday. That is according to Reuters. The explosions killed at least 100 people, injuring hundreds of others as well. It is the latest escalation of tensions between the Somali government and the extremists, who also claim responsibility for an even more brutal attack years ago. CNN's Larry Madowo has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Smoke rises over Somalia's Education Ministry. The detonation of two car bombs near a busy intersection in the capital could be seen and heard throughout the city on Saturday. The blast happening in deadly succession. The second hitting just minutes later as ambulances arrived to treat the victims of the first blast. Cleanup is now underway as well as the search for bodies. (INAUDIBLE) rubble would normally be an area filled with people buying and selling food. Early Sunday, Somalia's president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, visited the blast site and said at least 100 people have been killed with hundreds more wounded, some so seriously. He expected the death to rise. He also blamed the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab terror group for the attacks. HASSAN SHEIKH MOHAMUD, PRESIDENT OF SOMALIA (through translator):  We and the Muslim Somali people are at war with these men. MADOWO (voice-over):  The terror group claimed responsibility for the blast, according to multiple reports. In a statement, al-Shabaab says they targeted the ministry because it teaches Somalia children using a Christian-based syllabus. Many of the wounded were taken to a nearby hospital, lucky to have survived the blast, but some say they are still shocked by the carnage they saw.",

Video shot outside the stadium during the Georgia-Florida football game Saturday night showed an antisemitic comment on a sign referencing remarks by rapper Kanye West. Similar messages appeared on a highway overpass at a downtown building. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist blasted his opponent, Gov. Ron DeSantis, for not condemning the messages, calling it a -- quote -- \"failure of leadership.\"Twitter's new owner, billionaire Elon Musk, posted a tweet Sunday promoting baseless allegations about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. CNN Donie O'Sullivan looks at how this incident is proving to be an early test for Musk in his new role as leader of the social media platform. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  So, just as we approach election day here in the United States, there are people at Twitter working to combat misinformation and disinformation about the election. But we saw on Sunday their new boss, the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, tweeting out a link to an article that was making baseless claims about what happened to Paul Pelosi. Musk eventually deleted that tweet, perhaps acknowledging he was wrong, but that website that he had linked to was basically a website that often publishes nonsense, including in 2016, that same website actually claimed that Hillary Clinton had died, and that the person on the campaign trail was a body double. Just a few days in to Musk's owning this company, we have seen a lot of upheaval within the company. Now, we see this Musk doing this publicly. It is going to be a rough ride for people at Twitter for the next time. Back to you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
