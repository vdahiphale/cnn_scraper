That he's learned from a lot of mistakes. And so, people evaluate your heart -- your character based upon what people are saying but also what he's saying and how he's saying it, and the level of credibility and trust. Elections are about trust, and who are they going to trust to represent Georgia is going to be the current senator who is going to join in taking the country left or is going to look at Herschel Walker and say that he's the right one to lead our country and make a difference in the Senate. And so, I give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's see on Election Day as to whether the voters do.",

I believe that they're fighting a battle that helps reflect a free Europe, and that's the reason that NATO and the European countries are united together in opposition and in support of Ukraine. Today, we're going to hear from not just Condoleezza Rice who is a supporter, as you said, of Ukraine, but we're also going to have a national security panel that's going to look at this more deeply and our relationship to China. And what happens in Ukraine against Russia impacts our relationship across the globe in terms of whether the United States is going to be in the leadership position that we usually are and where it can make a difference for the free people of Ukraine.",

This is because of inflation. The highest inflation in 40 years will mean big changes at tax time.The IRS making the largest change to deductions since it began cost of living adjustments during the Reagan administration. This means lower tax rates for some in 2023. The standard deduction for married couples filing rises to $27,700. For single taxpayers and married individuals, it is $13,850. And the IRS will adjust income levels for the seven tax brackets, raising from 10 to 37 percent. The top income tax rate of 37 percent will apply to individual income above $578,000 and $693,000 for married couples. The IRS raising the maximum contribution of flexible spending accounts by $200 and also raising the estate tax and annual gift tax limits.

We asked the White House about that. They confirmed that there were discussions. They said there was no request but that they would stand by El Paso. Brianna, we should note these conversations happen often between the federal government and border cities, especially in moments when they are seeing an influx. And that has been the case in El Paso where thousands of Venezuelan migrants have crossed into that city, straining their resources. Now, the mayor said in a statement to us that he does not, quote, \"bow to pressure.\" And he went on to say that it is, quote, \"critical to work not only with the federal government but with regional elected leaders and multiple partners when facing a humanitarian crisis of this level.\" He also added the federal government has worked closely with him on issues and as he's raised these challenges. Now, we should also note that the administration, last week, announced that they're going to start turning Venezuelan migrants back into Mexico. They expect that's going to drive down numbers.
