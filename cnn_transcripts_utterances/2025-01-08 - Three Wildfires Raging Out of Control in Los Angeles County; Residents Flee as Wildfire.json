And in these winds, those embers take off and they could land someplace else and start a fire.Also worth noting that L.A. County is in a drought here. This is the driest start to the wet season on record, period. We have not had enough rain. In fact, we barely have had any at all.

So, this shows you that this is a different kind of response.Waiting to come talk to you, I've been standing here, there's been a couple of gusts that blew me off my feet. So, it feels like you're, you know, we're covering a hurricane, something else we both have done. These winds are no joke. And when I tell you that wind hit that fire, the whole sky lit up with all of the orange of that fire and it's burning brighter. This is nothing to play with. This is nothing like we've seen before. You hear so many people saying that. And then you've got to keep in mind up inside those communities, they're tight roads, they're very narrow. It is hard to maneuver and get in and around that.

And just going back to what Natasha experienced and what Stephanie was describing with regards to how quickly these fires spread under these types of conditions, the palm trees that are notorious to Southern California, here's one burning out of control. But look at the incredible amount of wind that's not only shaking this vehicle, embers and quickly spreading them across the road, starting and igniting additional what we call spot fires.This is the moment that the Palisades fire erupted yesterday. And you can see the direction of the wind with the smoke plume just emanating out into the open of the Pacific Ocean. Here's what I'm concerned about as it stands right now, the immediate threat. You're looking at West L.A. County and the Palisades fire. The area that's burned is right here. You can see some of the topography. These are actually buildings, homes, residents, apartments, businesses. This is a canyon right here. And with the video I showed you just a moment ago, you can imagine the winds whipping up and over these canyons and into the valleys below taking the embers, spreading them and starting additional spot fires. You can see one there. There's another one. That is how quickly and how rapidly that this will spread. So, what we've got right now is this northerly component to the wind. If we start to see what's called a backing of the wind to more of a north northwest, that would put more of Western L.A. County at threat, so more residential area, more densely populated areas. There is some relaxing of the winds forecast later this afternoon, but then again with Sta. Ana winds, they will pick up overnight and into tomorrow morning, as we typically see with Sta. Ana wind events, they peak right around the dawn hours. John?",

It's the wind flick -- look at these embers, Chris, look at these embers. Any one of these embers could go and cause a fire somewhere else. Look, we got this, we got another spot fire up here. Just around the corner, an entire apartment building was gone. It's dry vegetation, it's wind. It's a terrible combination.30,000-plus people evacuated. We have no idea yet how many structures have been lost. But we have been up in the hills, million dollar homes we've seen destroyed.
