It really is gripping, so congratulations Karoun and Rachael to you on this -- on this effort here.I also want to mention -- because everyone's familiar I think with this video that we saw last week, right -- this new video. And it shows -- it's mostly Speaker Pelosi but you also see, at the time, then-minority leader Chuck Schumer. And they are working on January 6 -- they're working the phones. You see -- there they are with Mitch McConnell. This is a small snippet where they're with Republican leaders. They're trying to get the military called up. They're trying to get law enforcement called up. And I know that you have some more reporting on what was happening behind the scenes here.",

He crosses the hall, he goes and finds the Democrats, and he's like Trump isn't going to help us. We have to help each other.That's a galvanizing moment where the Republicans spearheaded it, right, which it just kind of goes to show you -- and we go into much more detail about what was going on there with both parties -- about how there was this opportunity on this day where they were all being attacked and they were all the victims of what this mob was doing where they could have had this moment. And that they lost it so quickly afterwards is -- it illustrates that much more of the tragedy of what follows -- to focus on everybody's actions on January 6 and what was going on. And -- sorry -- just to add to -- add -- you know, we looked in that video. Pelosi -- and I mentioned a moment ago how there was this moment on January 6 where her people wanted to impeach Trump. She talks at one moment in that video about I'm going to punch him out. I'm going to punch out the president. She had an opportunity a few hours later to level a constitutional punch that might have knocked him out and she pulled it.",

There were Democrats on the Hill who had privately started drafting an impeachment article that very night, approached Steny Hoyer on the floor, gave it to him, and said let's do this now when everybody's mad. They said no and they lost, potentially, some momentum there.But it's also interesting because those four leaders -- I think that moment that you were just -- we were all just talking about is perhaps the only time in Trump's presidency when all four leaders were united to try to bring Trump to heel. And again, after that, things just fell apart. I mean, we show in the book that Democrats behind the scenes were pressuring Jamie Raskin and his team, who were leading the second impeachment, to drop this sort of secret push they had to try to find GOP witnesses and get people like Mike Pence's aides to testify at the trial to try to change Republican minds in a moment where Trump was the most vulnerable. And not only that but Republicans -- Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy -- we've all seen, obviously, ended up forgetting about that day and -- with McCarthy really hugging Trump within just a few days later.",

Then some critics took issue, calling the movie racist and Islamophobic, and some of those same industry folks turned on the film. Now, in the end, the pilon wasn't necessarily because of the content but the person who made it, specifically, her race, her cultural identity, and her religious affiliation. And now with the documentary in limbo, without distribution, there is a reassessment that's questioning this negative narrative, bringing the film initially known as \"Jihad Rehab,\" now called \"The UnRedacted,\" back into the conversation, if not into theaters yet. It's all upon further review. Now, the debate races some big questions. Who gets to tell another person's story? Do they have to share the same identity? And what's the line between legitimate criticism and trying to cancel a film because it causes some people offense? All right, let's take a step back. \"The UnRedacted\" is the product of interviews over three years with four Yemini men at a reverse radicalization program in Saudi Arabia. All had previously been imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay as accused terrorists but never charged or brought to trial. The director, a former California firefighter named Meg Smaker, set out to understand the individuals who had been so often reduced to stereotypes, tracking their progress, their regrets, and their frustrations. I watched it and found it revealing because it dares to humanize people who, by their own admission, at least briefly fell under the sway of terrorist groups. Here's a clip.
