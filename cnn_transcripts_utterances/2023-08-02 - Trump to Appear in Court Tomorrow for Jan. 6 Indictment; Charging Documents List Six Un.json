Not having to do with hush money payments before he was president, not having to do with classified documents he kept after he was president. This one has to do with his actions while still president and his fight to stay in power after losing the election. All indications are Trump will again plead not guilty.

Obviously, it's more secure for everyone, including himself, and, of course, the security of the court. But it appears that the former president is likely to take the option to come to court.And so what we expect is sometime tomorrow afternoon, he's going to present himself in federal court here in Washington. He's going to be formally arrested. He's going to meet with a federal magistrate who's going to read him the charges, and then we may also have the arraignment all in one hearing as a way to do this more efficiently. Obviously, this is going to be a bit of a mess here in Washington at 4:00 P.M. The former president, he has a golf club in Northern Virginia. So, all of this now is triggering a security meeting among the Secret Service, the Marshalls, all of the federal agencies to try to get him to court. He has a club in Northern Virginia where he could stay overnight. We don't know whether he's going to come to Washington tonight or whether he'll come in the morning.

So, this is a court has repeatedly told the defendants that one of the things they want to do is handle these cases as quickly as possible to basically be a deterrent against anyone doing what happened on January 6th again.

CNN has been able to identify most of them, though. The big question this morning is, though, will these people who allegedly helped Trump face legal repercussions of their own?CNN's Jessica Schneider, she joins us now with more on this. Jessica, what more are you learning about what kind of trouble these unnamed unindicted co-conspirators could be in themselves? JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  You know, yesterday, Kate, special counsel Jack Smith, he made clear this investigation continues. So it is very possible, very likely that at least some of these six co-conspirators, they could face charges or even by naming them in this indictment could really pressure them to maybe investigators. So, the first co-conspirator that CNN has identified is Rudy Giuliani. He is described in this indictment as an attorney who's, quote, willing to spread knowingly false claims and pursue strategies that other attorneys just wouldn't who were involved in the campaign. So, that description alone, it does indicate that charges could be coming. Of course, Giuliani was front and center pushing these election fraud claims. He led that effort to pressure state legislators to overturn the election. Co-conspirator number 2, former Trump lawyer John Eastman. Part of what he did is he circulated a two-page plan for Vice President Pence to overturn the election. Interestingly here, not only is he at the forefront of part of this investigation by the special counsel, but he's already been facing disciplinary proceedings in California, fighting there to keep his law license. So, there could be more legal fights for him to come. Now, moving on to co conspirator 3, that's former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell. She, too, has faced ethics complaints in a few states about her conduct after the election. And she's described in this indictment as circulating claims of election fraud that even Trump acknowledged sounded crazy. Then we have co-conspirator number 4, that's former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. He's accused of pushing these fake election claims to try to get state lawmakers to overturn the results in their state. Interestingly, it was just about a year ago, last summer that FBI agents did search Jeffrey Clark's Virginia home. So, could there be legal trouble coming for him? Very possible. And, finally, we have co conspirator number 5, that's pro Trump lawyer Kenneth Cheseboro. He endorsed the fake electors plot. He has also, like Sidney Powell and John Eastman, faced ethics complaints in other states, maybe could face charges here. But a lot detailed in this indictment, John and Kate, and, obviously, this investigation still continuing. The special counsel made that clear yesterday. And they could potentially face charges.",

They try to save face by saying any rallies or marches are a honeypot operation, but the truth is they just don't want to get arrested, which means that what they want to do is commit crimes.

But was anything done in furtherance of the scheme to overturn the results of the election? And here, there are so many allegations about, for example, the false slate of electors. So, I think the question more is, did the president at the time knowingly allow these false names with falsified documents, fake places where the fake votes were taken? Did he know that that was being done and that those fake names were going to be submitted to Congress? And from -- you know, it flies off the pages that he did know that.

In fact, there are numerous emails and information in this indictment. I look particularly at paragraph 30 dealing with Georgia, where it's talking specifically about communications with counsel, but showing that there's a potential unlawful act in having Donald Trump file a known false verification with respect to the civil lawsuit in Georgia. So, that's going to be a difficult argument.

And you want to avoid a jury notification issue where you know even one juror could think, hey, you shouldn't submit these fake names but he really thought he'd won, so kind of a conscientious objection kind of a process.

And that's one of the reasons we probably don't see the other co-conspirators being indicted that will delay the case too. I am not confident this will go to trial before the election, unfortunately. There are a lot of motions and discovery efforts that the defense can make. This judge has been around now for almost a decade. I've had some cases before her. She's a good judge. I think she's going to be fair and I hope and think Judge Cannon down in Florida will be fair.
