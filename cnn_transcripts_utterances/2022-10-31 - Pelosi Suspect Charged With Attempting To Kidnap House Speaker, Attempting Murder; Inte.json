Those words from a Federal criminal complaint spell out an attempt to take House Speaker Nancy Pelosi captive, interrogate her, and beat her savagely if the answers did not come out right, which the complaint says the suspect, one David DePape considered a certainty. Late today, we saw a separate State charges as well including attempted murder, more on that shortly. But just stop and think about what is already on the table. According to Federal authorities who have now charged him with assault on Paul Pelosi and attempted kidnapping of Nancy Pelosi, this man says he wanted to break the kneecaps of an 82-year-old woman and do it to make a political point. Quoting again from the filing, \"In the course of the interview, DePape articulated he viewed Nancy as the leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic Party.\" The document goes on in graphic detail about what the suspect said he intended, but its bottom line is simple enough. According to the suspect himself, this potentially deadly attack on Paul Pelosi was part of a politically motivated attempt to kidnap and harm the Speaker of the House, the most powerful woman in American politics, second in line to the presidency. Yet as shocking as that is, it should not be surprising, not when you consider the way Pelosi has been openly demonized, often using violent imagery to do it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

First, of course, is that the agent, the affiant, whose words we are reading, is someone who is a specialist in investigating domestic terrorism. So that tells us the Bureau sees this case, this investigation as one that is being managed by the Counterterrorism Division. And then secondly, I would say, John, the facts as alleged by the government in the affidavit fit perfectly the statutory definition of domestic terrorism. So 18 USC 23315, I believe, which basically defines an act of domestic terrorism as a crime at the Federal or State level, it's a violent crime, and one that is committed for any one of a number of different intents, one of which is to influence the conduct of government. Well, the facts that we have read in this affidavit about this individual's intent to shatter Nancy Pelosi's kneecaps, to have that work as a message to the rest of Congress when she is wheeled back into the Capitol.

One is the DA's case, which is a simple case, and very important, that's a felony that occurs in the presence of police officers recorded largely on body camera, where that is a probable cause arrest. Mr. Pelosi is a witness, but they could have made that arrest without him. The Federal case, they'll have to prove those elements about his motive to intimidate government officials in the performance of their duties, but when you articulate allegedly, in your interview with the FBI, the Capitol Police and the San Francisco Police Department that your goal was to have Nancy Pelosi return in a wheelchair with broken kneecaps to Congress, to intimidate not just her, but the entire two bodies of Congress, you're pretty much meeting this statute.

We know he has an infant at home and he brought it to Capitol Police, and they basically said, \"Look, you are among a lot of people who gets threats.\" And ultimately, John, this comes down to a resources issue.

The place is just crawling with Capitol Police. The major concern for law enforcement is once those members go back to the district where they don't have as much protection.

So, here's where we are, John, eight days out of one week really of campaigning left the yellow states for the tossups, the light red are the lean Republicans, the light blue is the lean Democrat. Let's look at these four new polls because they impact how you look at this. Let's just go through them quickly. And then we'll do the steaks.John Fetterman, the Democrat up in Pennsylvania but just up in Pennsylvania, just outside the margin of error. Republicans believe they can close on this race. Democrats want to hold it, very close in a state now held by a Republican. That's Pennsylvania. You move to Georgia, no clear leader here 49-46, the Democrat, the incumbent Raphael Warnock ahead if you want to call it that, but not inside, statistically, that's a tie. And remember, on election night, if nobody gets 50 plus one, we have a runoff in December. So, Georgia, very close race to the end. Now out to Nevada, Catherine Cortez Masto is the most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbent. Republicans think they're going to close and win this race. Barack Obama is heading out there in the final days to help with turnout. But again, you don't need me to tell you that 47-47 as dead heat. And then Arizona is interesting, because if you look at the polling numbers, Democrats feel a little better about this based on the numbers. The incumbent Democrat is Mark Kelly, that six points so it's outside of the margin of error, just barely. But Obama added a stop, John, added a stop in Arizona in the final day. So that tells you Democrats are a little nervous. So, what are we looking at here? Democrats want to pick this one up. They desperately want to pick this one up. The Republican incumbent, why do they want to pick that up? That would get Democrats to 51 if they hold this one, and that one, but what if Democrats lose this? Right? This is the most likely one to flip right now. This is why these four races are likely to determine control of the Senate. If that happens, Democrats are back to 50. But what about Georgia, if Republicans who pick up Georgia this is all hypothetical at home, we're just walking through this in the final days here. This is why Rick Scott thinks they can get to 52 because he thinks Rick Scott who runs the Senatorial Committee for the Republicans. He thinks they're going to close strong and get Pennsylvania, he thinks they're going to get Georgia, and he thinks they're going to get Nevada and get to 52 doesn't mean that's not going to happen. But those four races likely to decide in the end, whether this stance or whether it flips.",

Paula Hancocks in Seoul Thank you very much.In Ukraine today, Russia launched a new round of missile attacks on key infrastructure facilities leaving parts of the capital without electricity or water. Russian President Vladimir Putin claims the strikes were partly in response to Ukraine's attack on a Russian fleet in Crimea. According to a Ukrainian power company, the country's energy system has suffered more attacks since October 10th than in the previous eight months of the war. This comes as Putin says Russia is suspending but not ending its participation in the Black Sea Grain Export deal with Ukraine. The UN brokered agreement was seen as vital to addressing the global food shortage. Joining me now in southeastern Ukraine with the very latest, CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward.

Now the last four Monday's Ukrainians wake up to air raid sirens and the sounds of Russian missiles slamming in to key civilian infrastructure around the country. Today it hit 10 different regions, 18 different installations. It was still actually a remarkable success on the part of the Ukrainians in the sense that they are claiming the Air Force that they manage to intercept 40 of the more than 50 missiles that flew into Ukraine, but still the ones that did manage to achieve their targets have done significant damage.So, you had hundreds of thousands of homes without any power. In Kyiv today, you had 40% of people in Kyiv without any water, you started to have lines forming on the street at makeshift water pumps that were erected. The mayor telling people to go out and try to basically stock up on water in case this happens again. And here in Zaporizhzhia where we are as well. Rolling blackouts, 200,000 people without power, the power has now been restored. But there was a time today when the children's hospital here was running on emergency power. And the real fear, John is that this is not a sustainable situation because while the Ukrainians keep desperately and quickly trying to build back the second these attacks happen, there is a rate of attrition and damage and there is a sort of level of stress that the grid has come under now, which is very difficult to repair, John.",
