But the bottom line is that Kevin McCarthy at the moment does not have the votes to become elected speaker.We do expect the fourth ballot, another ballot vote likely going to happen. Mr. Leader, do you have the votes now? Do you have the votes? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, REPUBLICAN LEADER: I think what you're going to find is the votes are going to improve right here.

Great reporting.But yes, I mean, what he said was that they're making progress. He did talk about, Kevin McCarthy talked about the wrench, not that they needed more wrenches in this.

And whether or not, they're going to be patient with Kevin McCarthy. I spoke to one of them this morning, he said he's still fully committed to voting for Kevin McCarthy.Some of the questions they have, though, are what is he giving away in these closed door negotiations, because they're not all in there, the people who are voting for him. So, a few of his allies, a lot of the hardliners as well. And one of the things that they were concerned was that they had heard he was giving away two seats on the Rules Committee to House Freedom Caucus members. He got to pick the House Freedom Caucus members was the agreement the last time they had heard what was coming out of these rooms, but it speaks to what kind of tours trading is going on behind closed doors. They're not fully aware of what all the concessions are. And so, the question, I think, in the end is, do the ends justify the means. And David Valadao, who I spoke with today, you know, he's been here since when Boehner fell. He's been here for a lot of this. He was saying that he believes Kevin McCarthy still despite these concessions can be an effective speaker, maybe not a powerful one, like someone Pelosi.",

I feel like, I'm really having to resist asking if he's halfway there. But you know, I think the idea here, it seems to be to show a little bit of movement with some of these hardliners.And there's some real questions about what the hardliners have been up to for the last 24 hours and who's been involved in those conversations? If he can't, then I think the question becomes what happens over the weekend to those people who are concerned about the concessions that he's making. Who are fed up with the fact that this process has dragged on for as long as it has, it's made Republicans look the way it has, it's made our government look the way it has to our allies and adversaries around the world. And if that starts to shift under Kevin McCarthy, I think you're going to start to see more questions about whether it has to be him.",

He has the most support. I think you said yesterday, it's around 95 percent of its own members. The question today is they have shown zero respect for him the holdouts. They have shown zero respect for the institution. Do they agree to a pause? Do they agree to a timeout? Do they agree to go home for the weekend?

You only earn the position of speaker of the House if you can get the votes. Mr. McCarthy doesn't have the votes today. He will not have the votes tomorrow, and he will not have the votes next week, next month, next year. And so, one must wonder, Madam Clerk, is this an exercise in vanity for someone who has done the math, taking the counts and is putting this institution through something that absolutely is avoidable?
