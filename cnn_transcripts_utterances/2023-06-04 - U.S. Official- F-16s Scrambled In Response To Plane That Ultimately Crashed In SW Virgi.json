We do start this hour with breaking news, an update now on where things stand with the breaking news we've been telling you about in the last several minutes. F-16 fighter jets scrambled around Washington, D.C. earlier today, shortly before a small plane crashed in Virginia.Here's what it sounded like. Take a look at this video from one person's security camera in the D.C. area. You can see there that little dog that was on that back porch, back deck, was scared pretty badly by the sonic boom. CNN correspondents and analysts are working this story right now. CNN National Security Analyst, Juliette Kayyem is with us. Also CNN's Transportation Analyst, Mary Schiavo. Let's start with CNN's Natasha Bertrand. Natasha, if you can update our viewers on where things stand with this situation. It caught a lot of people by surprise here in the Washington, D.C. area a few hours ago.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so let's just walk folks through the series of events because a lot of things appeared to happen at roughly the same time. So around 3And then, the FAA released a statement saying that a small aircraft had actually crashed in Southwest Virginia. It was unclear whether those two things were connected, but the Pentagon then -- but then we learned, according to U.S. officials, that U.S. F-16 fighter jets were actually scrambled to essentially chase that small aircraft that had crashed in Southwest Virginia for reasons that are unclear at this point. It is not known whether that aircraft actually violated D.C. airspace, or whether it was just too close or whether the pilot was unresponsive, and that caused U.S. officials to become extremely concerned. But that sonic boom that was heard across the district earlier this afternoon, it was the result of those F-16 fighter jets being scrambled. They were flying so fast that it actually broke the sound barrier. So, we actually have even more video of that sonic boom, just to really give a sense for just how loud it was. Take a listen. Now the FAA did release a statement on the aircraft that did crash. We should note that the jets did not actually shoot it down. It -- we are told that that the jets really did not have anything to do with why it crashed. However, the FAA statement said that it crashed into a mountainous terrain and sparsely populated area of Southwest Virginia around 3:00 p.m. The aircraft took off from Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Tennessee and was bound to Long Island MacArthur Airport in New York. Now the flight path itself is also still unclear. As I said, it is not known at this point whether it actually pierced D.C. airspace, or whether it was just around the airspace, and that made U.S. officials concerned. So we are expecting more information to come from the Pentagon and U.S. officials in the coming hours, Jim.",

And then from New York, it was supposed to go to Florida, I believe, Malvern, Florida. And so that's the flight plan filed by looking at flight tracker and online data.

To me, this is -- the only question that remains is, is the unresponsiveness due to nefarious activity, which I think is less likely, you know, or something horrible went wrong in that airplane. And the fighter jets scramble because you do not need, you do not want to wait until aerospace is violated, especially if there are the pieces of evidence that suggests that the plane is unresponsive.Remember from the viewpoint of the Air Force and the military and D.C., you don't know why the plane is unresponsive at that moment. All you know is it's somewhat getting closer to D.C. and that's why they scrambled. By the time everything occurs, the plane is already down, which also leads more credence to the belief that something went wrong in the Cessna. I should say this is not a small Cessna, just looking online at its identification. It's a business class Cessna, so we don't know if it was just a pilot or if there were others in the plane, we'll get a passenger list as well. So that's where my focus is right now. The F-16 scramble from the Air Force is absolutely appropriate, and scary. There's no question about that for people in D.C., but has an explanation and we shouldn't always go to the nefarious one. It's just part of what the apparatus looks like now. You just simply don't know from the ground what's happening up above, and that's why they scramble.",

The air speed varied little but not much. So it looks like it was headed for New York. It was supposed to land there, go to Florida. And then turned and at that point became unresponsive.And over the years, we have covered many of these where something happens to the pilot, usually it's a rapid decompression in the plane, scrambling the aircraft, usually happens when the pilot's not responsive. But in most -- in all cases, they have never had to shoot them down. So it does look like -- it doesn't look like a hijacked situation based only on the flight track. Obviously, we don't have any information that they squawked a hijack code or they squawked any other kind of code. It looks like an unresponsive pilot like others we've reported on in the past, but they had to scramble because of the flight track. Takes it pretty close to Washington, D.C. and that's what they're supposed to do. Go out and find out what's going on.",

But it is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley who's been in this race longer than anyone except Donald Trump. She's been campaigning frequently across this state. She had this to say about her commitment to Iowa voters and the campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have been to Iowa. I think we've done over 25 events. I'm going to keep coming. I'm not doing shortcuts. I'm not going to do a rally and leave you. I'm going to answer every question. I'm going to shake every hand.

That is a, of course, an implicit message to the former president who often holds rallies, but he's been campaigning here as well in smaller settings.So the reason all this matters, of course, Iowa is the state that launches the Republican presidential contest early next year, and it's where the candidates will likely find an alternative to Donald Trump. Of course, he's leading this race, but he certainly is not the presumptive nominee. So many Republican voters we talked to here have open minds. So that's what this campaign, as it ever grows, as the field gets larger and larger is all about.

In this latest incident, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command says one of its vessels with a Canadian vessel was carrying out a joint exercise sailing through the Taiwan Strait in a message, not only to China, but also to the rest of the world, that this is an international waterway.Commercial shipping can use it as can other militaries, including of course the U.S. But Chinese military ship cut 150 yards in front of the U.S. vessel, then circled back and came around passing again 2,000 yards. Very short distances in terms of naval vessels of this size. The U.S. calls it an unsafe maneuver carried out with the Chinese. But as is so often the case in these instances, we see China with a completely different narrative about what happened. China's Minister of National Defense said they were not there for innocent reasons. They were there to be provocative. So it was there you see the difficulty in simply communicating here with these -- essentially these encounters between the U.S. and Chinese military. We saw another one of these, just a couple weeks ago, when a Chinese jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft over the South China Sea. The U.S. was in international airspace, China essentially trying to exert its sovereignty, its claims to those two sensitive areas, the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. And those areas have led to a tremendous amount of tension between Beijing and Washington. Jim, the question, where do you go from here? How do you get off of this escalation intentions?",

In a blog post, the YouTube says, \"We find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence.\" And joining us to discuss what that could mean is Roger McNamee, the co-founder of Elevation Partners and author of \"Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe\". Roger, Donald Trump and his supporters are still peddling this lie that the election was stolen in 2020. Obviously, fact checking it a million times doesn't stop them from doing it. They're just going to keep doing it. Isn't YouTube just giving them a free pass to keep on doing this right into the next election? ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Jim, what YouTube is doing is obviously irresponsible, but it's also totally predictable. YouTube has a long history of prioritizing user engagement, which is really the key to profits over the public interest. They're not a social network the way Facebook is, but they've done almost as much harm. They use a recommendation engine to maximize engagement to 3 billion users. And in the process, they've amplified content from terrorists, conspiracy theorists, and scammers to maximize profits. So it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that in this particular context, they would do the same thing again. They're desperate for earnings and they are not concerned about the consequences.",
