From the mid-1980s through the 1990s, tabloid talk shows were a dominant TV genre. But even in the crowded pantheon of outrageous programs, \"The Jerry Springer Show\" stood out. The former mayor of Cincinnati laughingly embraced the shade that people threw on his show. Here is how he described it to Larry King back in 1998.

And it also happened to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the United States and South Korea, which was forged in the aftermath of the Korean War. And President Yoon talked about the war, paid tribute to the men and women who sacrificed their lives in the name of democracy and freedom.

This image captured on Sunday at around 11:00 in the morning. You can see in the image he is wearing a dark shirt and jeans and a baseball cap. Now, authorities believe that Raynes stole a public works truck from an area in Mississippi after his escape from the detention center with the three other escapees. He drove that truck about 400 miles west to Texas. That truck was later found abandoned in Spring Valley. You mentioned there are two other escapees being searched for as well. That search being focused in central Mississippi, 24-yeaer-old Casey Gracin and 22-year-old Corey Harrison. Those are the people that the police are searching for. Police believe these two men may have stolen a red Chevy Silverado after their escape. That truck was last seen on Monday morning, heading into neighboring Rankin County. The fourth escapee you mentioned, Jim, Dylan Arrington, yes, he has been confirmed dead. His remains were recovered inside a home in Leake County. That is where Arrington had a shootout with police. A sheriff said something interesting, that in all of his years in law enforcement, he's never seen anything like this, where a gunman, the shooting at officers from inside a home while a fire is raging there.
