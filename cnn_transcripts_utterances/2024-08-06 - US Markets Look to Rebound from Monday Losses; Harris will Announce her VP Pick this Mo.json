      "sentences": "This morning Debby also wreaking havoc on millions of American up and down the east coast with really heavy rains, dangerous flooding and tornadoes. We are tracking that storm for you.And one day after devastating market losses, things are back in the green. U.S. futures looking up as we wait for the opening bell on Wall Street. Kate is out today. I'm Sara Sidner with John Berman. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We're getting closer and closer, standing he by for Vice President Harris's hugely important V.P. announcement that we expect to happen via an online message first, which means refresh buttons are likely getting more action should a \"Terminator\" movie right now. Moments ago, we learned she did not have a decision last night. She said she needed to sleep on it. Will it be Minnesota Governor Tim Walz or Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Sources overnight said the race is down to those two. We have cameras outside each governor's home watching every move, although it has been very quiet this morning. But first, CNN's M.J. Lee and Philadelphia for all of the breaking news details. M.J., right now, Kamala Harris could be calling one of these two men with some very good news for them. What more can you share about how this decision is happening? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Sara, it is still anybody's guess exactly when Kamala Harris is going to make that phone call and who she is going to call to share that life-changing news with. But we did learn this morning that, as you mentioned, the vice president had not made a decision as of last night when she was going to bed, and that she essentially decided that she needed that extra final night to sleep on the decision, meaning that this decision is going to get made this morning. That means that phone call will likely come this morning. She is going to be informing her team this morning as well. And presumably the finalists that didn't end up getting the job, they're going to be finding out about that decision sometime today as well. But the preparations, of course, for this eventual announcement, not to mention that Philadelphia rally that is going to take place this evening here with Harris and her eventual running mate, those have had to proceed it even as the campaign is waiting on her final word. We are told that the campaign has actually printed out multiple versions of campaign signs featuring Harris's name next to the names of multiple contenders that she has been deliberating over. And while I haven't actually confirmed yet which names for these signs were printed out, we do know that there are three names that we have been talking about a lot the last 48 hours or so, and those are, of course, Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz, and Mark Kelly. And we did report that in the final hours, the vice president did seem particularly focused on those first two names, Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz. And all three of them, we should mention, did have in-person interviews with the vice president over the weekend in Washington, D.C. But Sara, I think one thing that we should just take a beat to talk about is how much of a condensed timeline all of this has really unfolded under given the events of the last 16 days or so. And it is just in a matter of days that the vice president has had to deliberate over some really important questions as she has tried to make this decision. Questions like, who could actually help her win, who could be a good governing partner for her? Who does she have a good and strong personal chemistry with? To that end, the vice president has been presented by her vetting team with a ton of information to sift through on their personal lives, polling numbers, and a lot of other research about the final contenders so that she could try to make an informed decision. And as far as the announcement that we are on standby for, we do know that the Harris campaign is trying to model all of this after what we saw Joe Biden do some four years ago when he decided that he was going to go with Kamala Harris, they made an online announcement on social media to all of the supporters. But one thing is for sure, they are very much trying to keep this under wraps, to as close to game time as possible. That again, is that Philadelphia rally tonight when we will see the two of them together for the first time. Sara?",

      "sentences": "We did just see some cars going in and out and St. Paul, at Governor Walz's home. But honestly, they could have been Grub Hub for all we know, delivering French toast. We just don't know at this stage.What we do know is CNN chief national correspondent John King is here with us at the magic wall. Great to see you this morning. Look, we're talking about Tim Walz of Minnesota, Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania. Both blue states last time, but these states aren't exactly alike. [08:05:02] JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  They're not exactly alike. Pennsylvania is bigger, Pennsylvania is more complicated. Minnesota has been one of those states that Republicans keeps saying we're going to get Minnesota, just like Democrats say we're going to get North Carolina, or George W Bush would say I'm going to get Pennsylvania. But this is what this whole decision is about, if you think about it. This is the 2020 map, right. This is Biden-Trump. Now of course, Biden is out of the race, and Harris is saying let's not let this happen again. Let's not let Donald Trump win the blue wall, because if Donald Trump wins the blue wall, than the Democratic path to 270 electoral votes gets so much harder. So that's why a lot of Democratic strategists say, go back to 2020, pick Shapiro because you need Pennsylvania, right? Thats part of the Democratic math, you have to have Pennsylvania. But other Democrats say Minnesota, lot of Trump voters in Minnesota. Minnesota was very close if you look at 2020, you come in here, 52-45 here. If he come back here, it's even more because of the third-party candidates in 2016. Again, these small rural areas. And Tim Walz does pretty well, but Josh Shapiro did well in more Republican areas, too. So is it a generational pick, is it a comfort pick? That's the debate we're having. Is it a white picket fence or the nice landscaping outside of Governor Shapiro's home there? The fascinating thing to me about this, John, is number one, the truncated calendar. So the vice president, Vice President Harris, now the Democratic nominee, is taking to the last possible second to make this decision. And then there's no data. There's no data anywhere that says this actually impacts votes come November, but it is her first big executive decisions, so it will get a big buzz.",

You can see our Whitney Wild and other people trying to look over the fence in St. Paul, Minnesota, right now because there was some action, a little bit of action at the home of Governor Tim Walz. Look, we're showing you this just to give you a sense, in a way, of how little is known and how much we're looking for any sign. One thing that would need to happen.

They'd bring a policy book just so you could read it on the plane to Philadelphia for the event.And yes, at the last minute, you bring the Secret Service in. Again, both of these governors have state police protection, so it's not hard to do. But it is -- it's a complicated process. It's been done many, many times, but you've got to pull it off.",

And so this is ad spending since President Biden stepped out and Harris became first the presumptive, now she is the Democratic nominee. The campaigns are saying, the campaigns are telling us what the strategist are saying. Pennsylvania, you have to get Pennsylvania, you have to get Pennsylvania. Look at the ad spending, overwhelming in Pennsylvania compared to these other battleground states. Not that these are not important, but the campaign seems to be affirming what the strategists are saying.So that you say, oh, if Shapiro, you're right, if he can help me with a half-a-point, if he can help me with 10,000 votes or 20,000 votes, that's the guy I want. One or the other questions is even though all of these candidates have essentially to save position on Israel and Hamas, there has been a conversation. The left has gone after Shapiro saying because he would crack down on the protesters. He had tougher language maybe about the protests. Do you want that candidate, do you want to stir it up? When she is starting to unify the party, do you want to stir that up again? A lot of Democrats, we didn't have a primary process for Harris, but you're having it now.",

That's one of the things that we're watching.So, what we've seen this morning, John, when we first got here, there were four or five law enforcement vehicles inside the parking lot at the residence here. But what we've seen in the last 20 minutes is six more vehicles that appear to be law enforcement and vehicles pulling into this parking lot that is much more activity than we've seen as of late. And what it appears that they're doing, John, is they're positioning one of the vehicles in such a way that they often do when the governor is preparing for a movement. And what we know, John is that there's nothing on the schedule yet. There's no public event that he's going to. No plans that we know of, that would mean that there's a movement that was already on the schedule. So, if there is a movement and it will really be something that we were not planning to see, it is something that was not necessarily on the schedule.
