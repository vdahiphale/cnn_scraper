Election Day, as I said, is just one month away. Israel could strike Iran at any moment. That could be a seismic event and at a sensitive time in the us presidential race. And in this moment, Vice President Harris, she's stepping up outreach to Arab American and Muslim voters. Last night, she met with community leaders in Michigan as she's trying to shore up support with Palestinian Americans reeling from the war in Gaza. And now Lebanese Americans are distressed by the bombardment of Beirut. Both groups are concerned about U.S. support of Israel's government, and both groups make up a critical demographic, specifically in the battleground state of Michigan. Wa'el Alzayat is one of the community leaders who met with Vice President Harris. He's the CEO of Emgage Action. It's an organization aimed at boosting the Muslim American vote. And they have endorsed the Harris Walz campaign. Thank you so much for meeting with me this morning. Let's talk about your meeting with Vice President Harris. It was slated the last ten minutes, went for 20. Explain what was the ask and did you get any commitments? WA'EL ALZAYAT, CEO, EMGAGE ACTION CEO; MET WITH VP HARRIS: Thank you so much for having me on. Obviously, these presidential elections are especially difficult moment for Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Lebanese Americans, Palestinian Americans, Israeli Americans, and they asked us to bring this war to an end. Many experts, including many community members, have warned the Biden administration that the longer this war continues in Gaza, the more likely it's going to escalate and become a regional war that could potentially drag the United States into another middle eastern war. And we are on the brink of that. And so our first and most important ask was for the vice president in her current capacity, or should this war continue and she would win and become commander in chief, is to bring this forward to an end. That was the most important ask. The second ask was to bring immediate alleviation to both the Palestinian and Lebanese people. There are over 80,000 American citizens who are stuck in Lebanon right now and need urgent support as well as perhaps evacuation.",

She skipped the address of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and essentially rebuked him and his policies following her meeting with him.So there's a lot that she can do and say, particularly regarding the need for the United States, perhaps a future Harris-Walz administration's bringing into compliance U.S. military assistance to any country, including Israel, to U.S. domestic and international humanitarian law, and really invigorating the political track to bring this war to an end through diplomatic means.",

But to your point, the membership is what does everything. The membership is made up of professional music people. So in order to be a member of the academy, you have to be working in the industry, you have to have credits, and you have to be relevant. We've re-qualified all of our membership over the last five years. So 100% of our members are now relevant contemporary music makers. So to your point, the outcomes, the nominations, the wins, are all dictated by the membership and the votes. So there's two rounds. It's a nomination round. All the nominations go back to the voting body. The 13,000 voters vote again for the second time, and the winners are announced. It's a straightforward process.

Actually, in 2024, 2023, we shared more Hip Hop on our show ever in the history of the Academy. We did a 13 minutes segment exclusively about Hip Hop and the importance of Hip Hop. The following year, we did a special about Hip Hop that was two hours on network television, the history of Hip Hop, and the 50th anniversary of Hip Hop. So things have absolutely changed.We have a lot of genres, a lot of people that we represent, and we try and balance that throughout all the work that we're doing. And it's also not just our award show. You have to think, Victor, that the show generates revenue for everything we do. So we have to put on the right show for the right audience and make sure we attract viewers and eyeballs and continue to generate revenue for the academy so we can do all the programs, the education, the philanthropy, the music service, the legislation. These things are all paid for by our show. So we have to do a balanced show and we also have to represent a lot of genres and a lot of awards.",

And I like to believe that our members, because they are professionals. There are people like me that are in studios, there are songwriters or music makers. They care about the music. They care about the art. So our hope and my wishes that they evaluate the music based on the quality of it. And that's really the goal, subjective. This is all very difficult.

Now Edie's pie. Also in 2020, we got the thick billed long spur. It's a bird once known as McCown's long spur. It got its name from a man named John McCown. He was an amateur bird collector who was also a confederate general.There are six other North American bird species the American Ornithological Society plans to change for similar reasons. And this apparently set off a big debate among birders ahead of their annual meeting, which kicked off in Colorado this week. Birdwatcher Christian Cooper was there. You'll remember his story. We showed a bit of the video just a moment ago. On the same day George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, a white woman called police on Christian after he called her out over her unleashed dog in Central Park. And that incident was part of the Black Lives Matter conversation that year. And Christian Cooper, now the host of National Geographic's Extraordinary Birder with Christian Cooper and the author of the memoir Better living through Birding. He is with us now. All right. So I expect that there are people who are saying now they want to change the name of birds. Confederate monuments, okay, Aunt Jemima off the pancake box, fine. But birds, come on to, that you say what? CHRISTIAN COOPER, HOST, \"EXTRAORDINARY BIRDER\": Well, the first thing you have to understand is that bird names change fairly regularly. So what has some people upset is that why these names are changing. And the reason is because a lot of these people have some pretty awful histories. And so we can either keep living with those awful legacy histories or we can do something to change them and at the same time be giving these birds names that are actually useful to people, like if you say to somebody, oh, I want to see a Wilsons Warbler, nobody knows what you're talking about. But if you say to somebody who doesn't know birds, oh, I want to see a black capped warbler, you would at least know you're looking for a warbler with a black cap. So we're getting more useful names on the one hand and getting rid of these legacy names that have often a lot of bad connotations.",

And in the process, a third of them died so it's really a case of genocide.
