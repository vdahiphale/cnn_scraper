Some members of his own party are starting to question his handling of a major pressing issue, the standoff over raising the debt limit. Some Democrats are anxious over Biden's refusal to negotiate with Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): I think - I think Joe Biden should be talking to Kevin McCarthy, even if those conversations right now prove nothing productive. My fear is that this gets pushed all the way to the last moment. And then if we're at the last moment and things fall apart, we go off -- we go off the cliff. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-WV): We're here to talk, communicate and negotiate. So, at least do it. At least they put something on the table. They said, put one on the table. They put something on the table.

The White House has, for months, insisted it's not going to negotiate, right? They only want to clean debt ceiling bill, instead calling on McCarthy to raise the debt ceiling with no conditions.That is not good enough for Joe Manchin, who said of Biden's strategy right now, quote, this signals a deficiency of leadership, and it must change. It's quite a quote from a fellow Democrat. Joining us now is another Democrat, Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. I should note, she just announced her plans to run for re- election in 2024.

And we must pass the Women's Health Protection Act and we have to build towards that time so that we are not either in a situation like we are in Wisconsin where our state has the oldest criminal abortion ban in the country. It was passed in 1849. And you didn't hear me wrong, 1849, a year after statehood. That is the law of the land in Wisconsin right now.

And that is $19.5 billion, because part of the reason that they're perhaps leaving Oakland was that they couldn't really get the financing for the stadium, right? I think sort of the last straw was federal subsidies that didn't come through. But public financing of MLB and NFL stadiums, $19.5 billion since 1990. It's very possible that Las Vegas will, in fact, put some money in. And this is something that has certainly been climbing. So, this is the inflation adjusted public money for the median new MLB or NFL stadium. Look at this, in the 2020s, look how much, $750 million for the median stadium. That's up from 2010, up from 2000, and well up from 1990 when it was $281 million. And I think the question is, do these new stadiums actually generate an economic boom for the cities? Most studies say, uh-uh, no way. But, hey, they do help team owners make a lot of money.",
