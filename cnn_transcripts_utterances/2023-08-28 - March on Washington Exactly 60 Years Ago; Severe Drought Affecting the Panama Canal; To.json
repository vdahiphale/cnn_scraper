If you said Panama, put your hands up. The Panama canal saves about 8,000 nautical miles. When ships travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to the east and west coast of the U.S. Panama, a country in central America is having one of their driest seasons on record and vessels. Traveling through the Panama canal are in a bit of a conundrum. The Panama canal is a 50-mile waterway that was completed in 1914 to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and to decrease travel times for ships. It`s very important for maritime trade and allows ships to avoid traveling all the way around south America. But now use of the canal is in jeopardy because of lower water levels. That`s being caused by a lack of rainfall this year, which is impacting the fresh water lakes nearby upon which the canal relies. The system uses at least 50 million gallons of water for each vessel that floats through. In response canal, authorities have imposed restrictions on things like daily traffic and how much each vessel can weigh. Just this week, they extended the restrictions for another 10 months while the direct impact to U.S., consumers, retailers and manufacturers seems to be minimal right now. The potential for more disruptions are growing. We`ll continue to follow this story for you right here on CNN 10. This summer beach goers have found hundreds of sea lion and dolphins washed up across the shores of Southern California. Some of the animals sick, some dying. And Marine life experts believe a harmful algae bloom is to blame. The algae is called pseudo-nitzschia and it produces a neurotoxin which can be poisonous to sea birds and fish, and can then travel all the way up to food chain, making larger animals like dolphins, sea lions, and even humans sick. CNN Correspondent, Stephanie Elam visited a marine animal care center to learn how they`ve been rescuing and caring for a sea lion with the goal of getting them back to the ocean. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A joyous moment months in the making, as two six sea lion now fully recovered, burst onto a Southern California beach slide into the sea and swim off to freedom. The journey back into open water for these two was long and uncertain, which made preparing for the release all the more rewarding.",
