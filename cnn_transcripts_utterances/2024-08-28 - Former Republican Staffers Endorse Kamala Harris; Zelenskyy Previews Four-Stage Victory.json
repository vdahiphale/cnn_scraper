The company says some customers are having trouble connecting, but it's not a nationwide issue. However, the outage did impact the 911 emergency services in some states. And a late summer heat wave is affecting the U.S. Midwest with millions of people under heat alerts today. Temperatures are expected to reach triple digits, prompting some schools to close early.

Then you lose by 5 million votes. I said, 5 million votes. I guarantee if Jesus came down and was the vote counter, I would win California, OK? In politics, you have an opponent, and you win or you lose. But you don't have an opponent, and then you're doing well against the opponent, they take them out, they give you a new opponent, they give you a nice fresh opponent. And so I have to win that. And if I win that, that would really serve to say that there's some incredible power up there that wanted me to be involved in saving, and maybe it's more than saving the nation, maybe it's saving the world.
