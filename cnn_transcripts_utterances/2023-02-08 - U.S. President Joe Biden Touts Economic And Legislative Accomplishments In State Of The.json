MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  White House officials are feeling pretty good about last night. Not just because of the rally moments that they appreciated. They felt like the president was able to lay out some of his major accomplishments from the last two years and painted a picture of an optimistic future and started to lay out why the country would be in better shape if he was leading it. He said multiple times last night that it is time to finish the job that he has started. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Hispanic and Latino rate, both those rates you can see are down sharply since Biden took office. More than 12 million jobs, compare that with Trump's 4.5 million and job losses in the first few years of Presidents Obama and Bush. Biden's record is distorted by the historic recovery of jobs lost during the pandemic. It is a reminder, presidents get too much credit and blame for what happens on the economy on their watch. President Biden took credit for the deficit which has fallen by $1.7 trillion. The deficit skyrocketed under Trump on massive pandemic relief spending and that is winding down. Biden also claimed one quarter of the national debt was added by Trump because of his major tax cuts. Just under $8 trillion was amassed under Trump. Just like the massive deficit spending under Obama, pandemic relief bloated the debt and all of that spending is authorized by Congress.
