Now, the Israeli military said the hostages were brutally murdered by Hamas. And this all comes nearly 11 months since Hamas first attacked Israel, capturing 250 hostages and killing more than 1,200 Israelis. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the authorities there. Now, CNN's Nic Robertson is following the breaking news from Jerusalem, where there are still 100 hostages still unaccounted for, 35 believed to be dead. So, Nic, tell us what you're learning.",

They were identified, their families informed.And the nation here told this told about it this morning. It really is a country grieving, but it's a country divided. The family members of the hostage families are blaming the prime minister, by and large. Leader of the opposition, Benny Gantz has called on the prime minister to actually call up some of the hostage families, some of these six, and just listen to them. We've heard from the prime minister's office now saying that he has actually called one of those families and said that he regrets that he was not able to bring him home alive. But there is a real groundswell here that the -- that the finding of these six young hostages was -- it really shows the deep division in the country about how the prime minister is handling this. Many leaders of opposition parties are calling for people to come out and protest on the streets. One of the communities here in Israel, the mayor there, said that his that his community is going on strike. Community workers, they're going on strike as from Monday. And, of course, the Hostage Families Forum calling for people to come out and protest about the way that the prime minister, in their view, has sacrificed the lives of these six hostages for his style and his negotiation and refusal. It appears to compromise over elements of their ceasefire and hostage release, negotiation with Hamas.

Even though the public has clearly stated that they're on the opposite side of this issue. So I guess that the problem is shown most clearly through Donald Trump, because he hasn't been able to find a message on this. I remember talking to Republicans last year who, frankly, were just wishing that the issue would go away by the next election.

ASTEAD HERNDON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": I think that they view the interview, they view the story they told at the DNC as kind of tacit responses to that. As an introduction of someone who is basically at the midpoint of where the Democratic Party is. In the same way that kind of Biden, I think by the end of his kind of term, found himself at the middle of where the party is. I think the difference between Harris and Biden are even Harris and kind of folks she was running up against in 2019, is that they had a brand to the public. They had a story that they already knew about Joe Biden. The country kind of understood him to be a moderate dealmaker looking for things to get done in Washington. There's not a clear story that I think has been told consistently over a period of time about her. And I think that's where that 15 percent is coming from because for as much as she can say that her values have not changed, the expression of those values is policy. The expression of those values is how you talk about yourself. And we have not seen the kind of consistent story between presidential campaigns and now. And I think that we can't just gloss over that initial introduction to the public. That's how a lot of people came to really understand her and the vice- presidential role is one that is inherently in the background. And so in this moment right now, I think the campaign is torn between two positions, frankly putting meat on the bones to answer folks' questions, to define herself, to give a kind of story to latch onto, and the fact that a lot of this unity is because she's a kind of generic, vague vessel. A lot of this unity is being driven because a lot of people can come to her and kind of project different things. And so there's a tension between those two things right now, because one thing is serving them electorally, even though it's a challenge with some of the lack of --",

Harris, of course, is leading Trump over women by a significant margin.But what about men? And the question about how Trump is doing versus Harris? He's got -- he's got about a 20-point lead himself with men. And this has been a real clear strategy by the Trump campaign. He's been having -- doing podcast interviews, different interviews targeting that segment of male voters, young male voters. This is how \"The New York Times\" reports it in a story out this weekend. \"The Trump campaign has been aggressively courting what might be called the bro vote, the frat boy flank. It's a slice of 18 to 29- year-olds that has been long regarded as unreliable and unreachable. But that Republicans believe may just swing the election this year.\" The Harris campaign needs to do a better job of trying to court those voters who potentially could swing an election. MIKE ALLEN, CO-FOUNDER, AXIOS: One thing they're doing this week to reach out to all of voters. She teased last week that she was going to have a small business tax cut. This week -- they're going to talk about this week. And in my conversations with this campaign, they see this as a very important moment in reaching all voters that small businesses, the front door to the economy for a lot of people -- dry cleaner, a HVAC guy, like the pest control guy, gas company. And getting to Astead's point, you -- it's going to be harder to call her a lefty liberal if she's out there talking about a tax cut for small business. So in this boys versus girls election as we've called it, this is place she's hoping to reach some boys.",

We went to a focus group in North Carolina and it was all men in between ages of 18 and 50, and they were all talking about just how bad the economy is and how -- how much the economy has soured them on Biden. So it's not just a Harris problem. Now, I think Harris has a unique challenge which that it is a lot of times difficult for female candidates to reach male voters, particularly a black woman. That may be an issue for them. So that's of course, where Tim Walz is going to come in, her running mate trying to reach those folks in the Rust Belt, trying to potentially reach out to those frat boys. But it's also going to be where they're positioning the vice president. Are they putting her in front of the people who may not be the most direct person to support her, but still they're an important part of the electorate.",

Dan Abrams, who -- with whom he had co-authored several books brought the story to him. So that was sort of the genesis -- genesis of this. But the key is, and you just did a great job setting it up. That this 1872 gubernatorial election, the chaos around it, the violence around it was so consequential beyond Louisiana because it was during this, excuse me, it was after the civil war and during reconstruction. And Manu, at the time of course black men, freed men were finally able to vote. And so the story around it was those who -- forces who wanted to help the African-Americans vote and those mostly Democrats in the South at the time, who did not.
