Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, today, after 15 years in power, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, has resigned from her post and fled the country. The announcement from the country's army chief coming after these extraordinary scenes of people storming the prime minister's residence. It's an incredible development and the culmination of deadly protests that have rocked the nation for weeks. At least 91 people dying just yesterday after demonstrators clashed with police. Now, this all started over new quotas for government jobs, but quickly evolved into a much wider antigovernment protest. Someone who's been closely following the situation is Mujib Mashal, the New York Times South Asia Bureau Chief, and he joins us now from New Delhi. Mujib, quite a historic day for a country, we should remind viewers the size of Illinois, but with a population of 170 million. Talk about the significance of this development.",

Prime Minister Hasina, in her early part of her career, she was sort of associated with hope. She came from personal trauma because her family was massacred in the '70s, but then she was a symbol of how this country could turn things around. She offered economic upliftment to a lot of -- you know, a country that was deeply poor and she sort of tried to rein in the military that was long in the practice of, you know, coups and counter coups. So, at one point in her career, she offered this promise of hope. But in recent years she was deeply authoritarian. So, the end of her rule has created, you know, this jubilation on the streets of Dhaka. But at the same time, there are deep concerns because the country -- as you mentioned, a huge country of 170 million people is leaderless right now. The law enforcement that could contain what is deeply entrenched political animosities between parties, that law enforcement is very discredited. So, on the streets, there are still reports of violence, but there's also fear that extremist elements could take advantage of this vacuum. So, right now, it's a mix of jubilation, but also of deep concern.",

And here you have her fleeing after being accused of corruption, authoritarianism, tactics. She spoke with Christiane back in 2013 after what was a tragic building collapse.

We were facing a response from Iran, which Israel did get by an unprecedented 300 projectiles, missiles and drones lobbed towards Israel, successfully shot down by Israel with the help of the United States and other regional partners.

And Netanyahu consistently rejected it based probably on his policy that Hamas is an asset for unexplainable reasons, and the Palestinian Authority is liability rather than the other way around. So, he could be killed by Israelis half a year ago, or three and a half years ago, quite easily. And he probably could have been killed by Israel half a year or a year from now.

That -- it appears to be the takeaway from the frustrating conversation, as it was described, a tough talk between President Biden and the Prime Minister Netanyahu last week, especially following the Haniyeh assassination, the United States, obviously reiterating that it will defend Israel in the face of an Iranian attack. But President Biden said this, that he raised his voice and that he wants a deal reached within a week to two weeks. That's reporting from Barak Ravid. And then, now, you know, there is clear daylight between the prime minister and his own defense establishment. Just for example, over the weekend, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a readout with his call with Defense Minister Gallant, Gallant himself reiterated this. He said he emphasized his commitment to ensuring the return of hostages held by Hamas and Gaza and highlighted the critical timing as it relates to achieving an agreement. Channel 12 in Israel published on Friday a really dramatic discussion that occurred last week between Netanyahu, Ronen Bar, the Shin Bet chief, the head of the Mossad as well. And here's what Ronen Bar said. He said, it feels that the prime minister does not want the outline that is on the table if this is indeed the meaning, tell us. Finally, Mossad chief Barnea saying this is -- there is a deal. If we hesitate, we may miss the opportunity. We have to take it. I'm saying all of this to you because it does appear to be unprecedented, this nature where you're seeing a real division publicly between the defense apparatus in this government and the prime minister himself, specifically on the issue related to the hostages.

Basically, all our defense establishment, fully agree with President Biden administration about what should been done -- what should have been done, all along the way in the last 10 months, what should have been done in regard to the hostages. What Israeli really needs is the hostage deal right now. If I would've known that the Iranian Hezbollah kind of attack will be executed only two weeks or three weeks from now, I would recommend to activate the deal right now. If it's possible. Israel has a win-win situation in regard to this deal. Israel has to agree. Even if the other side does not agree, at least we will know who is responsible for the deterioration towards regional war, but what we really need is a deal on the hostages.

But they do have common enemies, and their enemies are anybody who uses the language of rights, of transparency, of the rule of law. You know, those are their enemies. And of course, that means their most important enemy is us, meaning all of us who live in the democratic world who use that language, but it also means their own opposition. So, whether it's the Venezuelan democratic opposition, or whether it was the Navalny movement in Russia, they see them as opponents. And so, that's why you see, you know, in the last few days, stories of Putin sending mercenaries to Venezuela to help defend Maduro. Maduro has just run an election. He lost very badly. It was actually a landslide for his opponent. The opposition was well prepared and they proved they have the documents to show that it was a landslide. He's not accepting the electoral result. And for Putin, the idea that -- and dictator like Maduro, who seeks to rule with absolute power, like he does, with no opposition and no media and no - - and a tame judiciary, the idea that he would lose to an election is damaging to Putin. And so, Putin sees it is in his interest, maybe it's in his financial interest as well, to try to help keep Maduro in power. And particularly if we get to a moment when the Venezuelan army is no longer reliable, which apparently some parts of it aren't, you could see Maduro relying on the troops or the mercenaries or the weapons of other countries. And that is how these regimes now work together. They actively try to keep one another in power.
