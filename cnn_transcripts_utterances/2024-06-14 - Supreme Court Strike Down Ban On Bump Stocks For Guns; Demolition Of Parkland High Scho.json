Today, the Supreme Court lifted a federal ban on Trump-era bump stocks, making it legal again to buy the gun accessories that let semi-automatic rifles fire hundreds of bullets per minute.Bump stocks were used by a gunman who opened fire at a Las Vegas music festival back in 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. He sprayed the crowd with more than a thousand bullets from a hotel room window, killing 60 people and injuring hundreds more. CNN's Joan Biskupic is with us now on this story.

Josh, I know you've covered so many of these legal cases involving guns since that landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision expanding gun rights. Is there really a chance of Congress trying to ban bump stocks? I almost feel foolish asking you that. But is that something that you could see happen in the coming years?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, very slim, especially in this particular Congress. I mean, getting any type of gun control measure through the Republican House obviously would be a challenge. And because of the mechanics of the U.S. Senate, that is likely going nowhere. But, you know, it's important to note that we now live in this era post-2020, when the Supreme Court decided that landmark decision expanding gun rights, that any new gun law has to fall under that framework. And this gets a little bit wonky, but it's so important, because imagine a bill actually did make it through Congress today banning bump stocks, it would still run up against that Supreme Court precedent.What the Supreme Court ultimately decided back in 2022 is that any modern law is only constitutional pertaining to guns if there was a similar law on the books at the founding of the nation. And so in this case, you can imagine through that framework, because bump stocks were not illegal at that time. It doesn't matter that they didn't exist at all. The Supreme Court would look at that and say, this can't be constitutional because there wasn't this analog law that was in place. So certainly an uphill battle and, you know, as has been discussed, this decision today certainly setback for some of the gun safety advocates.",

      "sentences": "You know, so much of this often comes down to the ability to fire bullets in a rapid fashion. The more bullets, the obviously more deadly that a shooter can be. This, of course, runs head on into what we're hearing from gun rights advocates who say that, look, this is a slippery slope. If you start reducing any type of freedom as it pertains to guns, that then opens the door. This has been this long- term debate, you know, we've obviously heard.But, you know, I've talked to gun safety advocates as well who say that, look, people can have certain guns, but let's look at the ability to reduce the amount of times that a shooter can actually fire. That's why we've heard debates about so-called high-capacity magazines. That's the device that goes into a weapon holding the bullet. If a shooter even has to take a short amount of time to then possibly reload that weapon, that then increases the chances, you know, in a mass shooting situation that people can be fleeing or that gun could jam or that law enforcement could arrive on the scene. But particularly with this device, the bump stock, the ability to fire hundreds and hundreds of rounds obviously increases the lethality of any type of device that is equipped with that. And then, finally, it's worth pointing out, you know, I constantly hear from law enforcement as well across the country that they often feel like they are outgunned when it comes to some of the devices that they're seeing on the street. So it is certainly an interesting dynamic that, on one hand, you have those obviously who are in favor of gun rights that want no restriction. On the other hand, oftentimes, you have the police themselves saying, look, we're the ones that are often on the receiving end of these bullets whenever we show up on the scene of some of these heinous shootings.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this was long anticipated. The Justice Department, of course, is not going to prosecute the Attorney General Merrick Garland, who runs the Justice Department, of course, for his - essentially refusing to comply with Congress' demand to turn over the audio from President Biden's interview with Rob Hur, the special counsel who investigated the President for his mishandling of classified documents.You remember that that investigation wrapped up a few months ago, and there was a declination to prosecute the President for mishandling, no recommendation to prosecute the president for the mishandling of those documents. We saw, of course, Congress recently pass a contempt motion against the Attorney General for his refusal to turn over the audio. I should note that they turned over the transcript of those interviews. Here is the key part of this letter that went from the Justice Department to Speaker Mike Johnson today. It says, \"Consistent with a longstanding position and uniform practice, the department has determined that the responses of Attorney General Garland to the subpoenas issued by the committees did not constitute a crime, and accordingly the Department will not bring congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General.\" Because, obviously, part of this story here, Brianna, is that President Biden did assert executive privilege over those recordings. And part of the reason why the administration says that they won't turn them over is that they believe Republicans only want to use this essentially for attack ads. I should note, Brianna, that CNN is right now suing the administration and the department to seek for them to turn over these recordings, because we believe that they are newsworthy from our point of view. So, I should note that fact. What remains to be seen, though, Brianna, is what Republicans in the House might do next. There is one representative from Florida who has threatened to at least bring up inherent contempt. This is something that's been rarely, rarely used, where the sergeant of arms could go and try to arrest the Attorney General. That hasn't been done since 1934, where a former commerce official was locked up in the Willard Hotel for about a week. Nobody thinks we're going to get there.

Congress could bring a lawsuit and try to challenge the President's assertion of executive privilege. That's something that's going to take some time, probably a couple of years to work out.
