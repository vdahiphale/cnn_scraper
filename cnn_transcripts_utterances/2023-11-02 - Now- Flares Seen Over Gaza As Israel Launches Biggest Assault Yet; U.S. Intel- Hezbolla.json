Israeli forces also now coming face to face with Hamas fighters.Plus, fears of a second war growing at this hour. CNN witnessing more rockets entering Israel from Lebanon tonight, as CNN learns Hezbollah is about to get a Russian missile system added to its already massive arsenal. And, an OUTFRONT exclusive this hour, the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on why the House just passed aid package for Israel is bad for the United States. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. We are seeing new flares right now over the Gaza strip. What you are looking at took place just moments ago, as part of a dangerous new phase in the war between Israel and Hamas. And, rockets have been raining down on Gaza over the past few hours, as flares have lit up the night sky. You can see what happened not long ago, in the night time in Gaza City. It is the biggest aerial attack we have seen since the October 7th terror attacks by Hamas. Israeli officials telling CNN that the area now being targeted, they say, is a Hamas stronghold. The smoke screen that you see covering the ground, suggests that Israeli troops are on the move, or maybe on the move, but that screen would be obviously to mask their movements. That's according to our Nic Robertson, who, of course, is along the Gaza border. And a spokesperson for Israel's military says they have now encircled Gaza City. And now, if that is indeed the case, if the IDF surrounds Gaza City, it means that Israel has completely cut off northern Gaza from the rest of the 25 mile long strip. They can get, in and no one can get out. Israel's military chief of staff says that Israeli troops are right now engaged in, quote, and face-to-face battles with Hamas. That's hand to hand street fighting. And, they are now inside important Hamas facilities, that are both above and below ground, which is a seeming reference to IDF forces, perhaps being inside Hamas's massive tunnel system, where, of course, we understand command centers are there, Hamas fighters and hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adding, quote, we are making progress, nothing will stop us. Hamas, however, is fighting back. During the massive air assault, Hamas fired rockets back at Israel. The Iron Dome did appear to have thwarted those specific attacks. But tonight's fighting comes as there are growing fears of a second war, this one along Israel's northern border against a much better armed and trained foe. Our Jim Sciutto reporting tonight that there's been a definite pick up in the face of rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel. We have so much to get to tonight. Nic Robertson, Jeremy Diamond, they are both live along that Israel-Gaza border. Jim Sciutto is in northern Israel. Nic, let me begin with you though, because you have seen these flares, seeing these smoke screens, seeing this activity behind you. Just, very close to where you are. Tell us more.",

Jeremy, obviously when we talk about the north, if indeed Israeli troops have been circled Gaza City, that would of course it means the north is truly cut off now, from the rest of the strip.

Earlier today, already, the fighting had grown more intense in that part of the Gaza Strip. We were not far from Nick's position earlier today, watching as there were mortar -- mortar shells that appear to be fired inside of Gaza. We also heard a steady thud of artillery fire there.But also, intensity of small arms fire, and intense gun battles ongoing between Hamas militants and Israeli forces in that area, more intense that we have heard in recent days. And all this is very interesting, particularly as you consider the context of Israeli officials saying, tonight that they have encircled Gaza City. They may have encircled, as they say, having various positions around Gaza City and in the city itself.",

And so, regardless of whether or not the not they have encircled it, clearly, Hamas fighters remain north of Gaza City, and there is still very intense fighting there.You know, as I've been trying to get a better sense from Israeli officials about what this encirclements actually means, and what the next steps, the next phases of this military ground assault will be, they have been very cautious this evening, to characterize what those next steps will be. Will this be a siege of Gaza City? Will Israeli forces actually go in and engage in the very intense, and perhaps even bloody and deadly business of urban fighting inside those densely populated areas in Gaza City. They simply won't say. What they are telling me tonight, Erin is, that they will do whatever it takes to achieve the aims of this war, which as you heard from the Israeli prime minister and other officials, is to eliminate Hamas's capabilities inside the Gaza Strip, and to remove it from power.",

And Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe. So, I appreciate both of you being with us. General Votel, let me start with you. This major aerial assault that we saw tonight, with all of those flares, 30 minutes of nonstop rocket fire and explosions, bombarding Gaza. This came right after the IDF said that its troops had fully encircled Gaza city itself. And you saw that smoke, low smoke as Nic Robertson described, as possibly being used to disguise Israeli troop movements. What do you think is happening right now inside Gaza City? GEN. JOSEPH L. VOTEL (RET.), FORMER CENTCOM COMMANDER:  Yeah, thanks, Erin. It's great to be with you. I think what is happening here is, Israel has -- has closed in around the city, and is trying to create the best positions of advantage that they can, for what will come next, which will be actual operations into Gaza City. So, it is likely that they make contact with Hamas forces on the outskirts of the city. They have to fight to get into position. And I think, that is a lot of what, a lot of what we have seen, and will likely see in the near future.",

And, moves through different parts of Gaza, they are trying to get control of the entrances and exits for these tunnel systems, because the people who control that, you begin to gain control over the movement of Hamas. You begin to take away one of their critical, critical advantages, and that is the ability to ship fighters that will, to move and distribute supplies, and, to conduct command and control upon them.So, while this is a very difficult aspect of the fight, it is very critical for them to try to get control of the tunnels.

Because everyone knows that visit, in large part is a big push for the Israeli government to pause, to pause military operations in Gaza, for humanitarian purposes.Obviously, the U.S. has also been pushing such a pause as a way to release hostages, although Israel has said it wouldn't succeed in that, right.

He was speaking on a panel, and he was talking about what he sees as the Treasury Department's failure to lock in low interest rates.And he was saying virtually all Americans went and refinance, locking in low mortgage rates. Companies went out and borrowed money to take advantage of the incredibly low interest rates. He says -- he says everybody did it, except for the Treasury Department. He puts this on you personally. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
