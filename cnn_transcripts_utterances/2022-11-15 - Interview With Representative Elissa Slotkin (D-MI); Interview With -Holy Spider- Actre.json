Journalist, Felix Salmon, untangles one of history's most shocking financial implosions. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has addressed the G20 virtually. And just hours afterwards, Russia responded with missile attacks across Ukraine. Putin's latest salvo follows the liberation of Kherson, with Zelenskyy compared to D-Day, invoking that World War II turning point by the allies. It comes as the west once again unites to defend democracy. For the United States, that means not just supporting Kyiv, it also means countering illiberal forces at home. And on that front, the Democrats have scored yet another victory. Katie Hobbs has won Arizona's race for governor, defeating a Trump-backed election denier. And Hobbs had help from an unlikely ally, Liz Cheney. Indeed, the Republican bucked her own party and endorsed three Democrats, all of whom won their races. That list includes my first guest tonight, the Michigan Congresswoman, Elissa Slotkin. And she's joining me now from Washington. Congresswoman Slotkin, welcome back to our program, and congratulations on your win. REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI):  Thanks very much.",

We disagree on a lot of issues. And we were open about that, even that night when we are campaigning. But we agree on one really big issue which is preserving democracy and the importance of preserving democracy. So, we -- I brought her out because frankly, to me, democracy is the ultimate kitchen table issue. My district is very focused on kitchen table issues, their pocketbooks, their kids, and I wanted to make that connection between electing someone who's extreme and what that would do to their pocketbooks and their kids.

I've always needed independents. I've always needed moderate Republicans. Republican women have always been critical for me winning in these last two elections. So, I knew that. And the goal is you go to a conservative area where maybe they haven't seen Democrats show up in 40 years, and you knock on doors, and instead of getting 39 percent of the vote you get 42 percent of the vote. Instead of getting 41, you get 48. And that's how we knew, even in the early parts of my night, that we were going to win the race because we were losing better in all of the precincts that were closing early.

And I think in the coast, they're sort of used to them being blue areas, Democratic areas, so, they don't have the same field campaign. They don't have the same, like, pounding the pavement approach. They are not going to some of those rural communities, because they don't have to. There's a lot of Democrats. And in the Midwest, we have gotten really strong at having these broad campaigns.

This autonomy taken away from us? We got almost 800,000 signatures in eight weeks, and we got a ballot initiative put on our ballot. It's called, proposition three. And you better believe that people were out there voting for that. Republicans were, women especially, were voting yes on proposition three. And then late into the night, you know -- the longest lines of the election, late into the evening, we're at our colleges and universities. I represent Michigan State, and we were -- there were thousands of kids in line who are waiting to vote. We are bringing them pizza. And if you ask them, why are you here?

When you look at how far Ukraine has come, thanks to the help of the United States and allies, and I was told by President Zelenskyy that he really thanks the American people, because he knows it's taxpayers' money and support from people around the world.

So, that pressure is a real pressure. And the American people have been generous. I think it's important to recognize that. But I think we also need to recognize that what's going on in Ukraine and Russia is not just, like, a -- some faraway issue that doesn't affect everyone in Europe, everyone in the United States, and everyone who supports democracy. Do we want a world where a neighboring country can just invade a democracy and claim it as their own territory? Should there be a punishment for that? Should there be a price to pay? And I think we need to remain resolved on that. And supporting the Ukrainians in what has been a really incredible run to take back that territory, I think is -- has been important. But we cannot get weak in the knees as they're having these successes as the winter sets in.

You don't negotiate about them without them, right? You don't have a conversation about a country without them at the table. And the Ukrainians have made very clear that they want to -- they were -- are willing to eventually negotiate, but they got to do it from a position of strength. Obviously, over the past week, they've really gained in that position of strength. But it's not for me to say, OK. I'm good enough with where they've gotten.

But I do think regardless in the House, in the Senate, at the White House. Running for president, running for Senate, all these places, we need to be more deliberate as a party on building the bench, right? On getting more names and faces out there. And I will tell you my bias is, I don't see a lot of Midwesterners in that leadership. I see a lot of California and New York, who we love. But the middle of the country is also a bid important area as well, especially a lot of those swing states. So, I'd like to see more Midwestern leaders come forward.

On Monday, Gunagzhou reported record COVID-19 infections along with other major cities, including Beijing. And even though the case numbers are very low compared to global standards, China has been holding tight to it's zero- COVID policy. A policy of mass testing, lockdowns and border controls which has disrupted both lives and livelihoods. And the protest in Guangzhou come weeks after video emerged of a rare protest in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa over China's tough pandemic rules and that brazen protest in Beijing that directly attacked China's zero- COVID policy. One Banner read in part, \"No to lockdown. Yes, to freedom.\" And despite the rising public discontent, China is sticking with zero-COVID.
