Meantime, the rebuttal to that speech leading to controversy of its own Senator Katie Britt wanted to focus on what she describes as President Biden's failures, but now the spotlight is on one of her own mistakes. We have more fallout from Britt's response as she denies misleading the country with a story she told in her speech.",

MJ, the president is set to speak in just minutes, and you're learning he's going to go on the attack talking about his plans for health care, contrasting it with Republicans.",

We do expect that when the president takes the stage at this event in New Hampshire, one of several battleground states that we're going to see him traveling to this week as a part of his post State of the Union tour, health care is going to be the major part of his focus. You know, health care may not necessarily be as politically salient as an issue like border policies or reproductive rights.Biden aides do see an opportunity here to draw that contrast between the president and Republican lawmakers and, of course, his GOP rival Donald Trump. Now, particularly given that New Hampshire, has a sizable older and elderly population, what we should hear from the president in just a few minutes is really a focus on hammering home some of the work that his administration has done to bring down cost of drugs, including insulin, and also the efforts that are ongoing to protect Obamacare law, of course, which the president, when he was serving as vice president, had worked on with former President Barack Obama. Now, this is a law, of course, that Donald Trump has long vowed to repeal. If he has the opportunity to do so, but it is a law important to keep in mind that is relatively popular with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to say it is an important issue for them heading into 2024. So expect President Biden to talk a lot about this issue as they particularly pertain to the residents of this state and continue drawing that contrast with Republicans and their vision for health care as well.

And I think, you know, the Biden campaign, certainly his administration believes that they think that most Americans are better off at this point.

And there has been this internet speculation. It's been going wild over the past couple of weeks, saying, where is Kate? All kinds of lurid speculation. And clearly, this photograph from the palace, from Kensington Palace, was an attempt to end the speculation, say, here's Kate, she's fine.But it fueled the flames with all of these, as you were saying, these photoshop errors within a couple of, you know, not 10 minutes, I think, of it being published. Twitter was aflame with all these poor people pointing this out. And then the international photo agency is a hugely reputable agency that is saying, we don't want, you know, don't use this. And there have been all kinds of suspicions about it even going as far as being AI, which is very serious if it's an AI picture. And the palace aren't saying anything. They said they won't release the original picture of which this was photoshopped from. They won't release that. They're not saying anything else. Kate herself has said, it was me, I photoshopped it, and I apologize for the confusion. But there also today, there was a brief shot of Kate leaving Castle. Now, William was going to Westminster Abbey to the Commonwealth Service, a long planned engagement. Kate was in the car with him. And there were people already saying that this was damage limitation. This was people saying, you know, this has got out of hand. People are saying, you know, where is Kate? It's going to get even worse. So let's just see her coming out in the car. And really, I think this has been, today has been just a disaster, a PR disaster for the royals. This vision they had of pouring oil on the troubled waters has actually caused more chaos. And now people are saying, well, if it's AI, that is quite serious. I think most people, I would say, oh, Photoshop, you know, celebrities Photoshop.

It's all very well. We've  seen actually there was a royal christmas photo the most recent christmas photo, Louis was missing a finger but I think everyone thought oh well you know it's just photoshop.But the accusation that they might have put these different pictures together, some people are saying. I've seen lots of comments saying that these were all different pictures of them that were taken long ago last year and they've all put them all together.  Well if that is what people are accusing, then I think it is a problem because, you know, in the world of AI, we have to hold on to some kind of truth. And the royals, there is this contract with them that what they tell us should be, they don't tell us everything, but some of it should be truthful. And I think that certainly with Charles being so open about his cancer, there was a lot of real support there. And people haven't been speculating about that. They've been saying he's got cancer, let's leave him to it. But the attitude of silence towards Kate, I understand it. She needs her privacy, but it has caused total, total chaos. And I just, I don't actually myself think that she did Photoshop it, really. I think that it's much more likely as the experts telling me that it was AI and someone did this who specializes in this, but simply within 10 minutes, it was being caught by the internet.
