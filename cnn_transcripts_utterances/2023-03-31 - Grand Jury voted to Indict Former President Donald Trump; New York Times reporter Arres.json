I'm Kim Brunhuber.Coming up this hour, Donald Trump indicted on criminal charges. The case against the former U.S. president sets a new precedent on what it means for his reelection campaign and the country. Russia arrests an American journalist accused of being a spy, it's a move not seen since the Cold War. And later, the ski crash trial watched around the world, Hollywood actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, cleared of wrongdoing. The first and only time in American history, a former U.S. President is facing criminal charges. A New York grand jury has voted to indict Donald Trump. Sources tell CNN, Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. He's expected to appear in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. The grand jury has been hearing evidence about payments to adult film star, Stormy Daniels, to keep quiet about alleged sexual encounters with Trump. The Former President is lashing out at the Manhattan district attorney, Democrats and President Joe Biden. He posted on Truth social, this is an attack on our country, the likes of which has never been seen before, is likewise a continuing attack on our once free and fair elections. Trump has previously called for protests if he's indicted. A small crowd of supporters gathered outside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. I want to go live now to Washington and CNN's Katelyn Polantz. First Katelyn, take us through exactly what happened here.",

All of that came together today for this grand jury in Manhattan to approve the unprecedented indictment of a former president, President Donald Trump.What happened today were two things, one the grand jury did vote at the very end of the day to approve these charges. Our reporters have learned that it is more than 30 charges, which they are specifically, we don't yet know yet neither does Donald Trump. But we do know that the grand jury has returned this massive indictment. Also, what happened was the district attorney in Manhattan, got in touch with Donald Trump's lawyers and wanted to coordinate him getting to New York and being treated like any other person who is charged with a crime in that district, contacting him so that he can make arrangements to fly from Florida to New York city so that he can appear in court be arrested, be fingerprinted, be photographed, and go before a judge, enter his initial plea, which we expect to be not guilty whenever he does appear on Tuesday. So that's what happened today. That is what's going forward. And now what we are looking for in the coming days is how hectic of a scene this will be, and exactly how Donald Trump behaves, and how he is treated when he enters that Manhattan courthouse next week.",

Joining me now from Washington, CNN Political Commentators, Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona, and Republican strategist Alice Stewart.Thanks so much for being here with us, both of you. So to start with you, Alice, I mean, what's the mood right now in Republican circles? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Republicans are furious, Kim. They're furious. And it's across the board and many who support Donald Trump and those who have been ready to turn their backs on him. Look, based on what we know right now, Kim, the information that we have, it does not appear as though this is a strong enough case to move forward, and Republicans are looking at this fact. And they're saying this district attorney, Alvin Bragg overreached, and they went after Donald Trump because he is a political enemy. He is that someone that he does not like and he campaigned on putting a high priority on taking down Donald Trump. And that's exactly what he did. Look, next Tuesday, when they go to court, he might have documents. He might have the receipts. He might have everything, every question that people have about these charges will be put to rest next Tuesday when we go to court. But based on this, Donald Trump, I believe, has a right to say, why is he going after me? What is the reason for such an overreach in these particular charges because, as has been reported in the past, the charges that are before the courts right now or this grand jury, the Federal Election Commission passed the opportunity to proceed on these charges, as well as the Department of Justice. And now, the Manhattan D.A. is going after this. And what Donald Trump is saying is that this is a witch hunt. It can happen to me. It can happen to you. And turning over to the other Fox News channel where they are the mouthpiece for Donald Trump, that has all Republicans are hearing that this is unjust and unfair, and that's their takeaway, as we move forward. That might change Tuesday, if we hear more information, but that's the -- that's the feeling.",

Look, Donald Trump could not get out of the political arena any faster to suit my needs and my desires because he is toxic. And he is going to take this as an opportunity to portray himself as a martyr, as a victim, and somehow or other he has managed to convince his base that if this happens to me your next.Well, I can't imagine a lot of people in this country are going around paying money to porn stars to keep them quiet while they're running for president. He did the underlying issue here. The actual underlying issue that's at the core of all of this is this -- is what he did. But Republicans are not looking at that, they are -- they are looking at the overall narrative and not the details. They're looking at the narrative that Liberal D.A. in a liberal city and a liberal state has brought these charges before a grand jury and the liberal justice system is going after the American people. He will take Tuesday as an opportunity to take advantage of this media opportunity, whether or not he is in handcuffs are walking down the street remains to be seen. I'd like to think that they will allow him to do a lot of this in private, but he is going to use this to his advantage. Quite frankly, he has spent his entire life skirting the legal consequences for his actions. And now, this has come home to roost. But he is going to, as he always does, find a way to make this benefit him and he is going to raise so much money off of this. It breaks my heart. People that have not money to spare are giving money to this ban to pay his legal bills and it is certainly going to energize his base and a large segment of the Republican Party in the Republican Primary. But as you said, Kim, no one is going to be persuaded to vote for him that as an independent, certainly not a Democrat, and the disaffected Republicans that have left the party and left voting for conservative candidates because they want the policies that Donald Trump stands for, but they are sick and tired of the chaos and confusion vision that he brings to the party.

Now, some of those you know more than one could involve the Stormy Daniels' payments, but it sounds like it may have expanded some. And we don't know certainly it would be interesting to see if they're able to pair it with some of the other financial crimes that the Trump organization had been convicted for.But we don't know that yet. And factually, this is actually a very strong, very simple case. I mean, it's a man who wanted to buy silence. It's been worked up extensively over the past years. And for all the criticism of Michael Cohen, he's been quite consistent. And it's not on him that the former justice department and even the current one did not pursue this case. The facts are straightforward. There's documents to support it. There's Cohen's testimony. There's perhaps Stormy Daniels testimony as well. I think where the challenge is going to be for Alvin Braggs team is the unprecedented amount of legal arguments are going to be thrown at them. They could range everything from a preemption argument, saying only federal campaign finance law can apply here if it's related to this, to other arguments about trump's former presidential status. That's where they're really going to try and challenge it. If the Bragg team fends those off and they get to the jury, I don't think factually it's very complicated. And I think the facts will prove quite strong in the long run.",

And also in the grand jury, it doesn't have to be unanimous in the U.S. system. It just needs to be a simple majority.But quite contrary to what Trump is trying to imply here. This case has been looked over by a lot of prosecutors, all of whom would have been very, very conscious of this would be a historic unprecedented kind of prosecution. They want to get it right. So, it's not as though they just put in something that they thought was a social case. Bragg is not going to bring this case unless he is pretty convinced that is strong. And you saw that in the past, he had failed to charge Trump even after his predecessor had worked up the case for years about the financial crimes. So, it's not as though Bragg is just looking to bring something which you may not be sure of. He has to be feeling pretty certain in order to go this route.",

CNN's Delia Gallagher reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This was the pope on Wednesday morning, seemingly in good health at his general audience in St Peter Square. But by Wednesday afternoon, he was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital. The diagnosis, respiratory infection. The Vatican said he'd been complaining of breathing difficulties for the past few days. On Thursday evening, more details from the Vatican, the pope has bronchitis and is receiving antibiotics intravenously with clear improvement in his health. If his recovery continues to progress, they say, he will be released in the next few days. (on camera) Pope Francis is 86 years old. He has a certain vulnerability to respiratory issues because when he was 21, he had part of his right lung removed for a respiratory illness. He's also no stranger to this hospital. His rooms are here on the top floor, those five windows with the white shutters pulled down. He was last here in the summer of 2021 for 10 days when he was operated on for diverticulitis, and they removed part of his colon. (voiceover) The Vatican said on Thursday that Francis was able to have breakfast, read the newspapers, and even do some work from his hospital rooms. He also managed to send a tweet saying I'm touched by the many messages received in these hours and I express my gratitude for the closeness and prayer. The pope's hospital stay has put into doubt whether he will be able to participate in Easter week events which begins this Sunday, Palm Sunday, one of the busiest times of the year at the Vatican.
