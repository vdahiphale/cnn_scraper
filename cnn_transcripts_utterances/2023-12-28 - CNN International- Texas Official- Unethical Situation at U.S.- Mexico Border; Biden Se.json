The U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security says he and other top officials from the Biden administration had a very productive meeting with Mexico's president and his cabinet on Wednesday.Mexico's top diplomat echoed the sentiment, saying the meeting was very good and details on agreements will be announced later in a joint statement. Senior U.S. officials say Mexico shared plans to crack down on migrant smugglers which are contributing to the crisis. The talks come as both U.S. and Mexican governments are under pressure to address an influx of migrants in recent weeks. Local leaders from border communities in Texas say the Biden administration needs to step up and provide solutions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Michigan Supreme Court has rejected a bid to remove Donald Trump's name from the state's primary ballot, but he could still be kept off the general election ballot. A voters advocacy group filed a lawsuit in September.They argue Trump should be disqualified because he violated the 14th Amendment of the Constitution by engaging in an insurrection. The Michigan courts didn't address that issue but rejected the lawsuit on procedural grounds. Trump's ballot ban in Colorado is now on hold indefinitely after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the challenge did not come from Trump's legal team. CNN's Paula Reid has the details.

It removed former President Trump from the ballot.Now Trump has signaled he too will appeal that ruling, but he hasn't done so yet. But the GOP has been a party in this litigation. They are fighting for the ability to list Trump as a candidate on the primary ballot. And one of the immediate impacts of this appeal is that the Colorado decision is now on pause until the Supreme Court reveals whether it wants to get involved. They are under enormous pressure to take up this case and to offer some clarity on exactly who the 14th Amendment applies to and the extent that states have power to remove candidates from the ballot. So unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up or how long it will take them to decide, but because of this appeal, that Colorado decision now on hold. Now one of the places where this question of whether Trump will be on the ballot is still outstanding is the state of Maine. Now what's interesting about Maine is there the Secretary of State is actually the first one to review ballot eligibility and then it can go to the courts to be appealed. And Trump and his team calling for the Secretary of State to be recused -- him to recuse herself from this case. They are arguing that things that she said about January 6th should make her ineligible to review this case. She's expected to make her decision on this any day now. She did not respond to our request for comment, though it does appear unlikely that she would recuse herself. Now the special counsel, Jack Smith, also hard at work just days after the holiday. He has filed a request with the court to limit Trump's ability to argue that he is the victim of political persecution if and when the January 6th federal case goes to trial. That whole case is on hold right now while larger constitutional questions are appealed. But the special counsel hopes to be able to take that case to trial before the 2024 election. In order to make that happen, he continues to make filings and requests of the court so that once those appeals are resolved, if he prevails, he can move ahead with trial as quickly as possible.

Resolution 1701 could lead to war in Lebanon. That resolution called for the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah following the 2006 Lebanon war and the withdrawal of troops from a demilitarized zone.That warning coming after the Israeli foreign minister visited the border, and as new shelling is reported. On Wednesday Hezbollah claimed it targeted an Israeli border city with 30 Katyusha rockets. The attack, Hezbollah says, was in response to earlier IDF airstrikes on a Lebanese village. And just one day after Israel's military chief said forces are concentrating their efforts in southern and central Gaza, reports of deadly strikes in the city of Khan Younis. [04:10:00] The Palestine Red Crescent Society said dozens of people have been killed after IDF shelling near a hospital on Wednesday. An Israeli official also tells CNN that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to return to Israel next week and will make other stops in the Middle East to discuss the next steps in the Israel-Hamas war. The U.S. State Department though has yet to confirm Blinken's visit. Our Nada Bashir has been closely following all of this. Nada, what has the Israeli military said it will do if the Hezbollah attacks on the northern border of Israel continue?",

As you mentioned, we have seen that exchange of shelling from Hezbollah on Wednesday.The Israeli military confirmed it had carried out an airstrike along the border region in southern Lebanon saying that they had targeted a Hezbollah site. Their Lebanese national media then later confirming that three people had been killed in that strike. Hezbollah later confirming that at least one of those killed was a Hezbollah fighter. And there is mounting concern that this could trigger another escalation in tensions between both Israel and Lebanon. We've heard from the Israeli foreign ministry's warning about this potential escalation saying that they are looking at two possible options here, a political solution to that escalation or a military solution. And that would see the Israeli military seeking to remove Hezbollah from the border region entirely. And we have also heard from a war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, who issued his own warning yesterday. Take a listen to his statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, ISRAELI MINISTER (through translator): The situation on Israel's northern border demands change. The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have now seen over the last few weeks an escalation in attacks targeting U.S. positions in both Syria and Iraq. And we have heard that vocal condemnation from the Biden administration, warning about Iran-backed proxies across the region who may, of course, carry out attacks in response to the situation we are seeing in the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, that is a huge point of concern as well for regional leaders. We saw just yesterday King of Jordan Abdullah and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt meeting yesterday. They spoke about the potential of this to spill over into a regional conflict, warning that this could be an eventuality if enough effort isn't put into the diplomatic solutions that they are seeking.

So he is pushing his weapons programs and his nuclear programs even further as he orders this to accelerate here in the face of what he accuses the U.S. of doing, of expanding its own efforts in the region. It's worth noting that just 10 days ago, North Korea tested the Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile. It is the third solid fuel ICBM test we've seen coming from North Korea this year. That also came with a short-range ballistic missile test. So you can see here Kim Jong-un seeing the U.S. working with South Korea and Japan. He is pushing his country even harder as well.

On Wednesday, Washington approved a quarter billion dollars in new aid, including ammunition for air defense, artillery and the so-called HIMARS rocket systems. But the White House has made it clear that that's the end of the line for Ukraine, until Congress approves more aid.Republicans in Congress are blocking a bill including more than $60 billion in aid, demanding more concessions on immigration and border security in return. Negotiations over the bill have been stalled for weeks, but they are expected to resume next month. We now want to show you a before and after image of a Ukrainian strike in occupied Crimea. Ukraine claims it destroyed a Russian navy tank landing ship on Tuesday, adding that only time will tell how many Russians were killed. But Russia says one person is dead and four others wounded. Moscow is trying to downplay the incident saying the military vessel was only damaged. But if Ukraine's claim is true, the ship would be the third major piece of military hardware that Russia has lost in less than a week. CNN's Helena Lins joins me now live from Kyiv. Helena, how are people in Ukraine reacting to the latest U.S. aid package, knowing that another one is not sure to come? And how does that factor into morale overall, looking ahead to next year, where this conflict will reach its third year?",

So they understand this decrease on aid for Ukraine, but at the same time, they keep asking for aid, not only Ukrainians on the streets, but also the government, because, you know, they say that's the only way of keep fighting, not only for Ukraine. They keep highlighting they are not fighting only for Ukraine, but they are fighting for Europe as well and for democracy and for the Western democracies. So this, of course, knowing that this can be the last U.S. aid for a while, it's a concern for Ukrainians. There's been, you know, the shelling continue in the east of the country, there is artillery fighting, drones, and some military sources saying that, you know, the situation is difficult, so equipment gets worn out, destroyed, burned. So people say, yes, it sounds that we keep asking for more and more and more, but, you know, if things get worn out and if they get destroyed, we do need more. And also yesterday, the economy minister on an interview for Financial Times was saying, you know, if we don't keep receiving more support from the U.S., but also from the European Union, we might have to prioritize money for the defense and that means delaying probably payments for salaries and pensions. So this is a big topic here in Ukraine. And I would say that from Ukrainian citizens on the streets to the government, this is one of the big concerns right now regarding the future of the country and this war that, you know, it's, as you were saying, it's almost two years, it will enter the third year of the war in Ukraine.",
