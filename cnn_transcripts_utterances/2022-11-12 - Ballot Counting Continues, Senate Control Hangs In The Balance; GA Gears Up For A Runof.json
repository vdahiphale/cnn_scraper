Again, Nadia Romero, thank you so much for that.So, Republicans may not have performed as well as they expected during the midterm elections. But there is new CNN exit polling that shows the party has made inroads in some areas with a fastest growing demographic of new voters in the country. And some communities there were notable declines from 63% support for Democrats among Latino men in the last midterm election to just a little over half this year. Meantime, support for Democrats among Latinos also dropped from 73%, four years ago, to 66% on Tuesday. Now, these shifts may not seem like much, but as we watch racist decided by very thin margins in places like Nevada and Arizona, some Democrats are urging the national party to do more to address and reverse these trends. Joining us to discuss is Melissa Morales, she is the founder and president of the Latino voter advocacy group, Somos Votantes. Melissa, thank you so much for being with us this morning. Your organization helps to educate and mobilize Latino voters. You've also had a history of endorsing Democrats. Why do you think the party saw that shift among Latino voters that's been going on now for several elections?",

So, we certainly see I think, Florida and the shifts that we've seen in Florida disproportionately represented in that. You know, I think Florida is, is a cautionary tale about what happens when you sort of let your foot off the gas or take Latino voters for granted. We've seen massive Republican gains in Florida over the past few cycles. But I think in the rest of the country, when we look outside of Florida, we see definitely a much bigger picture of stability in the Latino vote, you know, sort of on par with where we were in 2020, and maybe even some Democratic gains.And I think, you know, the Latino, the Latino red wave certainly did not happen in the way that Republicans had hoped. And there's a lot of analysis to be done, a lot of races still to be called. But I think I'm looking at some key points when I say that, you know, I'm looking at the fact that Mayra Flores, who was sort of the figurehead for Republicans for this Latino red wave lost her congressional seat on Tuesday. I'm looking at the fact that Democrats have elected an incoming wave of Latino Democrats, you know, thinking about Delia Ramirez and Greg Casar and Maxwell Frost. And I'm looking at an analysis that was put out by the Economist, you know, very initial analysis that showed that Democrats actually made some of their biggest gains in counties with large numbers of Latino voters. And so, again, I think there's, you know, there's still votes to be to be counted and analysis to be done over the coming months. But I do think that, you know, we did not see the Latino red wave happen, and certainly not in the way that Republicans had hoped.",

      "sentences": "You know, I think that, you know, key here is really about investment. Right. And when we're looking at a state like Florida, that's certainly one side of the coin. And what happens when you sort of pull investment from the state and then states like Arizona, as you mentioned, in Georgia, where there has been this massive investment, you know, by groups like so most by Democrats in the Latino community, I do think we're looking at a little bit different, you know, when we're looking at Senator Kelly, he was elected in 2020, which was a presidential year sky high turnout, I think midterms is always going to be a little bit different. I think we'll know more once the analysis gets in.But I think the lesson to be taken as you know, for Democrats, like you cannot take your foot off the gas right now it has to be about massive investment and continued investment. And I think he definitely in states like Arizona, Nevada, all obviously still to be called but incredible investment in Nevada this year, but also in states that we don't traditionally talk about when we're talking about the Latino vote. States like Wisconsin and Michigan, and as you said, the incredibly crucial state of Georgia. So, most is headed to Georgia and certainly planning to invest there in this upcoming runoff. But I do think that that that is the lesson for Democrats here is there has to be continued investments. And I think that, of course means resources, right time, money and energy. But it also means policies. I think, a reason why Democrats were able to hold, you know, hold Latino voters this this year in a way that they were is because of the policies that we've seen passed over the past two years by President Biden and the Biden administration and Democrats, specifically, you know, key economic policies. I grew up in in rural Kansas and a hardworking family that really struggled to meet make ends meet. And so, I have seen firsthand the direct impact that these kinds of policies can have on voters. And so, we have to continue and have on families and you know, make a real difference. So, we have to continue to make those sorts of investments. And I think on the economy, yes, but on other issues, too, like climate and like immigration.",

But this win by Ron DeSantis, was not only really convincing and historic in the size of the margin, but also who he is winning with, obviously, South Florida, Cuban-Americans traditionally vote more Republican than other Latinos.But DeSantis did really, really well among Puerto Ricans and other Latin Americans as well, who tend to not give Republicans majorities.

So I think, you know, we talked a lot about the shifts that we saw in Florida and the Latino vote in 2020. But, you know, for those of us who were paying attention to Florida politics, those shifts started in 2018.And that was really a result of the fact that Republicans and the Trump campaign made a strategic decision that they said that they thought that they could pick up games with Latino voters in Florida, and they were on the ground in 2016. And honestly, they never left. There were they had a huge visible presence in Florida, you know, in Miami-Dade for the last six years now. And I think that gets back to the story of investments. You think that that's what happens when you take Latino voters for granted. That's what happens when we don't invest in communities, which I think is why the sort of cautionary tale is we have to be investing -- continuously investing in states like Nevada, Arizona and Georgia.",

As of this moment, the President should ensure while be heading to a gala with Asia Pacific leaders here in Cambodia, dodging the torrential downpour behind me to some degree. But even this meeting, this meeting with ASEAN leaders, is largely about trying to impress upon them that they remain central to the United States strategy in the region. And it's really been a geopolitical battle, maybe not as explicit as it is implicit between the U.S. and China in terms of kind of who holds the upper hand in the relationship economically, in terms of maritime rights, kind of across the board with the countries in Southeastern Asia, all leading up to that trip to Bali, here in a couple of days.Now that at that G20 Summit, there'll be a number of issues on the agenda that leaders will have to grapple with, most notably probably what's going on in Ukraine, the continued efforts by the U.S. to rally what has been a rather surprisingly unified coalition, unbreakable to this point, despite all of the economic headwinds and challenges, European allies, other allies in the Asia Pacific region as well have been facing. But when you talk to U.S. officials, they acknowledged that after nearly two years of no face-to-face, sit downs tensions that continued to rise in an increasingly muscular China and a president now and Xi Jinping that has just been given kind of, to the extent you can have more power. I'm not sure you see it in China right now, in the wake of the People's Congress that just finished up this meeting will be focused on not necessarily major deliverables. Obviously, that's diplomatic speak for what leaders often trying to come out of face-to-face bilateral engagements with. Instead, it's more about understanding when you talk to White House officials understanding the perspectives, the red lines, where each leader sits on critical issues like Taiwan on maritime rights, things like that, that have the possibility of creating very real problems in the future. Right now, they want an understanding that just simply doesn't exist between the two countries as those relations have continued almost in a downward spiral over the course of the last few years. That will be the focal point of that meeting here in Cambodia. There'll be driving towards that there'll be a critical trilateral meeting with the leaders of South Korea and Japan tomorrow that the President we focused on. China will also be a central component of that meeting, again, all driving towards that first face-to-face sit down. Everybody here acknowledges. Certainly, keeping an eye on the domestic political situation.
