This despite the fact that his Republican allies have come on this show and others and said, oh no, that's not what he means.

I want to walk through some of the numbers that we've seen. So, Elon Musk, of course, one of his most high-profile surrogates right now, he gave $75 million to the super PAC that he had launched over the summer. We know Miriam Adelson, another huge Trump supporter and donor, she gave $95 million. Of course, you know, another massive number. And then we know that David Uihlein, he's a Midwestern shipping magnate, he gave $49 million to a pro-Trump super PAC as well, known as the restoration pack.So, this is a ton of money. And, of course, this is something that the Trump campaign is obviously welcoming. They have been worried about trying to catch up with Democrats, really good fundraising numbers in this final stretch. But it's very clear he is going to have the money to do what he needs to do in these final 20 days. John?",

The initial charge of theft that was later dropped. But, you know, the sheer speed with which all this transpired has led to this outcry from the community. It also comes as we've been reporting on the scathing DOJ report earlier this year saying that Phoenix Police had allegedly engaged in disproportionate use of force against minorities, including people with disabilities. Only later did the officers here actually learned that he was deaf and that he was suffering from cerebral palsy. But this also raises the question, John, about training, or lack thereof. I want to play you what the officers described in court when they were asked about the type of training they received dealing with people with disabilities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
