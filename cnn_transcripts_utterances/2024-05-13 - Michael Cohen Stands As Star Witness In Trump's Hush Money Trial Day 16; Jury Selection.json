In this hour, today's star witness in the Hush Money cover-up conspiracy case, Michael Cohen, who testified that Donald Trump told him an alleged sexual encounter that Stormy Daniels was claiming would be catastrophic for his 2016 campaign, were that to come out before voters went to the booths, but did Michael Cohen convince the jury that Trump himself directed him to pay off Daniels to protect Trump's election? I'm going to ask a criminal defense attorney who was in the courtroom for today's testimony.And live images right now from Baltimore, where a major demolition is just minutes away. Engineers plan to use explosives to remove parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge that collapsed back in March, and by the way, the 21-member crew on the ship that caused the collapse, they're still on the boat, and they're going to stay on board for today's demolition. Plus, a frankly puzzling move by Russia's Vladimir Putin. He fired the head of the Russian military and replaced him with an economist, a money man, as Russia is running out of weapons for war. But let's begin outside the New York courthouse with the New York Hush Money cover-up conspiracy case, CNN's Paula Reid is there, and Paula, it's a wrap on day one of testimony from Michael Cohen, the most critical witness in this case. So far, is this going the way that the prosecution hoped?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so far, Jake, it's been going well for prosecutors.Michael Cohen laid out how long before he announced his candidacy for the White House, Trump was worried that stories from other women would come out in the open and potentially impact his candidacy. Now, Michael Cohen also testified how involved he was in suppressing negative stories ahead of the election, and how in the wake of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, he facilitated that Hush Money payment to Stormy Daniels. He testified that Trump told him, don't worry, you'll be reimbursed. And then towards the end of the day, we got to the really critical part of his testimony for prosecutors, which is that he testified that Trump was aware of the scheme to reimburse him by making it all seem like illegal expenses and to really increase the amount he was being paid back so that he didn't, of course, he didn't have to pay taxes so that he would be made whole. What's not clear, Jake, though, is if Cohen's testimony has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump was aware that business records were going to be falsified. And of course, Cohen's testimony still has a long way to go. This was certainly not easy for him or for the prosecution, but it really is the easy part because after they get through 2017 and the receipt of this reimbursement, then they're going to have to walk through how Cohen eventually flipped on Trump, how he also pleaded guilty to federal crimes, including lying to Congress, lying to the IRS, lying to banks, also election crimes related to this hush money scheme. And then he has to talk about how he has relentlessly attacked the defendant for years and really made a living doing that. So, so far, it's been going OK, but, you know, it's only going to get more difficult both for Cohen and prosecutors tomorrow morning when they're back.",

His delivery was important. He was making eye contact, especially when he was talking about taking out that home equity loan. So I think he definitely came off credible. In the end, the one line that sticks out to me is just like Nike, just do it. And that was the theme that Donald Trump gave to Michael Cohen. Just do what you need to do. I think the prosecution was essential and crucial to Michael Cohen because they finally provided that link, that Donald Trump authorized these payments and the payments were for the purposes of affecting that campaign, of purposes of paying off Stormy Daniels because they knew that story will affect the campaign. So Michael Cohen did deliver. But again, this is only direct examination. We have to see how he stands up doing cross-examination. I'm not concerned about his prior record. It hasn't come in yet, but I know when it does come in, I'm never concerned with that because I put on witnesses with a criminal record longer than my arm being a former prosecutor, 16 years.

He was straightforward. He was a matter of fact. He had an awful lot of yes ma'am, yes ma'am, no ma'am type answers to questions. And I think, you know, I spent a lot of time looking at the jury today trying to figure out what those people were possibly thinking because some of them looked at Cohen. Some of them took notes. Some of them looked away. And at the end of the day, I'm not sure, but they were paying attention. They weren't just sort of ignoring him and thinking about other things.",

And I think that's where they are.The idea that sort of Trump is saying do what you just do and take care of it, I don't think that really crosses the line of where the prosecution needs to be. And I say that because they also talked about Allen Weisselberg and his input into what would be done and setting up the company and even the tape recording that we heard from Cohen when he tape recorded his client, which I thought was ridiculous. But, you know, that to me was sort of a, you know, it really cut both ways, frankly, I think, more for the defense because it says, I've talked to Allen, everything's fine, this is what we're going to do. You know, and then he tells the jury today and the court, he says, you know, I told Trump and I kept him up to date on everything that was going on, except the fact that he was taping him. I mean, he's lying again. He's already started lying again. So I don't think they've gotten there. They've got to get to the place where they say, you know, look, Trump knew that the records were going to be falsified. He had actually some input and direction into that specific part, not just pay it off, you know, his former relationship, but, you know, that he had a real hand in falsifying these records or directing someone to do that, not just to sort of clean up his mess that was outside of his marriage.",

And I think because we can expect a similar thing with Cohen and Cross, that they'll go after just all these sort of names he's called Trump, the crude posts, the TikTok videos, the podcasts and the books, that this will, especially once Cross starts, that this will be a major line of questioning.",

If you know your own witness is going to get beat with a ball bat, it's better to take the flyswatter to him first yourself. And so that's what they need to do to sort of disarm the defense. I think the Allen Weisselberg issue is going to remain because we've been hearing his testimony really through some statements that Cohen is getting in. And I'm surprised that, I mean, that would typically be some hearsay objections, I think. And so that to me will be an issue. And if the prosecution tries to come back, I think the defense will be able to say, wait a minute, they could have cut a deal with him. They chose not to do that. And instead, the only one they're giving you is the guy who's already admitted not telling the truth. And I think that's something they'll ride all the way in. So Cohen will be, they'll have their day with him.

And also do you think, asking jurors, do you think perhaps that anyone that comes from New Jersey, would that mean that they would, do you think that a person from New Jersey is more likely to commit a crime or not? Just some of the questions that jurors are likely going to be asked here. But again, jury has not been seated. Once that does happen, of course, opening statements will get underway. We already know how the prosecution is going to outline its case. It says that Senator Menendez and his wife accepted thousands of dollars in bribes that came in the form of cash, that came in the form of gold bars that were confiscated from the Senator's home, all in exchange for the Senator's influence. The Senator, for his part, saying that the government is overreaching here, that they're out to get him, saying that the money that was found at his home in New Jersey is money that he had saved and he stored at home, in part for cultural reasons, and that some of the other money that was found at his home were loans that he had received, that his wife had received.

Let's bring in our political panel right now to discuss all of this. So one thing that is interesting, put the polls aside for a second. Let's just look at actual election results. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley dropped out of the race two months ago. She took around 21.7 percent of the vote in Indiana's Republican primary. That's Republican voters. That's not mischief makers. Those are Republican voters. And about a fifth of them voted for her. And Senator Tom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, he sees that as a warning sign. He told \"The Hill\", quote, my guess is you're talking a good number of that 20 percent are people that vote consistently. Those folks that vote consistently in Republican primaries are not going to vote for Joe Biden. They may not vote. So, Scott, how concerned are you about those 20, 50 percent, 20 percent?

So some of these people probably never voted for Trump to begin with.Some of them may come around to him because frankly, Joe Biden's doing things that they hate so much right now. I mean, just be honest, since this Israel stuff and Biden going wobbly on this, I've talked to a lot of people who have nothing for Trump, but they are so furious with Biden on Israel that they're warming up. Some of them may not vote, but these, you know, her voters were college educated, high engagement, you know, vote in every election type. So maybe they vote and they leave it blank. I don't know.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled the southern city of Rafah since Israel's first evacuation order last week, according to the United Nations, while in the north, videos show panicked Palestinians attempting to reach safety amid heavy bombings.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us. Jeremy, though, of course, we can see the horror on the ground. Clearly, it's been harder to get an accurate estimate of how many Palestinians have been killed since October 7th in Gaza. Last week, the United Nations quietly revised downward its numbers on fatalities for Palestinian women and children. Tell us more about that. What led to the change?",
