Also, the House, with its newly minted speaker, gets down to business today, maybe. We'll see what it looks like. Republicans are trying to pass the rules package for the new congress, which is going to be the first big test for Speaker Kevin McCarthy. And a nightmare ordeal in Texas where a man has been charged with aggravated kidnapping for allegedly holding a woman that he met on the dating app Bumble captive for days, repeatedly assaulting her after she denied his sexual advances.",

Before arriving in Mexico, Biden toured El Paso, Texas. It was his first tour of the border as president. Local Officials and area lawmakers accompanied him as he spoke with officers and migrant aid providers.So, joining us now, one of those local officials is the El Paso mayor, Oscar Leeser. We're so happy to have you this morning. Thank you for joining. When you spoke with the president, it was -- you had a talk with him. I'm wondering what he said and how he received what you had to say. MAYOR OSCAR LEESER (D), EL PASO, TEXAS: Well, you know, we were very thankful that he came down here to really talk to the people that really -- we've been dealing with it on a day in and day out. And, you know, it - it really makes a difference. I was telling people that he's very aware of what's going on in the border. He's very aware of what's going on in El Paso. But coming down and seeing it with his own eyes really made a big difference. And what I - what I did, though, I made a book. And this book had 62 pictures of what I've seen through my eyes. Every morning I go down -- and this morning I went down there -- and looked at the, you know, Sacrament Church area. And I - I actually would go down at 4:00 in the morning and take pictures. So, I was able to share these pictures with him because it's something he wouldn't be able to see. So, for the last 90 days, I've actually shared the pictures that I was able to really compile. And he looked at them. And whether it was at the airport, whether it was at the river. So, it was really very - and I was able to have a little breakout room with him and kind of go over those pictures with him, which were very impactful, so he could see what our city and what challenges we've been going through.",

So, he really -- he talked to everybody that really has been dealing with this and how we could, you know, get the people off the street. And that was my main concern. How do we work together to get the people off the street and make sure that they're not on the street, they're not sleeping on the street, and they're not susceptible to, you know, the climate out here.",

Because that was important that he really had a view of everything that we've been seeing.So, no, he actually was able to see what was going on, what's been going on in El Paso. And I have gone down there. I was there this morning again. And, obviously, I'm down there at 10:00, 11:00 at night. So, he was able -- I was able to have a one-on-one with him and talk to him about what's been going on in El Paso and our needs. And he was able to talk to the border patrol and ask them what their needs were. And I was very impressed because when he asked then what their needs were, he knew what their needs were.

And, again, they're all good government reforms. The only thing that actually changed, by the way, these rules were negotiated by the entire conference. Kevin McCarthy was very open and honest, transparent, allowing all members to participate in the process on how to improve the way the House operates. And that should be made clear here. The vast majority, all but maybe one, had been negotiated by the entire conference and approved, I should say, by the entire conference prior to January 3rd, which is why this stalemate that happened last week was unnecessary because it didn't really add anything much more unless there were, as you say, other deals made on the side that we're unaware of.But I trust Kevin McCarthy. I think that he was doing what was in the best interest of the entire conference. And the bottom line is, we need to move forward. There is just too many issues facing our nation right now that we want to get forward and address.

Do you have concerns about cuts to defense spending? MALLIOTAKIS: Sure, and that's not part of the rules, that could be an area that they're discussing, which would be interesting, right, because this group of members from the Freedom Caucus would then be siding with AOC and members of the squad and President Biden, who have all called for cutting defense spending.
