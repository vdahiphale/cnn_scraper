Any minute now, the candidate will take the stage in South Carolina for what her campaign is billing as a major speech. We expect her to make the case for while she'll stay in the race even if she loses her home state.Plus, contrasting the crazy. New CNN reporting reveals the president's orders to his senior most campaign staff ramp up how much they're spotlighting the quote \"crazy,\" let's say stuff, that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. And Bill Bradley, former Democratic senator, NBA star,h e hasn't run a campaign since the year 2000. And he is younger than Joe Biden. Does that matter? Should it matter to voters? I'll talk to him about that in more in minutes. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, Nikki Haley says she can still write her own story. The former ambassador in South Carolina governor will take the stage shortly in her home state, which holds its pivotal primary in just four days. Her task is to convince donors and voters, she still has a path to victory. That's a scenario that seems more and more unlikely by the day. CNN's Kylie Atwood is covering the Haley campaign for us is in South Carolina. Kylie?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, what we've heard from Nikki Haley over the last few days is her continuing to beat this drum of determination on the campaign trail. Even though we've seen many polls, including a poll out today that show her -- behind former President Trump here in her home state of South Carolina by 30, 35 points.She is continuing to say that she is in this that she is not going anywhere. She's also not casting the results of South Carolina primary as a life or death for her campaign. She has said that it is important for her to do well. She has encouraged South Carolinians to get out and vote for her on Saturday. But in the same breath, she has been telling voters here in South Carolina that she's heading to Michigan. The next day that she's going to compete in those Super Tuesday seats states, really a defiant Nikki Haley that we have seen over the course of the last few days. As she is preparing to deliver this speech on what her campaign says is the state of the race. Now, as she is going to do this, former President Trump's campaign is out with a campaign memo today. Trying to, oh, it looks like Nikki Haley is going to be coming on in just a second year but trying to undercut her message. What they are saying is that her campaign is effectively over. They are laying out the delegate math for how former President Trump is going to clinch the delegates that he needs to win the nomination by March 12 or March 19. And we're going to listen to what Nikki Haley has to say here if she'll get into any of that delegate math at all.",

      "sentences": "OK. We've been listening to Nikki Haley, Republican presidential candidate and giving what her campaign dubbed as a major speech in her home state of South Carolina. A state that is going to the polls for an important primary in just four days on Saturday. So, the intro to this speech was about how she's not dropping out. And first of all, I just want to bring in our panel -- number of orders, Nia-Malika Henderson of Bloomberg and CNN, Laura Barron-Lopez of the PBS NewsHour, and NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. So back to wrapping up the gist of her speech, which was I refuse to quit I'm not dropping out.And of course, the sort of predictable the media says, I should drop out which -- I just want to lay the groundwork here for our conversation, which is that going into the speech. I don't think anybody thought she was going to drop out. She and her campaign made extremely clear that she was going to stay in -- at least through South Carolina and even beyond, as she reiterated in this speech. But there clearly is a reason why she gave this speech today. She wants to kind of reframe the discussion, reframe the narrative around her campaign for it not to be the fact that she is so far behind Donald Trump, and she wants to -- let met sort of get other headlines out there. She also wants to continue to raise money. So, I think a big audience for this speech is the donor class, which so far given where she is, you know, and the fact that she doesn't have that many delegates that she doesn't have a lot of hope for beating Donald Trump. The fact that she still is able to raise any money. Says a lot about some of the concern about Donald Trump as small as it is, particularly in the donor class. Nia, what are your thoughts, especially as a South Carolina native. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, listen, -- you know, she wanted attention today and she got it. And you know, the donors will be listening and maybe they'll give her a little more runway to continue this thing. Nikki Haley was there saying, she likes hard truths. Well, one hard truth is her path to defeating Donald Trump is incredibly difficult. She sort of makes it -- seem like she has a beef with the GOP a lead and the political press. The beef should be with the voters, right, who aren't really buying her message. At this point, I mean in South Carolina, she is going to lose by a landslide. She was a two-time governor. They're fairly popular on the way out, but people aren't just -- people aren't liking her. They liked Donald Trump much better. And so, listen. I think she lives to see another day. It's sort of a pre buttle to her defeat in South Carolina. But again, it just seems like another day of this campaign that will end at some point.",

Rewind to Iowa and New Hampshire, particularly after New Hampshire, there certainly was a question about whether she wanted to face voters in our home state and potentially lose by a landslide.But given the fact that she's young, and whether that would hurt her brand long term. My own political future is of zero concern. That was a notable line that helps answer -- I mean ---- HENDERSON: It is untruth too.",

I mean, look, I think that all of us can agree that she definitely has ambitions beyond this presidential election cycle. I mean, she's likely looking to 2028 and establishing herself as someone who didn't kiss the ring necessarily. Although, I thought that that was a funny line considering that, you know, recently she still said -- even though she's been going after the former president more aggressively lately. She still said that she would pardon him if she were elected president. And I'm not sure if she's answered more recently, whether or not, she would vote for him still or support him as a nominee.",

She has called him on hinge. She has said that he is willing to hand over, you know, NATO territories to Russia and establish herself as not an isolationist in the Republican Party, and that he represents a threat but then still says she'd be willing to vote for him. So, I think that that's making it harder for her to establish this lane where she can win over a lot of voters.",

There is no real groundswell of support for her. Even in her own state of South Carolina right.Before New Hampshire, I was talking to some folks on the ground there, they thought maybe she could get 45, 47 percent. If she did well in New Hampshire. She didn't do that well in New Hampshire. And so, it looks like she's going to go there and really kind of have an embarrassing defeat. She doesn't think it's embarrassing. I think it goes to the fact that if you can't win in South Carolina, what other states can you win?",

Isn't that conversation happening about Trump versus Biden, whether she's in or not?BARRON-LOPEZ: Yeah, it is. I mean, voters I talked to are talking about those two candidates and Democrats are focused on President Biden, you know, not really anticipating any shake up there.

This brand-new reporting from CNN's MJ Lee is that Biden personally instructed his top campaign aides recently to spend even more time painting Trump is on the hinge and calling out his inflammatory rhetoric.Two Sources tell MJ that the thrust of Biden's instruction was to significantly ramp up the campaign's efforts to highlight the crazy 'S' that Trump says in public.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. You know, I think this reporting gives us some interesting insight into how the president himself personally views his campaign strategy. What I was told by sources is, as you said, President Biden instructing personally some of his top campaign aides to essentially be even more aggressive in highlighting some of Trump's most inflammatory and wild comments.You know, it's not a secret at all, obviously, that the Biden campaign believes it is critical to draw these black and white contrast between Biden and Trump as they see it when it comes to even their temperament, their worldviews, their policies. But as the Biden campaign makes this full pivot to the general election, it's clear that Biden himself believes that it is critical to paint the former president as being unhinged and simply unfit for office. And I think we've seen the Biden campaign and the president himself take those opportunities more aggressively in recent weeks. When it comes to -- for example, going after the former president's comments about NATO or going after his mocking of Nikki Haley's husband, who is currently serving abroad. And when I reached out to the campaign for comment for this story. This is a part of what the campaign's rapid response director said in a statement to us. He said Donald Trump is the polar opposite of everything President Biden stands for and has accomplished since he took office. And the campaign's top priority over the next nine months will be laying out that stark choice for voters. One bit of context, Dana, that I do think is important is that Biden campaign advisors have been concerned that so many voters seem to have sort of forgotten about some of the moments from the Trump presidency that they see as sort of outrageous and unacceptable. This is sort of the rose-colored glasses effect that they are concerned about, and they are determined to try to fix that heading into member by highlighting all of these examples.",
