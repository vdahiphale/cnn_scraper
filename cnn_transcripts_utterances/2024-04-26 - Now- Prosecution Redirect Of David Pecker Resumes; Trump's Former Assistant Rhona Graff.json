Former tabloid executive, David Pecker, is still on the stand for the redirect examination.And Pecker just reiterated that when it came to the Stormy Daniel story, he wasn't going to print it or be associated with it. Our panel is back with us now. And it looks like notes from the interview confirm that Pecker told the FBI that when he visited Trump Tower in January of 2017, Donald Trump thanked him for handling the doorman and McDougal stories. And I want to get back to what we heard moments ago, a name that has only come up sparingly, but that is at the center of this case, and that is Stormy Daniels. Why is it important in the redirect for the prosecution to ask David Pecker about him staying away from that story?",

Because they spent so much time setting up the two stories that he was willing to pay for and suppress the doorman who alleged -- falsely alleged affair out of wedlock, McDougal who alleged an affair.But then you get similarly -- a similar story, Stormy Daniels offering to sell her tale. And he said, I want nothing to do with that. And there were a lot of reasons for that. A big one was that he was not paid back for the $150,000 that he paid Karen McDougal. And this sort of brings us up to the beginning of the falsifying business records story. Because Stormy Daniels, her contact, they get passed off to Michael Cohen, who we now know facilitates this hush money payment that is at the center of this case. So that's why they're just revisiting exactly what his connection was to Stormy Daniels and the fact that he wanted nothing to do with that particular payment.",

And that was the more salacious -- those are the more salacious facts. And so that's what everyone focused on. But what the trial's doing is really refocusing everyone on what it's actually about, which is not just a hush money porn star case. This is about trying to influence an election and committing crimes in doing so.

But it also shows that what -- that Josh Steinglass thinks that the points that were scored on cross had to do with dates and little things, little inconsistencies from -- from what he told the FBI versus what he's saying on the stand.

      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN's special coverage of former President Trump's criminal hush money trial.I'd like to bring back my panel right now to discuss all the latest developments from inside the courtroom. And, Laura, let's talk about the defense now cross-examining, re- cross-examining David Pecker, the former publisher of the \"National Enquirer.\" I thought it was significant that he really didn't want to get into the whole Stormy Daniels issue. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: It is. It's one of those things -- well, first of all, in the Big Apple, how many bites at the apple will these prosecutors and defense get at this one witness. You normally think about a direct, a cross, maybe going back, the way that, yet again, which alerts the jury that there were some unfinished business. It can have two different effects. On the one hand, a jury could say, oh, something was really important here that they need to whittle down on. If they don't drill down, if they don't do so, I might miss something. The other thing would be, is this sloppy attorneys? I don't -- they were not able to do the first time well and correctly? But the important thing here in terms of why this is important, Stormy Daniels is the one case, it seems to be the one headline of all the \"National Enquirer\" headlines they didn't want to touch with a ten- foot pole. Think about the types of things they've published in the past. This was the case that was different. Why? Because they had already been burned not only with the discussion on Arnold Schwarzenegger and having him formally be the editor in chief of \"Fitness\" magazines, and then being some editor-at-large and those magazines and then having it discovered they had a catch-and-kill scheme, which was embarrassing to the organization. Then you've got the idea of not being repaid by -- on the issue of Karen McDougal, having a back-and-forth going on there. Then you've got the general counsel of AMI saying you don't do not want to be reimbursed by the Trump Organization or have that on your books. And then them saying, I want nothing to do with a porn star. This doesn't really, in many ways, comport for people that the salacious headlines would make this sort of headline, not what you wanted, except for this, Donald Trump would not be the beneficiary of a publication or a headline. Their relationship might take a hit and that's what they are trying to establish in this entire testimony.",
