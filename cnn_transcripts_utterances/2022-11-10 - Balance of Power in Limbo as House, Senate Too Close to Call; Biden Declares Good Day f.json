They counted some more mail vote in Clark County right here and in Washoe County right here. And that closed that lead down to 15,000. There's about 110,000 mail votes left to count --",

You saw Mark Kelly ahead by 89,000. But then there were votes released overnight from Maricopa County and Pima County down here, his lead grew to 95,000. Now, I'm going to tell you this, you are going to have to take my word for it, there's about 560,000 at least, 560,000 votes at least left to count largely from Maricopa County here and Pima County down here. Now, what these votes look like we're not sure. Two years ago, that vote, that batch was a little more Republican. So, Blake Masters has a chance here to close this gap and maybe overtake it. I did some math. If he manages to win 60 percent of the remaining vote -- if, that's a tall order but not impossible -- that would net him a total of 112,000 votes, okay, which is more than 95,000. So, his target is actually right around 58 percent. It's a high bar, not impossible. So, this race not over. And just to remind people, if Democrats take both these seats then the runoff in Georgia won't matter in terms of determining control, likewise for Republicans.

It alluded to the theory that if all else failed, I could alter the outcome election on January 6th. I showed my wife, Karen, and rolled my eyes. Keep in mind, on New Year's day, Trump called Pence about a lawsuit that had been filed by Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert aimed at forcing Pence to help overturn the election. Pence says that Trump told him, quote, I don't want to see Pence Opposes Gohmert Suit as a headline this morning. But Pence says he told Trump he did oppose it. Trump responded, quote, you're too honest. Hundreds of thousands are going to hate your guts. People are going to think you're stupid. Pence goes on to write that he challenged Trump's attorney, John Eastman two days before January 6th actually happened, saying Eastman didn't even believe his own advice he was giving Trump. Pence writes, quote, I turned to the president and said, Mr. President, did you hear that? Even your own lawyer doesn't think I have authority to return electoral votes. Then on the eve of the insurrection, Pence says, quote, I had a feeling January 6th, 2021 was going to be a very long day. Of course we all know what happened next, Pence was rushed to safety as rioters broke in looking for him personally. Pence told his Secret Service agents at the time, quote, I'm not leaving, I'm not giving those people the sight of a 16-car motorcade speeding away from the Capitol. Pence writes, quote, I heard footsteps and angry chanting, making our way to the basement of the Capitol, took a few extra minutes, because I insisted that we walk not run. As they were hiding from the rioters, an assistant to Pence showed him what Trump had tweeted right in the middle of the attack. Trump said, quote, Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done. Pence writes, he ignored the tweet and got back to work. Eight days later, Pence says he stopped by the Oval Office and that the night before Trump had, quote, unequivocally denounced the violence at the Capitol, Pence congratulated him on his address and Trump said, I knew you'd like it. Pence writes, he said he seemed discouraged, so I reminded him that I was praying for him. Trump's response, don't bother. Pence's book comes out on Tuesday. That's the same day Trump has promised to make an announcement at Mar-a-Lago teasing a presidential run. Pence is also scheduled to participate in a CNN town hall on Wednesday. So, joining us now, who better to discuss, Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. David Urban, you had a fascinating quote yesterday that I want to read about what happened.

There's no way to deny Donald Trump got fired Tuesday night. And the search committee has brought a few names to the top of the list and Ron DeSantis is one of them. I think Ron DeSantis is being rewarded for a new thought process with Republicans and that solid leadership. We watched that play out in Georgia. Brian Kemp beat the brakes off Stacey Abrams because he really got to put leadership on display through a pandemic and economic upheaval and whatnot. And in Georgia, I think we're going to watch this play out over the next four weeks. My advice, if anyone in the Herschel Walker wanted to listen would be to make three successful phone calls. One is to tell Donald Trump to stay out of Georgia for four weeks. He's toxic and he would do nothing to help the ticket. Secondly, I would pick up the phone and call Brian Kemp and ask him for his help and apologize for not endorsing him during the primary against David Perdue.

Now, that is 2.44 percent against his opponent, Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto. All this as we learned that there are tens of thousands of ballots that haven't been processed, they're not part of the results yet, just here in Clark County where I am, the most populous county home to Vegas.Don, I want to break down where these ballots are exactly and where they came from so that we get an idea of what we're talking about. This is according to the Clark County registrar. He says 12,700 mail ballots were picked up at the USPS on Wednesday alone. Those are beginning to be processed. There were 300 drop boxes on Election Day that were only picked up, they were not counted, they were only secured by police. They're working on those as well, Don. And then you have 5,396 ballots that need to be cured. Voters have until Monday to do that. And then there are 5,555 provisional ballots, that, of course, voters have to figure out the registration. That has to be settled out. So, when there is a race with a margin that is this razor thin, Don, you and I know that every single vote counts, and it's not just the U.S. Senate race here in the state of Nevada, it's also the governor's race. So, we're going to be here. We're going to follow everything to make sure that all of those votes are counted.",
