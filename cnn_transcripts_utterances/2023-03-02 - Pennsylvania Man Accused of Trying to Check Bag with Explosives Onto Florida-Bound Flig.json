According to the FBI, this is what they found -- they found powder that was in a plastic wrap. They found fuses. The powder appears to be from commercial grade fireworks. And so, the question is what was he doing with this?The airport tried to page him while he was still at the airport. He left, and he was later arrested, later that evening on Monday, by the FBI. Now, the court documents that were released today by the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia don't mention any indication of extremism or his ties to terrorist groups or anything like that. This is something that obviously the FBI was focused on over the last couple of days. Nothing like that appears to have occurred in this investigation. This is a very serious thing, obviously. If you read the court documents, the FBI says that this powder that was included in this compound was susceptible to ignite from heat and friction, and posed a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.

This includes hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets, the principal contractors include Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, two American companies that have previously been sanctioned by China for previous weapons sales to Taiwan.A couple hours ago, we heard reaction from the ministry of foreign affairs in Beijing, they slim to this deal, adding this, quote, stop arms sales to Taiwan and military contacts with United States, and stop creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits. China will continue to take firm and forceful measures to safeguard its sovereignty and its security interests. We also heard from Taiwan's ministry of defense earlier in the day. Of course, they welcomed this purchase, while adding this, quickly quote, the depression of defensive -- is the basis for preserving regional peace, unquote. Some key context for you, this is not the largest U.S. arms deal to Taiwan. That was -- that took place in September of last year, in a deal that surpassed $1.1 billion. The last U.S. arms deal to Taiwan took place in December of last year, the latest one announced on Wednesday, will certainly continue to drive a wedge between the U.S. and China.

We know, according to Ukrainian military, that Wagner is still deploying, they say, some of its best trained units in the city.For Russia, we know this untold resources into this battle, for a city which, by the way, was not even a city, a town really, population of around 70,000 before the war. Not even particularly strategically placed, but has become something of huge significance for both sides. Ukraine has said this, week, they believe the town is not encircled. They say they've fortify the west of the town, which even if Russia does take Bakhmut, should prevent them advancing to quickly further west. There's another wildcard, Christine, the weather here. The spring is starting at this moment in Ukraine, the ground that was frozen breaking up, and the mud that creates could potentially slow down Russian tanks as they try to advance.

There has been a real domestic outcry internally, and real concerns that this is about hard-liners, and young women and girls trying to scare them into giving up their fundamental and free rights to education. I think this really important to contextualize this for our audience, this comes against the backdrop of young women, school girls, taking to the streets, protesting the restrictive hijab and head covering rules for the last few months. So together, it is an incredibly worrying and toxic miasma for so many of these people, people who we were able to communicate with inside Iran said they were actually not allowed initially to seek treatment so while it may seem now on some level Iranian officials are publicly making some of the right statements, there is also a real concern that this could be Russian hard-liners themselves, and in this context, the proliferation of fierce and concerns and people are really worried Christine.",
