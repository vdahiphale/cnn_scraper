The furor, in Israel, over his controversial judicial overhaul, his relationship with President Trump, and much more. Plus, the bars of gold, the hidden stashes of cash, and the pressure now growing, for a top U.S. Senator, Bob Menendez, to resign, after being indicted, once again, on corruption charges. And a State Attorney General calls the fake Trump electors, she charged, \"Brainwashed.\" Did she undermine her own case? I'm Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening, I am in for Kaitlan Collins, who sat down, with Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, following his address, at the United Nations, today, and amid what could be a truly historic breakthrough, for his country. Netanyahu telling and showing the world, earlier, what a new Middle East could look like. He says Israel is on the quote, \"Cusp\" of a deal, with Saudi Arabia, that would not only normalize their relations, but encourage other Arab States, to do the same, and increase prospects of peace, with Palestinians. Netanyahu finally met, with President Biden, Wednesday, their first face-to-face meeting, since Netanyahu returned to Office. Biden had been keeping his distance, freezing the Israeli leader out, for nine months, over his government's highly controversial attempt, to overhaul Israel's democratic system, and reduce oversight of his government. Here's Kaitlan's one-on-one with Prime Minister Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He's joining a growing number of Menendez's Democratic lawmakers, from New Jersey, who are calling, on the Senator, to resign.

But legally speaking, I mean, the Supreme Court has made this a little more difficult, for federal prosecutors. We remember, the former Governor of Virginia, who was convicted, on corruption charges. I covered that trial, watched it go through, up to the Supreme Court. They overturned that conviction, where some of the facts were a little bit similar, right?

We've continued to see, as Alice said, we've continued to see Donald Trump extend his lead.I think, certainly for history, she's on the right side. Nothing she said I disagree with. But I think the problem that the Republican Party has, is that Donald Trump has an almost cult-like, a cult of personality style lock, on their voters. And they're not interested in hearing facts. I mean, they're -- most of his voters argue that he won the 2020 election, fair and square. So, they don't -- they have not yet shown that they're open, to this kind of argument, although I certainly applaud Nikki Haley for making it. And I think that history will look kindly on her, for calling it out.",

Head-to-head Donald Trump versus Joe Biden, actually Biden is doing better, in this one. He's up 52, and Trump's at 40. But Trump is the best of the GOP candidates, in New Hampshire.And people, in New Hampshire, are pretty set in their ways. But as we get closer, to the first-in-the-nation primary, they're still window- shopping. They're still looking. They're still going to make up their mind. And more people are going to go out, into New Hampshire, do that retail politics and change minds.

So, you see, of course, people are willing to write in, and they're essentially desperate to say, \"I will not support anybody but Donald Trump.\"But remember, he also engenders that kind of energy, going the other way. He fires up the Democratic base. He's also really off-putting to a lot of Independents, who may genuinely be deciding how they're going to vote, this election. So, I think, to me, that's actually the most interesting thing about this is it just is such a reminder that he energizes voters, in a way nobody else does.",
