Families were just enjoying their Saturday when the scene at the kids' fountain turned into chaos. A mother and her eight-year-old son are both in critical condition. Authorities say the shooting appears to be random. Well, police found the 42-year-old male suspect at a nearby home, dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The star-studded fundraiser here at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles raised at least $28 million, which the campaign is touting as the largest Democratic fundraiser in history.President Biden appeared on stage with his former boss, former President Barack Obama, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, and they all three tried to warn of the stakes in this election, each painting former President Donald Trump as a direct threat to democracy. Now, President -- former President Obama talked about how Trump does not embody the values of this country, including pointing to his recent conviction in that criminal hush money trial in New York. Obama made the argument to voters, young voters and also conservative- leaning voters, that they need to look at the accomplishments of what President Biden has done while he is in office. Now, the president was also joined at this fundraiser by some other major stars, including George Clooney and Julia Roberts, Jack Black, Jason Bateman, among the many who were here. The Biden campaign really trying to use this fundraiser as another way to tap into that celebrity star power to try to engage voters. They raised money for this fundraiser through tickets ranging from $250 to $500,000. There were also small donor grassroots contests for people to travel here to Los Angeles to meet the two presidents and George Clooney and Julia Roberts. It all comes as President Biden is trying to maintain the cash advantage that he currently has over former President Trump in the campaign. Now, Trump has made significant gains, potentially narrowing the money gap in recent months. The Biden campaign is hoping that a big event like this will further drum up support, bring in more money for their campaign, in what is expected to be a very expensive race heading into November.

The Israeli military has made it clear they will continue in other areas. But, interestingly, this announcement seems to have taken many people by surprise.

And she brought this question up with the deputy leader of the Taliban at the time in 2022 and asked him about girls' rights. Here's what he had to say.SIRAJUDDIN HAQQANI, ACTING INTERIOR MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN (through translator): What I am saying is that the international community is raising the issue of women's rights a lot. Here in Afghanistan, there are Islamic, national, cultural and traditional principles. Within the limit of those principles, we are working to provide them with opportunities to work. And that is our goal.",

There is no solid basis for that at all. Islam actually encourages education for all children, for everybody. And in Islam, it is your responsibility to get education. I don't know what sort of system, what sort of ideology they're talking about, but -- but the culture that, you know, I come from and the religion that I know, it encourages education. And I think the Taliban need to -- we also -- like, at this point, I would say we need more Muslim leaders and more Muslim countries to step forward and actually challenge the Taliban to say that, in Islam, there is no justification for a ban on girls' education and for preventing women from work in the Islamic context.",

There are two big, hot wars in Ukraine and in Gaza there.And I know that you have recently announced a new graduate program and scholarship for Palestinians at Oxford University.

More than 80% of the schools have been damaged. Almost all universities have been bombed in this bombing by Israel.So, when I think about any war, any crisis in the world, I think about children. These wars take away their dreams, their future. I want girls to be in a classroom. I want children to be studying, to be dreaming about their future, to be playing outside on their streets. War and conflicts and oppression takes all of that away from children. We are seeing that happening in Afghanistan. We are seeing these things happening in Sudan. And in Gaza, this has to stop. And, again, I want our leaders to think about the children, to think about humanity, and to take a brave step towards peace.

Oilers fans hoping their team will be the next to do it.Have you ever seen fans so hyped with their team down 0-3? Edmonton had only scored four goals in this series against Florida, but they go off, doubling that total with eight of them last night. Their two-time MVP, Connor McDavid, finally scoring for the first time this series. Seven different Oilers score. McDavid notching three assists. This one to Dylan Holloway, who puts it in the top shelf. McDavid now with 32 assists this postseason. He surpasses the great one, Wayne Gretzky, for the most in a single postseason. Edmonton wins 8-1. Moving day at the U.S. Open, and Bryson DeChambeau was just getting warmed up. Literally, 11th hole, BDC will BRB. He laid down and stretched in the woods with his physio for a stiff back. Well, it was just what the doctor ordered. He birdied on his way to one of the best rounds of the day, enjoying the moment. The 2020 champ is 7-under, three strokes clear of the field. He lost his dad a year and a half ago, and he said he'll be thinking of him on every hole in today's final round, hoping to win his second major on Father's Day. Now, another great day of sport is ahead of us, especially with the Euros. The Netherlands taking on a Poland side without their legendary striker, Robert Lewandowski. Slovenia facing Denmark. And then, of course, the finale Sunday, England against Serbia. After reaching the 2018 World Cup semis, then finishing runners-up at the last Euros, Captain Harry Kane says the three Lions are ready to make the next step. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Unfortunately, the joy didn't last long. Italy scoring two goals in the next 15 minutes to win 2-1 with Nicolo Barella scoring the game winner for the Azzurri.
