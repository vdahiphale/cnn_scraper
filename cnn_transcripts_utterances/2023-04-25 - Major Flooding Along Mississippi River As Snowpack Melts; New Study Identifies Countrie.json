You can see here the rising water creeping up against homes and businesses in Wabasha, Minnesota.That's about 90 miles southwest of Indianapolis. And in Iowa the water level is rising so rapidly in some areas the governor there issuing a disaster proclamation for at least ten counties. Let's take you now live to the CNN Weather Center with meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, this is flooding because of snow melting, and it is going to be very, very widespread across the floodplain.",

I mean, we're not talking about the record flooding we had in Fargo years ago where, I mean, we were up to the second floor, downtown. That's not happening. But this is low land farmland and even into the lower river towns they are now getting flooded.Flood warnings all the way from Minneapolis almost all the way down now even into St. Louis. So, let's get to it. This is where we are at this point. We are seeing the rain come down in some spots, and we are seeing some water rise in others. Everywhere you see a purple spot that is where the river is in major flood stage. And it's still rising in some spots and going down in others. The farther you get to the north, it's starting to go down. Red River of the north actually goes the other direction. It goes into Canada where the water you see here that's now all these big numbers here. Major river stages here across parts of the Mississippi River now back even into 400 miles long of that flash flooding. And it's river flooding so it's not coming up really quickly, but people just see -- they can stand in their yards and they go, here it comes. And then two days later it's a little bit closer and a little bit closer and a little bit closer. And we are still seeing the snow melt. There was a lot of snow up here. Now if you were just to the south of this white line, that's what's going to drain back into the Mississippi. If you're north over here, that's going to go into Lake Superior. And then up here, the Red River of the North is going to take that up into Canada, flooding in all those places. Here is where the radar starts to be -- the river gauge is now beginning to show that the water still going up in places but beginning to come down in others. What the Minnesota governor just talked about is what we don't want now is rain. There's some scattered rain, one inch or so, but so far so good. Don't melt that any faster with the rain and don't make it go up any faster as the water runs off -- Boris.",

If you remember it's summer of 2021 of in western Canada, Lytton, British Columbia, this very temperate moderately zoned little town saw temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius, 121 degrees Fahrenheit for several days. The whole town burned down as a result of that. That was considered a statistically implausible record event there -- that temperature.And so, these scientists looked at 60 years of data, they looked at projections and laid out this map here that shows where this could possibly happen again. What places are most vulnerable to being caught by surprise by some devastating heat wave like this that just shatters records? The reddest spots are -- you see in Central America. That could have a real impact on migration in North America. We've seen that historically. Parts of Germany are bright red. Afghanistan given their vulnerabilities after years of war make them vulnerable. Beijing, China, is in a high risk area. 250 million people living there. But even in places where there's not anyone living like in Siberia up on the east coast of Canada there, that's a methane bomb. If the heat wave melts the permafrost there that means more misery for everybody in heating up the planet. But this is an interesting look at the most vulnerable spots.",

So, heat waves that wouldn't have happened in a century could happen in less time than that. And so, they are calling for leaders out there to prepare accordingly. You kind of have to prepare for a heat emergency you can't even imagine in some temperate zones. That means cooling centers, that means thinking about maximum work hours. And some of these temperatures we're seeing more and more of the human body can't tolerate them for more than an hour at a time.So, this has an effect on both the economy, on human health, on agriculture and just on overall preparation. Heat is the number one killer. It's the sort of the invisible one that doesn't make for great pictures and dramatic pictures on TV, but definitely preys on the most vulnerable among us.",

She is the other half of Russia's deputy minister of defense, Timur Ivanov, one of the most senior architects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And, according to a shocking investigation, Maniovich continues to gallivant around France more than a year into Russia's bloody war, despite the fact that Ivanov was sanctioned by the E.U. in October. The explosive report, put out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an investigative outfit founded by Russia's jailed opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, is based they say on a leaked archive of more than 8,000 of Maniovich's emails over the last 12 years and has racked up more than six million views on YouTube. It claims that on March 25, 2022, as dozens of missiles rained down on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the Place Vendome.",

They haven't -- they haven't split any assets. Nothing has changed in terms of like, you know, daily life. Whatever they owned, they keep owning together, but technically, they're not legally married anymore. WARD (voice-over): Equally shocking are the opulent lifestyle and lavish spending that the leaked emails document. According to Russian business publication \"RBC,\" Ivanov's official income was once declared to be around 14.2 million rubles a year, less than $175,000. Yet, the Navalny group's report calculated that the couple spent more than a quarter of a million dollars in just one summer. CNN has not been able to independently verify those numbers.",

And what's interesting is though you have Republicans in control of the legislature there you are seeing some division among the Attorney General in particular who's pushing through this law that would really restrict access for some of the gender affirming care for our viewers.A sense of what that includes, that includes puberty blockers, hormone therapies and gender surgeries requiring years of evidence to submit that you are actually going through gender dysphoria and 15 hours of consecutive therapy over 18 months before receiving any of that care. Now, the Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft says that's a bit too far because this law would ban it applying it to both children and adults. And the Secretary of State says going after adults is a bit too far. But perhaps legally, morally he may agree with this law, but he says legally he doesn't think it will get very far.",
