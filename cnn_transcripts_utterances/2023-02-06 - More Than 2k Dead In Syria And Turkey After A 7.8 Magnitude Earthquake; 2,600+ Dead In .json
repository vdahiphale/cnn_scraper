This was supposed to be floating above at 60,000 feet, not right in a forensics lab being pulled apart and picked apart and analyzed by the U.S. Intelligence community. Except, that's exactly what's going to happen. We just had a briefing a short time ago with General Glen VanHerck; the commander of Northern Command and NORAD, and he said there were significant efforts undertaken while the balloon was over the United States to prevent any of the Chinese surveillance attempts as this was going on. Instead, they had an opportunity to learn what this was capable of, what sort of technology he had, and VanHerck said that this was valuable time spent. It was worth the time in waiting to shoot it down. Now, instead of looking at this at a distance, you get an up-close look at it depending, of course, on the conditions of the wreckage. It fell from 60,000 feet, so 11 or 12 miles high before it crashed into the ocean. So we're waiting for an update on, frankly, how many pieces of this they need to collect, and how much of it isn't good enough condition to really be analyzed. But that's the focus now in terms of finding all the debris, raising whatever sunk to the bottom in about 50 feet of water to pull that up and start to analyze it, and then pick this apart and see what can be pulled from it. There's a rare opportunity to get an up-close look at Chinese technology, and that gives you insight into what their intent was, what they were hoping to learn, and what the future plans on something like this might be in terms of where else they might try to deploy these.

But essentially, the Israeli military decided that it was worth it to be able to fly more safely into Adana and then drive into the different places. And actually, what the Israeli military does is they send a small plane with a smaller team to first do a situation assessment. That was sent in the early afternoon hours. So they've already been on the ground, I'm looking at the time for about, I would say, three hours or so. It's only about a two-hour flight from here to the hardest hit area. So, they were sent to first figure out where they need to be, who needs to go where and then that bigger plane of more are coming through. And the other aid groups that I'm talking to, I -- they will likely be sending essentially charter flights. So they will likely be going through those airports that are not damaged, that they can still get to steal land at and then be essentially driving to where they need to be. In terms of the assistance to Syria, it is very unlikely that Israeli teams will actually be on the ground there for political and diplomatic reasons.

The commander of Ukraine's land forces say they will prevail against Russian forces saying the landscape and natural defenses turned the city into a \"unwinnable fortress.\" NATO is brushing up on its military response skills with its annual winter exercise in Estonia. Nic Robertson saw them in action and joins me now live from Estonia. And Nic, we've been hearing about these Leopard 2 tanks for weeks now, if not months, and we understand that the Ukrainian forces are today learning or beginning to use the Leopard 2 tanks. You've seen them in action. Tell us what you saw.",

So there's a huge amount of at stake this year and the tanks, as we saw, are very, very key part of it. But the speed to get them there, that's huge. And I think realistically, even though the training times are longer in countries that are not at war, I think we're going to see the Ukrainians really shorten those training times so that they can try to get back that territory this year.
