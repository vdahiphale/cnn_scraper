We begin in New Delhi, where world leaders -- leaders of the world's biggest economies, rather -- will gather for the annual G-20 summit this weekend.Among them is U.S. President Joe Biden, who plans to pitch the United States and the World Bank as an alternative to China for investment and funding. Also en route is Rishi Sunak. Downing Street described his visit as historic: the first British prime minister of Indian heritage to visit the country. And just like last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin won't be attending. Apparently, his schedule is too busy. Most see his absence, though, as an attempt to avoid international scrutiny, or even possible arrest for his war in Ukraine, one of the biggest issues looming over the summit. China's president, Xi Jinping's, last-minute decision to not go caused some surprise. When asked why, Beijing's foreign minister just declined to answer. For India's foreign minister, though, Xi's no-show is what it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR, INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: I think at different points of time in G-20, there have been some presidential prime ministers who, for whatever reason, have chosen not to come themselves. But, you know, that country and that country's position is obviously reflected by whoever is the representative on that occasion. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I doubt there will be, especially on issues like Ukraine or climate change. There is a call, like there's always been, for the phasing down of fossil fuel usage, as well as increasing renewable energy and sourcing it. But that is going to be a key concern. You heard the G-20 shapers meeting over the last two days to actually finalize the primary details over the joint statement. Will there be one is the question at this point. Because over Ukraine, of course, there are deep divisions between the countries present over the next two days here in India. You have the delegations coming in, but the divide has never been starker, according to experts. So even though, for climate change, there will be divisions, there will be criticism, there will be arguments. And that's what the G-20 shapers are trying -- are trying to iron out. And have been trying to iron out over the last 48 hours. Climate change being extremely, extremely crucial to this G-20 summit. High on the agenda, sustainable development, as well, as well as talks on global debt. So those three will be high on the agenda. And Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be trying to steer clear of any controversies, any deep divisions overseas or deep divisions over Ukraine. And he will want to focus on these three key aspects, as he has mentioned in his interviews here in India, along with talking about the global South. Back to you.",

But what could be a loss for the summit could be a gain for Narendra Modi and the Indian government, because then that really helps in focusing on key other issues. We don't know why the Chinese leader isn't coming at this point, but according to experts, it could also be a message that the Chinese leader is sending out to the G-20 summit, to India, to Biden that he'd rather be a part of the anti-West blocks then be a part of the G-20 summit. He'd rather be a part of BRICS. He'd rather be a part of the SCO, than be present tomorrow and the day after at the G-20 summit, sitting across the table with Joe Biden, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the other leaders who will be converging over the next few days here in New Delhi.",

For civilians in Ukraine, meanwhile, the war is all too familiar. A Russian drone attack in the Odessa region killed one on Wednesday as Russians targeted agriculture infrastructure and port facilities for the fourth day in a row.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's an operation that has brought 150 rescuers from across the globe to here, the Morca Sinkhole, Turkey's third deepest cave, to help evacuate a caver who fell ill on a research expedition. Forty-year-old U.S. National Mark Dickey is an experienced caver and instructor at the National Cave Rescue Commission. These photos, posted on his Facebook page just last month.
