That, I remind people, started under Donald Trump and has gotten significantly worse under Joe Biden. So the communities that I represented -- I had 820 miles of the border. It took 10 1/2 hours to drive across my district at 80 miles an hour, which was the speed limit in most of the district. These communities have been dealing with this before COVID. They were hit by COVID. And now they're having thousands of people that they have to take care of before they find places to go in the interior of the country. So I don't know how a bus is different from a flight. What we need to be talking about is how California can say hey, here is the capacity we can have. You know, bring this many people.

The Greek Coast Guard pulling a group of people to safety -- the lucky ones -- survivors of yet another catastrophe on the deadliest migrant crossing in the world, the Mediterranean. Somehow, 104 people managed to leave this overcrowded fishing boat alive, but hundreds that you see here did not. Most still missing in the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea just 50 miles off the Greek coast. On shore, medics rush to preserve the lives of those that survived -- their bodies in trauma after hours in the water. All are men. Aid workers tell me others were unable to get out.",
