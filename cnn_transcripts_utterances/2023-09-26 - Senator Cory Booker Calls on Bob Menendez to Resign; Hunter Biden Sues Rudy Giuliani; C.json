He just boarded Air Force One. And CNN learned the union will gift the president there -- you can see the president leaving on Air Force One. We learned that the union will give the president a red UAW pullover when he walks with them. The UAW has yet to officially endorse Biden's reelection bid, and Donald Trump will be speaking in Michigan to autoworkers tomorrow night, instead of attending the Republican debate.

Now, the White House has still not said exactly where the presidentwill be. But he will be here in Wayne County walking a picket line marking the first time a sitting president has done so. We expect that he will be joined by the by the UAW president, Shawn Fain, who had extended an invitation to Biden. But it comes at a time as the UAW has so far withheld from endorsing President Biden in this election, even as some other labor groups have. But the president's mission here on the ground in Michigan is really trying to shore up support among working-class voters. And there will be a remarkable split screen that takes place over the course of the next 24 hours, and not -- as not just Biden is here today. But former President Donald Trump will also be in the Detroit area to talk to union workers, instead of attending that GOP primary debate. It comes at a time where both men are trying to take their pitch to working-class voters. And in a state like Michigan, that's incredibly important. If you take a look at the last election, Biden won voters from union households here with 62 percent of the vote compared to former President Donald Trump. So, this is a constituency that both sides are trying to court heading into the 2024 election. But throughout these negotiations, the White House has walked a very fine line, trying to balance the rights of workers with also concerns about what a strike could potentially mean for economic conditions. Now, the president has said he fully supports these striking workers. He believes that auto companies should be sharing record profits with these workers. But the White House so far has stayed away from weighing in on the specific demands that the UAW is making. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He is standing with the workers. We are not involved in negotiations. That is something for them to decide what is going to work for the parties that are involved. But he is standing with the autoworkers. That's what the president is doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Biden being the labor -- fashions himself as the labor president, felt like he needed to go there.And, for sure, this has to do with the fact that he needs the union support in order to be reelected. Let's remember he did win people -- the union-supporting or union-identified households, but Trump has been able to siphon off some of that support. So this is definitely a place where he needs to shore that up. But you have to say, this is -- while he does have this long record with unions, the union members that our reporters spoke to in Mansfield, Massachusetts, noted that this push for electric vehicles is something that has really made them very nervous, and they're afraid to be left behind.

Now, in this lawsuit, they do not concede that the laptop belongs to Hunter Biden, but they do admit that some of the data on that laptop belonged to him. Rob Costello is said to have received the data from this laptop after it was left at a Delaware repair shop, and especially ahead of the last election, Giuliani helped him publicize that. Now, Hunter's lawyers call this, as you just quoted, a total annihilation of Hunter's digital privacy, but this is all part of a much more aggressive strategy that Hunter and his attorneys have adopted since earlier this year. But when they first decided to punch back at his detractors, to become more litigious, it looked like the long-running criminal investigation to the president's son was dying down and it would likely resolve with a plea deal. But we now know that plea deal has fallen apart. Hunter Biden now faces a criminal case in Delaware, but it does not appear that he is backing off of this strategy. One lawyer on Hunter's team told me earlier today -- quote -- \"Everyone involved in stealing and manipulating Hunter's data should be hearing footsteps right about now.\" Of course, this lawsuit comes as Giuliani also facing criminal charges in Fulton County, Georgia, and facing millions of dollars in legal debt, including over a million dollars that he owes to Rob Costello, someone who's worked with him for years representing him in cases and working alongside him and trying to publicize this data from Hunter Biden.
