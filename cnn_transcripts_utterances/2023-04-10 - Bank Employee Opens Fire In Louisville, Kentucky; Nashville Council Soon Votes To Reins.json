Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez turned heads over the weekend when she called on the FDA to ignore the judge's ruling. She told that to Dana Bash of suspending the use of the drug. But now, Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who calls herself pro-life, although she's trying to find, I guess, some sort of middle ground where people can agree on this issue, she says she agrees with AOC and she has some strong criticism for her fellow Republicans. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): I agree with ignoring it. This is an issue that Republicans have been largely on the wrong side of. We have over the last nine months not shown compassion towards women. And this is one of those issues that I've tried to lead on as someone who's pro- life and just have some common sense. In the state of South Carolina, just a few weeks ago, we had some folks in the state legislature that essentially wanted to execute women who had abortions. (END VIDEO CLIP) AYESHA RASCOE, HOST, NPR'S WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY: I mean, you know, it's a huge deal to have Nancy Mace say this. But let's set aside because there are two issues here. Should you ignore court ruling, I think is like, you know, in a democracy, I think if you start ignoring court rulings that you don't like, that could have some very serious consequences. But then let's focus on the abortion issue, which is an issue where Nancy Mace was saying, look, we are on the wrong side of this with the public. We keep losing, Republicans keep losing because we are going against something that is really health care. When you look at the, you know, the mifepristone, that is not just for abortions, that's for people who have miscarriages. And if people who get pregnant, they have miscarriages and then they need medical help. You're telling them they won't be able to get medical help. So she is saying, look, we are shooting ourselves in the foot, we have to step back from this. That's what she's saying.",
