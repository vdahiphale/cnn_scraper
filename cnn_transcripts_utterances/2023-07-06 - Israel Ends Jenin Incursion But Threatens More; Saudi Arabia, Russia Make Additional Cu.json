Damage to the camp, meantime, devastating, with dozens of homes destroyed. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us from Jerusalem.

The morning after Israel's military withdrew, thousands filled the streets to bury the dead. The Israeli military says that all 12 killed in its incursion were combatants and that its operation aimed to dismantle terror networks here. But this father says he is proud his 19-year-old is what he calls a martyr and was a fighter for one of the Palestinian armed factions killed in the incursion.",

In the aftermath, the camp's residents were left without running water, electricity, or basic services, and families returned to destroyed homes.

And a country that -- like Libya, which is usually pretty fragile when it comes to its oil production -- they've been on a pretty good streak of late with not having many disruptions. So oil markets, right now, seem to be pretty well-supplied. SOLOMON:  So help me understand the thinking from Saudi Arabia and Russia in terms of the export cuts. What's the thinking there?",

And the government just said they were going to buy three million barrels and just release an RFP for another three million for sometime in October.So they are refilling the SPR albeit slowly. But that should set a floor for the market probably in the upper 60s to low 70s.

But having attended that news conference and seeing that the support for the official statement was unanimous, it seems like all things were good, right?
