I mean it's -- I don't think that most of Donald Trump's GOP rivals are looking at this thinking, yes, this is how I would handle classified documents. They're looking at the base and saying, the base is firmly with Trump. I can't defeat Trump if I don't run to the right of Trump. And so this rallying cry about, you know, the deep state or whatever has -- it's - it's resonant with a core of that base. And that's what they're concerned to walk away from.So, I think part of it is that and part of it is how Donald Trump conducts himself. If anyone sees an opening, if they think that -- if they see a strategic reason to pursue it, yes, but there's two different lanes. There is the DeSantis lane and there's the -- the Chris Christie lane. And I don't see Ron DeSantis changing his views about tackling, you know, the FBI or the Justice Department. That's already baked into the narrative of his campaign also. So, I think there's two different lanes of candidates here.",
