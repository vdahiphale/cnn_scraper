Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell promising to address those comments on Tuesday during his regularly scheduled press conference. His number two in the Senate John Thune saying that he couldn't disagree more with former President Donald Trump's comments. Also, Senator Mitt Romney saying similar things, and were getting tweets from Senators Lisa Murkowski, Mike Rounds, really speaking out forcefully against those comments. That's one side of the Senate GOP. Others in the Senate GOP like Senator Roger Marshall, he said that he hadn't seen it. When I pressed back on him and told him what those comments were, he said that maybe they'd been taken out of context, that we the media should be talking about something else. Other Senators like Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott -- of course both from South Carolina -- refused to answer any questions about it at all. We did hear of course, from former Vice President Mike Pence who really said that this was not -- he did not support this, that of course you must support the Constitution if you are going to run for and hold public office. One person that we have notably not heard from so far is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He has stayed very silent on all of this. The there's a sweet from several weeks ago in which he promised to read the entire Constitution on the floor of the House when Republicans take over during the next Congress.

We know that the Indonesian Parliament that made these sweeping changes to its criminal code which critics fear could harm democratic freedoms and police morality in the world's third-largest democracy.Offenses that will be criminalized, you know, include sex outside of marriage as you mentioned. This law won't just apply to Indonesian citizens but foreigners living in the country as well as tourists found guilty could face a year in prison. Other jailable offenses under this new penal code, co-habitation among unmarried and LGBTQ couples, blasphemy, apostasy, as well as criticizing the president, the government or other state institutions. Now human rights groups are very, very concerned about the direction that Indonesia is heading. They say it's because of this rise in ultra-conservative Islam in the nation's politics as it adopts what they say are a sharia inspired laws. And they fear minority groups will be targeted, tourism groups. They say that these laws are troublesome and counterproductive especially on the tourist island of Bali that as we know, heavily relies on Western tourists for its economy. Now, as I said, we don't know how this will be enforced but we heard from the justice minister earlier today. He said there will be intensive outreach to police, prosecutors, lawyers and advocates. So, it would certainly indicate they want to move ahead. This law, however, will not come into place until three years' time -- Max and Bianca.",
