And we begin with new details about that passenger jet that crashed in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day, killing at least 38 people. Authorities recovering a second black box, hoping it will provide more answers about exactly what led to that fatal disaster. Earlier this week, a U.S. official telling CNN early indications suggest a Russian anti- aircraft system may have downed the plane, adding that it may have been a case of mistaken identity in which poorly trained Russian units have fired negligently against Ukraine's use of drones. But officials in the region are urging not to speculate about the crash until investigators have wrapped up. CNN's Bianna Golodryga has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (voice-over):  As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan airlines plane crash, early indications suggest that a Russian anti- aircraft system may be responsible, a U.S. official told CNN. The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said. Video from on board the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's federal air transport agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. ILHAM ALIYEV, AZERBAIJAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan.",

So again, it's a -- it's a sitting molding pie -- a melting pot without an answer unless we have clear -- clearly defined objectives. What's our plan?

But The Hague has prosecuted, or at least passed sentences against several Russian irregulars for that shootdown. So it looks like it's happening again.And Congressman Zinke also represents part of the Republican Party shared by incoming national security advisor, Mike Waltz, and also, Marco Rubio, who has been nominated to be secretary of state, who are very hawkish on Russia and think that Russia needs to be reined in, pulled back, taught a lesson, and they're going to point to something like this as showing Russia's out of control, but they'll be fighting other parts of the party who will also be vying for Donald Trump's ear, who believe that Russia has been menaced by NATO and is within its rights to carry out these kind of activities to protect places like Grozny, which was apparently undergoing a Ukrainian drone attack at the time that the Azeri flight was turned away from landing.",

Or it could simply blame it on Ukrainian actors somehow saying that they somehow caused the shootdown, or it could deny it altogether.Russia has a seat on one of the main investigation -- investigation bodies into the crash. So, you know, they can put a finger on the scale and raise enough doubt. That's what they did with the Malaysian Flight 17, never claiming responsibility for it, but putting out so many different versions of what could have happened that it simply left the public confused, with no blame to cast anywhere in particular, except for western countries that are already in the anti- Russian camp.",
