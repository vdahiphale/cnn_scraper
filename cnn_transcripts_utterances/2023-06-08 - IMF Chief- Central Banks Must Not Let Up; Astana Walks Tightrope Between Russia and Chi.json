It is bene up most of the -- well, all of the session chipped by a bit of read at the beginning, and we are up 183 points. An hour left to go. Those are the markets and the main news that we're following. The Eurozone is officially in recession and the IMF chief tells me central bankers must hold their nerve to beat inflation. President Zelenskyy surveys damage after the dam collapse. On this program, you'll hear the head of the EBRD saying they will help rebuild. And Kazakhstan at a crossroads, caught between China and Russia, the dragon and the bear. Live from Astana in Kazakhstan where it is already Friday morning, just Friday morning, after one o'clock. For most of you, it is still Thursday, June the 8th. I'm Richard Quest, and you better believe it in Kazakhstan, I mean business. Good evening. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight live from Astana, the capital. And believe me, there's many debates whether it's Astana, Astana, Astana. We will probably say all of them before we're finished tonight, there seems to be no disagreement. We're all here, because global leaders have been arriving here in the Kazakh capital for the Astana International Forum. It used to be the Economic Forum, and then the President widened the brief, and it is now the Astana International Forum. And you're going to hear from some of the people who are on -- the guests: The IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva. She will be talking to us. The head of the EBRD, Odile Renaud-Basso. You will have the former EU Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso. He is head of Gavi, and of course, an international analyst of great repute, and Kazakhstan's deputy foreign minister will be here to talk about strategic in neutrality, if such exists. Tonight, though, we begin with economic news and hearing Kazakhstan, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva has said Central Banks must not and cannot relax, despite the cooling headline, inflation number, the underlying embedded call whatever you want to call it, inflation number is not moving down fast enough. The Eurozone today was announced to be in mild recession. There are now two negative quarters of GDP. It is the smallest you can imagine, but I suppose if technically -- well, you've got to be technical on some things, and that would appear to be a recession. The IMF head says that Central Bank governors must hold their nerve and on the question of higher rates for longer, the overarching question, what happens next? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I don't think -- I mean, the dam per se, the reparation will come soon because it is -- I mean, it is in occupied territories and so forth, but at least helping the hydropower energy company in order to see how they can compensate or take some measures for -- I mean, exceptional measures, emergency measures, we are doing that.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice over): High in the Altai Mountains and across the Kazakhstan, the country of Kazakhstan extends thousands of kilometers. This former Soviet state is the largest landlocked country in the world. Its capital, Astana was previously known as Nursultan, named after the former president who led the country for decades. QUEST (on camera): It was after the fall of the Soviet Union when Kazakhstan became an independent country, and the then President Nazarbayev decided, Astana should become the country capital, a vast project of construction rapidly began. QUEST (voice over): Its grand buildings and unique architecture reflect his vision for the country. He is said to have designed the Baiterek Monument on a napkin, while on a plane. QUEST (on camera): All of this was paid for, with the proceeds of oil and gas revenues. Kazakhstan is one of the largest producers in the world. And yet, even that has created difficulties. Kazakhstan is vast and landlocked. On one side is China, the other side, Russia. The supply lines are very tricky. QUEST (voice over): Kazakhstan's global impact is not just from its underground resources. It's also in outer space. The country is home to the Baikonur spaceport operated by Russia, the facility launched the first human into orbit, and it is now the busiest spaceport in the world.

According to the police, the male suspect, seen here, is a Syrian asylum seeker. He's been taken into custody, shortly after the stabbings. His motive is not known. Clashes broke out after Israeli forces staged a rare raid into the West Bank town of Ramallah. Israel says the operation targeted and blew up the home of a man accused of bombings in Jerusalem. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least six people were wounded, including a journalist. The fires are in eastern Canada. The smoke and the smog have drifted down to the southern border. And it is now blanketing large parts of the northeast United States, including major cities such as Washington, D.C., that you can see here. Washington today is among the worst hit with smoke drifting off to the south in the west. President Biden was with Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, at a joint press conference.
