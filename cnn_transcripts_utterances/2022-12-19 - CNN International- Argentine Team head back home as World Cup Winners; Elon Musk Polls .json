Elon Musk gave Twitter users a chance to weigh in on this future the social media company but he may not like the result.But Tesla and SpaceX founder tweeted this Should I stepped down as the Head of Twitter? The Answer, Yes, more than 17 million votes were cast and 57 percent of respondents want him to step down. So far, his short tenure has been filled with chaos and controversy.

And you know, that policy created its own wave of backlash, culminating in Sunday's decision by Twitter to revert that policy or pull it back and modify it and this incredible poll by Elon Musk suggesting that perhaps he should step down as CEO, which as we know now this morning has ended with most users voting in the affirmative. We'll have to see whether, you know Elon decides to take the plunge and step down and if so, when? All of that is still very much in the air.",

Severe weather in the Gulf of Thailand is hampering efforts to find and rescue 31 sailors missing. After Royal Thai Navy warship sank early on Monday.Thai authorities say strong winds tilted the ship and sea water rushed into the vessel through an exhaust pipe that shut down the electrical system leaving the crew unable to maneuver or pump the sea water out. According that is to the Thai Navy 75 crew members have been rescued. At last report three sailors were in critical condition. Winter officially sets in this week and Ukraine says Russian attacks of course more critical damage to the energy infrastructure in Kyiv. Ukraine says Moscow launched 35 drones on Sunday night, 23 of them towards the capitol where Kyiv says most were shot down, 2 people were reportedly injured. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Belarusian capitol for talks with President Alexander Lukashenko. The Kremlin says this will be a working visit but the chip is raising concerns that Belarus could join the fight in neighboring Ukraine. Clare Sebastian, following all the latest developments joins us from London with more. What do we expect to come out of this meeting then? Is there any sort of suggestion there may be an announcement of some kind?",

But this is you know, just something that comes with a bit of ceremony, the greeting there that if we can show it again. Body language said it all he was met personally by President Lukashenko flowers is all kinds of pleasantries, even a hug. This is the first time that President Putin has visited Belarus in more than three years and it's not just him. He comes with his Foreign Minister, who has already arrived. According to Belarusian state media, the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, is also in Belarus. So this is a bit of a show of force. It also comes amid some increase in military activity; Belarus announced snap drills last week. There are also pictures out this morning via state media from the Russian Defense Ministry showing Russian forces that joined a sort of grouping a battalion in conjunction with Belarusian forces, they are doing training in Belarus today. Those pictures came out this morning. So all of that fueling concerns among Ukrainian officials, that Russia could potentially be preparing for a new offensive could be using Belarus potentially as a staging ground as they did at the beginning of this conflict. But we don't have any concrete evidence as yet. That is happening as having said that they President Zelenskyy did say on Sunday, that they are prepared for any kind of defensive scenario on that Northern border, Max.",

This is a country that right now is in the middle of a deep financial crisis. There is inflation spiking up over 90 percent and the last few years so with a pandemic, there has been really a serious gloom.

I mean, if Messi left in year 2000, when Argentina was again, in a very deep financial trouble because Barcelona made an offer to him and his family to give him a growth hormone therapy when he was 13, because they saw the potential to have what he could have become in terms of a football player, but he needed these help. The club that he was playing for here in Rosario in Argentina was not able to pay for that treatment because the whole country was pretty much bankrupt.It ended up bailing out the following year. So for years, the idea of an Argentinian kid who learns to play football in Europe and of course, it's a very different style of football. The ones that he's played in Europe compared to the ones that he's played here and conquering so much in Europe but never delivering for Argentina caused some fraction. All of that was swept away yesterday he went into third World cup and just making you know, comparing himself gave into the level of the grade Diego Armando Maradona, I think Max.",

That's yes, because of the longevity of his career, the records that Lionel Messi has broken and how he does? What he does producing those moments of magic that makes?Children like we've got behind us here trying to recreate those moments in playgrounds in their garden, at school on the playing fields that regardless of how that final finished. He would absolutely still end his career as the greatest, you know, perhaps, in terms of other Argentinians. You know, the only other person to have superseded him in up to this point was Diego Maradona because of the way he led Argentina to that success in 1986. But what we saw last night with those goals, the way he very much led from the front, produced performed under pressure and took that team with him. This was a young group of players who yes, wanted to win for Messi, but Messi wanted to win for him. And there was really a feeling that in the last couple of years, he has embraced his role as the Senior Member of the team walking out of the tunnel ahead of these young stars, leading them on to an off the team Buster and the training pitch much like watching the Mighty Ducks. You can argue it backwards and forwards but from how he's performed in this tournament on this stage and now finally adding that one piece of silverware that was missing from his career.

The government has been using this information as evidence to suppress the rest and in many cases prosecute them. CNN's Katie Polglase has this exclusive report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice over): Moody, reflective like many teenagers Nika Shahkarami considered her Instagram page, a safe space for self-expression, but her death on September 20, during protests in Iran, turned her into an icon and her Instagram page into a blank slate, which disabled it and why became yet another mystery surrounding what happened to her. CNN previously revealed evidence suggesting Nika was detained at the protests shortly after this video was filmed, but the Iranian authorities have always denied any involvement in her disappearance or death. Now CNN can exclusively reveal that Meta, Instagram's parent company investigated Nika's account after she disappeared, concluding they themselves were not involved in disabling it. In other words, it was either Nika herself or crucially, someone with access to her account that took it down. And as recent reporting by the intercept revealed Iran's highly sophisticated system for phone hacking, it raises the question of whether social media platforms can keep accounts secure. When protests erupted in Iran, Nika began using Instagram as a diary for her activism, but this online activity may have ended up working against her. After Nika's death, Ukrainian states began publishing evidence like this CCTV footage, attempting to clear the state of any involvement in her death. First, they said she was pushed from this building, and then she fell from it. Next do they reference suicidal messages in documents extracted from Nika's mobile and Instagram conversations? It was an open acknowledgement they were accessing her phone and her social media accounts, but she's not alone. As flames engulfed the notorious Evin Prison in mid-October, inside was Negin. She was accused of sharing activist posters like these on Telegram, the encrypted social media platform. We've changed her name for her safety. Her words are read by an actor.",
