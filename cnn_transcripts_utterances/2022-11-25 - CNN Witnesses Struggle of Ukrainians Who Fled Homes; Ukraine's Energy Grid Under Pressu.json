More power plants are slowly coming back online, but Ukrainians say the process is taking a while because of the sheer scale of Russian strikes on Ukraine's electricity system.On Wednesday, the attacks left a vast majority of the country in the dark, and for the first time in decades, temporarily took all of Ukraine's nuclear power plants off-line. Have a look at these satellite images. They show you how much the Russian attacks are hurting Ukraine's power supply. The image on the left, well, that's January, and you can see the lights are on all over the country. The one on the right, well, that's this month, most of Ukraine in the dark. In Kyiv, doctors had to perform a heart surgery by flashlight after their hospital lost power halfway through the procedure.

The Tottenham Hotspurs star Richarlison scored two of them on his World Cup debut, the second of which was a beauty. That is a contender for goal of the tournament. In comparison, Serbia barely got a look-in, as Brazil won their opening game 2-nil. Elsewhere in Group G, Switzerland beat Cameroon by a slender 1-nil margin. And it was again with mixed emotions for the man who scored the winner, Breel Embolo. He was born in Cameroon, and he left the country as a child. That is why he didn't celebrate. The stories of the night arguably belong to Portugal's legendary Cristiano Ronaldo, who was emotional during the anthem, and who then made history with the penalty against Ghana. That made him the first man to score in five different World Cups. Ghana made it difficult, though. Andre Ayew scored Africa's first goal of the tournament, before Portugal effectively settled it with two goals in as many minutes. The young star Joao Felix will certainly remember his first World Cup goal. And Rafael Leao then quickly made it 3-1. But Ghana pulled a goal back, and they could have drawn the game, when Portugal's goalie was asleep at the wheel. Every Portuguese fan breathed a sigh of relief when he got away with it. Most of all, Ronaldo himself. The other Group H game, between Uruguay and South Korea, finished in a goalless draw. But there was late drama here, too.

Not the tourists in the food chain, but you see where we're going. Patrick Oppmann takes us underwater for the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Usually, they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean, but sharks are the reason why we have come here to the waters off Eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba, perhaps, one of only a handful in the world, where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world, but the ones we see seem mostly curious, swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guy Lazaro (ph) says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks, and to protect them. \"The shark is the perfect machine, the perfect predator,\" he says. \"It's inspiring, emotional, and satisfying to interact with them.\" Marine biologists say robust shark populations are necessary to maintain healthy coral reefs. In 2015, Cuba placed restrictions on shark fishing, one of an increasing number of countries in the Caribbean to realize that sharks are not only important to the environment but a way to attract visitors.",
