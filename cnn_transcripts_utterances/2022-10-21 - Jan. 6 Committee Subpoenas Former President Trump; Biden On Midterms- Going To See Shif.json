He now has until November 4th to turn over slew of documents requested by the January 6 Committee.And while the subpoena was expected, it is the Committee's most aggressive step yet could result in an epic legal battle, which frankly, is also anticipated. The panel is asking for phone calls, text, videos from the former president relating to the attack on the U.S. Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",

And they're putting this subpoena against the backdrop of everything that the House Select Committee has found so far in their sprawling investigation, hundreds of witness interviews, thousands of documents collected, and they do believe, based on all of the evidence that they have collected the testimony that they have taken, that Donald Trump was at the center of a multi-part effort that they explained was pressuring different parts of the government, members of Congress, the court system also riling up Trump supporters asking for help from Justice Department officials, all of it comes together around Trump.And this committee does believe that there are only answers that Donald Trump can provide to them, information that only Trump may be willing to give. The other thing that they're doing with the subpoena is they're setting this against the backdrop of history. They're testing Trump, as a former president, that office holder really do what people in the past have also done. They say former presidents go whole way back to John Quincy Adams up to Gerald Ford have sat for testimony with committees. They also mentioned that Abraham Lincoln as a sitting president testified to Congress and so they really are testing Trump here, putting it on the line and seeing what he does to respond in just a few weeks.",

We are going to have to wait and see exactly what happens over these coming weeks. He has a couple of options.He could fight this in court. He could sue. He could try to claim executive privilege, presidential privilege, confidentiality around himself and with a lot of conversations with his advisers and lawyers. He also, of course, could just run out the clock. There is an election coming up, the Congress will expire or he always has the option to testify. At the same time, the House Select Committee has some options of their own and that's including whether or not they want to look to the court system in the way that they did with Steve Bannon, with Peter Navarro and with some others and potentially asked the Justice Department to prosecute Donald Trump, if he refuses to comply, but we'll have to see how that plays out.",

Does he want to subject himself to a deposition to questioning under deposition by the Committee? That's what the Committee requests in the subpoena? Does he want to try to negotiate some sort of middle ground with the Committee? Or third, does he just want to defy the Committee outright?If he defies the Committee and it seems like he might, given his prior statements, then the Committee is going to have two options here. One is they can go to a court, into a federal court and seek an order from a judge forcing Donald Trump to testify. The problem, though, as Katelyn said, is that takes many, many months. That's more time than the Committee has. The second option that the Committee will have is if Donald Trump defies the subpoena is to hold him in contempt and then send the case over to DOJ for potential prosecution like we've seen with Steve Bannon. We don't know whether DOJ would charge that case. DOJ has received four referrals so far from the Committee. They've only charged two of them, Bannon and Peter Navarro, they declined to charge the other two. So those are the two legal avenues available to the Committee if Donald Trump defies the subpoena.",

If the Committee votes to hold Donald Trump in contempt, as long as they get that vote done before January 3rd 2023, when the next Congress takes over, then that referral goes over to DOJ and it will be in Merrick Garland's House to make a decision.Garland so far, he's two for four. He's received four referrals. He's charged two of them criminally. He's charged Steve Bannon, who of course was sentenced earlier today. And Peter Navarro who goes to trial next month, but he has chosen not to charge Mark Meadows. He's chosen not to charge Dan Scavino. I think part of the calculation of DOJ, if you ask why these two, but not those two, is the strength of any potential executive privilege argument. And also, I think it seems Garland was looking at, did these people make some good faith effort to negotiate to engage or did they just sort of flagrantly defy the subpoenas. So Donald Trump's legal team may be thinking about those factors, do we want to at least make a show of trying to negotiate because that could make it less likely that DOJ chooses to charge?",

They've allowed this to play out over well more than a year. They tried the nice route, they negotiated, they got some of the documents back, not all of them. They tried to subpoena like we just saw. This is a grand jury subpoena saying give us everything. Again, they got some more documents back, but not all. They did the search in August and they got what they believed was all the documents, they could have gotten at Mar-A-Lago. But if they believe there are other documents out there and if this reporting is correct that some of the documents they've already recovered go to the most classified information about Iran and China, then it's a great question. What are they waiting for? Why are they playing nice? You need to go get those documents for the reason that Josh just laid out.",

Here I'm not confident that that would play out well. And let's remember, DOJ ultimately, really is in the advantageous position here.DOJ is the ones who have the ability to go back to a federal judge, say, we need another search warrant. And if they can make that showing to a federal judge, then they don't have to be politely escorted around. They don't have to politely be told you can look here, but you can't look there. So DOJ really holds the power here. If I was back at DOJ and I was given this offer, we'll walk you around Mar-A-Lago and show you where you can look, I wouldn't be all that interested in it.

They were down for almost a hundred days. They started to pop back up again for about a month. Over the course of the last several weeks, last week, in particular, they've started to drop again, the sense that that might continue leading right into the midterm elections has created at least some sense of positivity here in the White House and it appears that maybe what the President was basing that prediction on earlier today, guys.",
