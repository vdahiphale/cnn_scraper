And a 24 hour long military offensive ends with Azerbaijan having total control for the first time in decades of an independent enclave, home to more than a hundred thousand ethnic Armenians. Hello everyone, thank you for joining us, we'll have those stories in a moment.But first the very latest from Ukraine with new Russian strikes on multiple Ukrainian cities. In the northeast, Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv are warning residents to stay in shelters due to heavy Russian shelling. No word on casualties, and officials are still assessing the extent of the damage. And earlier Thursday, air raid sirens sounded in the capital of Kyiv with the Reuters News Agency reporting the sound of explosions a short time ago. Officials say the city's air defense system intercepted a number of Russian airstrikes with reports of debris falling over central Kyiv and elsewhere. More on that story as details come in. But now, the latest strikes come amid a dramatic downward spiral in relations between Ukraine, and one of its biggest supporters in NATO, that would be Poland. What began as a dispute over Ukrainian grain import has quickly escalated in recent days with Poland's prime minister announcing late Wednesday, an end to supplying weapons to Ukraine, and a focus instead on arming its own defense forces. Poland and four other neighboring countries issued a ban on Ukrainian grain imports after farmers complained over a slump in prices caused by the increased grain supply. France has sided with Ukraine, and called the move unjustified. And the European Council President Charles Michel, says EU support for Ukraine remains steadfast. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A position supported by most Republican presidential hopefuls. The US president, though, has promised Ukrainians they won't face Russia alone and he's called for global unity to end the war.A White House official tells CNN a significant new aid package for Ukraine, including artillery, anti armor rounds, and air defense capabilities will be announced Thursday during a visit by the Ukrainian president. Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his case for more support in person at the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday, and he called out the elephant in the room, a deadlocked Security Council since the world began because Russia is a permanent member with Veto power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In cases of mass atrocities against human rights, Veto power should be voluntarily suspended. But we can also observe that Russia will not give up this stolen privilege voluntarily. Therefore, the UN General Assembly should be given a real power to overcome the Veto. This will be the first necessary step. It is impossible to stop the war, because all efforts are Vetoed by the aggressor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Americans are divided based on party. 71 percent of Republicans do not support continuing to send aid to Ukraine.About 62 percent of Democrats want to continue to support Ukraine. So there's very much a divide. And again the divide is the result of what different people think about how the US should be spending its money. Republicans increasingly think we should be spending on the United States. America first. Why should we be sending our money to a country that's far away?

Just seven months into the job, a dramatic fall. In June, he disappeared. In July, he was dismissed. The foreign ministry in Beijing refusing to address reporting by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" saying they are \"not aware\" of claims Qin was ousted for an extramarital affair during his stint as China's U.S. ambassador in Washington.

Speculation swirling over another apparent disappearance. China's defense minister, Li Shangfu, last seen in late August, more than three weeks ago. Back in June, he briefly shook hands but refused to meet with U.S. defense minister [SIC] Lloyd Austin in Singapore. Now, Li is \"under investigation,\" Reuters said last week. A government probe reportedly over the purchase of military equipment. Last month, a surprise shake-up in the People's Liberation Army rocket force. Two leaders suddenly replaced without explanation. Beijing notoriously nebulous when it comes to bad-behaving senior leaders. This latest scandal involving the defense minister setting China's heavily-censored social media on fire. From the foreign ministry -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I'm not aware of the situation. RIPLEY (voice-over): A familiar response. No answers but plenty of questions about instability at the top, and the potential danger it brings. JONES: But I do think there's more to it. Xi Jinping, he would not take these measures against such high-level military and diplomatic figures unless he felt some kind of genuine risk.",

They were handpicked by the president himself.And their removal from such visible positions so abruptly, it raises questions in the international community about the stability of the Chinese system. And you know, Chinese leaders have long said that their stability makes their system superior to democracies. President Xi, however, might be sending a message to the world that, no matter who he has put by his side, if they fall out of favor, no one is indispensable. No one is irreplaceable under his one-man rule. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
