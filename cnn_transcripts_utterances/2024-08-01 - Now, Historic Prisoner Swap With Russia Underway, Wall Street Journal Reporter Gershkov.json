These are live images right now on your screen. This is the airport in Ankara, Turkey, the capital of Turkey, where Turkish intelligence tells us they are coordinating an extensive prisoner swap. Now, here's what we know about it thus far. We understand from sources that the exchange includes the two best known Americans held in Russia. Those are the Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, who was detained more than 15 months ago and recently sentenced to a prison of 16 years, convicted of espionage last month, and also reportedly the Marine veteran, Paul Whelan, who has been held the longest, more than five and a half years in a penal colony in Russia. The U.S. has denounced the espionage convictions of both Whelan and Gershkovich and called their trials shams. CNN crews are in place around the world working their sources to bring you all the latest details as this is unfolding as we speak. We show you an airport tarmac because these last minute, last moment, last second, exchanges could be happening. Let's go to Alex Marquardt first in Washington. Alex, the historical significance of this day can't be understated. As far as I know, a lot of the reporting coming in, this could be the biggest exchange of prisoners between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War.",

And as you say, the scenes of a movie, when you remember those scenes of someone walking across a bridge, and until that very last instant, right, when that exchange happens, you don't know if it will. And these are these final fraught moments that we're in. Let's bring in CNN Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance. Matthew, as we're looking at the tarmac in Ankara where we understand the Turkish intelligence could be coordinating this, multi-countries, there, of course, has been the reporting over time that perhaps even part of the reason that Vladimir Putin wanted the arrest of Evan Gershkovich, a U.S. reporter doing his job in Moscow, was all a part of a long term ploy to get back that assassin that Alex Marquardt was just talking about. I mean, the machinations on this have been going on for a long time.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they have. I mean, look, these negotiations have been going on for months. They've been very painful. They've been very delicate. In fact, there have been talks between United States and Russia going on for several years to try and sort of find ways in which, you know, people connected with the United States with the west could be exchanged in a prisoner swap, just like this one.And I think you're right. This idea that Vladimir Putin, and this is what his critics accuse him of, is, you know, of gathering sort of bargaining chips, collecting people like Evan Gershkovich, who was accused of espionage and convicted of espionage, but categorically denied having anything to do with espionage. Paul Whelan as well, that former Marine who spent the best part of the past six years behind bars in Russia, he was accused of spying as well, and he was just there attending a wedding of a friend in Moscow when he was detained. And so, look, all of these people, critics suggest, have been gathered by Vladimir Putin so that he could use them as bargaining chips when the right opportunity arose. And it seems that's exactly what's happened. There's been some suggestion that this deal is an indication that Vladimir Putin is open for negotiations, that it's a softening of his position, perhaps. Well, I mean, that may very well be the case. Let's hope it is. But it's also, I think, a sign that his strategy of gathering those bargaining chips in exchange and using them to exchange for compromises from the United States from the west, that has also been successful as well. So, we're talking about 16 people. These are unconfirmed figures. 16 people from from the U.S. Side. Sorry, from the Russian side being exchanged from eight from the U.S. side, from the western side, if you like. And so, you know, that those are the sort of numbers that we're looking at. But there's been a moral compromise on a moral decision that had to be made, ethically as well.",

But, of course, these are individual lives who have been completely gutted and destroyed. One of them responding to me just with a heart, when the possibility arose that maybe their loved one, who they never thought they would see again, could come home.

And I think I could describe it this way best, Erin. They are elated. They're full of anticipation after months and, in some cases, years, of course, of pain, but also false starts, times when they thought they might -- their loved ones might be released or might be part of some other deal, and they were not.But with a heavy dose of nervousness, their feeling is they will feel truly comfortable, truly relieved when they see with their own eyes that their loved ones are safe, and that could be imminent as we watch those planes on the tarmac in Ankara, in Germany. But as you know, Erin, this has been a painful spell for these families. I will say, I could hear the excitement. I could hear the excitement in their voices this morning as they awaited this news.",

      "sentences": "It's such a good point. It really does boil down to personal communications that U.S. officials are having with folks in other countries, because, as we have been talking about, this has been a global effort that the U.S., the Biden administration has led here. And the reason for that, just to remind folks, is that the United States doesn't have anyone, has not had anyone in its custody that is the caliber of person that Russia was looking for in terms of a prisoner swap.We have heard U.S. officials say that because Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich were both charged with espionage, the Russian side has wanted Russian spies in exchange for them, and the U.S. simply has not had those folks in their custody as of recently. And so they have had to go to those other countries, engage in diplomatic conversations, look at Russians that they have in their custody and say, would you be willing to work with us on a potential prisoner swap that we are expecting to see come to fruition in some version today? I think we've also been trying to read the tea leaves here, Erin. We haven't heard much from the Biden administration in terms of assessments of how Russia has responded to proposals that they have put on the table recently. It was late last year that we know that the Biden administration put a serious -- they deemed it a serious proposal on the table with Russia that was rejected by Russia. But since then, more than eight months later, we haven't heard much. And now it's becoming clear that the reason that we haven't heard a whole lot is because there has been a tremendous amount of activity behind the scenes on this. And, of course, U.S. officials don't want those kinds of efforts to get out publicly because it could actually undercut their efforts. One of the things that we watched, however, in the last few weeks recently was Evan Gershkovich's trial in Russia concluded quite quickly, and that was significant. The reason being of, as I said, he was charged with espionage. And typically for trials involving charges of espionage in the Russian system, it can go on for months, potentially leading up to a year. But because his trial came to fruition, quite quickly, U.S. officials were somewhat hopeful, that that was a signal that Russia was moving towards some sort of an agreement on a prisoner swap because they have always said that there needs to be a conviction before they can move to an actual agreement on a deal. So, those are some of the tea leaves that we have been reading. But as we watch this all come together, we'll have to watch and see what the ups and downs of the last eight to ten months really looks like.",

I mean, it is really stunning to see where we are.Nic Robertson, our international diplomatic editor, Nic, let me just ask you. Looking through, when you see these prisoner swaps, the U.S. saying who do they have that Putin would want, putting aside whether people think these things should happen this way or not. I mean, you've got hackers, Russian hackers in U.S. prison, one currently serving 27 years, the biggest ever sentenced for cybercrime, a guy that they say is the person who actually is responsible for the entire credit card fraud industry. There are people like that in U.S. prison who may be a part of this deal. But the question is, Nic, what's in this for Putin right now?",

I have spoken to him about a dozen times over the course of his detainment there in Russia, and he has described the conditions there as being deplorable. He has described working in a factory that he equates to a sweatshop.But he also has expressed increasing optimism about the prospects for getting him home in the past couple calls. He has said he is confident in the work that the U.S. had been doing to secure his release, particularly after he was left behind in the swaps that freed both Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed. And, of course, we are seeing the fruits of that happening today, and now as he is heading back to the United States. Now, Erin, we spoke just a couple weeks ago, right after Evan Gershkovich was sentenced and convicted to 16 years in a maximum security penal colony. This is the same sentence that Whelan himself received back in June of 2020. And he said he could really relate to what Evan was going through in that day in that courtroom. Take a listen to what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I was just thinking that if you look at who is being exchanged, and we still don't know every single name, but you look at the people whom Putin's government or regime has held, these are journalists, human rights people who've been held for a very long time.Now, who are being returned to Russia? Assassins, money launderers, cybercrime people. And this, to me, is an illustration of how Russia actually works in the world right now. Vladimir Putin believes that he is at war with the west, and the tools that he's using right now are tools meant to undermine, cybercrime, money laundering, that type of thing, not to mention targeted assassination, and there are more and more of those. So, in the long run, I think that's maybe not the main part of this, but I think it's significant just exactly who is being released. And I have to say, Americans are watching, and they should, the Americans who are being released, but you also have to think of the Russians who are outside of Russia, the opposition people who are being, we think, released, people like Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a renowned historian and very well known in Russia. These are people who are really important for the Russia of the future, I would argue, as well.",
