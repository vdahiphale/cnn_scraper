This latest incident all started with a distress call from a commercial cargo ship in the region.CNN's Katie Bo Lillis has this reporting for us. What more are you hearing about this, Katie Bo?",

An attempted hijacking. The U.S. jumps in to help, and then missiles fired from the Houthis in Yemen. This a sideshow, Spider, or is this the type of thing we could see more in the coming days? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think we're going to see more of this, John. Clearly, it's like the gloves are off because of the outrage, the international global outrage when they look at what's taking place in Gaza, irrespective of what the IDF is trying to achieve with Hamas. This is now become a discussion about the brutal handling of the greater Palestinian issue. So, Iran has gone back to its proxies, the Houthis being one of those, and saying, fair game. Do what you need to do. You've got our support. You certainly have our backing. Iran does not pull the trigger, does not authorize each one of these engagements, but certainly the boundaries between what's appropriate and what's not appropriate, in their perspective, is wide open now, and that's what you're seeing.",

It's going to take a little bit of time. Plus what we've seen is the pause releases hostages, it would not be unsurprising that we should expect that there will be additional pauses so more hostages can be released in drips and drabs. We're talking about over 200. So, when you get 10, you get 15. It's a glorious day for those individuals and those families, but the IDF loses its momentum.This becomes a very difficult challenge for the IDF. And what we're seeing, John, is this is a shift in their center of gravity from Israel destroying Hamas to center of gravity being, let's get the recovery and return of the hostages, which means the destruction of Hamas is put on the back burner. This now -- we're now talking about - we're not talking about months in terms of trying to destroy -- Israel trying to destroy Hamas, we're now talking potentially years.",

The Israelis are now digging in because they are now transitioning to a defensive posture. And that you have to adjust from. If you go from defense, you now have to, eventually after the pause, go back to the offensive operation. That is going to take time. Hamas is improving its position.Israel, the challenge is, Israel had some targetable intelligence that it gathered as a result of the operations. That intelligence now atrophies because they haven't been able to use it and Hamas has been able to alter the landscape.",

We'll see.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:46:02] BOLDUAN: This morning Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is making clear he is forging ahead and preparing to bring a national security package to the Senate floor as soon as next week. Despite the fact that this emergency funding has been stuck in limbo now for weeks, suck over fights about how much and under what conditions lawmakers now believe the United States should be sending more aid to Israel and Ukraine specifically. Despite the inter and intra party divisions over this funding, Schumer offered this warning in his letter to senators. \"Senators should be prepared to stay in Washington until we finish our work,\" which basically means, get ready, it could be a long haul. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill for us. She's tracking all of this. So, Lauren, it's -- this is complicated. It's within parties. It's between parties. Where are the sticking points?",

      "sentences": "Yes, there are several sticking points, Kate, which is why this has not passed up until this point. And Schumer is giving a warning and reminding members that they aren't going home for Christmas until they deal with the issue of the supplemental. And, obviously, nothing motivates lawmakers like that holiday deadline. People want to go home and be with their families.But one of the key sticking points is the fact that while Biden included immigration funding, funding for the southern border in this supplemental package, Republicans are arguing that that's not enough. They want to see concrete policy changes to immigration. Now, this is a problem because for the last decade or more you have seen lawmakers in Washington vexed by this question of how to deal with the southern border. And basically the argument from Democrats is, how are we supposed to solve this in a matter of weeks when we haven't been able to solve it for years? Now, there is a small bipartisan group of senators working to find some common ground, some policy changes that could be included to get this supplemental across the finish line. But one of the key issues is that whatever the Senate, and only if the Senate can agree on some kind of compromise, will it be enough for hard line Freedom Caucus members in the House, especially given the fact that you have a new speaker, Mike Johnson, who may be hesitant to put anything on the floor that could again anger his right flank after he put forward that short-term spending package that included, you know, no additional changes to policy. So, I think that those are some of the key sticking points right now. And while, you know, the Biden administration is impressing upon members of Congress that this money is important, there's also the issue of the fact that a lot of Republicans in the House don't really want to support any Ukraine funding moving forward. It's another question. If Mike Johnson puts that on the floor, does that put him once again in a bad political spot with his right flank? So, Kate, a lot of questions right now about how leadership handles this, how lawmakers and rank and file handles this. And, obviously, a lot of questions about whether this gets across the finish line before Christmas. Kate.",

Musk here on the ground, describing this visit as, quote, \"jarring,\" saying that he found the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been happening around the world \"troubling.\"CNN's Elliott Gotkine is tracking this visit by Elon Musk to Israel. And, Elliott, I mean I just think it's notable, in and of itself, that he's here given the controversy that has been surrounding Elon Musk.
