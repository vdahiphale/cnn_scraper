This is January 5, 2021, one day before the Capitol attack.Now, CNN has not independently verified this claim. In the speech, Santos falsely claimed that the 2020 congressional election was stolen from him. Now, you say this is not - you know, it's more than just a stolen scarf. This is bigger than that. Did he take other things and why are you saying this is bigger than just a scarf? MOREY-PARKER: Well, it just bothers me. I mean he is one of a, you know, highest elected officials in the country. You know, he is responsible for, you know, making the laws. And, yes, I mean, I do miss my stone check Burberry scarf, but, at the same time, it's why I feel like they're not focusing enough on the issues at hand.

So, it's not exactly the same thing. The commendation and the scholarship are not the same thing.
