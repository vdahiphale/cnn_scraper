New reports just filed with the Federal Election Commission revealed Kamala Harris' campaign has been bringing in lots of cash; in fact, more than four times as much as Donald Trump.Harris raised a whopping $190 million in August, while Trump only brought in $44.5 million. Harris has been on the trail in key battleground states all week. And later today, Trump will hold a campaign rally in North Carolina, an important target for both parties. However, sources say the state's embattled Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, has not been invited to attend. So far Republicans are standing by Robinson after CNN's KFile investigation into his online activity was released. Hours later, inflammatory posts on a porn website message board were removed. It's unclear who removed the comments. But Democrats are using the offensive posts as political ammo against both Robinson and Trump. CNN's Dianne Gallagher has more.

Trump is the head of MAGA and he endorsed Robinson in the primary. So the two are invariably linked. But it's not just that Trump endorsed Robinson. Trump's praised him effusively. He called him Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids, said that he's like Martin Luther King times two. And this isn't Robinson's first brush with scandal. He has a history of making inflammatory remarks. Candidate quality matters. Even in a mostly red state, candidate quality matters. I'm not sure if Robinson is such a drag on Trump that it causes him to lose North Carolina. The state hasn't voted, as you noted, for a Democrat for president since 2008.

I mean, one of the best ways to get a sense of who's winning, who is losing in the polls, is just to aggregate all of these polls. I mean, certainly doesn't make sense to simply single out one and say, oh, this means that Trump is winning or this means that Harris is winning. But if we aggregate the polls, look the averages, it tends to be the case that we get a little bit more accuracy. But again, it's hard to know which polls to include, which polls to exclude, based on their methodologies. And even with that, we've seen in previous years that those can be wrong.

Private Travis King was given credit for good behavior and time served. King pled guilty in a court martial to charges of desertion, assault and disobeying a superior officer. As part of a plea deal, nine other charges were dismissed. Army officials say in July of 2023, King willfully crossed into North Korea after being released from a detention facility in South Korea.

The 46-year old was convicted of shooting convenience store clerk Irene Graves to death 25 years ago during a robbery. The execution came despite a last-minute sworn plea from his robbery co-defendant, saying Owens wasn't even there at the scene. South Carolina's supreme court said that claim conflicted with what a witness had repeatedly testified to before. The court also noted Owens had previously confessed to five people, including two law enforcement officers and his girlfriend.

Even stranger than that was the message that came with it, which said, we received a Tesla Cybertruck from the respected Elon Musk. Kadyrov also said he was sending the Cybertruck to the front line of Russia's war in Ukraine. Musk then responded in very Musk language to deny the gift, saying it was ridiculous to think he would donate a Cybertruck to a Russian general. That, you might think, would be the end of it. But it's not. Kadyrov has now posted to Telegram accusing Elon Musk of remotely deactivating his truck in a long post, which ends, it's not manly. The iron horse had to be towed. How come, Elon? Is this how it is done? No response yet from Tesla or Musk. In the meantime, Kadyrov doesn't appear to be put off. In a new video that looks and sounds like a B movie blockbuster trailer, Kadyrov says he is sending two new Cybertrucks to the war in Ukraine.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced $11 billion will be given to member nations hit by the, quote, \"heartbreaking\" floods caused by storm Boris. Scientists using ice-breaking ships and underwater robots have found that the Thwaites Glacier, aka the Doomsday Glacier, is melting much faster than previously thought and its collapse may be inevitable. Its ice loss is set to speed up the century and melting of the glacier in Antarctica which is the size of Florida, would lead to about 10 feet or three meters of sea level rise with devastating effects for humanity. They say the outlook is grim and the whole of Thwaites and the Antarctic ice sheet could be gone by the 23rd century.

For decades, it has been devouring mountains of coal in Minnesota and belching out gigatons of planet cooking gases, making this power plant the state's biggest climate polluter. But in a vivid example of energy transition, Sherco's owners are changing its diet, swapping out coal for renewables, until the last fire goes out in 2030.
