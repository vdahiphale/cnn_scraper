People -- I mean, literally, we were all tracking the numbers. Hundreds people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed. In large part all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis.When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3 percent. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices in particular for groceries are still too high. The American people know it, I know it, which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price-gouging. What we need to do to extend the Child Tax Credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first- time home buyers. So they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home which is part of the American dream and their aspiration.

Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, never happened. We did it.So now, and I -- as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I've met -- I was in Nevada recently, a grandmother who showed me her receipts, and before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, she was playing hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin.

That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed.

My values have not changed. So that is the reality of it. And four years of being Vice President, I'll tell you one of the aspects, to your point, is traveling the country extensively.

I'll give Scott the opportunity to do it in a second. But as she spoke, I thought it showed a certain character, the way she talked about Joe Biden. She didn't run away from him.

I don't think there's a policy separation that they've created with Biden. Obviously, she gave a kind of personal defense of him. But they're also very clearly trying to position her as a change candidate, in the same way that Donald Trump is positioning himself as a change candidate.

She is making it clear that she will embrace, and be a continuation of Biden's economic policy, his record, what they've done. She didn't offer -- she offered no remorse, no regrets, no introspection about anything they've done. She continued to blame inflation on this fantasy price gouging idea. She had no additional thoughts, on the economic situation, in the country, or what they've done beyond just saying, Joe Biden and I have done a great job. Now, if I were the Trump people, I would be salivating over the idea that that's how they are going to run the race. I don't believe it's tenable. I also thought it was interesting that she didn't take any responsibility, at the end, for telling the American people that Joe Biden was fine, and he was strong. When we all know that's not true. That's why he's out of the race. And she's still standing by the idea that he was fine, and he's strong, and then he's fine today. Nobody believes that. And I just think, at some point, I just--",
