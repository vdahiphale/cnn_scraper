And as the search and rescue teams here understand it, they believe that there are more than 15 people still in the rubble beneath this building.If you just looking to the building on the left-hand side, you can see the extent of the building as it stood just some 40 hours ago before that earthquake at 4:30 in the morning on Monday, and they are now just turning that generator down. So, I am going to stand out of the shot, because they are going to call for quiet. It sounds as if they may now be once again hoping for an extraction. We will wait for -- they have kept the generator on, which means that they have not asked for silence as of yet. They have heard the voices, Jim, of three people during the period of time that we have been here. So, they are hoping that they will be able to extract people alive still from here. There is hope. It has been, what, 40 hours now. It is bitterly cold. It is just about minus one here at present and it was bitterly cold here at 4:00 in morning on Monday when this earthquake struck. But there are pockets beneath this building where people could still be alive. Over the years, when we have been reported on this, it's become clear that people do survive if they are warm and if they have got water, they can survive for as many as 13 days. But, obviously, search and rescue becomes a recovery situation the longer that things go on. And we have been talking to people who are gathered here and people just behind me here with their blankets on, and this group of people over here from this building. We have just been talking to a gentleman whose mom and dad live in this building. He was in tears. He is just hoping that his mom and dad may survive this. But, yes, it is a desperate situation here in Gaziantep, which is (INAUDIBLE), which is to the west of Gaziantep, apologies, just watching the van behind me, as people really just hope for some good news at this point.

He is going to talk about all of those, Jim, because those accomplishments, those laws will be game-changing. The fact of the matter is that a lot of them have not implemented, so Americans aren't feeling it. But they will start feeling it now.And so he is going to talk about it tonight. The cabinet is going to fan out across the country tomorrow, and they are not going to stop talking about everything that they have been able to accomplish with the American people moving forward. And the other I would say is, we were talking about this a little bit earlier, this is a president who has lived underestimated every single time he sets out to do something. This is where this man I think thrives, right? Every single time that he has put forth a plan, an agenda, has run for office, people say he can't do it, he is not popular enough, they don't like him enough, he's not effective enough, and every single time he doesn't just get it done, but he surpasses people's the expectation. I think that's what's going to happen tonight. I think that's what's going to happen in the next two years. And the contrast with Kevin McCarthy in the back, I think, is going to remind people what Kevin McCarthy had to go through to get there, striking a corrupt bargain, who knows how many deals he had to break with the MAGA extremists in his party, and that's is going to be a big contrast with the massive accomplishments of the last Democratic Congress.

The rhetoric coming out of the elections was, the Republican Party is dead. And it's because of extreme candidates and extreme MAGA, if you want to say that, fine.But now we're at the reality. Democrats had the victory rallies after they lost the House, but we are going to see Kevin McCarthy as Republican speaker. That's the reality now. It means the Biden legislative agenda is over, essentially, as far as getting things through on Capitol Hill. So, he has got pressure points of things like the debt ceiling. He can talk about what he's done and there are accomplishments that he can tout, but politics is very much about Janet Jackson. What have you done for me lately?

You just said it. If nothing gets done, that's a huge comparison.And it's not going not going to be a good comparison for Republicans because what are they going to run on? We investigated Hunter Biden's laptop, we tried to impeach Secretary Maryokas. That is not what American people voted them into office with a very slim majority to do.

You have Brandon Russell, former head of the Atomwaffen Division, now running something called the new socialist order, fresh out of prison from his stint for possession of explosives related to a plot to topple the Florida power grid.
