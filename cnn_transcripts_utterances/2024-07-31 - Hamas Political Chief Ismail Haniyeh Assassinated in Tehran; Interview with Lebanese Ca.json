I'm Becky Anderson in London; normally based, of course, in Abu Dhabi. And we start with all eyes on the Middle East as the assassination of the Hamas political leader pushes this region potentially into a new, unprecedented phase. Hamas says Ismail Haniyeh, seen here, was killed in a, quote, \"Zionist\" strike on Iranian soil on Wednesday after attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. In the wake of the killing, Iran's mission to the United Nations posted, quote, \"The response to an assassination will indeed be special operations -- harder and intended to instill deep regret in the perpetrator.\" That after Iran's supreme leader says he sees it as his country's duty to avenge the killing. And that was pointedly a statement directed at Israel who have not claimed responsibility for the assassination of the Hamas political leader. Speaking a short time ago, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken said he would not speculate on the impact of the assassination but said the U.S. was, quote, \"not aware of or involved\" in the incident. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has covered this region extensively and knows more about the region than most people will ever know, joins me now. What do you make of what we have been reporting in the past hours and over the past, what, 25 hours with the assassination, of course, of a senior Hezbollah leader in Beirut?",

You are hearing it coming from governments across the region as well as so many people in the Middle East, who are very worried about where this is all going. And as you mentioned, this is not just obviously the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh I'm Tehran. It is 24 hours that the region has not seen anything like this before with that strike in Beirut, targeting the Hezbollah leader. And that has really pushed the region right now into even more dangerous territory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over):  These some of the last images of Ismail Haniyeh before he was assassinated in the Iranian capital. He appeared defiant. Here at the country's parliament. Among those invited to attend the new presidents inauguration. Just hours before what appears to be Israel delivering on its promise its to target Hamas leaders wherever they may be. The news of his assassination broke on Iranian state TV in the early hours Wednesday. Tehran says he was assassinated at around 2:00 am local time by a, quote, \"airborne guided projectile\" that hit a residence for veterans in northern Tehran, where he was staying. Israel, that's carried out assassinations and attacks inside Iran in the past, has not claimed responsibility. On the Hamas' military leadership that has gone underground since October 7, the political leader of the group has been its public face, living in Doha, traveling relatively freely and central to ceasefire and hostage negotiations. His killing, at least for now, dampens hopes for a deal anytime soon. Qatar, that's facilitated these negotiations, condemned the killing. Its prime minister posting on X, quote, \"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\" The timing, the target and this happening in Tehran has pushed a region that has been teetering on the edge even closer to all out war. Haniyeh's assassination comes less than 24 hours after Israel says it killed a top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in a strike on Beirut's southern suburbs.",

Israel, of course, is not commenting on this, neither denying nor confirming that it was behind the attack. Reaction though, is pouring in from across the Middle East and beyond to what is the apparent assassination of the political the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, today. Both Jordan and Qatar called his death a heinous crime. Turkiye described the killing as despicable. Those countries, along with Egypt, Russia and China, are warning the assassination could push the region into an all-out war. Well, speaking from Singapore, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken said that Washington was not aware of or involved in Haniyeh's death and wouldn't speculate on the impact.

What was called an AI weapon, a machine gun, apparently, that self- destructed after being used, remotely controlled. So this time, some of the speculations about what caused Haniyeh's death, there was some talk about quadcopters being used, some kind of long-range missile. And then this rocket that you're talking about, that could be connected to what was used during Fakhrizadeh's assassination. But ultimately what's the goal of this assassination? I think that's the bigger question, rather than how he was killed. I think the goal here really is about sabotaging two parallel negotiation processes. One is about the ceasefire in Gaza. Second, connected to that, is that Iran-West dialogue, which many were expecting with, Pezeshkian taking office. This assassination in Tehran took place on the day of Pezeshkian's inauguration. They could have picked any other date, right? Because someone like Haniyeh comes and goes to Iran quite a lot. Why did they pick that date? Why did they pick that location? I think those are key questions that we need to answer.
