Three hundred seventy-six law enforcement officers were on the scene, but it took 77 agonizing minutes before storming in and killing the gunman. Two months later, 411 days ago, the city of Uvalde hired an independent investigator to probe the failures of that day. So, Audie, what's actually happening now?",
