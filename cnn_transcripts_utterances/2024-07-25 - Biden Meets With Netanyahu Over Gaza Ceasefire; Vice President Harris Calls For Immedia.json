We have video that you're seeing here from just moments ago before their meeting began. And we're told that Biden is expected to be as forceful as he's ever been in pushing Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire agreement, which sources indicate is within reach at this point in time. And that pressure is expected to intensify even further later this afternoon when they both meet with families of American hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas.Let's get now to CNN senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche. All right. Kayla, give us a sense of -- given Biden's decision to drop out of the race. Do the White House concerned about what kind of leverage he may have? Is he's trying to pressure Netanyahu here?",

      "sentences": "There is absolutely a question of leverage, Brianna. It is a question that we expect Admiral John Kirby to have to answer now from the White House podium about how exactly Biden plans to pressure Netanyahu behind the scenes. And it's a question for the President himself, especially given the fact that it's now been two months since he began amping up the rhetorical pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as the leaders of Hamas to reach that deal.Remember, it was the end of May when Biden gave a public address laying out the three part ceasefire framework, in essence, trying to lay out all of the facts of that potential deal and try to strong arm them into reaching it. And then it was just two weeks ago when during a press conference after the conclusion of the NATO summit that President Biden said that Hamas and Israel had agreed to a framework of that deal. And shortly following that, Secretary of State Tony Blinken said that they were inside the 10-yard line. And now, senior administration officials say, they have never been closer than they are today to reaching such a deal. But, of course, it is not only the details of such deal, but also the political will of Netanyahu himself that are critical to actually reaching one. It's no secret that clinching that deal would be a major accomplishment for President Biden's legacy, but also a major gift that he could potentially give his vice president as she begins campaigning and begins distilling her own policy on Israel. I'm told by participants in a call that campaign officials held with major Wall Street donors yesterday that those donors asked the campaign officials in no uncertain terms, what is Harris's policy on Israel? Rufus Gifford, the National Finance Committee of the now Harris campaign answered, give us a few days. That's all still being ironed out. Certainly, the meetings between Biden and Netanyahu, as well as Vice President Harris and Netanyahu will be critical in figuring out exactly where Harris is going to stand on that issue. And we'll wait and see how that meeting goes and what, if anything, there is to report out of it, guys.",

You know, let's remember that when this meeting -- when Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit was scheduled, it was supposed to be a month ago, and that was when the Biden administration was pushing for this ceasefire deal that President Biden announced in May. And no one could have predicted that a month later, he would be a lame duck president. But Kamala Harris would be the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump would be waiting in the wing.So, you know, if you just listen to Netanyahu's speech yesterday, it's very clear that he's willing to make zero concessions at this time. He said his hands won't be shackled. He has no intention of making any movements towards this deal. That's what all of the indicators say. So I think, yeah, it would be very nice for Kamala Harris if President Biden could get this done. But I don't see the leverage, I don't see the incentive for Netanyahu. And it seems like he's just going to wait and see how the election pans out before he does anything. Again, that's really unfortunate. KEILAR: Yeah. And he has, on this visit, can meetings with -- he's not just meeting Joe Biden and Donald Trump. He's also meeting Kamala Harris. And I wonder how that change in the ticket is maybe changing his calculus, if at all, and how he's approaching this visit?",

That's really angered the hostage families who believe that he's holding them back to try to get political concessions from Biden.Here in Washington, there was a Pentagon press conference today where the secretary of defense said, we have not slowed down our deliveries of weapons. We don't know what Netanyahu is talking about. But behind closed doors, I think Biden is going to get an ask from Netanyahu for something before these talks can go forward.",

That's why you had hostage families in Netanyahu's speech yesterday, standing up with t- shirts on that say, \"just sign the deal.\" And some of them getting escorted out of the chambers for that silent protest.And also, Kamala Harris is going to be walking into this. Brianna, to your question, she doesn't want to tip her hand too much about what her policy might be, especially if it's more restrictive than Biden's because Netanyahu is going to see Trump tomorrow.

And she already has, really, I mean, when she has been speaking out much more forcefully about the need for a ceasefire. But also, I'm struck by what she brings to this. She does not have a lifelong relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. She comes at this from a fresh perspective, a fresh set of eyes, if you will. So I think on the margins, maybe stylistically and perhaps rhetorically, there'll be some differences. But again, she's not setting policy. She has to win the election before that.
