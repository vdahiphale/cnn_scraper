And they are perpetually in search of evidence to pin crimes on Biden's allies. Now, there's supposed to be proof in the pudding, but Republicans can't seem to make jello. The GOP struck out on the Mayorkas impeachment. They whiffed again when they tried to impeach Joe Biden. And just yesterday, they tried to turn Anthony Fauci into Dr. Frankenstein. They laid the blame for a monster COVID pandemic at his feet. And now today, Congress gave us the latest example. Republicans want America to believe that the attorney general, Merrick Garland, is a Biden henchman, and that he is the principal orchestrator of a plot to stop Donald Trump. Now, the problem with that is that it's just not true.

But that political convenience, I think the worry is, could turn into public chaos. And Merrick Garland pointed this out in his opening statement.And that's what was so remarkable about this hearing is his opening statement was primarily about those threats, those threats to law enforcement and to judges and to civil servants. Those are the nonpolitical appointees in the Justice Department. And he said those threats were coming from conspiracy theories. They were coming from misinformation. They were coming from these politically convenient statements that are being used to paint a picture on the Justice Department that is inaccurate. And then remarkably in that hearing, as you showed Abby, they then went into more of those conspiracy theories. And I want to just quickly put some numbers to that for you, tenfold increase since 2016 of death threats to members of Congress. There's been a fourfold increase in threats to federal judges over the same period. And nearly four 40 percent of election workers in this country say they've been harassed or threatened in their jobs. Merrick Garland tonight at the Justice Department is not thinking about protecting Joe Biden or helping Joe Biden win re-election. The Justice Department is focused on those numbers and the extraordinary period of threat we are in to public servants from these conspiracy theories.",

What's so alarming to me as a conservative is that the messaging has swung around 180 degrees and now you've got members of Congress talking about, in their words, detonating the FBI, clearing house, gutting the deep state.So, it's no longer just one person. It's not just Donald Trump saying these things. His views have been transmuted onto the wider party and on members of Congress that were otherwise previously considered mainstream. But now they're talking about going after law enforcement. It's really spread quite substantially, and what I think that means is Trump's agenda, he'll be able to advance it if he gets a second term as it relates to going after these institutions.",

And now, their response to this, their remedy, is to weaponize the Justice Department. I mean, that's really extraordinary.I mean, what you would hope to hear out of a Republican candidate and his allies right now, if they actually had these concerns, is that they'll restore impartiality, integrity and the rule of law to the Justice Department, not go back in and push their fingers on the scales in the other direction. But that's what you're hearing about. And it's certainly what was clear to me at the end of the first term of the Trump administration is there were a lot of plans to go into a prospective second term to go weaponize those institutions to turn them against political adversaries. The only thing that's gotten worse since then is they've had four years to systematically and methodically plan that. Trump was very unprepared to become President of the United States. He did not accept it, or he did not expect it, and now they've had a lot of time to prepare to go after those institutions and political rivals in the meantime.",

That said, I also think that part of the reason that he was the choice of the Democratic Party in 2020 was that he was the guy who could speak the language of the working class white people who the Dems were freaked out about losing in 2016, right?

We can't be more thoughtful in how we're responding to the situation. What I've been hearing from mayors for, well, more than a year now is they need the federal government's assistance in, yes, dealing with the volume of migrants that may be coming to the southern border seeking asylum, which is legal based on our federal law and international law. But when we starve both the departments and the agencies, like Border Patrol and ICE, but others of the resources they need to handle the capacity, that is a problem. Democrats have put forward additional funding only to be shut down by Republicans. And there's programs in place to assist local governments and non-governmental organizations in providing some just temporary emergency shelter food, services to migrants seeking asylum while they're awaiting that process.

A lot of people that come, that's what they claim or when their asylum claim is turned down, it's because they admit they're looking for jobs and economic opportunity for their families.But listen to this, Abby, every employer, every industry leader that I talked to is desperate for more workers. Thanks to President Biden, we have record low sustained levels of unemployment. Our economy needs more workers to keep growing. Imagine if we brought in the legal pathway opportunities and linked people looking for work with employers needing workers, that would be a more smart, more effective, more thoughtful way to help drive down the numbers.",

Do you have hope that he really is behind it, that that if Hamas does say yes, that he's willing to say yes to a path that actually would end the war?DEKEL-CHEN: Well, I think two things are important here. First is he has to have the political backbone and to put aside any personal interests he might have in retaining his coalition for the good of the country, which would mean ending the war on Israel's terms and most importantly, healing this enormous wound in the country that can only heal by the return of the hostages. That -- that's -- you know, that's something that he must do. And luckily for him in the last 24 hours, the ultra-religious parties that are part of his coalition have said very clearly that they are willing to support any hostage deal. And really, the only obstacle appears to be the messianic, very small parties in his coalition who seem to be determined to prolong the war no matter what. Again, for their sort of zealous messianic reasons. But again, at the end of the day, the hard, the nut to crack here is not Netanyahu because Israeli public opinion is solidly behind ending the conflict again with Hamas, not as a governing or military authority.

Keeping in mind that we're from kibbutz near Oz, a small community that was utterly destroyed on October 7th by Hamas terrorists and looters from Gaza.

And the three older gentlemen, and I lived with them and among them and for them for over 40 years. And they -- they were alive and they appeared in hostage videos and they were allowed to die.
