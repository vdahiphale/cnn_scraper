It is part of an aggressive strategy that the Harris campaign is trying to employ, using a Democratic playbook from 2022. That's what Senator Warnock during the 2022 runoff was able to basically shave off Republican votes in those rural counties, while also winning big in Metro Atlanta. That's what helped him secure the win, and that is what they hope they can do with Vice President Kamala Harris by, again, losing by less in these counties, while losing -- or, sorry, winning big in areas where they have that strong Democratic base.And so, it is notable that she and the Vice Presidential nominee, Tim Walz, have chosen to come to South Georgia to kick off their bus tour, the first time they're in the state together, and the first time after the Democratic National Convention, to try to shore up those votes. Now, yesterday, they were in -- they visited a high school, and they went to a barbecue joint, talking to voters. But, take a listen to what the Vice President had to say to the students.

And Democratic strategists tell me, it's important to keep an eye on how he is resonating with voters, especially in that part of the state, given his rural upbringing and his background in football and the military, and seeing whether he helps boost the ticket, especially in this area of Georgia, in Southeast Georgia.Now, of course, again, it is a crucial battleground state, one that polls show that she has a slight edge on Donald Trump but within the margin of error. So, there is no leader. And when Biden won the state in 2020, it was only by less than 12,000 votes. So, the campaign giving a glimpse of what their strategy is going to be in this state, simply by spending time in South Georgia. [11:05:00] NEWTON: Yeah. 12,000 votes. Think about it, folks. That is far less than you see on any given weekend or weeknight, for that matter, at college football in Georgia. So, that is key perspective. Priscilla Alvarez for us on the trail, really appreciate it. I want to go now to Omar Jimenez, who is in La Crosse, Wisconsin. For me, a reminder. Omar, well, you don't need any reminding.

But, they all look very swingy to me. I mean, these are all margin of error races, and just a small movement one way or the other could change the outcome. So, if you like exciting political campaigns, you're about to get one. On the ground game, I think Trump's ticket to victory has always been,can they turn out these low propensity voters, people who aren't all that connected to either political party, people who don't vote that often, maybe some people who have never voted or aren't even registered? If you look at in the surveys, people who are less connected to politics tend to like Trump more. So, their ground game efforts, really, in my opinion, should be focused on those folks. That's how he changes the game. You can change the composition of the electorate by putting people in the pool who usually don't participate. So, yeah, I do have confidence he can do that. It's why they've joined forces with someone like RFK. I mean, he is not my cup of tea. But, if you're thinking strategically about who he has to turn out, you understand why he is doing it.",

But, you're going to forgive me for saying, this sounds a lot like 2016 to me. What's different this time? MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Oh, what's different is the energy, the inspiration, the mobilization, the joy, the -- frankly, what voters saw, not just in the Democratic National Convention, but what they're seeing now on the road, in terms of Kamala Harris being on the top of the ticket, with Tim Walz as -- at her side. And look, Paula, I think a big difference between the Kamala Harris campaign and the Trump campaign are what you're seeing on the ground. Kamala Harris has raised over $0.5 billion. $540 million have come in in the last month, and that money is going to go to, on top of the ground game that the Biden campaign had already had, is going to go to increase the field offices, the ground operators that are knocking on doors, the call centers that are going to be calling all of these voters that have registered, newly registered voters, a record amount. Ever since Kamala Harris was at the top of the ticket, Paula, we've seen an increase of young black women of 175 percent voter registration over what it was in 2020, Latinas, 150 percent registration over what it was in 2020, the vast majority of them registering as Democrats. Now I agree with Scott, this is going to be close. The Harris campaign cannot and is not taking anything for granted. She is running like she is 10 points behind, which is super smart. She talks about how they are the underdog out there, which is true. And so, as long as she continues to talk about what she is going to do for middle class, working class voters, make the contrast with Donald Trump, a 34 times convicted felon, who is only in this for himself, I think that is a winning formula --",

VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The President just got RFK's endorsement. He just got Tulsi Gabbard's endorsement. And on the other side, he has got Nikki Haley's endorsement. He has got Brian Kemp's endorsement. And it's important that Donald Trump, despite the fact that he has disagreements with a number of people who have endorsed him, he is willing to say, we are the big tent party. We stand for common sense and sanity, and we've got to kick that insane politician named Kamala Harris out of the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, when you think about campaign tactics, will this work? Will that work? A few thousand people here and there, it absolutely makes the difference.J.D. Vance there mentioned Brian Kemp in Georgia in the recitation of politicians who were supporting Donald Trump. That was important when Donald Trump finally made up with Brian Kemp. They don't want to love each other and golf together on the weekends, but they do need to get along if they intend to win the election and cooperate. And in Georgia, where Brian Kemp is like the most popular politician, his organization, the people who are loyal to him, working for Trump, that will matter. So, I think the Vance message there is exactly the message that most Republicans want to hear, which is, are we going to be at each other's throats, or are we going to work together for the purpose of defeating the Democrats? And Trump would do well to listen to that message, because sometimes he gets off of it a little bit. But, Vance has it right, I think.",

They're allegedly used for child pornography and that type of thing. And this seems to be what the French are really going after here. So, it could have a chilling effect.And I think there is a lot of unease in the tech industry right now, especially among tech executives who like to travel to France, because France has made it clear that, if you travel there, you could be exposed here. Now, Durov is also a French citizen, which probably raised the risk for him. And this is one of the big questions, big mysteries sort of surrounding this whole affair, is that he appears to have known that the French were looking into him and decided to travel to France, to Paris, from Azerbaijan anyway. But, this is definitely going to have a chilling effect across the entire tech industry when it comes to cryptography.",

So, it does appear that he has not been really in the best favor of Russia in recent years, and he settled in Dubai, and has been running the company from there.So, it's not really clear why the Russians all of a sudden are defending him, except for the fact that they do use Telegram in Russia, especially in the military, to communicate, and this could be a big factor in their sort of shock and horror over this arrest, because it's going to make it more difficult, potentially, or more risky, for the Russian military to continue to use this service if they're worried that Durov might be forced to hand over some encryption keys or something like that to French authorities, which is something that the Russian Foreign Minister mentioned yesterday.",

That's how they characterize them, that they've used airstrikes. They've had gun battles with them, and one of those battles took place in and around a mosque where they killed a group, they say, were terrorists. They also say that they've killed the commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Tulkarm. Now, Palestinian Islamic Jihad have admitted that their commander there was killed. They praised him as a martyr, and saying, this is not going to defeat them.What is clear, and it's a very unclear picture, what is clear that is happening, civilians are being caught up in this. The Palestinian Red Crescent, for a time, have lost communications with their headquarters in Jenin. The internet, the phone lines were all down. The cellular service was down. People can't get out to get food or medicines. That's what we're hearing from Palestinian officials in those affected areas in the north of the occupied West Bank. But, how does this fit in with a bigger picture of what Israel has been doing? Well, since October 7th, Israel has focused some of its efforts and energies on stopping Hamas and other groups forming and getting stronger inside the West Bank. And to that end, more than 637 Palestinians have been killed to date, according to the UN, and that is just a massive, massive increase in what we've seen over recent years. And that also includes 100 -- more than 135 people now killed in airstrikes within the northern -- within the occupied West Bank. There were no, or very, very few airstrikes in that area before last year. So, again, all of this fits into a picture of a much bigger security operation going on in that area. And we heard today from the spokesperson of the UN human rights body being very clear about Israel's obligations, even seeming to imply that Israel was breaking some of its international obligations.",

The group says that they want to stop a second term of the Trump presidency.

He served as the Southern California Chair for John McCain's primary campaign in 2008. He is also the author of this piece in The Hill entitled \"This is not your mother's Democratic Party.\" We start by asking you please to explain that, because I am intrigued by this statement, though, that you made after the Democratic National Convention. You said perhaps the most impressive thing about the convention was what was missing. What does that mean? CHRIS TRUAX, ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAIR FOR JOHN MCCAIN'S 2008 PRIMARY CAMPAIGN: Good morning, Paula. It's -- the Democrats have actually gone out of their way to be very inclusive this cycle, and I'm naturally skeptical as a conservative, but the Democrats need to be walking the walk. That convention would not have been out of place for Republican convention in the before times. It was very inclusive, very patriotic, hitting all of the big themes of America, none of the niche identity politics issues that Democrats or progressives, rather, sometimes get involved with. Kamala Harris made a real effort to walk the walk with that convention. And I was impressed.",

I mean, politics is a -- I wouldn't say it's a marriage, but we can certainly date, they have -- they made a real effort. If you listen to Kamala Harris' acceptance speech, I mean, she even promised a tax cut. It was -- I was -- it was quite extraordinary to me how far she went in terms of really basic issues about protecting our alliances, protecting our democracy, sort of basic American themes.And for me, that kind of capstone was she gave Adam Kinzinger, probably one of the most, well, definitely one of the most important spots in the whole convention.

The question is, if you're a conservative, you want to conserve things, things that are important, and you have to ask yourself, what are -- what's the sort of cost of four more years of Donald Trump versus the cost of Kamala Harris? Kamala Harris is going to do some things that I won't like, but those are relatively unimportant things. They're not big things. Donald Trump may destroy some of our alliances that we've worked on since World War II. He may significantly damage our democracy. He is unpredictable. Many of the people who worked in his cabinet are refusing to endorse him, and they know him better than anyone else.So, if you're a conservative, it is sort -- the concern -- the Republican Party has always been a sort of a big tent party, and it has been -- there have been uncomfortable alliances, even in the old days, between social conservatives and economic conservatives. So, Republicans have never -- conservatives have never had the perfect party, because everybody has a little bit of a different attitude toward things. But, Kamala Harris' Democratic Party, at least for this cycle, is really making an effort to say, let's concentrate on the basic things that we all agree on and put some of that other stuff to the side.",

She is probably the most pragmatic candidate, Democratic candidate since Bill Clinton. And if you're a pragmatic -- if you're a pragmatist, you say, I'm going to fix the things I can. I'm going to concentrate on the problems that I can fix, and some of my other things that I might like to do, those go farther down the list.

      "sentences": "It is, Paula. And look, I have been covering this for a long time, and it has been a fascinating story. And one of the most intriguing parts of it is the fact that former President Trump is sitting on this multi-billion dollar social media fortune, a fortune that he probably would like to use to try to meet some of his financial needs, but he hasn't been able to touch it because, as you mentioned, those shares have been locked up by those fairly typical restrictions. Well, that is going to change very soon, as soon as September 20th. If the stock price stays above $20, that's when these lockup restrictions will go away. And even if the share price falls further, the restrictions are still going away on the 25th.And so, at that point, he would be technically free to sell his shares and use the proceeds for whatever he wants, to pay lawyers, to fund his campaign. However, from a practical standpoint, this would not be so easy, because large shareholders like Trump, they always face obstacles when they try to exit their stake. And it would be even more complicated here, because Trump isn't just the dominant shareholder. He is the most popular user on Truth Social. The company's stock ticker symbol is even DJT. So, if he hit the exits, it would create a crisis of confidence. That's why NYU Law Professor Michael Ohlrogge, he told me that it would be all but impossible for Trump to liquidate his whole stake, or even a third of it, without completely tanking the stock price. And look, the stock price, it's already been tanking, falling another four percent yesterday, falling below $20 for the first time since the merger close last spring. The share price is actually down 70 percent since March, and that sell-off has accelerated as Vice President Harris gains in the polls, and as these lockup restrictions loom, as far as the end of them come, this sell-off in the stock price, it has really taken a hit to Trump's stake in this company. It was worth over $6 billion back in May. Now, it's worth $2.3 billion, still a lot of money, but not as much as before. And one other point here, Paula, there is another way that Trump could possibly monetize this stake if he was able to borrow against the shares. Of course, to do that, he'd need to find a bank or a wealthy individual or some other entity to lend to him, and that would not be simple either.",
