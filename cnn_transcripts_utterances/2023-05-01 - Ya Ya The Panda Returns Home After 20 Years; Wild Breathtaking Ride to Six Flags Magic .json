      "sentences": "Bring Ya Ya home became a rallying cry for millions of Chinese. The panda`s picture plastered on billboards from Beijing to the Big Apple.It`s true, Ya Ya was young and fluffy when she arrived at the Memphis Zoo 20 years ago. On a long-term multimillion dollar lease from China. U.S. and Chinese scientists say she has a genetic condition affecting her skin and fur, a condition that worsens with old age. No impact on her quality of life just her looks. They even issued a joint statement saying the fact is, Ya Ya had excellent care. But facts don`t always matter in a world full of fake news. Anti-American panda propaganda is filling the feeds of Chinese social media users. No mention of the healthy pandas at two other American zoos, but plenty of pictures of an active and playful panda in Russia, a panda Chinese state media praises for improving bilateral ties. Ya Ya`s saga will end where it began. The Beijing zoo where she`ll live out her final years. She just might be the world`s most politicized Panda, a beloved bear that brought the U.S. and China closer now being used to divide. (On camera):  China has been using pandas as a political tool for decades. They are national treasures and China is very selective about which countries get these million dollar a year panda loans, the U.S. had not one in two decades. Ya Ya was the last one. But they also heavily censored social media and allowed this online backlash to grow to the point that people were calling for all pandas to be pulled out of the U.S. and panda diplomacy to end altogether. And only on Wednesday did the Foreign Ministry of China say that in fact, the pandas at the Memphis Zoo were well taken care of and actually loved by the American people. Halfhearted attempt perhaps to dial back some of this controversy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
