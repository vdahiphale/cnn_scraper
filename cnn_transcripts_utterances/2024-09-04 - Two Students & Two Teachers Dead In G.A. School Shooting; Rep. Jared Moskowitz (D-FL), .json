Two of the victims were teachers. Two of the victims were students. Nine others have been hospitalized. State officials say the suspect in custody is 14 years old, a boy who attends the school. He has been speaking to investigators, we are told, and law enforcement officials say they believe the suspect will be charged with murder and tried as an adult.

In the other cases, as you state, we often see the person commit a form of suicide by cop, by not complaining or firing on police or taking their own life once they're aware that police are there and that the situation is closing in on them.

New York is obviously a city that has a great deal of gun violence as well. BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Yes. Jake, I'm thinking as a parent right now, I know you're a parent, too, I mean, hearing those kids talk about this like it was something they almost expected to have happen during their time in school, that was chilling. And I think what's happening for parents all over America is just a growing anger that this continues without a solution. How does a 14-year-old get a gun and no one picks up on the signs that there may be danger coming? How -- and so many of these other cases was there. Obviously a mental health problem, but there was no follow up. I think this is going to become a bigger and bigger issue for parents all across this country because it just seems out of control.",

So you don't know, nor do I, what kind of Congress we're going to have. We might have a Congress a little more willing to take action. We did see some major gun safety legislation in the last few years. That was a big step.But I think it comes down to things like clearly the red flag laws, strengthening those so that if there is a sign of trouble, the police are empowered to go and seize a weapon until there's a full evaluation, clearly holding parents responsible. And this may be more of a matter of state law, too, but you've started to see it in the court system. If parents did not properly store guns or ignored signs of a child potentially being ready to be violent, there has to be responsibility for that parent. Other children die, other parents lose a child. There has to be responsibility. And the last thing I'd say, and this could be national and local, is some actual investment in mental health services for young people. We barely have enough guidance counselors in our high schools, but we certainly don't have mental health professionals in most schools anywhere near the way we need them. Some of these things could be caught early enough to be turned around if there were some actual professionals there to see what's going on and do something about it when a kid's in trouble.",

In that mental health professional's view or teacher's view, police can get involved. But red flag laws only work as much as people know about them and use them. And I've covered so many of these.So I apologize if I get any of these facts not exactly right, but it seemed to me, as I recall, the Buffalo shooter could have been highlighted under the red flag law, but was not. The Maine shooter, people in New York City knew about him having problems, I believe, and authorities in Maine, somehow that connection was never made. How do we solve that problem where there are red flag laws and people either don't know about them or they don't act on them? DE BLASIO: Jake, we see this problem a lot in law enforcement, and I learned this as mayor of New York City many times, that one jurisdiction had a sense that someone was a potential danger, but another jurisdiction did not. That is solvable. We can create mechanisms to share information and to flag people with potential dangerous characteristics across jurisdictions. But also more teeth in these laws. I mean, right now, what we see is the red flag laws give law enforcement the ability. But you're exactly right. In the case of Buffalo, there was not follow up. There was not accountability. If law enforcement or any other local officials didn't follow through on those red flag laws, it was like, oh, you have the right to intervene, but you don't necessarily have to do it. I think red flag laws work when it's very clear that if they're not acted on, people are held responsible, especially if, God forbid, a tragedy like this happens.",

JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Now, hi, Jake. It's good to be with you. I'm in Parkland right now, a mile from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where I graduated from. I saw you had Max Schachter one of the parents who lost their kid in that building. I shouldn't know, Max. And now there are families who join an exclusive club that they've been drafted into involuntarily. And so, you know, it's -- it's -- it's more of the same. You know, we're going to find out, obviously, more about the shooter. We're going to find out what worked from a school safety perspective, what didn't work. It's good to see that the SRO's here engaged in Parkland. The SRO did not. And we'll continue to work on school safety in -- in states where that seems to be doing the most work, where Congress is failing. But this is just heartbreaking. This has been something that one political party has just accepted as part of the political reality in this country in order to have freedom. Florida rejected that, red state Florida, Republican Florida rejected that. It was my bill where we raised the age to buy a gun to 21. We instituted red flag laws which have been used 19,000 times in the state of Florida in the last six years. And we have three day waiting periods. It doesn't mean we're going to stop everything, but it's about mitigation. It's about mitigating the damage if an individual wants to throw their life away and walk into a school.",

This law that governor, I think it was Governor Scott at the time, signed into law. It expanded background checks. It banned bump stocks. It had a three-day waiting period to purchase a handgun. It raised the age limit for purchasing -- for purchasing a long gun to 21. That -- that was your provision of it. But even though Rick Scott signed that as governor of Florida, he opposed it as -- as a senator from Florida. Why do you think it was easier for Republicans in red Florida to support these kinds of gun reforms than it is for Republicans in the U.S. Senate?",

And so having SRO's and funding them and training them appropriately, there are other measures you can take at schools to prevent folks from getting guns in. There are aggressive measures, but they do keep our students safe, if you had metal detectors. And then there's other laws that we should be holding our elected leaders accountable to make sure that our children are safe. That's their number one responsibility.",

The opposition generally comes with stricter laws surrounding storage, especially ones where the owner has to have the gun unloaded and locked because people have concerns about accessibility for self- defense. That's generally where you see opposition to those laws come from.I think there probably is some, you know, middle ground there that you can see more laws dealing with allowing access to minors who -- what, you know, irresponsibly allowing access to minors. There may be more middle ground on that.",

And the -- the idea there is that even if you have officers on scene, they may not be able -- they might not be at the spot where the shooting occurs. It sounds like that's -- that's what happened here. They weren't able to get there immediately. And in theory, an armed teacher could or armed staff could. But obviously, that's a highly controversial position, and it's unlikely that we're going to see one single solution throughout the entire nation.",

We could get a few out. They'll give us that, but they'll leave a lot with them. We won't have the pressure point and something else will happen. We will not be able to come back.So we won't release all the hostages and we won't achieve the defenses that we must have to prevent more October 7th, again and again and again. I don't stand in judgment of these tormented souls because they're undergoing an agony that is hard to -- hard to fathom, and I understand that. But the responsibility of leaders is not merely to share the sentiment, the emotion, but also to exercise judgment, the correct judgment to make sure that these horrors do not happen again.
