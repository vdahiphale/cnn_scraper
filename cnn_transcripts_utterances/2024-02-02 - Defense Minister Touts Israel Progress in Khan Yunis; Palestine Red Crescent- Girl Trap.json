According to the State Department, one of the settlers spoke to riot we've set cars and buildings on fire and left a Palestinian civilian dead. Now there was part of a mob which attacked Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists with stones and clubs.

So this is a real not a threat against him per se.The White House has not saying that they're going but they plan to target anyone in the Israeli government. But this is very clearly the Biden administration planting a red flag, creating a red line saying that the escalation in settler violence in the West Bank risks raising tensions to such a level that that even bigger violence could overspill where, and to give some context on the settler violence since October the seventh. The U.N. body you know, chair that tracks the statistics noted a tripling in the amount of settler violence in the month of October and to the middle of January from then they said there's been 430 such attacks that have involved in casualties, the Palestinians, intimidation of Palestinians, damaged a Palestinian property. And this is what the White House is trying to do is send a very clear message that they will not tolerate this. They say that these decisions that they're taking with this executive order and other decisions are decisions that are in keeping with what they want to achieve in their foreign policies. But this is a very, very strong political message for Prime Minister Netanyahu is government and the Prime Minister himself has said that actually the Israeli government does take to court and charge all those who commit violence within the West Bank, but again, a political message to the Prime Minister of Israel from the Biden administration, Nick Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel.

So this whole idea that the president in the White House tried to do at a time that Israel is fighting a war. I don't want to say existential but it is one of the most important force in our history against a barbaric Hamas terrorist group that has massacred over thousand Israelis. And now because of a few cases of violence in the West Bank, which exist, this is going to make a moral equivalency. It's wrong. And I think that it is about American politics, Michigan is a swing state. It is a state that Biden could potentially lose if that large Arab percentage of residents of the state do not come out to vote for him.

Here's the response from the administration. We've made quite clear publicly that we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, because we do believe that's the best way to bring about lasting peace security for Israel, for Palestinians and for the region. There's been no change in policy. No policy change yet. And it may not happen. But something is happening here.
