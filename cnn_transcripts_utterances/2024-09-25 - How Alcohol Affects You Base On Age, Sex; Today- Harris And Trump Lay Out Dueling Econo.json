Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both in crucial swing states today, laying out dueling visions for the economy, as polls overwhelmingly show it's the most important issue for voters.Plus, shocking security lapses on the day Donald Trump was shot. We'll bring you the details from a new bipartisan report that one Democratic senator says, will make you, quote, astonished and appalled. And minding the manosphere. A top pollster is here to break down why Donald Trump is dominating with male voters, as the Harris campaign knows that cutting into that lead could ultimately determine whether or not she wins the election. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, pocketbook politics. Donald Trump has a big lead on the issue that will likely define the race, that of course, is the economy. And what sources say will be a wide-ranging economic speech today. We are told that Vice President Harris will detail her policies on competition, on childcare and manufacturing, something her opponent talked about on the trail yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Will lead an American manufacturing boom. We're going to have a manufacturing boom, and a lot of it's just taxation policy, tariff policy. This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.

And to me, this really seems like an effort to quiet the noise that we hear from the right that this prosecutor, this former attorney general, is somehow a Marxist. She's going to speak directly to that and say, listen, I am a capitalist and really try to continue to -- I think, speak directly to those undecided voters that she is a mainstream Democrat. Here we're getting a little bit of an excerpt from this speech. Let me take a read for you. It says, for Donald Trump, our economy works best if it works for those who own the big skyscrapers. Not those who build them. Or wire them. Or mop the floors. I have a different view. I believe we need to grow our middle class and make sure our economy works for everyone. And Dana, this is not the first economic rollout that we have seen from the vice president. I was with her in North Carolina not long ago, where she really focused on lowering costs for everyday Americans, focused on going after corporate price gouging, as well as building out more options for affordable homes. So, I expect that this speech very much in line with that will speak directly to this issue of the cost-of-living crisis that so many Americans are confronting right now. Dana?",

I don't really know that much about her.And so, she's got a thread a needle here because, you know, there is Bidenomics, which is not popular. So, she has to figure out a way to kind of distance yourself a little bit from Bidenomics, make some distinguishing policy choices, and yet take credit for some of the progress that's been made.

And we're told that she's going to pitch herself as a policy pragmatist with a populist bent.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, BLOOMBERG POLITICAL &amp; POLICY COLUMNIST &amp; CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I mean, looking at some of those lines that she's going to use that Eva was talking about this idea that Donald Trump is in it for himself and his rich friends. And I am one of you. I grew up in a middleclass family. You know, and every time she talks about the economy, she sort of couches it in those terms about. And part of that is educating the American public about who she is, but also saying, I understand your struggles, whole feel your pain. Idea, she is making some progress on this. You do see some of the polls shrinking, but I think this idea that Trump is in it for himself, that he's just a rich guy. He's just going to make rich people richer, and he doesn't really care about you. That's actually fairly powerful, and you can see it in some of her ads. This is a Pennsylvania ad. There's former Republicans who are now going to vote for her. They're former sort of regular working class, former white folks in Pennsylvania, and they are making this argument too, that Trump was here. He said he was going to do all these things. He didn't do anything for us and he's for the rich, and Kamala Harris is for us.",

To your point of people asking, OK, what about the specifics, particularly on the economy?And it was really unclear whether or not they would, because I don't -- I think they were trying to balance whether or not be better for her to be in the homes and on these -- on those -- on the road with Americans in Pennsylvania, in Georgia versus kind of these larger policy pronouncers. But then I think that they saw those polls that showed her really tightening the gap between her and Donald Trump on the question of who do Americans trust more on the economy. And so that is kind of why we're seeing her do this big policy rollout today, even though it's not very different from what we heard from Biden. Biden ran on boosting domestic manufacturing. That's something that he actually had a lot of positive impact on as president. Biden ran on being a capitalist, something that we're going to hear her talk about today. And I think that is actually the most authentic version of her because at her heart, at her core, she is an incrementalist. And I think that that's what she's going to talk about today, trying to put more money in people's pockets, so that they can put more food on their table.",

I am told, along with my colleagues Kevin Liptak and Natasha Bertrand, that the U.S. is now working on a new ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah to try to quieten the tension and to stop this escalation, to deescalate the situation. They're working on that with France and other countries. We don't really have many details. One U.S. official telling Natasha that a deal is very close at hand. And I should note that it's not just about the de-escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, but also with Hamas. As you know, Dana, those ceasefire talks with Hamas have essentially been stuck. And what, you know, this moment now really highlights the fact that the U.S. has not been able to get to a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
