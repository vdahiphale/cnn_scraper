So it -- their point is that he's totally fine. But as you point out, there have been a number of incidences over the last several months. And he has been asked about his political future. Our colleague, Manu Raju, back in May, sat down with him for a story on the U.S. Senate map and taking back the Senate. And he tried to sort of push McConnell at that time about what his political future was. McConnell didn't want to get into it, didn't want to answer the question, saying just that this was not an interview about his political future. So, obviously, there are a lot of questions about what happened yesterday. He did not answer repeated questions about whether he saw a physician. His office did not answer those questions.

Let's bring in our CNN political correspondent, Sara Murray. So, Sara, I think a lot of people in reaction are wondering how did they even get to that point?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, this is not the day that anyone expected to have in court. As you said, Hunter Biden walked into that federal courthouse in Delaware, prepared to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges, and strike a deal to complete a program that would allow him to avoid a felony gun charge.But as the judge was sort of pressing about what the scope of this deal encompassed, things began to fall apart. And Politico obtained a copy of the version of this plea deal. CNN has not verified that it's the final version. But I want to read you part of it because it gets into, you know, the scope of what this deal was supposed to encompass. It said, \"The United States agrees not to criminally prosecute Biden outside of the terms of this agreement for any federal crimes encompassed by the statement of facts. This agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any future conduct by Biden or by any of his affiliated businesses.\" [06:10:02] So as the judge is running through this making sure Hunter Biden knows what he's pleading to, she says, you know, is this an ongoing investigation? And prosecutors confirmed it is. And they sit in the judge says, so -- you know, you can't bring maybe charges against him for tax crimes, but could you bring charges against him for foreign lobbying? And the prosecutors say, yes, we could. And that is the point when the deal begins to fall apart. Hunter Biden's attorneys say, that's not our understanding. They take a recess. They come to an agreement, again, about this deal, the prosecution and the defense and say, OK, OK, we've reached a deal in which prosecutors will not prosecute Hunter Biden for tax crimes over a five-year span. They're not going to prosecute him for drug offenses. They're not going to prosecute him on this firearms offense. And that is the scope of it. And then as the judge continues to look this over, she takes issue, especially with this deal to avoid the felony firearms charge and essentially says, I'm not going to reject it or accept it, but I want more information. I'm going to put this on hold. And she has given both sides 30 days, essentially, to answer some of her questions and concerns about this plea deal.",

There is always a chance that this is the kind of thing that ends up going to trial, which I don't necessarily think is what prosecutors want in this case.My colleagues have previously reported, prosecutors had some concerns about some parts of the strength of this case, as they've been investigating Hunter Biden. And, obviously, it seems like Hunter Biden would like to avoid a trial. So I think what's most likely is that both sides are going to go back and try to craft a plea agreement that they think is going to satisfy the judge, maybe make tweaks to the one they have, or at least be able to answer the judge's questions more efficiently. But you can't rule out the possibility that this could be something that goes to trial.

If you look at that document, there is a statement of fact, it's about four pages, and it lays out Hunter Biden's business history making millions of dollars, by the way, from Chinese companies and from Ukrainian companies, and his drug use history. Now, this is where the legalese comes in. There's play on this. DOJ apparently reads that to mean only the tax stuff that's talked about in the actual text. Hunter Biden's lawyers said, well, we sort of understood it to mean anything in the periphery, anything that might touch on any of his foreign dealings at all. That was the disconnect.

And there's also an emergency alert that's been declared for the nation's largest power grid that could impact electricity for 65 million people across 13 states and in Washington D.C.Also new this morning, we've learned President Biden will meet the mayors of Phoenix and San Antonio to talk about those soaring temperatures and also announced some new measures to protect workers from extreme temperatures. The threat there is real. We probably don't have to tell you that. But take a look at some of this in Yuma County, Arizona, a 25-year-old farm worker and father of two lost consciousness while working and later died. Neighboring Maricopa County says 25 people have now died as a result of the heat so far. That county doesn't compass Phoenix where temperatures reached a record 118 degrees yesterday. Derek Van Dam is joining us live this morning from Key Biscayne, Florida. We've been talking so much about the heat of the water even in Florida.

She was not afraid to speak up for what she believed in.Let's go back to that infamous moment in that song, in the '90s, I believe in 1992 on Saturday Night Live when she ripped up the photo of Pope John Paul II that you see right there. And she told the New York Times in 2021, it was brilliant. I don't regret it. And so she was speaking out about, you know, the sex abuse in the Catholic Church, these issues long before others, and she faced widespread criticism all over the world. But I also want to talk to you guys about this really tough past year for her. We're all moms, everybody out there has a loved one, right? Last year, she lost one of her children to suicide. And she spoke about it on Twitter. She talked even recently on a Twitter account that's unverified but, you know, it appears to be her saying that she's lost her way. Lost the meaning to live. And she was hospitalized after the suicide of her 17-year-old son, Shane, canceled her shows. But on her Facebook page, it appeared that she did want to get back -- get back out there this year, start touring, and that she wanted to reconnect with her fans and that she had sort of found this reenergized part of her life. And also, she had just done a documentary with an incredible filmmaker that actually won many awards and debuted this past year. And you guys can actually watch that on Paramount and Hulu and other places. And they're actually streaming it overseas this weekend, but a really hard year for her. And so we don't know the cause of death or the circumstances right now. But we know, based on the statement from her family, that they are asking for prayers, and that this is a very tragic loss for them right now and that they need privacy.",
