We don't know exactly when that will be or where that will be. From past experience, and precedence, they are generally expelled through China. So, he could - he could well be flown to Beijing, for example, and then flown on from there. We simply don't have that information at this point. This is all that state run media is giving us. It does come on the eve of an important Korean holiday. It is Korean thanksgiving that starts in a day or two, a significant calendar time of the year. And what we know from just last month, August, in fact, when North Korea finally admitted that Travis King had crossed into the country illegally, was that he had admitted that he had done this voluntarily. And that is what we heard from the South Korean side as well and eyewitnesses that were within this private tour group up at the DMZ that say that he simply ran for it, ran across the border, tried to get into the building on the North Korean side. The door was locked. So ran around to the back and was then bundled into a car with North Korean guards. So, what we know today is that he will be expelled. What we're waiting to find out is exactly how, where and when.",

You and I know dozens of people like this that are of a younger generation or even older generation, sort of Paul Ryan type Republicans. None of them seem terribly optimistic about their ability to fight and win for control of their party and take it in a different direction. And I think we heard that from - it wasn't so much resignation, but it came close to it from Cassidy Hutchinson. And that's what will be interesting on the debate tonight. Now, I don't suspect Cassidy Hutchinson is going to be a question tonight on the debate. There are a lot of important questions we just saw with the news from North Korea.

The state has defiantly, you know, they said, OK, we'll redraw it. Andthen they regrew it and essentially handed in the same map. That level of defiance of a Supreme Court directive is very unusual. A special master has been appointed. They're going to sort of continue this fight. But what it tells us is, ten years after the Supreme Court struck down some of the provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were intended to prevent this kind of nonsense down at the state level, you're playing whack-a-mole all over the country.

And he's an easy target because you can draw a clear contrast with him. People can say look how inexperienced he is. I have experience on x, y, z. But I think that in the first debate Nikki really shined and her polling numbers have gone up. And we saw in a recent NBC poll that in a head to head match-up between her and Joe Biden, she beats Biden in a general election by five points.

So, let's walk through what's in it.Basically, we start with better pay. Five percent more this year, followed by 4 percent next year, 3.5 percent the year after that. Better benefits, which includes a slight increase in health fund contribution. And writers who are on the same script no longer have to share the cap on that pension and health benefit contribution. This was a big sticking point, artificial intelligence. There are some protections against the studio's use of that. A studio can't use AI to write or rewrite literary material. They have to disclose to a writer if they're handing them anything that's been done with AI. And a writer can choose to use AI with consent from the company, but can't be forced to use it. Another big sticking point, streaming bonuses and residuals. This is going to be based on the success of the content and how many people view it on streaming platforms. In some cases, on the largest platforms with really big budget productions, this could mean an extra $9,000 bonus on a half hour episode, up to more than $40,000 bonus on a huge feature movie.

If you just analyze the student loan payments, it can be very painful for an individual family to deal with.
