One of them will be my guest tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, we actually have no idea what sentence Judge Merchan is going to actually hand down to Donald J. Trump next month, but we do know one thing for sure, Donald Trump is not leaving his political future up to this judge. Between now and November, Donald Trump is going to use that 34-count conviction to try to get to 47, the number 47 that is. And today, a furious Trump railed against the verdict during a speech in Trump Tower. You know Trump Tower, the same place as his infamous 2015 announcement. You remember this moment, the ride down the escalator with Melania in tow, really, ahead of him? Well, the smiling and the waving? This time, there was no ride down an escalator, there was actually no Melania, and there were no smiles. And for 33 minutes, Donald Trump stood alone and told his supporters that he is a victim of a weaponized system. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, because they didn't see that there was a criminal case there, they didn't feel that there was sufficient evidence in that case. He sees the facts in this case -- COATES: I don't want to cut you off, Nick. I'm sorry, but we're having a little bit of difficulty hearing you. I want to be able to hear and understand your points very much. So just give us a second to correct your audio for a moment, and we'll come right back to you. Amy, let me go to you here on this because after the verdict, Bragg stressed that this case was just, frankly, one of many that the D.A.'s office is prosecuting every day. I mean, he made very few appearances in the courtroom, no real public appearances, which I found very interesting, given that there have been others who would have a very high-profile case like this, and they would make sure that they themselves were present, omnipresent, and even having daily press conferences, and you could see this happening in other places as well.

He's there because of a deep commitment to the rule of law.And so, we saw this when he ran for office and made clear that he would follow the facts wherever they led. He did not -- he refused to actually commit to prosecuting Trump despite pretty significant pressure during that campaign to do so. And as I think my friend, Nick, was explaining, he actually declined to prosecute a different criminal case against Trump in the early days of his tenure as D.A. And so, he's not someone who was doing this for political reasons. He's not someone who's doing this for the glory. He's doing this because his entire career has been rooted in a commitment to the rule of law and to pursuing justice.
