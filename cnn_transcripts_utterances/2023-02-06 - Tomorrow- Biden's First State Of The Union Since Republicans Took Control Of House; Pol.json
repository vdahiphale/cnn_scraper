      "sentences": "Bit later this afternoon, President Biden will return to the White House from Camp David. He spent the weekend there huddling with advisers that ahead of tomorrow's State of the Union address. It is a critical speech as the President discusses his hopes for the next two years of divided government. And as he ramps up for a reelection run.New numbers tell us the most important audience that would be you is skeptical. The President's approval rating sits at 43 percent. That's according to CNN's latest poll of polls average. That is up three points from the eve of last year's address. But a new ABC News Washington Post poll finds this, only 37 percent of Americans give the President a thumbs up on the economy. More than two thirds lack confidence in the President to make the right decisions for the country's future. In six and 10 say President Biden has accomplished little or nothing. Our great reporters are back with us. That has to be an enormous frustration at the White House where they understand inflation sort of fogs people's perception of everything right now after the pandemic. But they would say, he passed the rescue plan, he passed infrastructure, why isn't it trickling out? I guess that's part of the goal tomorrow. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": I think part of the issue is that they haven't been great salesmen. You know, the fact of the matter is, when you had someone like Trump in the White House, what he knew how to do was sell, you know, his message. One thing they would talk about all the time during the Trump administration was like, low record, low black unemployment. You hear that all the time. And Trump got so much credit for it. And so I wondered, like I was like, wait, unemployment is falling. How is black unemployment doing? I had to look it up. I'm like, oh, it's near record lows now, but I don't hear about it as much. Like, I'm sure Biden mentions it, but he doesn't sell it. You got to sell these things.",

You can say criticize what they did if you don't agree with it, but they still pass a lot of legislation.But the problems, these are big mess of bills that take many years to implement. Infrastructure, the Inflation Reduction Act, allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, those are all things that will take some time from people to feel so we'll have enough an impact for when voters go to the polls. That is a striking number. 62 percent of the voters do not believe the President has really done a whole lot in office. That's something he has to be concerned about.",

And it is largely about saying, look, this is what I've done. But it is a slightly less sexy sales pitch when you're talking about implementation because that's really what the next two years of the Biden presidency are about. He's not going to get -- probably not going to get any major big legislative accomplishments done with the current conditions of this Congress. I think he will say tomorrow night, he'll note a few things that he thinks they can work together on. President Biden's identity is largely about working with the other side. So he'll talk about that, but he'll also really emphasize this is what we've done so far and we can move it at least a little bit further together.",

Now, that he was -- he did not -- that was not a universal view within the D.A.'s office. Several prosecutors resigned from the team because they thought they were moving too far ahead, and, you know, sources told us last year. In addition, other experienced career prosecutors on that team also thought that they didn't have enough evidence to prove that Trump had criminal intent in the preparation of these financial statements. Now, some of these bits and pieces of evidence have come out in the New York Attorney General's civil lawsuit against the former President and his family members, you know, in that she had alleged that they had engaged in a decade long fraud by manipulating the value of many assets on the company's financial statements, and that Trumps have denied any wrongdoing. But, you know, that Bragg has said that he believes those career prosecutors, he thought more work needed to be done, and he said that Pomerantz's plane was not ready for takeoff.
