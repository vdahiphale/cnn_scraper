Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000 for the three charges, but as a first-time offender, he is likely to receive a lesser sentence.He also is facing another trial on the horizon. Hunter Biden's tax trial is set to start on September 5. Joining me now, criminal defense attorney Andrew Cherkasky. Andrew, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. Can you talk us through what is a likely sentence in this case? ANDREW CHERKASKY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  For the gun charge alone, it is not likely that he will see jail time. If you run the federal sentencing calculator you can get somewhere between about six to 10 months as kind of the recommended sentence, but that's well within the area of when judges give some sort of a more probationary type of sentence that doesn't have jail time. The problem for Hunter is that this conviction, even if it doesn't see jail time on its own -- that combined with the September tax trial, if he's convicted of that, would most certainly result in some degree of jail time, likely in the neighborhood of a number of years. And this conviction would be used as an aggravator in that case as a factor that would increase the sentence under the guidelines.",

What he was saying he was paying the taxes on versus what he was actually spending his money on. So there are kind of layers of that -- those tax issues at hand.If he's convicted of everything, this is the sort of case that could be generally in the single digits type of years of confinement. I would see it generally in kind of the two to five range. But it's a very difficult number to give you a good idea of, at this stage, since we don't know what he's convicted of and the federal sentencing guidelines, which were once effectively mandatory, are now discretionary. And so it's more of guidepost. This type of case, though, I think would be in the low single digits of years of confinement.",

We saw some have spoken on camera to other networks. This is what one told Politico. They said the defense's decision to call Biden's daughter Naomi to the stand didn't help his case. \"I thought it was a mistake,\" the juror told reporters on Tuesday. \"I think it was probably a strategy they should not have done.

But, yeah -- I mean, like you mentioned, this -- he talks a lot about we don't have an American dream anymore; it's an American nightmare. It reminds me a lot of the American carnage -- sort of, Trump's first inaugural speech. And I think it shows the question for Brown and all of these challengers will be how do you appeal to the base that's very pro- Trump in states like Nevada where Trump hasn't won?
