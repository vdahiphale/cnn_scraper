The country's semi-official FARS News reports three explosions near an army base in the province of Isfahan and an Iranian cyberspace official says its air defenses successfully shut down three drones.The country has now reopened its airspace after suspending flights to and from major cities. Israel has been vowing to retaliate since Iran launched that barrage of drones and missiles against Israel this past weekend. Live now to Jerusalem, and CNN's Nic Robertson.

We haven't heard in detail from Israeli officials about what they believe was comprised of in the attack.What we understand from the Iranians is that they switched on their air defenses in the early hours of the morning, because they had some suspicious activity. They also shut down their airspace, shut down their main airport in Tehran and Isfahan, unsure as major cities and put a no fly zone in effect, essentially, in the whole of the West of the country, which is the direction of course, that is really fighter jets would come in if they were flying from Israel towards Iran. But we've heard from the Iranian saying that actually, no aircraft came into their airspace, and what they're reporting about what happened around Isfahan, that there were three drones in that area. That at one point, the reports were that one of them had come down near an army base, or perhaps blown out some windows of some offices, there were reports that it could have been a radar base. But Iranian state media is now characterizing this, the sounds of explosions that people reported that they've heard as actually the air defense systems firing off at suspicious objects. So the Iranian state media is playing this as not the sound of drones, or missiles impacting exploding, but actually their defense systems. And there were similar reports in at least one other town in Iran and local media, in Iran at the moment have been characterizing these drones that the Iranian state media we're talking about as little quad copters. So really playing them down and minimizing what may or may not have happened. Again, we don't have independent verification on this of what happened on the ground. We haven't seen satellite imagery of what happened on the ground, and we don't have Israel's version of what they believe happened in Iran overnight. I have, however, talked with a regional intelligence source, who tells me his first reading and his understanding of the situation right now, is that this tit for tat is over that this is small, and that therefore, we're unlikely to see an Iranian response. Of course, situation may change, that could all change but that's the early read. And it does seem to comport with a picture that's being painted by Iranian media.",

I mean, they're being extremely tight lipped. We haven't heard anything public from anybody administration official, or the IDF for that matter.So, I spoke with a U.S. official earlier this evening, who did confirm that this was the Israeli response to that Iranian unprecedented historic attack last weekend with more than 300 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles. A second senior U.S. official told me that this was actually warned to the Biden administration earlier today. There were two sets Jim of high level conversations on Thursday. One was between the two countries defense ministers Yaov Gallant and Lloyd Austin. The second was actually ostensibly about a conversation about Rafah with the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan and senior Israeli officials. So, in those -- in that communication to the Biden ministration, they were told that there was an attack coming, and that it could happen in the coming days. And it came really quite quickly. The other thing, Jim, that we'd been told throughout the course of the week in anticipation of this attack tonight is that it would be limited in scope. One official telling CNN, that it could look something like a visible kinetic attack against a military target, which is what appears to have happened. And in trying to figure out what happened tonight, when you hear that this was -- that this took place around the city of Isfahan, one of the biggest cities in Ira, in in central western Iran. There is a major nuclear facility there. And so one of the big questions we had was, was that nuclear facility targeted, of course, Israel has long accused Iran of trying to develop a nuclear weapon that it could use against Israel. And I was told by a U.S. official that the nuclear facility was not the target. In fact, in leading up to tonight's strike, the U.S. had been given assurances that limited scope did not include nuclear or civilian targets. So Jim, it is clear to me in speaking with U.S. officials, they are not necessarily happy with what Israel ended up doing tonight. One official telling me, we did not green light this, we did not endorse this. But clearly Israel felt the need to try to reestablish deterrence go after Iran again, for that attack last weekend. And very interesting what Nic was just saying there about Iran downplaying what happened tonight, perhaps that's Iran looking for a way out and not having to retaliate. Because, as you were just saying, we heard from the foreign minister right here on CNN just a couple hours ago talking about an immediate and maximum response to Israel, if they decided to attack and now they have.

And remember that Iran last weekend said it was responding to Israel at the beginning of this month striking a diplomatic compound in Damascus. So that in itself was a retaliation. And Iran said that they believe the matter was concluded, that it had finished, and they had responded and they were trying to draw a line under it. Israel did not see it that way, given the unprecedented nature of the drone and missile attack and did feel that it had to give some kind of response. Of course, the question now is was the target of Israel's strike something that Iran can live with? Is it something that Tehran can put to rest now and not feel the need to retaliate.

But for them again it's a question of how do you respond to this latest attack? So either Iran brushes this off and suggests that this was a failed attack that Iran intercepted many of the incoming missile strikes. And this would be supported by some of the (INAUDIBLE) way the Iranian state media has been reporting about this, clearly trying to downplay it.

Iran has now lifted suspensions of civilian flights that were imposed after reports of explosions in the Isfahan region, central part of the country.A U.S. official confirmed to CNN that Israel launched attacks hours ago on Iran. Israel's military is still not officially commenting. HOLMES: An Iranian news agency says the explosions happened near an army base where fighter jets are stationed. But the report says the target could also have been a nearby military radar. Iranian media says nuclear facilities in the region are secure. The U.S. officials say those facilities were not the targets. All right. For more now on CNN's exclusive interview with the Iranian foreign minister, He spoke with our Erin Burnett just hours before the Israeli strike on Iran about the tit for tat attacks between the two countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Our missiles and drones did reach our two intended targets. The attack was known to have come even though they didn't know the precise time, but they knew that it would occur fairly soon. It was a successful operation and a decisive response and a clear message to the Zionist regime.",

And as of course, you know, there are many dividing lines in the Middle East between countries, tribal divisions, religious divisions, you name it. But the thing that has really united countries diplomatically over the past couple of weeks has been their response to this back-and-forth between the Israelis and the Iranians? Virtually all countries in this region, save for the ones that are directly involved, have been calling for restraint, calling for everyone to take a breath, dial down the temperature, and try to figure out how to resolve this peacefully because you have already seen in the wake of the war in Gaza, an expansion of the conflict. You have seen regular strikes on Iranian proxy groups and others in Iraq and Syria. Of course, you've had the U.S. striking targets in Yemen in response to what the Houthis are doing there. You've had a back-and-forth between the Israelis and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And so nobody wants to see this expand even further and surely, when we do start seeing more reactions Jim, there will be some eye rolls in there because many countries in this region, Egyptians summed it up after the last Iranian attack on Israel saying that look, we saw this coming. This is something that we -- you know, the attacks, the sort of proxy war in the region has not helped the situation in Gaza, has only enflamed tensions in the region. That's a similar message to what the Turks have been saying that look, this war in Gaza is sort of putting everyone on edge as has the back- and-forth between Iran and the Israelis. The Turks, by the way, have been working as an intermediary, had been working as an intermediary between the Americans and the Iranians leading up to the Iranian strike on Israel. And so while the U.S. is using countries in the region to get a message to Iran not to strike back, a lot of countries in this part of the world are sort of cynical about why the West can't deliver the same kind of message to Israel that look, we are telling the Iranians to cool it. But the U.S. and the West has not been able to successfully convince the Israelis to do the same, Jim.",
