Sudan's Military Chief exclusively telling CNN he believes this is a coup. We will be bringing you eyewitness's testimony from Khartoum. But first, your headlines; the sour preeminent critic and human rights activists Vladimir Kara Murza has been given 25 years in prison after publicly condemning Moscow's war on Ukraine Amnesty International describing the sentencing as reminiscent of Stalin era repression. The judge in Dominion voting systems defamation case against FOX News has formally pushed back opening statements. The change comes as \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports an out of court settlement could be in the works. And in Missouri protests have been taking place in response to a teenager being shot in the head after he accidentally went to the wrong home. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\"! Now the sound of mortars and artillery ringing out in Sudan as intense combat between the country's military and the powerful paramilitary group the rapid support forces rages on for a third day. The violence erupting again after years of political upheaval, a major flashpoint being the coup in 2019, overthrowing longtime ruler Omar Al Bashir, almost one hundred civilians have reportedly been killed and the fierce fighting across Sudan has left hopes for a peaceful transition. Two civilian were in tatters. So tonight, we ask, how did we get here? Witness says report hospitals in Sudan are being targeted and heads as governments across the world issue urgent calls for a ceasefire. Here's how we got to this point. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS (voice over): A battle for power between Sudan's national army and a strong paramilitary group that operates without reprieve. At the heart of the conflict are these two men, Sudan's Military Leader Abdel Fattah al- Burhan, and the Commander of the Rapid Support Forces or RSF Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemetti. Until recently, the two were allies. They work together to topple Sudan's Former Dictator President Omar Al Bashir in 2019, and played a crucial role in orchestrating the country's military coup in 2021. But tensions have been rising in the uneasy alliance with both sides clashing over how to restore civilian rule? So how did the struggle for power in Sudan begin? In 2013, the RSF evolved from the -- weed militia that had earlier fought a rebellion in the Darfur region, under the authority of then President Bashir. It was led by Hemetti himself, who was implicated in human rights violations and atrocities. In 2017 Sudan passed a law legitimizing the RSF as an independent security force. In late 2018 protests started in a northern city in part of the price of bread. And those protests spread rapidly to the Capital Khartoum. After months of protests in April 2019 Hemetti turned against Bashir and the army ousted him from office. A few months later, the main opposition coalition led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and the ruling Military Council led by Hemetti signed a power sharing deal that paved the way for transitional government and eventually elections. But a little over two years later, the military effectively took control, dissolving the power sharing government and temporarily detaining Hamdok. The next day protesters took to the streets to denounce the military coup. And those protests have continued sporadically ever since. In December of last year, civilian and military leaders signed a deal to start the process of a new two year political transition. But they have yet to agree on a political solution. The fierce fighting across Sudan right now has dashed hopes for a peaceful transition to civilian and democratic law. And as forces loyal to the two rival leaders by full control dozens of civilians are left caught in the middle. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Because today, the General Burhan, the Leader of the Sudanese Military has taken a unilateral decision to dissolve the rapid support forces and declared a rebellious force. In a short while ago, our Nima Elbagir spoke with General Burhan who said that General Hemetti -- against the state, and therefore he will be captured and dealt with on that basis. So these are fighting words, this is not a consolidated return to hear the Leader of Sudan, the Leader of the Military declare that his deputy mutiny against the state that he committed an act of rebellion, and therefore he will be treated in that way, is a really a big escalation in this conference has been running since Saturday. I want to read a section of this interview that Nima just did with Burhan. He says this is an attempted coup in the rebellion against the state. And he says that he will be tried in the court of law. So if that were to happen, that's would be significant. And now you understand why when I spoke with General Hemetti yesterday, he did not want to appear on camera, because he didn't want to reveal anything that might give clues as to where he is. He appeared to be apologetic to the people of Sudan about the violence they have seen. And he said, General Burhan appears to have lost control of his army, I want to play a bit of that for you.

Now that it has happened, in fact, and the classes have started and so on, I think, you know, it was bound to happen. But it's happening in the worst way possible.

In his speech at the New York StockExchange in the previous hour, he slammed President Joe Biden and pitched a plan that he hopes House Republicans can pass to raise the debt ceiling. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): In the coming weeks, the house will vote on a bill to lift the debt ceiling into the next year. Save taxpayers trillions of dollars, make us less dependent upon China; curve our high inflation, all without touching Social Security and Medicare. Simply put, it puts it all on a fiscal responsible path in three ways. It limits, it saves and it grows. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Right, the delay is not unusual. Those are the words of the judge in the Dominion voting systems defamation case against FOX News. Opening statements have been pushed back to Tuesday. They were originally expected to begin a couple of hours ago. The change comes as the Wall Street Journal, owned by FOX Chairman Rupert Murdoch reports and out of court settlement could be in the works Dominion says it was defamed when FOX hosts claimed it illegally rigged the 2020 election against Donald Trump. For its part, FOX News is denying the allegations. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us now live from Wilmington, Delaware, where the case is set to be tried. So, this is a delay. At the same time, we're hearing, there could be some kind of deal or settlement happening behind the scenes. Could these two events be correlated?",

      "sentences": "It's totally possible. They might be meeting as we speak, behind closed doors to try to hammer out a last-minute deal.But if that is what they're doing, they're not saying anything about it. We've checked in with FOX, we've checked in with dominion. No one is publicly commenting about the situation and had a very brief court hearing this morning. The judge was also pretty tight lipped. He said it was his decision to delay this, the start of this trial from today to tomorrow so just a one-day delay at this point. He said this was not unusual, basically telling the public not to read too deeply into the situation. So, if there is a last-minute settlement announced tonight or tomorrow morning, then obviously the case would be over. But if there is no announcement, if there is no settlement, and that means we will all be back here in Wilmington tomorrow morning 9 am that would be the end of jury selection and the start of opening statements. If this case ends up going to trial, they predict that it will last perhaps six weeks. Some of the biggest names in right wing media are expected to be called as witnesses if it happens, so we will be waiting here in Wilmington to see if there's a deal, if not, the trial of the century.",
