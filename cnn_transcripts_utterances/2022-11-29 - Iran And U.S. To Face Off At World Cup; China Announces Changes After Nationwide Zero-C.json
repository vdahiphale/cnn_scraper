Where no matter the outcome of the matches today, it sure to be a momentous day of football. With protests dividing the nation at home and politics dividing it abroad, can sport unite Iran on the global stage as it faces the U.S. in what is a crucial match at the World Cup later tonight? At the time, the stakes are high even before the players step onto the pitch. If the U.S. loses against Iran, it'll be eliminated from the tournament altogether, something that would evoke painful memories of its exit in 1998. In other developments, we are hearing that the families of Iran's World Cup team have been threatened with prison and even torture if their players don't, quote, \"behave\" ahead of the game. That is according to a source involved with the security of the games. Whatever happens tonight, it'll be a hugely symbolic matchup for both sides. We are covering all sides of this for you. Don Riddell is in Doha while Jomana Karadsheh is monitoring developments in Iran from neighboring Turkey. Don, let's start with you. You are outside the stadium. It is going to be a big match both on and off the pitch. Let's start with the game of football itself. What are you looking out for in today's game? DON RIDDELL, CNN ANCHOR, \"WORLD SPORT\": Well, Becky, it's hard to really answer that question because I can't remember game where I feel as though I'm going to need eyes on the back of my head. Of course, I'm going to be spinning attention what's happening on the field. But just as much attention to what's going on in the crowd before the game amongst the fans. Because it really feels as though so many storylines have all collided just at this moment. Of course, it's a crunch game for both teams. This is the decisive game in Group B. The American team have to win or they're going home. Iran, would settle for a draw or a win would see them through. It's going to be fascinating to see a both teams approach this game. Iran were thrashed in the opening match by England. They got a brilliant win against Wales in their second game. The American side have got to draw so far. So they're going up to up their game from what they've done before. But that's what's happening on the field. Around this game of football, there's so many other things going on. You may notice that we're standing by the complimentary team flag concession stand, which is open for business now. The gates have literally just opened. Fans are about to be coming into the stadium. Of, course the flag is what has dominated the buildup to this entire game. This is the flag of the Islamic Republic. Of course, you may remember, it is the emblem of the Islamic Republic. The U.S. Soccer Federation removed from the flag for one of their graphics, which was only up for a brief moment in time but it caused an absolute storm of controversy. It has certainly motivated the Iranian camp ahead of this game.",

I want to bring up the surreal pictures that we saw after the Wales game. That was the game that Iran played against Wales. Iran police celebrating on the streets of Tehran. That would've been very painful for many who would have seen that, to a certain extent, as the celebration of a win by the regime.

Iran won it, 2-1, and sent the United States home. It feels like a very different time now. Things are much more intense and much more heated now. For example, it was just a few years ago that the United States government killed Qasem Soleimani, who was the most senior military commander in Iran. And there was a period of a couple of weeks where it falls of the two countries might actually be at war. When the World Cup draw was made, back in April, Soleimani was still alive. And we have seen what's happened over the last few months in Iran. That's what's happening now with this game going on. On that occasion back then in 1998, the two teams came together before the game. Famously, there was a joint photograph. There was an exchange of gifts where both sides were so generous that the joke was the captains can barely walk back to the touch line to get rid of them or to put them down before they kicked off. In the end of the American -- Iranian team won as I've said. The American coach from that time has been reflecting. He said, at that time, he was asked by FIFA and the United States Soccer Federation not to make the game political. He says, in hindsight, he regrets that. He says he should have done. It would motivate his players more. He felt as though at that a lot of Americans had died because of pro-Iranian policies. If he could do it all over again, he would. Now we're here with an Iranian team that must be just so conflicted with what's going on. We know that some of them are sympathetic with the demonstrators. One of them has even told me as much. And the American team are just caught in the middle of all this. It is going to be fascinating to see how both sides handle it out on the field.",
