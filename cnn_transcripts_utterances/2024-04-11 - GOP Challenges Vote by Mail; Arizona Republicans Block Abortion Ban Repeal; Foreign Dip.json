They warned users to stick with licensed professionals in offices for cosmetic treatments.The Anti-Defamation League has released its first report card on how 85 American college campuses are handling anti-Semitism. More than a dozen schools, including Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, received a failing grade. Another 53 got, C's or D's. Only two got an A from the ADL, Brandeis and Elon.

And others, the GOP is defending restrictions on ballot drop boxes. Those are playing out as the party is pushing its bank your vote campaign, urging Republican voters to turn their ballots in early, use in person early voting or vote by mail.

He repeatedly says that it is rife with fraud and contributed to his 2020 loss.But at the same time, the party needs to reassure him and its - his supporters, voters, that this is a good way to go. So, you're seeing a lot of lawsuits that are emerging in places that sort of try to tighten the rules on mail-in voting. For instance, in Mississippi, the Republican National Committee just filed a lawsuit arguing that the ballots received up to five business days after the election, they can be postmarked on Election Day, but that that practice should end. That voting should happen on one day. So, you're seeing lots of pockets of this around the country. North Carolinas is another state where the law has changed. And the Republican-controlled legislature says, no, ballots need to come in on Election Day. We won't count those that arrive after that day.",

There's nothing he can do.When the legislature speaks, the states highest court speaks, you realize what a problematic situation that Arizona women are in, 1.6 million women there of reproductive age. That's between the ages of 15 and 49, of which 38 percent are Hispanic and 43 percent white. Where are these women going to go? We don't really have good, empirical evidence to tell us how these women feel about this draconian move now. I mean this is not only taking women back in time, this is unsafe on every level. And when Democrats message that, the fact that there's no exceptions for fetal abnormalities, rape, incest, you realize what's at play here. And Donald Trump is understanding that but doesn't know what to do. So, like usual, he is going to say something will happen, but it will not. It will go to the people. It will go on a ballot.

After all that, who would say, hey, let's let the states run things. Let's let the states decide (ph). The states, at least some of them, are really cracking down. And this is not going to get better for Republicans because it's the real world. It's not just theoretical. This is what I mean. The Journal of the American Medical Association in January released a study. In the 14 states that had the strictest abortion laws after Dobbs, 64,565 women became pregnant by rape and were unable to get abortion treatment in their state, 64,565 as of January. Now, they just stopped counting in January. Tragically, the rapes didn't stop. So, these are real women suffering in real states.

That includes folks at thinktanks, Republican-leaning think tanks here who might have policy insights into where Trump would go in a potential second term, and also former Trump administration officials who worked with him in the first term and would know the direction that he would head in a second term.I think it's important to note, John, that this flurry of activity really wasn't happening when Trump was running in 2016 because the assumption that was baked in was that Hillary Clinton was going to win. And so you talked to diplomats and they say that they learned something because they weren't well-prepared when Trump first came into office. And particularly those diplomats were here in Washington for Trump's first term. They say that they have now learned that relationships are critical to having a working relationship with the Trump administration. And that is exactly what they are working on now. But when you talk to diplomats who are new to town or diplomats from smaller countries, they're having a hard time setting up some of these meetings. But they are learning things in these meetings. And particularly Europeans who are worried about the future of NATO. What they are being told, I'm told, according to sources familiar with these meetings, is that hitting that 2 percent of GDP spending for NATO countries is simply going to be a non-negotiable for Trump. They say, listen to what he has said. Don't try and think that he's going to go in any other direction. And one thing that's being considered is a two tier system of NATO. So those countries that hit the 2 percent spending, they're covered by Article Five, which means that an attack on one nation is an attack on all. That their alliance really will apply and they'll defend those countries. And then the countries that don't meet the 2 percent would not actually qualify for that Article Five, which would be a drastic change for NATO. So, that's something that Europeans are looking at, talking about. And then the other thing that they are asking in these meetings with Trump allies is what he's going to do on Ukraine, and that is really a question that is alive and well here in Washington right now. And I'm told that one of the things that Trump would do, either right after he is elected, or right after he is inaugurated, would be to reach out to both Putin and Zelenskyy to try and set up conversations, to try and come to some sort of agreement for the way forward, to bring the Ukraine war to a swift end. Now, we have heard him talk about the fact that he would end the war in 24 hours. Of course, that wouldn't happen. But what these folks say is that he really wants to start conversations and there are concerns among Europeans who are hearing this, that that might mean Ukraine giving up territory. But those who are close to Trump say that wouldn't necessarily be the case. You'd have to watch and see where those negotiations go. John.",

There are a lot of elementary schools out in remote areas of those counties. And this was designed to bring about a line of defense, if, in fact, someone tried to breach any kind of security doors and enter into a school. And so, I'm looking more at it as a help for those rural schools. And if metro areas, urban, suburban areas don't want to implement this type of policy, that's fine. It's totally permissive.
