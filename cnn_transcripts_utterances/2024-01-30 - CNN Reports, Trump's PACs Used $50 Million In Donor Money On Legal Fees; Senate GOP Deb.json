Now, that is a lot of money. And it would pay for a lot of campaign commercials or online advertising or staffers going door to door asking for votes, or if you're Donald Trump, it pays for legal fees, lots of legal fees. Sources tell CNN that $50 million is how much the PACs supporting Trump have raised and then donated to the cause of keeping Trump out of jail. Now, mind you, this is all legal, but a spokesman for one of those PACs insists tonight to The New York Times that every dollar being raised by MAGA Inc. is going directly to defeating Joe Biden in November. But at least some of those dollars and cents are, as of this moment, being siphoned off for courtroom costs. It's part of the bargain if your preferred presidential candidates faced indictments and trials of all sorts. Now, right now, at any moment, a judge in New York is expected to reveal just how Trump will be punished for committing fraud. Will his empire in Gotham be completely shut down? And, second, speaking of his businesses, will he be forced to pay nearly $400 million in that case, and nearly 90 million more for the E. Jean Carroll defamation verdict just this week? Now, third, we're awaiting an appeals court decision on Trump's argument that presidents deserve absolute immunity. Is he above the law? Fourth, will Fani Willis be the one to prosecute Trump in Georgia? She herself is under investigation for an alleged affair with one of her prosecutors. And, finally, the Supreme Court justices are weighing whether Trump can be kicked off the ballot all together over the 14th Amendment. And tonight, there's a group of former Republican governors who are bucking the trend of their party. They are arguing before the Supreme Court that Trump is, in fact, disqualified. Former Montana Governor Marc Racicot joins me now. Mr. Racicot, thank you so much for being here and for joining us tonight. Let's start with your reaction to what we were just laying out. Trump's PACs, we're now learning, using $50 million in donor funds to not pay for his actual campaign, but to pay for all of these legal bills. What do you make of that? FMR. GOV. MARC RACICOT (R-MT): Well, it's a mess. And, obviously, I wonder about the contributors who pour in all of these contributions in small dosages over the course of time are aware of the fact that it's going to provide a defense to all of these different actions, paying lawyers and expert witnesses, and not going into efforts to try and make certain you communicate with the public and the people that you want to serve. So, it's unfortunate, sad, and, in some respects, I think it's disgraceful.",

And there were certain rules of etiquette, and we tried to observe civility being provided to one another at this moment in time. Of course, he has lanced all those bubbles, and pretty much they have dissipated because of his behavior and his actions and his verbiage over the course of time has been cruel and insensitive, and at the end of the day has made us a coarser society.

Those are all issues.What I'm really terribly concerned about is the violation of the Constitution here and the inclination to try to gloss over it. The fact of the matter is you don't have a right to be a candidate in America. You have a right to vote in America, but you don't have a right to be a candidate. And to be a candidate, you have to meet certain qualifications that are set out by the Constitution. They focused upon birth, age, residence.

And tonight, so goddamn dysfunctional, that is an exact quote, and it's what one senator is calling Washington, D.C. It is an indictment of the people who work there, and their inability to get bipartisan things done, specifically a border bill anywhere near the finish line. And Democrat Senator Jon Tester, he's not the only one who thinks that. John Thune, he's the number two in the Senate, and he told reporters tonight, quote, people are just waiting. They're sitting on their hands until language for a bill is finalized. Now, there's a debate among Senate leaders about just scrapping the border bill all together. That plan would be to shelve the border bill and just move ahead with a separate bill that includes money for Ukraine and Israel. So, what's the takeaway in all of this? Well, doing things in Washington isn't something that people there are great at. And blaming people for not doing things is something that they are. Lawmakers can teach a master class in that. Just listen to Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN): The Biden administration was in the Supreme Court just last week seeking permission to take down the razor wire at our southern border that Greg Abbott put up. That is not good faith. REP.

I'm glad that you're having me back on with you all.But with what took place on Saturday, it shows that, yes, there are Republicans that are disgruntled with the border policy, with the Biden border policy. And people are very frustrated and very upset and concerned about it. It was not an official OKGOP action, but people are very frustrated and upset. Regarding what Senator Lankford is working on, we haven't seen any final language. We don't know exactly what he's working on. So, I would say that it's presumptive to go ahead and condemn someone who is trying to find a solution. Personally, I would say 5,000 people crossing the border is too many. I would say zero people should be allowed to be crossing our border. We should secure our border. I'm of the aside that if we can't shut down the border, we should shut down the government. But this will have conversations at least taking place. And so, yes, there are people that are very disgruntled.

And it can't be a press corps that everyone accuses of bias, right? I mean, if there were no referees, there would be no football, no basketball, no baseball. The idea that there's an independent referee judging things, they might have their own opinion, but they don't apply that to the outcome. That is crucial to the press. And the idea -- I find it very hypocritical that people accuse the press of bias, but the news consumers themselves are enormously biased, right? So, when people in the different political camps reject information because it's disfavorable to their candidates, you can't then accuse the press of bias, right, because the consumers themselves are thinking like that.
