Hamas militants are urging people there to defy the orders and to stay in their homes. But we are seeing some Palestinians heeding that warning.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Tel Aviv yesterday. He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan. We have team coverage with correspondents on the ground in Israel. Let's start with Becky Anderson in East Jerusalem. Becky, there's a large Palestinian population where you are. Hamas has called for a day of rage. What's the scene right now?",

Where are they going to be housed? The U.N. and other international organizations in Gaza are saying it's simply not possible, given the number of people and the circumstances. There's an active war. People are afraid to just move in the street. So moving 1.1 million people from Northern Gaza to the Southern part is something that's hard to imagine being done on practical terms. Now, I've been in Gaza before. For instance, in 2014 the Israelis ordered the evacuation of civilians from Northern communities, ones near the Israeli border. For the most part, people were able to do that, because you could get out by walking. You could get out by riding on a donkey cart, perhaps, if you could get a car ride out. But that was relatively small numbers compared to Gaza City. Gaza City is huge. Where are you going to put all these people when you move them South when none of the relief supplies -- tents, food, water, medicine -- have been allowed into the Gaza Strip? It's very difficult to imagine how this could possibly be done. And Hamas is calling on people to stay in their homes, to stay put. So, this is going to be very difficult, and certainly, if people do not or cannot evacuate those areas the Israelis are calling them to leave, and this ground offensive goes ahead, probability is, it will be a bloodbath.",

But by and large, it's -- it's a situation where people are demonstrating, but the border in South Lebanon is quiet today. I actually had an opportunity to speak to the Lebanese information minister, who was going on a tour of the border area, and he downplayed the possibility that Lebanon will be drawn into this war.

The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 1,500 people have died so far in Gaza after days of Israel's air strikes in a total blockade without water. With us now again this morning, military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. The U.N. says this is impossible.

Poppy, good morning to you. Yes, when Peter Lerner was talking about this, he was talking about this area of evacuation right here. So this area is the Northern part of Gaza. It is the most densely populated area in this strip right here. So over 1.1 million people live right where my hand is. Now, when you look at the possibilities here, we're talking about going down this way to the South, toward the Rafah crossing. So this is going to be a very, very difficult thing for -- for them to do. The Rafah crossing is right on the Egyptian border right here. This is what it looks like when normal times, more or less normal times are present. It is a very difficult place to get to under these conditions because, quite frankly, the crossing is closed. And it's going to be very hard for all the citizens of Gaza from the Northern part to not only go to the South but, if they're told to move out of Gaza, the Egyptians won't let them do that.
