That's after the arrest of New York architect and serial murder suspect, Rex Heuermann. Police say they can prove three murders and he's a key suspect in a fourth.Authorities have broke off and searched a storage unit near his home. And during a search of that house, investigators said they collected a trove of evidence, including more than 200 firearms found stashed in a vault behind a locked metal basement door. Let's get into this with CNN national correspondent, Brynn Gingras. Brynn, what more can you tell us about the items that officials found in his home?",

John, how hard is it to get into the mind of someone that's capable of committing these sorts of crimes? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, in this case, it's not as hard as it used to be. The digital footprint of Rex Heuermann has been a virtual road map for authorities, as very much like alleged serial killers we've seen in the past. David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam, who went on a rampage killing people in the 1970s in New York City, was a quiet postal worker by day who used to walk people to their cars because they were afraid of the killer, which was him. Ted Bundy had a series of respectable jobs. So here you have a man, who owns and runs a Manhattan architectural firm that deals with regulators and government officials, wears a suit and tie to work, gets on the train, and has been operating, allegedly, for more than a decade as a cold, cruel, calculating sexual sadist and serial killer.",

Which is why, where Brynn is at the search site, and particularly in that storage area, they're looking for any clues or things that he would have kept from the victims.",

Video shows him struggling to make it through a song before he's seen running off the stage. The 46-year-old says he thinks he suffered a combination of dehydration and heat exhaustion after playing golf all day. He stopped short of saying it was a heatstroke, adding, quote, \"I don't think it was quite that serious.\" Aldean says he received two I.V.s following the incident and that he's going on with his concert tour. Meantime, in Spain's Port of Ibiza, environmental activists spray painted a super superyacht in an act of protest. The activists posted this video showing them standing in front of the $300 million vessel holding a banner that says, \"You consume, others suffer.\" The activists then sprayed red and black paint on the yacht. Multiple shipping industry news sites say the superyacht belongs to a Nancy Walton Laurie, the billionaire heiress of Walmart. And former employees of Twitter Africa, who were laid off after Elon Musk bought the company, say they've never received severance pay nearly nine months later. The employees say they accepted Twitter's offer to pay them three months' severance and relocation costs. But they've not received a dime or heard from the company. Twitter and Musk now face multiple lawsuits where plaintiffs are claiming the company has failed to pay what they're owed. Brianna?",

Major League Soccer's Inter Miami formally introduced World Cup champion, Lionel Messi, to thousands of fans during a rainy celebration last night.It comes just the day after he officially inked a deal with the club that will fetch him between $50 million and $60 million a year through the end of the 2025 season. Despite the huge payout, the seven-time World Player of the Year is still just like us, he's a Florida man now. Fans spotting Messi getting groceries at Publix ahead of his big reveal. Messi's first match, keep in mind, could come as soon as this Friday. And we'll get to how much those tickets are going for in just a moment. Joining us now is soccer podcaster and commenter for \"MLS Season Pass,\" Chris Wittyngham. Chris, let's start with the bona fides. I tried to list out all of Lionel Massi's accomplishments, and he's won everything. Talk to us about his greatness. Is he really the GOAT? CHRIS WITTYNGHAM, SOCCER PODCASTER &amp; COMMENTER, \"MLS SEASON PASS\": I think so. You can have a well-reasoned debate about Pele, obviously, who came to the U.S. back in the 1970s, having won multiple World Cups, while Lionel Messi going one to one. If you look at the European record of a player like Cristiano Ronaldo, they are a few more champion and league titles. But to me, putting it all together and also not even just listing off the bona fides, as you mentioned, but also the watching of a player, who I think has completely mastered this game at every level, I think Messi is the greatest player who ever lived. There are reasonable debates. Otherwise, I think that you combine everything, the accolades, style of play, the joy of watching him play, I just think he's the greatest. And he's now coming to Major League Soccer.",

I think people are waiting for sort of a boom moment where it becomes the biggest league in the world.But I think Major League Soccer is fighting up against quite a lot to get to that level, particularly from a financial standpoint. If you look at the competitive environment in the Premier League, in that league, even now with the Saudi Pro League coming in and spending a ton of money on players, it's really going to be very hard for Major League Soccer to compete on that level. But everything are steps forward. If you go back to when David Beckham joined the league in 2007, the league had 12 teams. Now they have 29. There's been an enormous amount of growth in stadiums and the quality of play and the quality of the American player. And the quality of the American player that also goes abroad and plays in major European leagues on a more consistent basis on a level that has never happened before. So everything is a step forward. I think what people are hoping, with Lionel Messi joining Inter Miami and Major League Soccer, is that it is a bigger step forward than all of the other ones. But sort of the impact of that remains to be seen of what the traveling tour will be like when he plays in New York and L.A., which he will in the last few games of the regular season. But you have to imagine that this supercharges him and begins a conversation of, all right, how does this sport, which will host -- next summer, will host the World Cup, the club and International Variety, in 2025 and 2026, take advantage of this moment and really use it to have it be a launching pad for the sport in this country.",
