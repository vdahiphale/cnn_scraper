So, that's part of those charges.The others relate to the other minors who were injured. Remember, we have four deaths, but we have other injuries and those that are being hospitalized due to their injuries who are also victims in this case. So, those child cruelty charges relate to those. And again, all of these charges, as was pointed out, we've seen how the manslaughter charges play out, but when we're talking about these murder charges and child cruelty charges, and that conduct against the father being that of another person, his minor son, that is a new and novel legal theory. So, it's going to be interesting how this plays out, and especially if he does opt to have what's called a preliminary hearing, you have a bit of a mini trial there. And I could see the father in this case saying, yes, let's have a preliminary hearing to see if there's probable cause to support these higher level charges of second-degree murder. We will learn a lot during that process because that's almost like a mini trial with a difference legal standard of probable cause. So, that's going to fill in the gaps that we have in what we've learned from this investigation from that May 20 (ph) meeting to the present day in this tragic event.",

We're aware of the allegations that they weren't secured. He had access to them. But the things that they could see - and we learned some of this from the Crumbley case is, what's contained in emails, text chats? What's contained in this boy's computer. What is contained in the communications to, in this particular set of charges, the father, from the mother, from the grandparents, from the school, from others that are going to be demonstrative possibly of his awareness of the fact that this is a child in crisis. The first day of school, he went out to see the counselor because of anxiety. The second day of school, of course, we have the shooting. But in CNN's own interviews with various relatives, they're saying it was obvious that he was a child that was going through crisis. So, all of that can factor into the, what did he know and when did he know it part that will be an additive to, would a reasonable person have not secured these weapons and was this negligence that could lead to serious injury or death.",

Remember, a few years ago, most people predicted this would not be possible to get to an unemployment rate at or near 4 percent this quickly and to have the kind of job growth that we've had, nearly 16 million created since President Biden and Vice President Harris came into office. And what we always wanted to see happen was a transition from the really rapid rate of job growth that we saw initially, to a more steady and stable rate of growth. And these current numbers reflect that. At the same time, we continue to see strong labor force participation. And, in fact, women's labor force participation rate broke - set a new record, broke our last record, which was also sent under this administration, demonstrating, again, that, you know, that the - that the - that the growth in jobs and who's getting these jobs is really widely shared.",

You know, we think about it as reaching our cruising altitude. These are numbers that are steady, that are stable, and we continue to look at all the markers. Again, the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, wages.You know, we said from the beginning we were going to focus on building an economy that put workers first, in which workers got their fair share, in which every job was a good job. And we're counting now, not just the number of jobs - again, those numbers are really solid, but also the quality of those jobs, which is why later today I'm traveling with the president to Michigan where he's going to issue an executive order, making sure that the continued investments of the Biden-Harris administration are creating good jobs that allow families to make a decent living, spend time with their families, and retire with dignity.",
