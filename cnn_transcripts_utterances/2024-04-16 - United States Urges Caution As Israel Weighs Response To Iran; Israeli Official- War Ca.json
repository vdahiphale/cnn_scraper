But the Israeli sources saying that, that now Hamas has pulled back from that. They are saying there will be less than 20, and at the same time, they are asking for more Palestinian prisoners to be released in this first phase and more, who are currently serving life sentences to be part of that relief -- release considering these demands to be too much. And we do understand that these talks have hit a wall. Now, the Israeli source says the thinking within Israel is that Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza is not willing to do a deal at this point. That is the way that they are reading this. And we have heard from a senior Biden administration official recently saying that Hamas has told negotiators and mediators, they simply don't have 40 hostages within that those parameters. That group of people that are still alive, what they are expecting from the U.S. side certainly was that Hamas would make up those numbers either with the younger male hostages that they could release or with the remains of some of those who lost their lives in Gaza. So, at this point, we're hearing it is a serious step backwards. And there is no clear view of how this move -- moves forward at this point. Rosemary?",

Once jury selection began, Trump was active at times conferring with his lawyer and holding the questionnaire up to read as the judge questioned jurors. Prosecutors also asked the judge to find Trump for social media posts, attacking witnesses involved in the case, saying he violated a gag order. The judge scheduled a hearing for next week to settle that matter. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. It may be the only case against Trump to face a jury before the 2024 election.

Everyone deserves a presumption of innocence. Mr. Trump certainly does. He's innocent as we speak. In the event, however, he's convicted, the judge can use that to sentence him. And remember, right, although people are saying conventional wisdom, he'll get no jail time. It's only probation. I'm not sure that that's true. This is a felony offence. It could be sentenced up to four years. And if you lie, judges, I can tell you from past experience, do not like that. And it could lead to a prison term.

Four different plans. Now, the ultimate questions, will they ultimately be cobbled together in one package and sent back to the Senate for final action here? That is some of the process is uncertain, but it's significant, because he's being warned by Republican hardliners not to tie any aid to Israel to any aid to Ukraine.
