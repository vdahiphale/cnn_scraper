INSIDE POLITICS, the best reporting from inside the corridors of power, starts now. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. President-elect, Donald Trump's stunning Saturday evening announcement is sending shockwaves through Washington and will put Senate Republicans in a bind as they return to the Capitol tomorrow and confront this question whether to confirm Kash Patel, a controversial MAGA firebrand, to head the FBI. Now, Patel is a Trump loyalist who has risen to prominence -- prominence on the hard right, and he's previously vowed to go after what he believes is a deep state government conspiracy against Trump. Now, this is a norm breaking move. FBI directors serve a ten year term, all intended to insulate themselves from political pressure and changes in administrations. But Trump seems ready to fire the FBI director that he himself appointed in 2017, Christopher Wray, who has three years left on his term. All of this after Trump's repeated promises to investigate and prosecute -- prosecute his political opponents. Now, also this weekend, Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, found himself engulfed in controversy again, while Trump named his ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, who previously served in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges and, oh, by the way, he's also the father of Jared Kushner, Trump's son in law. But let's start with the Kash Patel news and CNN's Zach Cohen, who has been leading the way on this story. So, Zach, tell us what kind of impact Patel would have on the FBI if confirmed.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Manu, Kash Patel has certainly shown he knows how to talk the talk. As far as saying all the things Trump would want to hear from a prospective FBI director nominee. And look, that includes things like pledging to turn the FBI headquarters into a, quote, museum of the deep state on day one in the job. He's also promised to come after Trump's political enemies, both in the government and in the media.And so, loyalty is really Kash Patel's number one qualification and the reason behind -- the overwhelming reason behind Trump's decision to announce that he wants to install him as the FBI director and what form or fashion that could take remains to be seen. But as you said, Kash Patel is not just a controversial figure outside of Trump's orbit, but some of those people close to him have privately raised questions, not only about Kash Patel's stated views and the way that he wants to run the FBI, but also about his competency, questioning if he actually is capable of carrying out the kind of sweeping changes at the bureau that he's promised to do in various interviews. But ultimately, this selection really does underscore the influence of people like Steve Bannon and folks on the right of Trump's orbit who have been supporting and publicly pushing Kash Patel for this job. Elon Musk weighing in and seemingly endorsing Kash Patel as the FBI director pick on X just a couple of weeks ago so really, this is coming to a head with this announcement from Donald Trump. It remains to be seen if and when, though Chris Wray will ultimately get fired or voluntarily resign. Donald Trump cannot push Chris Wray out until he's sworn in as president on January 20th. And as you said, these ten year terms for FBI directors are designed to really insulate them from political influence. But it seems like Trump wants to install somebody who is the exact opposite and was willing to carry out his political agenda.",

What is the picture that Trump is trying to paint here with his Pam Bondi -- he wanted Matt Gaetz, of course, to be the attorney general. That didn't happen. But Pam Bondi is very much a Trump loyalist. And if she gets the job, she would have obviously be in charge of law enforcement here in the policy for this country. Kash Patel, too, if he's in the FBI director. What is Trump? What does it say to you about what is Trump is trying to do with such critical law enforcement agency?",

I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.He thinks the FBI should be an instrument of presidential power not an independent agency. So given what the president-elect has said, given what Kash Patel has said, notably on Steve Bannon's podcast webcast, YouTube, whatever it is, there's no way, I think, to see this in any other way than the fact that this would be -- the Kash Patel would be an agent of the president-elect's retribution agenda, which he talked about on the campaign. That therefore, given the fact that the FBI is such a crucial agency in terms of combating crime terrorism, et cetera, that poses a very big question to Republican senators who are going to have to confirm him.",

And I think only Mike Pence was the one who was able to settle that particular dispute.There was a whole range of national security officials in the last Trump administration that didn't want Kash Patel near any of this.

We turn that around and say that other people.So the way that they -- you saw it in Patel's interviews, the way they conceive of this role is that is not that it is independent, it's that Democrats pretend it's independent and don't act that way that would be a surprise to Joe Biden, who has presided over a main justice that put his son -- I should say sentenced his son to prison, that he appointed a special counsel that produced a report that badly damaged his reelection, played a role in ending it. Democrats believe they have played by these rules, and they have not leaned on this. This is the power of narrative. This is nine years of Republicans saying that there never should be any investigation of Donald Trump in 2016, I should say and that if we get the reins of power, we're going to use the endless power of the state to go after them because they think it's been done to them.",

Too much regulation and we as a country, the U.S., almost lost our footing in the cryptocurrency world, and we call it digital assets. It's that's a more understandable name because chairman Gary Gensler at the SEC, didn't think it was safe or what have you. And so we drove a lot of talent away from the United States. We think that's going to change with a focus on crypto and A.I. There are five major platforms evolving in the world today. I mentioned A.I. as the biggest platform shift. Crypto or we call it blockchain technology. Digital assets is the second. Robotics, energy storage and multiomic sequencing. Those are all technology platforms that the U.S. must seize and harness really, and lead the way, much like we did in the Internet. We were about to lose that given our regulatory system. And I think a change in the regulatory system with both crypto and A.I. as prime focuses, is going to be quite meaningful. R2: So you're obviously an expert in the ups and downs of the stock market. I'm wondering what you think about Trump's proposed tariffs. You know, he has said on the campaign trail he would impose tariffs on 100 percent of imports.

And they want to help President Trump deal with some of the problems that are -- that he is really focused on. Immigration, of course, is one; drugs is another way outside of what I do. But they're at the table. That's the most important thing. The other thing I would say is, tariffs are tax increases. I'm not a fan of any tax increases, personally. But if they are offset by tax cuts, which is how the U.S. was run in its very early days, President Washington, for example ran the country that way. That does make some sense to us.",
