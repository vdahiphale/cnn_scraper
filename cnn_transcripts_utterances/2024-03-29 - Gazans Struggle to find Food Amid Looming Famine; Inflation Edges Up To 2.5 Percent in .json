Then one year ago, American Journalist Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia and charged with espionage today, he's still behind bars. Plus a record breaking fundraising event for U.S. President Joe Biden in New York and Beyonce drops her highly anticipated country album. Drowned out by bombs that is the description of any hope for a ceasefire in Gaza today from the UNICEF Spokesperson who's visited there repeatedly during the war. James Elder says cities are unrecognizable and the hunger situation has rapidly worsened. And he warns the Israeli Prime Minister's promised operation in Rafah could cause in his words, the biggest catastrophe of the swamp. His comments come with Israel siege around Al-Shifa hospital now in its 12th day, and there is reported Israeli activity in Syria as well. Syria's state news agency says Israeli airstrikes hit targets outside of Aleppo. Reuters reports several Hezbollah fighters are -- killed in the strikes.

Now the Israeli saying that they're continuing what they call a precise operational activity in the area the Israelis claimed to have killed what they call 200 terrorists, of course, because journalists are not allowed into the Gaza Strip beyond those who are still there. Palestinian journalists, we don't -- we're not able to confirm the veracity of that claim. But what we understand is that the situation in and around the hospital, which is a complex, it's not just one building is increasingly more difficult. The Palestinian civil defense organization in Gaza says that they are receiving phone calls from people trapped under the rubble in the area around Shifa Hospital. So the fighting is going on inside the hospital complex, but also in the area around it. They're receiving phone calls, from what they say are women and children trapped under the rubble there, but they cannot approach it because of the presence of Israeli forces in the area. Local residents are reporting heavy firing from the area around the hospital. One resident -- told CNN that his daughter and his son have been killed as a result of the fighting and the fighting is ongoing. This Palestinian civil defense is calling appealing for the United Nations, the Red Cross to come and help extract people from the area but at the moment, that doesn't seem to be possible, Eleni.",

There was a fresh onslaught on Ukraine's energy networks overnight, mirroring similar Russian attacks last week. At least three regions were targeted with drones and missiles hitting power generation centers. Kyiv says private homes and civilian facilities were also hit. In Baltimore, the largest floating crane on the east coast of the U.S. is being brought in to help clear the wreckage left when the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed on Tuesday night. It is going to be a painstaking process to all debris piece by piece out of the river and reopen the waterway to the Port of Baltimore. The U.S. government is giving Maryland $60 million as a down payment for all the cleanup work and rebuilding that needs to be done. CNN's Gabe Cohen joins us now from Baltimore for more. Gabe, you've been on the story from the moment this crash occurred. You know, we've been seeing the search and rescue teams and recovery teams and our salvage teams.

And we know that two more on their way. But look, this is going to be a massive project. As you look over my shoulder as we zoom in on the scene, to give you a sense of the scale of what we're talking about that container ship to Dali is about the size of the Eiffel Tower just turned on its side and then you have to factor in not just moving the ship out of the way. But getting all of that steel, that massive bridge out of the water, you can see a lot of it above the surface. So much of it is underwater. And so they're bringing in these huge vessels to try to eventually cut up all of that steel into pieces, something engineers are working on right now as we speak. And then hopefully, either later today or in the days ahead, those cranes can get to work and start lifting it -- lifting all those pieces out. But Eleni this is going to take quite a bit of time because they're also trying to go about it in a very delicate and sensitive manner, knowing that there are still four of those construction workers missing in the river. And some officials believe that they could be trapped under a lot of that debris. And so as they remove it, they're going to be very careful. And eventually once everything is pulled out they're going to send divers back in to try to recover those four missing men. And then Eleni there is also the NTSB investigation, federal investigators, still speaking with the pilots of the ship trying to figure out what caused that power outage, that total blackout on the ship in those few minutes before the crash. That led to the pilot losing power, losing the ability to steer, eventually sending out that mayday call, just before colliding with the column of the bridge, bringing it down into the river. They still don't know what caused the power outage. We should know that. Hopefully in the next couple of weeks, although it could take longer than that. But Eleni the next step, again, is the salvage operation trying to get the bridge out of the water could be many days before that happens. And then hopefully they can reopen the Port of Baltimore thousands of jobs at stake millions of dollars in the local economy.",

What we're talking about largely are things like perfume, those things that are flammable, but not a public health emergency at this point. So the governor seemed confident that they can get that contained pretty quickly. But so far, it has limited the ability for crews to actually get on the bow of the ship, the front where you can see the chunk of the bridge actually across and so it's slowing things down. But the governor seemed confident that there is no larger safety risk.

That is so different from where we were four years ago, when Joe Biden led this campaign at this point by seven points, lead it in April, lead it in May, June, July, August, September, October, and then November, Joe Biden never trailed. Now we are in such a different point where yes, it is a race that is too close to call. But that was not the case back in 2020. It was never too close to call.

And then third is preserving democracy in which Biden holds a very small advantage. And I think that gives you an understanding of why Donald Trump is in a significantly better position than he was at four years ago at this point is because in the top issues, he is leading, Joe Biden. You mentioned Gaza and I will note, no, it is not one of the top issues, but it's certainly an issue that is dividing the Democratic base at this particular point. And it's an issue on which Joe Biden holds one of his lowest approval ratings. And another one of these issues in which Donald Trump holds a clear lead in the voters' minds on who would better handle it. So it just kind of folds into that overarching, 2024 picture that is significantly different than what we saw four years ago, in which Donald Trump is again, favored on the top issues, including Gaza, over Joe Biden.",

And so this is a progress report on inflation. And it was kind of mixed, right a month over month, prices were up by .3 percent. That was actually cooler than expected in a cool down from the month before. But 2.5 percent is the annual number, that's right in line with expectations, but it was a little bit hotter than the month before. And that is because of what you were just referencing energy prices, specifically gasoline in the U.S. went up in February. And so we knew that was going to cause this inflation gauge and the other ones to go up Now 2.5 percent some context there. Back in June of 2022, when gas prices were at record highs and inflation felt like it was out of control. This metric was above 7 percent. So 2.5 percent, you can see on that chart is obviously much, much lower than that it is a major improvement. The problem, though, is 2.5 percent is also above what the Fed targets, right? The Fed is looking for 2 percent inflation. Before COVID in 2019, this metric was well below 2 percent, the entire year. So I think the problem here is that some of the progress in the fight against inflation has kind of leveled out, right? And so this shows that the job the effort to get inflation totally back to normal it's not done yet and so that does suggest that the Fed may need to wait a little bit longer, before we can start cutting interest rates. And Eleni, you know, this is got huge implications, right for financial markets and for consumers, everyone on Main Street as well. And you were just talking to Harry in the last segment before the break about the election, in a close election, which is what this one looks like. The economy could end up being the difference, right? And so whether or not the cost of living is getting better, or worse, whether or not the cost of borrowing is going down or staying the same.
