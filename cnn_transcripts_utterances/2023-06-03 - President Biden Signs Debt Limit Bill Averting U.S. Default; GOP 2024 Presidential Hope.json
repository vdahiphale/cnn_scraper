Earlier this afternoon President Biden signed into law the bipartisan bill that raises the nation's debt limit. That prevents the federal government from running out of money to pay its bills. Experts said that a default, the first in American history, would have been catastrophic for the U.S. and global economies. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us live from the White House. Priscilla, the president has really emphasized how close to the cliff this country came. But he had a couple of days to spare. What was his message today?",

Now a week later you see a photo there from the White House of President Biden signing this into law and averting what would have been the nation's first default. Now, in his remarks from the Oval Office on Friday evening, President Biden emphasized the bipartisanship and the work that was done between Republican negotiators and White House negotiators to get to this point. Now of course, there has been criticism from President Biden's allies on the left as to what concessions were made, and President Biden noted that not everyone got what they wanted but what he did hear was also trying to tie in his -- all of the elements of his presidency, reaching an agreement with Republicans on this debt ceiling as well as looking forward in terms of unity and the expectation of how to work with lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans moving forward.

He followed Senator Ernst over here to the Iowa fairground. So this is something he said it was great to be back on a bike. So he's again trying to show that he is a man from out here in the country. It is hard to imagine that he would be able to overcome all of the skepticism and hatred toward him among Trump supporters. He knows that. But he is also clearly going to make these deeply conservative arguments. He just goes right up to the line of saying that Donald Trump is not a fiscal conservative. He goes right up to the line of saying, look, we spent too much during our administration, so, look, it's a challenging road for him, an uphill climb.

But have also described more bodies being trapped underneath these enormous railroad cars. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was supposed to be inaugurating a new high-speed train for the country. But instead he had to rush to the scene of this awful disaster to meet with some of the survivors to express his grief on the part of the government for the enormous death toll here, and also to vow for an investigation and that whoever is responsible for this, he says, will be brought to justice. There have been messages of condolences pouring in. Everybody from Pope Francis to the prime minister of the U.K., Pakistan, India's neighbor and rival, all calling in.

Kristina Bozanich, coordinator of Pride in St. Cloud, canceled the Orlando-area event that was planned to include drag performers. According to the new laws signed by DeSantis just weeks ago, local governments are banned from issuing public permits for events that include some adult live performances. Venues risk steep fines and losing licensing if a child is present. Knowingly admitting a child would be a first-degree misdemeanor.",

The majority of Americans support companies that stand with the LGBTQ community.And we know that the size of our community is growing. One in seven adults identify as a member of the community, one of four of Generation Z. This is not a fringe issue. What is happening right now is backlash from an extremist part of the right-wing community that is attacking us. Attacking us physically in the places that we live, attacking us where we shop and attacking us where we work. This is a crisis moment where we have to identify it for what it is.

They're the same ones pushing campaigns of harassment and bullying against our community online. They are the same ones that are launching these attacks. So what companies need to do is to stand firm in your values, to stand up to the bullies. We have seen examples, from Disney to Nike, that when they stand firm in their values, when they are unwavering, the community shows up in support. And at the end of the day, the bullies back down. There can't be cowering to the bullies in this moment. And that's our call to every company, to stand bold in your values, especially during Pride season.",

Just like Kelley said, when a company says, these are our core values, we are in alignment with them and we're going to live along with them, then it's fine. The marketplace responds very well. It's when they don't grow the backbone and they're trying to be all things to all people. And not every company and not every product is all things to all people. So from a business standpoint, you have to decide on who your ideal client avatar is, your persona or your demographic, as people would say, and then you have to speak directly to them. And that means saying no to some other people. Sports leagues, beverage companies, they try to grab everybody. They try to be inclusive when maybe they're really not.

We are not going back there. This Pride season, we're showing up boldly, defiantly, and joyfully to make sure of that. And I think we also have to be clear that this is just not where the majority of Americans are. It's good for business to do this. It's good for the community, as well. And 70 percent of non-LGBTQ-plus people believe that companies should publicly support and include the LGBTQ-plus community in hiring practices, advertising, and more. This is a moment where all of us, if you're a company, if you're a teacher, if you're an employer, if you're a consumer, need to stand up.
