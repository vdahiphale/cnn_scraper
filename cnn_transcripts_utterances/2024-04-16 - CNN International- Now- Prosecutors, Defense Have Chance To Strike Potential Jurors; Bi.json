Trump, the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president, and, of course, current candidate for president. Today, Donald Trump sits in court observing the Manhattanites who could end up deciding his legal fate here. A slim, older man who's read Trump's \"Art of the Deal\", a Mexican immigrant who gain U.S. citizenship in 2017 and like scuba diving, a recent college grad who said that she has no strong feelings about Donald Trump and lives with three roommates in Chelsea. Those are some of the potential jurors questioned this morning under the eye of Trump himself. So far, zero have been officially selected to sit for the historic trial. Right now, both sides have a chance to strike individual jurors without cause. A reminder of the stakes here, Trump faces some 34 felony counts for falsifying business records allegedly in an effort to cover up an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels, right in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election. Trump denies the affair, and has pleaded not guilty to all of those charges. Following all the twists and turns for us today is CNN's Zach Cohen. Zach, I understand the judge just struck one juror. Bring us up to speed on what's happening right now in the room because I also hear that the judge admonished Trump for speaking in the direction of one of the jurors?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, that's right. So Trump's team is currently challenging some of these doors for it to be eliminated for calls, right? So that would mean that they're asking the judge remove them from the potential jury pool without having to use any of those ten total strikes, they get to preemptively try to eliminate these doors and, you know, we've already seen him challenge to different jobs so far since returning from lunch, one of them was a woman who they raised concerns about her social media posts, basically describing a post where she was celebrating Joe Biden's 2020 election, when there was a video that was described in court according to our colleagues, are there of her in a car where honking and celebration is ensued.Trump's lawyers are arguing at those posts do represent an anti-Trump bias and they wanted her to be removed from the case and from the jury pool for cause. But the judge disagreed with that. The judge brought the juror in without any of the other jurors present, and asked her about the post and she explained it. She says, quote, I'm very, very strongly believed that regardless of my thoughts about anyone or anything political feelings or convictions that the job of a juror is to understand the facts of a trial and to be the judge of those facts. Judge Merchan told attorneys on both sides, said, look, that juror looked me in the eye and made it clear that they believe they can be impartial in rendering a fair verdict in this case, denying that first attempt by Trump's lawyers to challenge a juror for cause. But there was a second juror that was challenged for cause by Trump's team. Judge Merchan ultimately did strike that juror over a social media post that included the words \"lock him up\" in reference to Trump, making it clear that even though that post was posted several years ago, that this juror had expressed the desire to see Donald Trump in jail. So we're getting an understanding of where the line is for Judge Merchan, as Trump's team is trying to narrow down this pool of jurors and eliminate anybody with what they say is anti-Trump bias.",

So you have to take a look at this very carefully.There's also an additional game that's deployed on here. At the end of the jury selection when someone's used their 10 peremptory challenges, the judge is going to try to protect their record against being appealed on some of these challenged cause, and will ask for more peremptory challenges, judges tend to give more peremptory challenges upon a defendant's request knowing full well with the same number will now be given to the state.

He does it anyway and especially if the aid package goes through as I suspect it will through the House, this week. I think if anything, he'll feel less pressure.I think that bigger pressure he's feeling is at home where, of course, you saw protests against him rising up until this attack happened. He's got a brief moment here where you can change the discussion from what he's been doing in Gaza, which has brought all of the splits with the U.S. And change it to Iran and I think if he's wise, he'll try to keep it that way, but, you know, we've seen him make those choices before. The other problem we have here in this goes straight to that. Some of the arguments in my book and then yours is that the Russians and the Chinese used to be on the American and European side here to urge calm, they are now really much more closely allied with Iran.",

Ticketmaster is the biggest ticketing service in the country. And as we remember with Taylor Swift, the ticket prices were so high and Ticketmaster shutdown back in 2022, causing even Taylor so to speak out against it. Then there was a hearing in early 2023 that was quite contentious with the head of Live Nation speaking there. And this was one of those rare occasions that brought Republicans and Democrats together all saying that we've got to stop this monopolization over the industry. Now, Jim, we have reached out to both Live Nation and the DOJ, have not heard back on this potential pending suit, but here's what Ticketmaster told \"The Wall Street Journal\".
