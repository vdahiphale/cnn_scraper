Now we're waiting for an update on his condition, but the Slovak deputy prime minister said Fico is expected to survive. He was shot five times on Wednesday by a man in a crowd, even though they were separated by barriers.Now you can see the security team leading Fico to a car for safety and the crowds watching nearby. The gunman was quickly apprehended and no one else was hurt. And Fico was rushed to the hospital and spent hours on an operating table. The deputy prime minister said the surgery went well. Now, prior to the attack, Fico had been attending a government meeting in the central town of Handlova. He won a third term as prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized Western support for Ukraine. Slovak leaders have called the shooting an assault on democracy and blamed rising hate speech for the country's tense political atmosphere. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In a message to Slovakia's president, he also called Fico a courageous and strong- willed man. The Slovakian prime minister has subscribed to the Kremlin's narrative about the war in Ukraine, blaming Kyiv for provoking the conflict.

Suddenly in this part of the world, although as you know, Kim, elsewhere, political tensions have been high with protests, with attempted assassinations on other leaders, in some cases, former prime ministers where it's been unsuccessful and also on politicians.So these sorts of things are playing out and these are high-risk environments and that division and the polarization that has very much been a characteristic most notably of European politics, certainly over the last 10 years, have unfortunately here played out in the way that we witnessed during the unfolding of this today, Kim. BRUNHUBER: Yes, I want to ask you about that polarization a little later, but just right now, to the motive. I mean, we don't know much about the motive beyond what we heard from the government saying it was politically motivated. But the prime minister certainly was a divisive figure, right?",

It has the politics of Ukraine, one of the neighbors there, Poland and in addition to Austria, of course, Hungary, and his friend and ally and Viktor Orban.So E.U. politics around immigration, around the question of Russian sanctions, support yes or no for the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. And then beyond that, the kind of rebranded Fico is somebody who's very much played out in the public space on sort of culture wars, LGBTQ rights, the kind of things Fred Pleitgen was referring to. But I think more importantly, since election, it has been various ways in which Fico has gone about very much like his neighbor Orban undermining the media, weakening the judiciary, and so on. And these are proving increasingly polarizing issues and questions particularly when one considers that the election itself did not turn his party to power. He simply emerged in the parliamentary system as the leader and have an opportunity to create this coalition government.

But the fact is he currently has four deputy prime ministers that also hold cabinet positions, defense, environment, and so on. And that reflect the different coalition organization that we have here.He's in party with a breakaway group from his party and also with the Slovakian National Party, which is a far-right leaning organization. So he has that. But the bigger question or the most important answer here this is a parliamentary system. Fico himself was not elected. His party came out ahead in the election and as the leader of that party, he had the opportunity to create a government. So were he to be replaced in the long-term, it would essentially be up to his party to go about identifying a new leader. But in the short- term, his party and his cabinet are able to run the show and there's also, let's not forget it, an elected president and the incoming president who will be in office June 15th is a former a member of his party and a member of the breakaway party.

Firstly, the Ukrainians have been able to rush reserves to the area, but secondly, it appears the Russian objectives here might be limited, at least in the initial phase.
