It is morally wrong. And in many religions, it is morally wrong. So I think people want to think oh, no, it's wrong -- nobody could do it. Let me tell you something, it's a fact. It's happening. And the stories -- I have talked to rape survivors now from some of these situations. Mothers that have been raped in front of their children. Stories of people from this most recent -- you've heard them. They're horrific. Knives put up women's -- I'm going to say this on television -- women's vaginas. Raping and shooting someone in the head at the same time. This kind of violence is unacceptable. And I can't -- it was repeated this isn't true. Don't say it anymore. You're not telling the truth.

Do you think a breakdown over border talks should prevent more funding for Ukraine and Israel this year? REP.

It could be used for our southern border. Right now, I think that there is a lack of vision and there's a lack of accountability of where the money that has been sent to Ukraine is going and what it's been used for.

How it has affected someone that runs a county of 1.4 million people and how their operations needed to have changed because of issues that they're facing, whether it's drugs, whether it's crimes being committed by migrants. So I think that it's an issue that we've seen across this country. Sometimes, the agencies that are tasked with handling most of these migrant issues are unfortunately now, like we've seen in New York City -- those agencies are becoming -- their budgets are being cut drastically. I mean, just the other day we have the -- we have the president of the FDNY UFA as one of our witnesses. I mean, now minimum manning has changed in certain firehouses because of budget cuts.
