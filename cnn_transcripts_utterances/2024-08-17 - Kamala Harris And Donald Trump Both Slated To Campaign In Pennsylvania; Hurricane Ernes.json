Well, to start, as you noted, you know, when Kamala Harris had announced her plan to not tax tipped wages that raised eyebrows among people in former President Donald Trump's orbit, because this is something that he's been campaigning on for weeks and weeks, and he sort of seems to say that this is Vice President Harris being a copycat, trying to appeal to the same voter base that he's appealing to.And so that's one of the biggest similarities that we see here. They do both sort of suggest that they have more populist economic policies like wanting to build more housing, lowering the cost of groceries, and living more middle class and working class voters. And I think particularly the reason why they're doing this is because this is the slice of the electorate that they must win, and so the both of them appealing to not taxing tipped wages and also expanding child tax credits really does say something about what they're appealing to. On the other hand, you know, former President Donald Trump has been really focused on using tariffs and trade as one of the biggest drivers of economic growth for the economy. He also seems to suggest that energy development will boost the economy, and that's not something that we've heard Vice President Harris talk about in much depth.",

And here's the thing, it's right over it as we speak, but it doesn't just end as soon as it makes landfall. So they're likely going to have several more hours of some pretty significant impacts.So let's take a look at the storm right now. Sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, that has come down a little bit since yesterday, but that was anticipated. In fact, it may even go down a little bit more before it finally gets back out over open water, where it will re intensify. Now, some wind gusts at the airport. They've already had a wind gust of 84 miles per hour in Bermuda, rainfall amounts already picking up about six and a half inches. The forecast was for about six to nine they're already within that window, but they may end up on the high end of that, as they're still expected to get about one to three inches more. From here, again, it's going to go back out over open water, but notice, it's expected to get back up to 90 miles per hour, and once it gets back out over that warmer, wide ocean, from there, it continues its trek up towards Atlantic. Canada, likely either hitting or very close to Newfoundland and Labrador by the time we get to late Monday or early Tuesday. Now here's one of the bigger concerns we've talked about, that significant wave height. Obviously, the highest ones are going to be in and around Bermuda. But notice all of that green, how close it gets to pretty much up and down the East Coast of the US. You've got a high rip current risk essentially stretching from Stewart, Florida all the way up into portions of Massachusetts and even Maine. And this isn't just for today. The threat continues Sunday and Monday, especially the farther north you are. Looking at some of these high surf advisories. Look at these areas of South Carolina, looking at those breaking wave heights of four to six feet. Portions of North Carolina could get as high as five to eight feet. Again, the concern here for a lot of these areas that are there is, yes, it's a lot of schools say in South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, they go back this week. So a lot of folks, they like to head to the beach that last weekend before school starts. You have to be very careful if you plan to head out to the water.",

And according to authorities, Perry fell back into that addiction last Fall, and they say that between September and October of 2023, he was given about 20 vials of ketamine that cost him about $55,000.Prosecutors saying that these people cared more about making money than they did about his well-being. And among them is Eric Fleming, who supplied the drugs, he has entered a guilty plea, and he told authorities that he got the drugs from Jasveen Sangha. Now, that's the woman known as \"The Ketamine Queen\" that authorities say ran a drug-selling emporium in her home. Prosecutors believe that the doses that ended Perry's life actually came from her. She entered a not-guilty plea, and is one of the lead defendants in this case, along with Dr. Salvador Plasencia. Prosecutors say they have a text message from Plasencia that says something along the lines of, \"I wonder how much this moron will pay.\" He has entered a not-guilty plea, and this is what his attorney is saying. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And finally, Keith Morrison, Perry's stepfather, he released a statement from the family, saying that they were and still are heartbroken, but say it has helped to know that law enforcement has taken his case very seriously.

So, that's where it differs.And that's what I've asked the IOC several times in e-mails, why did you do one thing in 2002, double gold. Why not just do double bronze? In other words, don't tell -- don't take someone's name out of the official books, put the other person in, and the answer is -- oh, I've ever gotten a good answer about that because I don't think that they'd even thought about the precedent that was set and is in the history books from 2002.",

Of course, she was getting slammed on social media for all things that are not her fault and then Barbosu as well, being caught in all of this, and all of the criticism controversy, et cetera, for a week-and- a-half for their dreams.This is all about having the performance of their lives and leaving Paris with a medal, and in Jordan Chiles case, of course, she's got the gold from the team competition. But this would have been -- and is her first individual medal. And you're right, it's a mistake by the officials, it is not a mistake by the athletes.
