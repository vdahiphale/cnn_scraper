This is a case where Donald Trump has been losing and this is the much bigger legal risk before him right now.What happened yesterday is three judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, a pretty powerful court, came together unanimously, said that they agreed in an unsigned opinion that no president is above the law. That the specific accusations against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election appear to be able to stand. And the sort of thing that taking votes or taking the election out of the hands of the voters, that is certainly something that could be charged in court and that it is the responsibility of the court system to try a former president if he is accused of a crime. So, a very thorough opinion, a unanimous opinion and also the Circuit Court sent a very strong signal that they want this to move quickly. That if there is going to be a trial against Donald Trump, they need to resolve this issue quickly in the courts. And they essentially set up a mechanism so that the appeals court in D.C. is very likely not going to be dealing with this anymore and it's going to be -- the next stop is the Supreme Court. And Donald Trump has a deadline of Monday, super quick in the court world, to go to the Supreme Court and ask for some relief. Very possible his trial is back on the calendar for this year.",

But Brock Purdy is not really your normal Mr. Irrelevant. He's gone from being the very last pick in the 2022 draft to one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. Purdy, well, he's as humble as they come. And he appreciates the chance that he now has to try and lead the 9ers to their first title since 1995.Here's what he told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BROCK PURDY, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS QUARTERBACK: With every little moment in my life, every milestone that I've come across, just being grateful more than anything. With the people in my life that have helped me get to where I'm at. I've had so much support in my life. And it hasn't just been a one-man show. So, I'm just very honored that, I mean, I get to play in the Super Bowl now and live out, you know, like my dream as a kid. And so, yes, just more than anything have that grateful mindset.

I'm standing in front of Tokyo Dome right now where Taylor Swift is literally having her concert right now. You can kind of hear her singing. I'm not going to sing along. I won't subject you to that. But you can also hear fans chanting. They are so excited that their favorite pop star is now in Japan.And, you know, event organizers tell us that all of her tickets to her concerts sold out within the first 30 minutes, which just goes to show how excited people are about Taylor Swift being here in Japan. And we have to remember that the last time Taylor Swift was in Tokyo to perform was back in 2018, nearly six years ago, for her Reputation Tour. So, fans are really Swift deprived. They want to see their favorite pop star up on that stage. But, you know, it's not just about the fandom. It's also about the economic revenue. Experts tell us that Taylor Swift's four-day concert will generate more than 230 million U.S. dollars for Japan. Far more than the next biggest musical event in Japan, Fuji Rock, which generates about 134 million U.S. dollars for Japan annually. Now, the burning question that I'm sure is on both of your minds, also on my mind, will Taylor Swift make it back in time by Super Bowl Sunday to kiss her boyfriend Travis Kelce. Now, I'm no betting woman, but I'm going to say with quite a bit of confidence that she will make it back in time. It does not take time travel, just a private jet, which she does own. And, you know, she kind of has to make it back for that Super Bowl because why else would we watch it. Am I right?",
