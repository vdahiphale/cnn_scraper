In Chicago, only about 55 percent.And these are pretty huge, mass transit systems and yet we're not seeing the folks coming back. Why, you say, why is it, right? So, why are fewer people using mass transit? Well, there's more remote work. Upwards of 50 percent of folks, depending on which city you're in, are still working from home. It's a fear of crime. Some of that is real. Some of that is just what's being portrayed in the media. But it is a real thing. And, as you mentioned, a fear of Covid that's still going on.

And I remember him saying to me that one of the first inspirations for the story of this season was when he asked a local about the Testa di Moro, you know, there are sculptures of heads that you see often in the show and Ethan and Harper have one in their bedroom. And the story there is relayed in the show is the actual back story for those Testa di Moro. So, yes, I think - I think it's a - it's a dark series. I think in a funny way it's also romantic.
