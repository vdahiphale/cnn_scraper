It's the interview where Robert Hur described Biden is seeming like a, quote, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. Do House Republicans have a vote? Have the votes? Also this hour, a hate crime task force launched to investigate this, repeated acts of antisemitism and vandalism in New York City. See some of the acts under investigation. And two somber moments today, marketing the ugly scars of gun violence in America, students who as first-graders survived the horrific Sandy Hook massacre. Those kids are graduating from high school today. And this hour, a symbolic act to remember the 49 innocent victims of the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. (MUSIC)",

Any minute, we expect to see history fold on Capitol Hill as House Republicans move to make Merrick Garland only the third U.S. attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress. All three quite tellingly happened within the last 10 years, as our politics has gotten even more divided. House Republican leaders say this rare step is necessary because Garland refuses to turn over the audio recordings of President Biden's interviews with special counsel Robert Hur. You might remember Hur investigated Biden's handling or mishandling of classified documents, but Democrats say this is all just a stumped by House Republicans who want to use the audio for attack ads take the audio out of context to embarrass President Biden and doing do it all to appease Donald Trump. If this motion passes Republicans will then ask justice department to prosecute Garland, who we should know is the head of the Justice Department because he's the attorney general, the DOJ did not pursue charges against the other two attorneys general who were held in contempt, Mr. Holder and Mr. Barr. Let's get straight to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. Manu, it is a very narrow majority that House Republicans have. Do they have the votes?",

There is such a narrow majority that a couple of members don't show unexpectedly that could scuttle the whole efforts going forward. We've seen that happen in other votes. Will that happen here? But nevertheless, the Republicans believe that they have all their members here in essentially support that. They only afford to lose two Republican votes if all members are here in voting because there's a majority of people who are here, but they do ultimately expect that. But Democrats are furiously opposed to this effort. They believe there's all part of push to try to make Joe Biden look bad and that the Justice Department has cooperated. The Justice Department, attorney general himself, Merrick Garland, said that they have provided transcripts about that interview between President Biden and the special counsel, and that the older provide the audio recordings that it would impair their ability to have investigations going forward because future witnesses would be unwilling to cooperate behind closed doors and be deposed if they other audio would be leaked to the public. But nevertheless, that is this dispute has been going on for weeks and now, Merrick Garland facing history, one of the rare attorney general about to be held in contempt in the House in the middle of this hotly contested election.

Shelter prices, housing prices, rents has been very painfully high and growing more, much more quickly, certainly, than prospective homebuyers or renters would like.If you own a home, that's quite good news for you. But if you are trying to purchase one or if you're looking for an apartment to rent, those numbers have been moving in the wrong direction. And certainly high interest rates don't help in that respect. Normally you would expect that when interest rates go up, that pushes housing prices down, because you can buy less house for the same mortgage payment and more of that payment is being eaten up by interests that hasn't happened recently. And that's because we just have a shortage of housing in this country. It's extremely difficult to build, not just here in New York and other coastal cities where this has been a problem for a long time, but increasingly across the country, it's difficult to build. We've basically under built since the financial crisis, since the housing bust. And we are continuing to see the pain of that today.",

But that is not what we're expecting here at the moment.In fact, the Republicans seem to have a little bit more leeway because of the number of Democratic absences at the moment. Remember the vote will be approved. This resolution to refer the attorney general, the United States, on contempt charges that will be approved if a majority of members who are present are actually voting. So that means that there are absences that changes the number of people that would be considered into be in the majority. At the moment based on what our team has calculating, on our back of the napkin calculations from the earlier votes today, and in this vote series, we expect that Johnson could actually afford to lose three Republican votes given this expect it to be along party lines, even if all members were present and voting, he could only afford to lose two Republican votes. So he potentially could have an extra defection to play with. The question is, who will defect? I spent the last couple of weeks were really talking to a number of those swing district Republicans and then making very clear that they are on the side of the leadership on this question, even though it is a very controversial vote, many of them have said that they believe that Attorney General Merrick Garland should turn over the audio tapes that he was subpoenaed for those audio tapes. Of course, it special counsel Robert Hur had in his conversations is interview with President Joe Biden over Biden's mishandling of classified. Documents Republicans clearly want to inject this. This audio into the campaign season, given the criticism of Robert Hur's -- about Joe Biden -- Joe Biden, his elderly state and why he decided not to prosecute him. They want to hear all of that. Democrat seen absolutely no reason for this audio to be turned over to the to the House and the attorney general himself has warned that doing so could be a detriment to future investigations going forward, witnesses may not want to Cooperate if they believe their audio is simply be released to Congress. So all that is playing out as his vote, Jake, it appears it is now taking in place. According to the vote right now is you can probably see here on your screen, but what were seeing right now, 204 votes, there is one Republican vote in the negative. We're trying to get a name and who that person is at the moment. Sometimes those votes happened by mistake. Remember, they may vote no and mean to vote yes, we'll see if that person changes their mind. But at the moment, Jake, since Johnson can afford, we think, to lose three votes, given the attendance numbers, he seems to be on track of gains approved Jake and a matter of minutes.",

The gavel making an official, the Republican-led House of Representatives has just voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress by a vote of 216-207. The vote coming because Attorney General Garland is not turning over the audio recordings of the special counsel's interview with President Biden.Special counsel Robert Hur, he investigated Biden's handling or mishandling, I should say, of classified documents. We should note for transparency reasons that CNN is suing the Biden administration as well for those audio recordings because transparency is a hallmark of journalism and accountability, demanding accountability from public officials. With us now to discuss this vote is New York Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman. Congressman, what's your reaction to the vote and why should the Biden administration hide these tapes from the public? REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Well, first of all, it's a -- it's a very disappointing day, and it's another effort by the Republican Party to dig a deeper hole for this institution. Contempt of Congress is a very serious charge, and as we know from the Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon cases, those are situations where witnesses are subpoenaed and absolutely blow off various committees, provide no documents, no information, which is exactly what the Trump administration did, as you will recall back in 2019, and the State Department had gathered a boatload of documents to turn over to the impeachment inquiry related to Ukraine, Donald Trump ordered them not to turn them over. And so, what we are now entering into is a situation here where the Republicans obtained the substance of the interview that they requested. That is more than enough for them to do any oversight that they deem necessary. There is no legitimate legislative purpose for them to obtain the audio recording because they're not prosecuting. They're not trying to determine whether to prosecute him. And there is no legislation they can identify. There's no oversight. They can identify that points to why they need the audio recording and what they really want to do is release it to help Donald Trump misconstrue these recordings, use them during the campaign, and that is not a legitimate purpose. And so, this is a situation where the Department of Justice when beyond really the call of duty and providing the substance of all of the requests that the oversight committee and the judiciary committee made of Merrick Garland.
