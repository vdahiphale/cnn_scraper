A martial arts fighter accused of being among five gunmen who attacked places of worship and police in Dagestan, killing at least 20. Ceasefire stance. Israel telling Hamas it's committed to the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, according to a source. Set back in space. Astronauts at the International Space Station staying a while longer as engineers battle to fix helium leaks and faulty thrusters on Boeing Starliner. And avatar superstar. The startup using multilingual full body A.I. avatars to help businesses tell stories and train their staff. That conversation and much more coming up. But first, we're learning more about the gunman who killed at least 20 people on Sunday in Dagestan in Southern Russia. The attackers reportedly included relatives of a regional government official as well as a mixed martial arts fighter. They opened fire at various houses of worship, including synagogues and churches. It's the second major terrorist attack on Russian soil in three months. And in addition to the devastating human toll, these attacks pose a political program too for President Vladimir Putin. He came to power promising to eradicate extremism. And a quarter of a century later, it remains a serious issue for Russia. For more on this, we're joined by Nick Payton Walsh. Nick, good to have you with us. And I guess as a result of that, information remains pretty scarce, perhaps by design. Just give us a sense of the scale of how big a problem Islamic extremism is in Russia today and what more we know about these attacks.",

But one of the things you pointed out was this anger that had been caused by the disproportionate mobilization of men from this region to fight in the war with Ukraine. You also said that the extent of the law enforcement response is going to be critical in the wake of this. What do you expect and how do you expect them to respond? WALSH (on camera): I think, ultimately, Moscow is more concerned about the opinions of people living in the capital and closer to it than a farther flung region like Dagestan. It's when you see incidents like this or you see the protests that we saw at mobilization that it gets onto the Kremlin's radar. But there are really questions, I think, about how Moscow can expect its grip on a place like this to be as strong as it wants it to be if, indeed, they are thinning out their law enforcement by sending many of them to the front line in Ukraine. So many of the dead, we've learned of, indeed, have been from Dagestan. What that does for security, what that does towards people's emotions towards the Kremlin per se. And on top of that, too, we now have this mythicizing extremist threat. We don't entirely know if there was an overarching group behind this. We do know that many of the attackers were indeed related, related to a local official, it seems. That might mean they were operating in isolation. But there are also questions, too, as to exactly how this attack seemed to have killed so many police, so few civilians. And exactly if we know the full extent of the damage at this time, Julia.",

Now, the Israeli government telling Hamas it's \"committed to aceasefire deal,\" at least according to a source close to the negotiations. It follows comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Monday, he walked back from what he'd said over the weekend where he appeared to dismiss that proposal. Last month, President Joe Biden outlined a plan that would see the release of all remaining hostages in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza. Now, all of this comes as Israel's defense minister is in Washington for high-level meetings with U.S. officials. Those talks aimed at transitioning to a new phase of the war in Gaza. Jennifer Hansler is in Washington for us. Jennifer, what came of those talks, and what more do we know, perhaps, about a transition away from what we've seen in Gaza, perhaps towards the northern border now in Hezbollah?",

Now, in response to those ongoing negotiations, the families of threehostages have authorized the release of new video of their loved ones being kidnapped from the music festival on October 7th. And I warn you, the images are distressing. The video, taken by Hamas, which shows the hostages in the back of a pickup truck being driven through Southern Israel. One can be seen with his face bloodied and his arm seemingly partially amputated. Some of the video has already been seen by the public, but now, the hostages' families want more footage released to help increase pressure for a deal to bring them home. Now, to the International Space Station, where the return of Boeing's Starliner capsule has been delayed again. The Starliner project, already over budget and behind schedule, made it to space earlier this month for its first test flight. But NASA's next challenge is getting the capsule and its two astronauts home. As engineers grapple. NASA is now saying that they won't return until July. Meanwhile, two other NASA astronauts were planning to do a spacewalk today, but that was cancelled due to a leak in one of the spacesuits. Let's bring in former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino. Mike plenty of issues to discuss. Let's just start with that spacewalk today. And we got some of the comments that the astronauts were making.

The space suit itself, if it was leaking, there would be more problematic. What they're -- what they see the leak in is in the umbilical. Before you before you do the spacewalk, you're in the airlock, you're getting your power and your cooling water and your oxygen from the spaceship itself. And that comes through an umbilical hook up to the space suit. And so, that's where the water was leaking from that umbilical. So, that's a much easier problem to fix than if it was actually the space suit itself, which -- because you go outside in the space suit. So, if you have a problem in that space suit, you're in a much worse situation than if it's with the equipment that's inside.",

And a WallStreet rotation conversation tops today's \"Money Move.\" U.S. stocks beginning the last trading week of June pretty mixed, with investors trimming their positions in tech and stocking up on lesser love names from sectors like banking and energy. So, rotation. NVIDIA shares lower for a third straight session too, taking its recent losses to over 10 percent. The textbook definition of a correction, especially when it's soared as it has so far this year. Context is everything. NVIDIA shares are still up 140 percent year-to-date. And many believe that a broadening out of the market rally beyond a handful of those big tech names will be a positive thing. Morgan Stanley analysts say market breadth hasn't been narrow -- this narrow since the mid-1960s. Now, mostly lower session in Asia with the Nikkei on the rise and the Shanghai Composite down over 1 percent. We'll see what Tuesday's session brings.

E.U. regulators saying the tech company broke new competition rules by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. Now, if found guilty, Apple could face a whopping $38 billion fine. That's what's new. The rules came into force in March, shortly before the European Commission began investigating Apple, Alphabet, and Meta. Now, for more detail on this, we're joined by Clare Duffy.

The context there, of course, is that app developers often charge a premium on purchases made in their iOS apps, because Apple takes a cut of all of those purchases. And the E.U. is saying that may be depriving consumers of getting to know about better deals. Of course, Apple is saying that it has made changes to be in compliance with the DMA, that it believes it is already complying with this law.

In the case of A.I., it's saying that it won't roll them out in Europe because it would be in violation of the DMA and it doesn't want to sacrifice consumer privacy measures.

Those places, yes, they do get muggy in the summer. But right now, the places in Saudi Arabia are as muggy as they've ever been. So, here we are, temperatures aren't going to cool down much.

So, we have to do everything that we can to make sure we maximize all the positive benefits of these technologies and minimize the harm, right? I think regulation is one tool we have in the toolbox. And certainly, is a very important one. Our sort of, you know, high level thinking around this is we believe that there should be a responsibility put on companies developing these technologies to make sure that they aren't misused. Now, what that means exactly is probably different from product to product, to company to company. Sort of saying, it's hard to be for me right here and I'll be prescriptive what that means, but we think that companies have a very real responsibility to make sure that their technology isn't misused. So, for us, we take that very seriously. We have been since we found the company eight years ago. As you mentioned yourself, we do KYC. We do absolutely no avatars or voices that's nonconsensual. We also take a pretty strict stance of what you're allowed to create on the platform by content moderation. So, if you try to create videos about questionable topics or what we call gray areas or red areas, then we'll simply block the creation of the video. You won't even get to actually make it. I think the last part that I think is worth mentioning, which I think is maybe actually the most important one is education and getting this technology into the hands of people. No matter what, we're going to be moving into a world in which just like we can't trust everything we read online just because someone tweets something, that definitely doesn't mean that it's necessarily true. For video, audio, and speech content, that's also going to be the case in the not-so-distant future. So, it's really important that everyone is literate on these technologies. How do they work? What's their limitations? What should we be looking for? And the best way to do that generally is actually to have people create videos themselves, right? So, when I see school kids using Synthesia and people if -- of all walks of life, making videos, I think that is really, really positive because that is the best way we can educate the population of what these technologies could be like, what we see with ChatGPT and other kind of similarly accessible generative A.I. technologies.",

We're heading into a U.S. presidential election where I think trust in leadership is at record lows. Victor, how do you advise people that are just looking at social media right now? And we've even seen it in the last few weeks with both President Biden and Former President Trump, you don't know what videos are real and what's fake. How do you advise social media users and voters to be able to distinguish between these two things in the absence yet of the kind of controls that we're talking about?",

So, it is a great point. Victor, I'm sorry that we've run out of time because I have a whole sheet of questions for you. But we'll get you back on to talk about the reception to the new tools. It's a fascinating industry and A.I. is moving really fast. Good luck with the with the adoption of the new tools and we'll speak again soon.",

After the 97th minute in their final Group B game, Croatia was set to progress to the knockout stages. Then Italy equalized with the last kick of the game to snatch a draw. That's enough to send Italy through and likely knock Croatia out. It was a less stressful evening for Spain, topping the group and with a win against last placed Albania. Patrick Snell joins us now. Patrick, there's a lot of very happy Spaniards in the world today. There's a lot of very disappointed Croatians. Wowzers.",

But look, let's start with the race to book a place in the last 16 years. Getting exciting now over there in Germany at the Euros. Ahead of Monday night's fix, we had four countries already through to the tournament's next phase. The host nation, Switzerland, Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal, and the three-time winner, Spain, they faced Albanian Group B action. Get to that in a moment. First up, Italy. The Azzurri, knowing they'd be through as group runners up, if they could avoid defeat in their match against Croatia. But, you know, Croatia, very durable opponents. They make life tough for you, and they would take the lead in this one. Luka Modric talks it, but it's saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma who keeps it scoreless, but only for about 30 seconds or so, because would you believe it, it's into the back of the net from Luka Modric there, making amends for the penalty. At 38 years of age, Julia, he's now the oldest player ever to score the Euros. But the Italians -- look at that. Eight minutes into injury time. Mattia Zaccagni finding it with a wonderful finish, a stunning goal, curled to perfection. That was the last kick of the match. Huge relief for Italy, because that point puts them through, but in stark contrast, it is heartbreak for Croatia. Their players and their fans alike they are left absolutely devastated. Their hopes of reaching the last 16 shattered, and they are hanging by a thread. We call football the beautiful game, and rightly so, but it can often bring with it so much devastation as well. Now, Spain, they're already qualified, as I said, as Group B winners. La Roja into the last 16 ahead of the match with Albania. It was certainly no surprise in this one when the Spaniards take the lead after just 13 minutes of play. Ferran Torres, the Barcelona man, showing lovely class and composure in Dusseldorf there to put his country ahead. Just curls it nice. Look at the curl on the shot there. Precision finish. The only goal of the night. Albania did put up a pretty decent fight. Decent performance by the Albanians, but Spain won it 1-nil and Albania are eliminated from the tournament. So, another three points for Spain. But what a finish, Julia, to that Croatia-Italy match. The Italians advance as group winners. They haven't been that impressive, I will say, Italy, the defending champions, but they've got the job done. They're through to the next phase. They'll take on Switzerland next. Croatia are on just two points. They do retain a tiny, tiny, tiny chance of advancing as one of the best third place teams, but their hopes are hanging by a thread, as I said earlier. Now, to that England news, because that win for Spain, good news for England, for France, and the Netherlands, they are all assured of progressing now to the knockout rounds. Back to you.",
