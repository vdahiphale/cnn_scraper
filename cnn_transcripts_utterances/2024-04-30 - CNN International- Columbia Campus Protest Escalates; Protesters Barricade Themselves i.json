I think this is certainly going to now amp up the pressure further on Columbia University to see what they will do to actually respond because you now see the potential.Actually, we are seeing yet another layer of disruption for some of those students, especially those who have been observing what has been happening, as you mentioned, for two weeks now. But there is still a lot of questions about who these people were. We've been -- myself and my colleagues have been on campus for the last couple of weeks, speaking to members of this encampment. The encampment itself has been largely peaceful. They've done gatherings there, and it has really been contained more than anything into the hedges there, basically where they have been camped out. However, something happened last night, as we saw in these pictures here and it is clearly going to be the reason why university officials might now have to calculate that next step. What we know is that access now to the campus is now going to be further restricted. I had an opportunity speak to a couple of students a short while ago. Unless you live on campus, it is likely that you may not be able to actually make your way onto campus until we find out a little bit more about what might be the next step. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what is interesting now is exactly how -- what will play out with these arrests. If you remember, last week, here at the university, there were nearly 60 people arrested in confrontations with police that were much more at times violent than what we saw unfold here yesterday. But the county attorney which prosecutes misdemeanor crimes here in Austin, dismissed all of those criminal charges against the protesters here at the university last week. But it is not clear that that is going to happen again.The county attorney put out a statement, Amara, saying that she is deeply concerned about the escalation of these protests. And then she is speaking with university officials on how to best proceed moving forward. So, a very different tone from what we saw from the county attorney last week. But so far, right now, here on the campus this morning, it is quiet, most of the protesters, after the majority of people were arrested yesterday, they hung around and lingered here on the campus into the evening. But this morning, they are not here right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it is difficult to paint all of these protests with one broad brush. I think they are all very different. Here at the University of Texas, what we have heard repeatedly from university officials is that this idea tolerating intense (ph), an encampment, many of the protesters often talk about occupying a space here on the campus. University officials have said that it was that kind of talk, that kind of -- those kinds of actions that were simply not going to be tolerated and we are going to be against university rules.And that is why the university here has called in State Troopers in riot gear to carry out those removal orders and the orders of getting people to disperse. So, what we saw unfold here in Austin yesterday, very different in terms of the intensity and the violent intensity yesterday in this protest that we saw that the protesters were gathered in one spot. Small groups of officers would go in and slowly remove people that it took him several hours to almost essentially one-by-one pluck people out of the encampment area and take them away. But I think to your broader point, it is clear universities across the country kind of struggling and how to balance the ability to free speech, to gather and assemble and protest and that sort of thing which are hallmarks of democratic society here in the United States, and then also at the same time, trying to prevent these situations from escalating into what we are seeing Columbia and here at the University of Texas at Austin as well. WALKER: Yeah, such a challenging situation. Ed lavender, appreciate your reporting from Texas. Thank you very much. Leaders across the Middle East and beyond are waiting for Hamas' response to a new proposal by Egypt for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages. The U.S. Secretary of State says the proposal is extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. Antony Blinken is in Jordan right now and he heads to Israel later today. The new offer would unfold in two phases with the first calling for the release of up to 33 hostages over several weeks. Now, as talks continue, Israel is keeping up airstrikes on Gaza ahead of a promised ground invasion of Rafah. At a meeting with hostages' families a short time ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces would enter Rafah \"with or without a deal.\" Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Jerusalem. Let's start with the status of the talks. Does it sound like there is potentially progress being made?",

      "sentences": "Now, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's bluster about a Rafah invasion moving forward with or without a deal, the hard reality is that if there is a deal, that means a ceasefire and that means that the Rafah offensive will at a minimum be delayed. For his political prospects here in Israel, he needs to signal that Rafah will happen no matter what. But in speaking with Israeli officials privately, I can tell you that there is certainly a sense that the Rafah offensive is being held up right now while they wait to see whether or not a deal can actually be achieved and then depending on that, only a deal can actually prevent this offensive from actually moving forward.Now, amid all of this, as you mentioned, Secretary of State Tony Blinken in the region. Yesterday, he was in Saudi Arabia. Today, he will be arriving in Israel this evening for a slew of meetings tomorrow, pushing forward not only, of course, these latest negotiations, but also pressing Israel to do more on the humanitarian aid front, to discuss the prospect of this potential Rafah operation and also more broadly, of course, in the backdrop of all of this is the possibility of a bigger deal, a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, one that would have to include some kind of concrete steps towards a Palestinian State. So, remains to be seen if that can be achieved, but that is certainly another layer that is kind of hanging in the background of all of these negotiations.",

We've heard a lot of bluster from Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is under intense pressure to win the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The war has been a catastrophe for Israel in terms of public relations. You have this pending ruling from the international court of -- criminal court. You have these demonstrations across universities in the United States.So, it is not looking good for him. The problem is, if a deal is reached and he goes away or goes ahead with his bluster and goes into Rafah, conducts a military operation which he has been warned by the United States, could are probably inevitably will result in huge numbers of civilian casualties on top of the 34,500-plus who have been killed already in Gaza, it will spell the end of any deal that is reached. So, really he is talking perhaps out of one side of his mouth and he is going to do something differently. But this certainly would indicate that his heart is not in a deal. And what we've heard time and time again, that his goal is the -- his primary goal, his first goal when he lists those, the goals of the war in Gaza, is the destruction of Hamas. If there is a deal which could lead to a, according to diplomats, as much as a year of ceasefire, then how is he going to achieve this? So, there is lots of questions and his behavior is that of a prime minister who certainly has perhaps political considerations that take precedence over the fate of those Israeli hostages still in Gaza.",

Next hour, Donald Trump's hush money trial will resume with more testimony from the banker who says he helped facilitate the payments at the heart of the case. Gary Farro was Michael Cohen's banker in 2016 when Cohen used a line of credit from his mortgage to pay porn star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. This is back in, as we said, 2016. This is the second testimony in the case -- the third testimony. Legal experts think that prosecution will use its witnesses to corroborate key pieces of evidence, such as emails and other documents. Let's go now to CNN's National Security Reporter Zachary Cohen with more. Hello, Zach. So, what can we expect today?",

And look, we don't know exactly who the prosecution is going to call after Gary Farro, that's really the big question, the thing that we are all looking to see. Prosecutors have said they are not going to disclose the witness list or the order in which these witnesses are going to testify because they're worried about things that Donald Trump might say about them publicly.That brings up another thing that we are looking for is, whether or not Judge Merchan is going to rule on that gag order. Prosecutors say that Donald Trump has violated the gag order 14 times. We had a hearing last week where the prosecution and defense both made their arguments, but still no ruling on that. So, we are expecting another gag order hearing later this week, but it would be interesting to see if Judge Merchan does make a decision on those 14 alleged violations that the prosecution put up last week. And finally, the last thing I am looking forward today is the Trump of it, all right, where our team in the courtroom has really done a good job of providing almost minute by minute sort of color about Donald Trump's reactions, how Donald Trump is reacting both to the jury, both to the arguments of the witnesses -- what the witnesses are saying in this case. And \"The New York Times\" reporting that Trump has expressed privately frustration with one of his attorneys, Todd Blanche, so it would be really interesting to see if some of that frustration spills over in the courtroom as he is once again forced to sit there for eight hours a day and listen to witness testimony, that's really going to be document-heavy. So we'll see how that plays out, but yeah, things picking up back -- picking back up today, this morning, with the testimony of Gary Farro.",

They are still digging through this heap here because they have had a smell and they suspect that there could be somebody still under there. They have reason to think that because just across the road, over on this side, we were here yesterday and they were digging through that section for hours. It is only today that they were able to pull out the body of a young man there. And they only started to do that because one of the neighbors reported hearing a phone vibrating. So again, this is the situation here.Most of these are not professionals. They are first responders, they are not equipped for this. They are just neighbors, relatives who are still missing neighbors, they are missing the family members, and because no one else is helping, they are using whatever they have, mostly their bare hands or they using garden hose, just to try and make sure that everybody is accounted for. There are dozens that are still missing from this tragedy that happened early Monday morning. It is the worst devastation that Kenya has seen since the heavy rains began back in March. The exact death toll is climbing and we've been speaking to so many family members, one who lost nine family members. We spoke to a young mother who lost her three-year-old son on his birthday. She is devastated. And there are so many of the stories, an entire village almost wiped out with this raging waters that hit them at 3 a.m. when they were asleep and they had no time to prepare for any of it at all. President William Ruto has called these people, the victims of climate change, and she says this is going to be the new normal if it is not the extreme weather events of flooding, it is droughts, and that's something that's here in East Africa and the Horn of Africa has become very common.

Thank you so much.All right, at any minute now, Donald Trump will begin his trek from Trump Tower to Downtown Manhattan for his hush money trial. We expect today's testimony to pick up where things left off on Friday with Michael Cohen's former banker taking the stand. These are live pictures in Manhattan there, you just saw Trump waving as he is now about to get into his motorcade and head to the courthouse. Now, this banker of Michael Cohen, Gary Farro, says he helped Cohen set up an account that Cohen has said he used to pay porn star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. We are still awaiting as well, a ruling from the judge on whether Trump has repeatedly violated the gag order in the case by talking about Cohen and other witnesses. All right. Now, for some legal analysis of what has happened so far and what may play out this week in Trump's criminal hush money trial with Jeff Swartz. He is a prosecutor -- was a prosecutor before becoming a judge in Florida, and he is also now a law school professor. He is joining me from Tampa. Jeff, good morning to you.
