We'll bring you the latest on why Russia is now a part of the conversation. And a fresh blow for an already devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza as one of the last functioning hospitals is forced to evacuate there. Plus, new chaos erupts in South Korea's parliament as political leaders in the country face a second impeachment in just two weeks. New details are emerging today about that deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan, as questions are mounting over whether Russia may have been involved. Azerbaijan Airlines says a preliminary investigation has found the disaster occurred because of, quote, \"physical and technical external interference.\" Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that the signs point to Russian anti- aircraft defenses shooting the plane down, possibly in a case of mistaken identity. Authorities have recovered two Black Box flight recorders at the crash site, hoping that they can provide some answers. At least, 38 people were killed when the Azerbaijan Airlines jet plummeted to the ground Wednesday. CNN's Nada Bashir has been following the latest developments. And the two headlines today, Nada, is that second Black Box found, and also Azerbaijan Airlines saying that they see external physical and technical interference as early evidence in their investigation here.",

Nada Bashir, thank you so much. Well, for more, I'm joined by Alan Diehl; he's a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. Thank you so much for joining us and taking the time. So, here we are 48 hours after this crash on Wednesday. You have U.S. officials saying that they believe that it was likely taken down by an anti-aircraft system, and Azerbaijan investigators believe the same. We've seen images of holes perforated through the plane's fuselage. Does that lead you to believe also that this was likely the result of a Russian anti- defense system? ALAN DIEHL, AVIATION SAFETY CONSULTANT &amp; FORMER INVESTIGATOR, NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: Bianna, it's almost certainly certain that it happened because of some sort of anti-aircraft fire. The physical evidence is overwhelming. Clearly, though, the recorders will play a critical role on whether or not the pilots were able to realize, first of all, what they had. This particular jet, the Embraer has three hydraulic systems. But if the hydraulic systems were destroyed, the only alternative you have to steer the aircraft, to fly the aircraft is the differential throttles. There's two engines you can steer left or right by increasing one or the other throttle. You can increase thrust to make the plane go up, you can decrease thrust to make it go down. The problem is, there's a lag doing that, and clearly, these people did a great job of managing to crash land with a limited control they had, but yes, this does look like a battle damaged aircraft.",

And what's so frightening is to learn that this planeisolate -- oscillated the vertical speed, oscillated more than 100 times during the final 74 minutes of the flight. And let's remind viewers, the flight originated in Azerbaijan, was supposed to go to Grozny in Chechnya in Russia. The federation, then for whatever reason and the Russian air traffic control says that they were told that they offered for this flight to land in Grozny two times, and then the pilots offered another airport -- and the pilot was offered another airport, excuse me, and he decided to fly to Kazakhstan.

      "sentences": "Yes, it might, Bianna, because remember, these pilots are doing something for the very first time, assuming that we're correct about thehydraulic systems failing, they're going to have to fly this aircraft with just thrust only. They're going to have to steer the aircraft. This is a very difficult task. This is not something that pilots are trained to do. So, by flying across the Caspian Sea, that gave them quite a bit of time to master how to control this aircraft. Also, the weather was bad in southern Russia, there in Crimea, it was better across the in Kazakhstan. And also, there were mountains and populated areas in the airports around the Russian airports were out in Kazakhstan, there's flat terrain and a less populated area. So, these pilots were thinking when they made that decision to cross the Caspian Sea, and it's much to their credit that they chose that course of action, didn't risk a lot of people's lives on the ground, and it's just unfortunate that they couldn't totally control the aircraft. One other thing, Bianna, you have to keep in mind, when they're manipulating these throttles, things don't happen quickly or instantly, it takes a -- there's a lag. So, you can see in the videos of the crash that they're trying to bring up that right wing, that the very -- in there, they got the aircraft almost level, but whenever you add power on one engine, of course, you increase the speed which you're trying to avoid doing when you land. So, this is a very difficult task for them, and they did a commendable job of selecting this course of action and executing the crash approach under the most difficult of circumstances.",

Theinterception came hours after Israeli forces unleashed a series of strikes on the Yemeni capital and a city in the west, killing six people and injuring dozens more. The Iran-backed Houthis had vowed to retaliate for the strike. One assault on the capital's airport hit as a high-level U.N. delegation was preparing to fly out. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said strikes on Yemen won't stop until the mission is complete. CNN's Elliott Gotkine reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST (on camera): The Houthis have lobbed ballistic missiles towards Tel Aviv for four out of the last seven nights sending millions scrambling to bomb shelters. On Thursday, Israel responded, launching its first-ever attack on Yemen's main airport and hitting two power stations. The strikes, the Israeli military said, targeted infrastructure the Houthis have been using to bring Iranian weapons into Yemen. Among those hurt, a crew member for a plane for the World Health Organization whose director general says he was just meters away from the impact. This was the fourth time Israeli planes have attacked the Houthis, who say they're firing on Israel and international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. On Wednesday night in a war-battered enclave, five men, all of them journalists, according to hospital officials And \"Al-Quds Today TV\" were killed while sleeping in their van. The channel affiliated with Palestine Islamic Jihad, which the U.S. and others proscribe as a terrorist organization, says the men were carrying out their journalistic and humanitarian duty. Israel says they were Islamic Jihad militants posing as journalists. For evidence, it provided what it said was a list of operatives it picked up during operations in Gaza, edited to translate names and details on which four of the men's names appear along with their roles. And as the war in Gaza rumbles on, ceasefire talks aimed at securing the release of the 100 or so hostages still being held captive appear to have hit another snag. On Christmas day, Hamas accused Israel of moving the goalposts in negotiations, and said this was why a deal had yet to be done. For its part, Israel said Hamas was lying and reneging on understandings that had already been reached. Whatever the case, despite renewed optimism that a deal could soon be done, the reality is the two sides appear no closer to reaching an agreement that could end the year-long war and bring all the hostages home.

We're seeing a real collision of all of these issues. Now, the victim has yet to be identified, but law enforcement sources believe that she, too, was homeless. In fact, they believe that she was likely taking shelter from the cold inside the subway that morning. The suspect in this instance, also homeless, he came to the United States from Guatemala in 2018. He was deported at one point, but made his way back into the country, and in recent months had been in and out of shelters here in New York City in the last few months.

Since then, there's been a leadership change in South Korea. The new prime minister called a snap election, and his party lost the majority in the legislature for the first time in 15 years. So, now he leads a minority government. Even though the policies will remain the same, which are in line with U.S. priorities, he will be unable to implement them efficiently and quickly. So now, Japan is a bit of a questionable ally or an uncertain ally. And now, we have South Korea, if the opposition wins a special election, as it is likely to do, it would go in a very different direction from U.S. priorities. The opposition would be very conciliatory towards China and North Korea, very antagonistic towards Japan, given historic differences, and also would sort of downplay the alliance with the United States. The opposition often blames the U.S. rather than North Korea for raising tensions in the region. So, if South Korea opposition wins the election, it's a much more uncertain situation just as the U.S. undergoes its own leadership transition.",

Seattle Airport officialsays the person went through security screening the night before the flight and then managed to access the loading bridge the next day. The stowaway was caught as the plane was taxiing for takeoff. Delta faced a similar incident around Thanksgiving, you'll recall, when a woman made it all the way from New York to Paris without a ticket. Let's bring in Carlos Suarez live from the world's busiest airport, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. So, Carlos, explain to us how -- listen, I can't get -- if I accidentally have a bottle of water with me, I can't get past security, much less get onto the plane. How is Delta responding to not one, but two stowaways now within a matter of less than two months?",

We knowthat this passenger was able to clear that TSA security checkpoint the night before the flight on Christmas Eve, meaning that this passenger was able to get past the security checkpoint without a boarding pass, without a ticket, and spent some time in that terminal several hours, perhaps. Exactly just how long this passenger was able to stay in that terminal, and exactly what that passenger was doing, is still unclear. As you noted, the flight crew really were the ones that finally figured this whole situation out when that plane was taxiing out for departure, and they noticed that this person who was on board should not be where they were. And so, they come back to the gate, and it's at that point that officials tell us that when the aircraft gets to the gate and the door is opened, the passenger runs out before law enforcement gets there. And so, we're told law enforcement had to rely on surveillance video at the airport in Seattle to find out the passenger's exact whereabouts. Were told that they found this passenger hiding in a bathroom. Now, Delta released a statement, of course, saying that it is -- there's no bigger matter for them than the safety and the security of its passengers, and they apologize to the folks that were involved in this because they were delayed on their way out to Hawaii. Here now is one of the passengers that was on that flight, kind of reacting to the entire situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Today alone, we're looking at about more than 357,000 passengers coming through Atlanta, which is going to make it its busiest day of the year. As for the overall travel picture right now, at last check, we're looking at about more than 4,100 flights across the U.S. that have been delayed and at least 102 flights have been canceled in large part because of what you've said there, which is some of the bad weather that is moving across parts of the South.",

It's happening after no one won the billion-dollar jackpot on Christmas Eve. The top prize has been rolling over since September when a ticket in Texas won more than $800 million. Well, new records being achieved in space over the holidays as a probe has made the closest-ever approach to the sun. The Parker Solar Probe flew past the sun on Tuesday, coming within 3.8 million miles or just over six million kilometers of the solar surface. Here's a NASA animation showing its journey. Now the mission operations team received a signal from the spacecraft just before midnight on Christmas Eve. But now, they're playing the waiting game as a probe will return to Earth on New Year's Day. We'll be waiting for it. And from the hottest place in our solar system to somewhere just a little bit colder. The snow-themed theme park in China has officially opened for its 26th edition. Built out of an incredible 300,000 cubic meters of ice and snow, the City of Harbin experiences long cold winters and shorter summers, earning its name as the Ice City. The annual ice and snow festival has been held there since 1999 and will run from December to March. So, if you're planning on visiting, make sure you wrap up very warmly. That is so beautiful.
