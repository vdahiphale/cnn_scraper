A judge sets the date of April the 15th for his hush money trial. Meanwhile, another court has ruled he can pay a substantially reduced bond, that's in the civil fraud case. Also tonight, Israel's Foreign Minister says the country will not cease fire. It follows the U.S. Security Council passing the resolution, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza -- the U.S. abstained. We'll talk about that in a moment. And more arrests in Moscow, but deadly terror attack at the concert hall. We'll talk about those details and those who are in court today, we'll hear about that in a moment. Now, there are two major legal rulings for Donald Trump's various court cases. In the criminal trial for the hush money case, the Stormy Daniels case, if you will, it's now scheduled to begin in only three weeks on April the 15th. And then in the civil fraud case, all about overvaluing his properties. The former U.S. President won a partial victory. There, the appeals court has ruled -- or one of the appeals court ruled, he can now only pay $175 bond in ten days rather than the full amount that was awarded by the judge, $464 million. Donald Trump says it will be an honor to post the money. A short time ago, he was asked whether he would accept money from a foreign government to come up with the bond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Memorials such as thisone here have now been set up to mourn the more than 130 people who were killed at the concert venue on Friday. The United States says it warned Russia about a potential extremist plot earlier this month. Now, the Kremlin is declining to comment on that alert, and speculation some of the suspects in custody were tortured as they appeared in court battered and bruised. A branch of the Jihadist group ISIS is claiming responsibility, and at least, three of the suspects have reportedly pleaded guilty. CNN's Matthew Chance has been visiting the city where the attack happened in our reports from outside Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, as shocked Russians continue to lay flowers here outside the concert hall where more than 130 people were killed last week, the four suspected attackers have appeared in a Moscow court charged with acts of terrorism. The men all from Tajikistan in Central Asia appear to have been beaten. Videos showing their brutal interrogation had been leaked and widely shared, and one suspect appears to have lost an eye, another has what appears to be a torn plastic bag around his neck. The Kremlin hasn't commented on allegations of torture, but it was here at the Crocus City Hall near Moscow that four gunmen dressed in camouflage went on a killing rampage, firing automatic weapons on innocent bystanders before setting fire to the crowded building where thousands had gathered for a rock concert. ISIS, the terror group has said it was responsible for the attack, releasing horrific video, apparently taken by the gunmen themselves as they stormed the venue. The U.S. says it's been warning Russia for months about Intelligence suggesting a threat. But the Kremlin dismissed a recent U.S. Embassy alert about an imminent attack as a provocation intended to destabilize the country. The Russian president has attempted to link the events here to Ukraine, although the Ukrainian government has categorically denied any involvement. There are now though, concerns about what comes next, how the Kremlin may use this tragedy to further tighten security laws and rally Russians who are more anxious about security now than at any time for years.

As I mentioned, another three people have appeared in court today. It's a father and two sons, people from the same family who are said to have been the owners of the white vehicle in which the four attackers apparently made their escape from the concert hall after carrying out the attack. And so, they've been connected as well and charged with sort of collaborating and helping to organize a terrorist act as well. One of them actually pleaded innocent at the time. But you know -- so, this is an ongoing investigation, Vladimir Putin, the Russian President has come out within the past few minutes, saying that while now he accepts that ISIS carried out this attack. So, he's not ruling that out.

So, you know, most people are not inclined to vote on something until they have a verdict.
