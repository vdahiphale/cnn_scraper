The Israel Defense Forces say Hezbollah fired approximately 190 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel. Video from Tel Aviv shows Israeli interceptors taking out some of those rockets. The IDF says others fell in open areas.The Israeli air force reports it struck more than 120 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon within an hour on Monday. The IDF says the extensive strikes were aimed at degrading the Iran-backed militant group's capabilities. One explosion lit up the Beirut night sky late Monday. The IDF warned residents it was planning to target two suburbs about 30 minutes earlier. And video from Israeli strikes on Gaza is especially disturbing. Palestinian officials report at least 10 people were killed in the Jabalia Refugee Camp. At least 11 more were killed in strikes elsewhere in northern and central Gaza. And CNN's Paula Hancock joins us now live from Abu Dhabi. Good to see you, Paula. So, what more are you learning about the impact of these strikes from Hezbollah and Israel on Monday into Tuesday?",

But we know that just a few weeks after this has started, there's more than 1400 people killed in Lebanon, no distinction between militants and civilians, and there's also some 1.2 million people who have been displaced from those evacuation orders.

Tehran says that some 200 ballistic missiles were fired in that particular attack. We've also heard from the CIA Chief William Burns saying that he doesn't believe Israel's necessarily decided on the exact course of action at this point, but saying that the risk of an unintended escalation is a very real danger. Still insisting, though, that he believes neither Israel nor Iran wants an all-out war.

But at the same time, have a reaction to an action by your enemy that is sufficient to help them stop, that hasn't happened so far.We've seen that against Hezbollah, against Hamas, they continue to fire weapons into the country of Israel, even though Israeli Defense Forces has conducted multi-phased operations in both Gaza and southern Lebanon. So it's going to be very difficult, but that escalation dominance is a concern right now, because it's just both sides ticking things up time after time to see how they can counter what their enemies' actions are and at the same time not go over the edge to start a regional or even a global war.",

And first of all, I wouldn't say that I agree with most of the things that Mr. Netanyahu has done, but in fact, it's very difficult to do ceasefires and even peace actions with an enemy that continues to fire in. And each one of the attempts at a cessation of hostilities that's been brokered by not only Israel but United States and others, there have been an immediate -- almost an immediate reaction by the terrorist organizations of Hamas and Hezbollah to continue to fire into Israel.And that's problematic because when you have one side that won't back down, Mr. Netanyahu feels that he has to continue to defend his territorial sovereignty as well as the welfare of the Israeli people. So, he's not going to back down. And even though there's a lot of people and all of us hoping for the return of the hostages, it takes a second seat to continuing to try and tamp down the actions of these terrorist organizations against the Israeli population.",

There's also been an attempt to tamp down the kind of terrorist action that's coming from Hezbollah inside of Lebanon with a government that doesn't much care for what they're doing against the State of Israel. But you got to remember that both of those terrorist organizations, both Hamas and Hezbollah, have a charter that says their primary effort is to kill Jews and to destroy the State of Israel.So, when you have that kind of an enemy within your territory and within range of firing rockets as you stated earlier, it's very difficult to find some kind of complex peace situation and live peacefully together. There's no government inside of the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority has not stepped up. Hamas has only continued to live by their charter and attacking Israel. So it's very difficult to say, hey, we've got to make some kind of deal with these people to help them stop. It's, you know, this is a millennial long war that's been going on between the Palestinians and the Jews, and it's going to be very difficult to tamp down the hatred that exists between these two people. And it's so very sad because the people who are caught in the middle, as we've seen over the last year, have been the ones that have suffered the most, by design of these terrorist organizations that are using this thing called a victim's doctrine.

The latest update just a short time ago now, has it at category four strength, and the wind should weaken a bit more with Milton expected to make landfall late Wednesday as a category three.But for a state already crippled by hurricane Helene, less than two weeks ago, officials are warning Milton's impact will be catastrophic. Here's a look at the storm from space. Milton's unpredictability comes from its small pinhole eye, a hallmark sign that the storm can fluctuate in its intensity. Florida's highways have been jammed with traffic. Here's a live look at some of the traffic headed north along Interstate 75. This part of the highway is nearly 100 kilometers outside of Tampa. Officials are urging everyone in the storm's path to leave as quickly as they can, and the mayor of Tampa did not mince words ominously warning, \"if you choose to stay, you're going to die.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the easiest and the most logical is just to carry the blue wall and the other normally democratic states and all the other ones seem to be in line already.For Donald Trump, it's really to stop Kamala Harris from winning at least one of the big states in the blue wall, probably Pennsylvania, maybe Wisconsin, but probably Pennsylvania. And then picking up his southern tier, which you would expect him to have some edge in, despite Biden's winning Georgia and Arizona the last time around. And that's credible too. Right now, it is a very close race. Doesn't mean it has to end up that way and I doubt that all the swing states will move in one direction or that they'll be almost evenly split.

      "sentences": "The online rumors are out of control. That is the main takeaway about the myths and disinformation in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Emergency responders and elected officials in hard-hit areas of North Carolina say that the online disinformation about the storm and the aftermath has actually hindered the relief and recovery efforts there, because public officials having to spent time debunking the lies that are being spread both on social media and in some cases, by Former President Donald Trump.Trump has been on the campaign trail claiming that money for FEMA, for the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been diverted to support migrants at the southern border. FEMA officials have pushed back on this, saying it's absolutely untruthful that any money has been diverted from the Disaster Relief Fund and sent to the migrant program. Furthermore, Trump is claiming that survivors are only receiving $750. In fact, that is a short-term immediate payment that is made to survivors. FEMA also comes in over the long term with a lot more money for survivors of hurricanes. On Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed this head on, saying that Donald Trump is lying about what is available to survivors. She called it extraordinarily irresponsible. We've also heard from Republican elected officials who are complaining and criticizing the lies that are spreading on sites like Elon Musk's X. I've also been seeing AI-generated images on Facebook from the storm, and this is something that is not happening in a vacuum because as another hurricane now heads toward Florida, there already lies and rumors spreading about Milton and about whether it's somehow possible to create a weather system and target it towards certain regions. These are ideas that used to exist only in the darkest fringes -- the darkest, deepest corners of the internet. But now, they percolate up through social media and windup confusing lots of people. The response, of course, has to be united from local officials, from federal officials to try to get the truth out and that is a challenge in this evermore fragmented media environment.
