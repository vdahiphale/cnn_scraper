But I wanted to share a story of how he got his name, though. My mom -- my sister LaToya said earlier, before my mom named him which was -- came from a movie called \"Silverado,\" one of the characters in it and she liked that movie. But she wanted to name me that but always kept that name in her back pocket for some reason, I don't know. Then '93 came and our boy came and she was, there you are, Tyre.And I used to always joke with him, like, man, you keep messing with me, I'm going to take my name back. And he was like, no, you ain't, that's my name. But it was how he said it. You know, he was 8 and he was already knew who he was. Like I'm Tyre. This is me. You know, and I always remember that about my little dude. Coming in the house watching him eat cereal and watching Looney Tunes. I just want to thank everybody for being here for us and you know, showing love. It ain't too much, like I say that hasn't already been said about my dude. I just miss him and I love him and this shouldn't have never happened, you know, and thank y'all.",

      "sentences": "That's some Africana ways of knowing. It was the ancestors who said, as long as you say someone's name, they shall never die.It's not too much I can add other than this to this family. We will see him again. I was at First African in savannah, Georgia, doing a workshop. I was in the administrative assistant's office and I realized I needed something to project my presentation, so I ran to Best Buy. I had the associated pastor take me. And we took longer than they had expected but I left my book bag in the administrative assistant's office. When I got back, she said, I thought you'd never come back. I said, did you look around? And she said, no. I said, had you looked around intently you would have saw I left something and that signified that at some point you would see me again. I know he's in the hands of God. I know he's in the ancestral realm but look around intently. He's left something. He's left a child. He's left brothers and sisters. He's left a mother and a father. He's left activists and organizers and community members, and I believe every time we raise our voice for love and justice and power, we will see Tyre again. May the family find comfort in these words. REV. RODNEY WOODLEY: I'd just like to say to my friends, Rodney and Rowvaughn and the entire family, that we are soldiers and we're in this army. We're fighting a fight that seems oftentimes unwinnable. But what I got as I sat here and listened was on that day of January 7th Tyre got drafted unknowingly into a service as a secret agent. He was drafted as a secret agent for a secret mission that he had no idea that he had been drafted for. But just like any soldier before they go off to war to do battle, they want to go and do something that they love. So, he went away to take some pictures, but on his way home the battle was already afoot. So understand this, that just because it looks like he lost the battle, the war will be won because I heard this statement and I'll keep it clear. Wars come and go, but soldiers are eternal. God bless you.",
