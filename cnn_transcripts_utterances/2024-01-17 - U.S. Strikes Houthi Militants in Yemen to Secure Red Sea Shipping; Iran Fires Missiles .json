U.S. defense officials tell CNN a number of anti-ship ballistic missiles were destroyed Tuesday in what was a pre-emptive strike, claiming the missiles were being readied for launch from parts of Yemen under Houthi control.Shortly after the strikes, Houthis claimed to have fired a direct hit on a Greek-owned Maltese-flagged carrier, which the Houthis claim was carrying a shipment of missiles to Israel. The Houthis say they are only targeting commercial shipping linked to Israel, and a spokesman stressed that point again on Tuesday. A U.S. vessel, though, was targeted a day earlier, with the Houthis warning future strikes on Yemen will not go unanswered. More details now from CNN's Oren Liebermann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the third time in the past several days, the U.S. has carried out strikes in Yemen targeting the Houthis. This time, U.S. Central Command says they went after anti-ship ballistic missiles that were preparing to be launched and posed an imminent threat to international shipping lanes. The U.S. has tried to limit and disrupt the Houthis' ability to target international shipping lanes because of the effect that has had on international shipping. Forcing many of the worlds largest carriers to go around Africa, adding thousands to international shipping rounds (ph) . The U.S. has tried to degrade the ability of the Houthis to launch the sorts of missiles, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones that they have used to target shipping. But they have not completely destroyed that ability. Several hours after the U.S. strike, the Houthis launched an anti-ship ballistic missile at a Maltese-flagged carrier. They struck that carrier, according to U.S. Central Command, doing minor damage. The ship was able to continue on its way, but it shows you the threat the Houthis still pose. And that's on top of a missile on Monday that damaged a U.S.-owned and operated vessel, the Gibraltar Eagle. That vessel, too, suffered minor damage, no injuries, and was able to continue on its way. But it's because of this ongoing threat that the U.S. Transportation Department has recommended that U.S.-flagged or U.S.-owned ships, for now, avoid the Red Sea. This is an upgrade of a warning or a recommendation which was supposed to have an end date on it. Now that recommendation to avoid the critical waterway is, at least as of right now, indefinite. So, although the U.S., with the strikes that it conducted with the U.K., was trying to restore safety and security to the Red Sea, you can see the turbulence there, you can see the threat still posed to international shipping, and the fallout from the Houthi attacks on one of the world's most critical waterways.

When Jake Sullivan said this was never the intention to end the Houthi threat, well, I would ask, well, why not? I think that essentially that should have been the goal from the outset, to hit them hard enough to deny them the ability to use those weapons and to not deny them the ability to recover capability. And that means a strategic approach to the use of force.It has to identify Iran as the sponsor and armorer of the Houthis. And I think that we saw a tactical incidence of that when the U.S. went after that vessel, the Iranian vessel carrying weapons. But as one vessel, I think what needs to happen is a much more decisive use of force across the length and breadth of the region against not only the Houthis, but also Iran. Now, the key challenge there, of course, is the Americans and their allies are trying to avoid escalation. If they do this more strategic approach, the risk of escalation goes up. But the risk is that if we continue on with this, as you say, whack-a-mole approach, this is going to go on and on and on. And ultimately, it will be the Iranians, the Houthis and others that will essentially have the initiative and will be responding to them, not us deterring them and defeating them.",

And so therefore, I think it's really vital that the Biden administration have a rethink of it strategy, recognise that it does need to take some risks in terms of escalation.Because if it doesn't, then ultimately, what we end up with is this slow move towards a wider war, but one where you know, the other side controls the initiative.
