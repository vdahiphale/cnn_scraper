More hostages and prisoners set to be released. I asked Middle East expert Khaled Elgindy what we know about those Palestinian detainees. Then, no more excuses. I speak with Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland about her calls for faster climate action ahead of the UN Climate Summit COP28. Also, ahead for us, is social media safe for kids? The Colorado attorney general tells me why he's leading a lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta. Plus, \"The Atlantic's\" Tom Nichols says Trump has crossed a crucial line. He discusses that with Michel Martin. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. A truce between Israel and Hamas is now in its sixth day, with key mediator Qatar hopeful that a further extension will be announced soon, the U.S. echoes that hope. Here's Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking today at a NATO meeting in Brussels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We'll be focused on making -- doing what we can to extend the pause so that we continue to get more hostages out and more humanitarian assistance in. We'll discuss with Israel how it can achieve its objective of ensuring that the terrorist attacks of October 7th never happen again, while sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance and minimizing further suffering and casualties among Palestinian civilians.

This comes as the IDF is assessing Hamas claimsthat the youngest hostage, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, his brother and mother, are no longer alive. The U.S. secretary of state will also visit the West Bank, where many Palestinian prisoners are now coming home. And in Jenin, reports of Israeli military raids and clashes. Out of the Palestinians freed, almost 80 percent were teenage boys ages 14 to 18, and two-thirds were held under administrative detention, meaning they were not told the charges against them or given due legal process, that's according to CNN analysis of Israel Prison Service data. Khaled Elgindy is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and an expert on Israeli Palestinian affairs and he joins me now from Washington. Khaled, good to have you on the show. Can you explain to me and to our viewers how Israel uses this administrative detention? KHALED ELGINDY, DIRECTOR, MEI PROGRAM ON PALESTINE AND PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI AFFAIRS:  Well, administrative detention is a holdover actually from the British -- the rule -- the period of British rule before 1948, and it is -- it's a draconian measure that allows the occupying power, in this case Israel, to hold detainees indefinitely without charge, and these aren't people who've been charged and then awaiting trial, they're simply held for, I believe, 90 days without charge. And then that detention can be renewed more or less indefinitely.",

That's not how Israel treats its citizens, certainly, who very often engage in protests, sometimes quite raucous protests, sometimes even violent protests.

Military courts are notorious, really, in any society, but certainly under Israeli occupation. They're known for, you know, almost none of the basic due process guarantees that you would find in a normal civilian court. And so, the conviction rate is something like 99.8 percent because you don't have those traditional due process guarantees, like being able to confront your accusers, or in some cases, they're convicted without even knowing what evidence is brought against them. They can use secret evidence and often convict people on the basis of that.",

What does that tell you about the psychological impact this is having on residents in the West Bank?

And the fact that, you know, it's not surprising to hear prisoners or their families praising Hamas when Hamas is the one who negotiated their release. And you know, compared to the Fatah leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, who not only hasn't been able to deliver prisoners, which is an issue that resonates across the board with the Palestinian population, but is unable to protect Palestinian lives and property from the very regular attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, you know, much less the soldiers. You know, we've seen over the past two months a major surge in violent attacks by both the Israeli army and of violent settlers. And meanwhile, the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah seems completely helpless. So, by comparison, it's not hard to imagine why. Hamas' popularity would go up and Fatah's popularity would go down.",

Israel has its set of conditions if that were to happen, but at the end of the day, Israel says that it's just a matter of time before they resume their military activity in getting rid of Hamas in Gaza.",

Hamas will continue to exist in one form or another, but we don't know. I mean, we don't know what will happen. Even if we get another two-day or more extension, we know that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a personal interest in picking up where they left off a week ago and resuming the bombing of Gaza. He kind of needs this war politically for his own survival because he knows that there is a reckoning coming and that the Israeli public is angry with him and his leadership and will hold him accountable for the failures of October 7th. So, that's part of the problem here. This isn't just about -- this is no longer about Israeli self-defense.

We're nowhere near that. And if you look at how much money that we have been delivering, it's about $680 billion.

If you see your home destroyed, your family killed, and you've got nothing left, that is what we're talking about in terms of existential, and it's happening again and again. We've got twice as many terrible climate crises today than we had in the end of the 1990s. And the terrible thing is, it's getting more severe. So, a category 5 hurricane in 1979 caused, what, a tenth of the damage that a category 5 hurricane causes today because it's huge. Because what's happening is before the hurricane would pass over the sea and the sea would act as a coolant, pull out the heat. Now, the ocean is acting, more often than not, as an accelerant.

If we had a functioning Congress, we would pass a law on data privacy. We would pass a law that protects young people online. The sad reality is Congress is having trouble even just passing a budget. And as a result, there's a vacuum here. The states are stepping in and state attorneys general enforcing laws like the Child Online Privacy Protection Law or State Consumer Protection Law. We have a role to play here. I would welcome Congress following up on this role, developing a regulatory system to protect our young people.",

And the more time people spend online going down these dark holes on platforms, I mentioned before the self-harm content that more and more young people are seeing, it worsens their mental health. It increases rates of self-harm itself, even suicide. We have to find ways to protect young people, to help them get a good night's sleep, to help them have time to connect with one another, and unregulated access to these platforms with any -- without controls and with notifications all the time and with these dark holes that they can take people down, it's the opposite of what we need.",

They don't know the type of dark holes and the content that kids are being served up, like the self-harm example I mentioned earlier. We also need to make sure that we are constantly attuned to mental health. And there is obviously a broader societal discussion with more research to inform it that we need to be having. There's a lot of work here.

I mean, I've also made arguments that we overuse the word terrorism, for example, that we've justified everything as terrorism. And I worry that over -- not just the past few years, but for decades, people in the United States especially have called all right-wing movements they don't like fascism.

People who support him, people on his team, are drawing up plans, for example, to invoke the Insurrection Act on Inauguration Day, not because they're worried about civil disorder, but simply to intimidate American citizens and to put down any protests against his inauguration if, God help us, he is re-elected. He is talking about camps, large camps for detaining immigrants. And he's talking about using the Justice Department against his enemies. He said, well, you know, people are challenging me, I'll just indict them. You know, this is also something that goes back to the experience with fascism, where the early fascists seized -- they found they kind of burrowed into government structures either through appointment or, you know, kind of fluke election and then seize the machinery of government to exterminate their opponents, politically and sometimes physically.

I think the other reason is that, unfortunately, it has to rest with the voters who I think have decided not to take things seriously. If you're a citizen in a democracy, you should have at least enough bandwidth to know that a major party candidate is talking like a fascist. You don't have to spend all day watching the news to be an involved enough citizen, but I think people kind of shrug and they say, well, it's fun. It's reality TV. People who voted for him the first time, many of them said point blank, I just wanted to see what would happen. And I think that first term, they've said, well, how bad could it be? And they don't realize how close we came. And I think the third reason is that Trump himself just got us used to it. There's a kind of frog boiling here, you know, where you boil the frog degree by degree in a hot pan, and Trump just got us used to saying crazy things.

It has to be, we have a Republican nominee, and we have a Democratic nominee. And this election is a totally normal election, just like 1996 or 1984 or 1972.

These were all themes that the former president signaled when he ran for office. So, I guess what I'm asking you, as somebody who is a close observer of our politics and our history, is why did it take you this long to see that this was dangerous, when there are a lot of people who said at the very beginning that this is just not -- this is not the leader of a liberal diverse democracy?",

And I think particularly after January 6th, if I'm a little late to this usage, maybe January 6th was the time to start talking about it. But even January 6th was just such a chowder headed rebellion of people that just wanted to trash government offices that it was -- I don't think there was a coherence to it yet. And I think Trump now -- after finally being turned out office, I think Trump's rage and his narcissistic injury has finally led him to talk about his fellow citizens, rounding them up as vermin, rooting them out, expelling them. And that -- you know, there -- he always had a nativist nationalistic kind of approach, but he also -- in 2016, he flipflopped on issues basically depending on where he felt he needed to be in any given moment. One thing I would point out in all this discussion about fascism, fascists tend to be pretty consistent, they tend to be workaholics, and they tend to be, you know, like it or not, pretty brave people when it comes to the streets, and Trump is none of those things.
