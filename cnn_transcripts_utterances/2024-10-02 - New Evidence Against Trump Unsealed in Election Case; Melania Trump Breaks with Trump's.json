      "sentences": "Tonight, stunning new evidence in Jack Smith's January 6 case against Donald Trump, what he revealed, and what it could mean for Donald Trump in court and, of course, at the ballot box.Plus, an attorney who says he represents dozens of new Diddy accusers. He claims there is an accomplice list that will -- quote -- \"shock the public.\" Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Well, Special Counsel Jack Smith is laying it all out there. His plan for prosecuting Donald Trump in the 2020 election conspiracy case revealed in a newly unsealed 165-page court filing. Light reading for what? A Thursday, Wednesday night? What is it? In it, we get never- before-seen evidence. We get his argument for why Trump is not immune from prosecution. We get a roadmap for how Smith plans to present this case at a potential trial. Notice, plan and potential. It essentially amounts to his opening statement. But it's all on paper, of course. He drops a familiar name in page after page, Mike Pence. A lot of the new evidence related to the former vice president, the man who had to be escorted to a secure location on January 6, that after a mob stormed the Capitol and called for his hanging. The filing explains how moments after what you're seeing happened, an aide rushed to Trump to tell him about the mob's threats against Pence. Well, Trump looked at the aide and apparently said only, so what? And remember this tweet on January 6, the one from Trump's account, accusing Pence of lacking courage for not tipping the election? Well, Smith argues he can prove Trump was by himself and using his own phone when it went out. How? By calling as a witness the only other Trump advisor who had access to his account. There's also this new detail: Smith cites an assistant who heard Trump tell family members on Marine One, no less, after the election -- quote -- \"It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.\" Now, a big chunk of this filing is Jack Smith's effort to address the issue that threatened to sink his entire case. Remember the Supreme Court and their ruling in July, one that granted Trump broad immunity for official acts? I know, that was like a thousand years ago at this point in time. But Smith, now, here, is arguing that Trump acted in his own private capacity as a candidate, not in his official role as president. Smith does that by claiming Trump used private actors and his own campaign infrastructure to overturn the election. He also gets crafty with how he describes one Mike Pence whose evidence Smith definitely wants to introduce at a trial. Throughout the entire filing, Trump and Pence are described as running mates. He's trying to show their conversations were related to the campaign, hence running mates, and not official acts. He also argues that Pence's role during the January 6 certification was legislative. It wasn't part of his duties in the executive branch. Will the Supreme Court buy it? I mean, we'll see if it ends up back there. I mean, take off the word \"if\" when it ends up back there. The chances case goes to trial before the election, though? Zilch. Zero. None. If Trump gets elected, the educated guess says it goes away. That doesn't mean this filing won't have big implications for the election. It's a final chance for voters to hear some of the evidence that is being alleged by Jack Smith before Election Day. It's also a chance for Trump to claim the deck is stacked against him. He's already doing that tonight, by the way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's important to note, these allegations and in this lawsuit, it's yet to be filed. The attorney representing the 120 people says it will be filed within 30 days.In a statement, a lawyer for Diddy said -- quote -- \"Mr. Combs emphatically and categorically denies as false and defamatory any claim that he sexually abused anyone, including minors. He looks forward to proving his innocence and vindicating himself in court if and when claims are filed and served, where the truth will be established based on evidence, not speculation.\" Now, Diddy is already facing at least 12 civil lawsuits. He hasn't responded to all of them. He has denied many of the allegations in them. And he settled one from ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. That suit seemed to break the floodgates of legal peril for Diddy. Not only is he facing a growing number of civil claims, he's facing three federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. He has pleaded not guilty and is currently in jail awaiting trial. Well, joining me now, Tony Buzbee, a lawyer representing the 120 accusers who apparently intend to sue Diddy. Tony, welcome.

[23You should know that of the 120 cases that will file, they'll be filed individually. Each of them, of course, Sean Combs will be a defendant. But there will be other defendants in each case. Some of these will be filed in New York. Some will be filed in California. They will be filed not only against Mr. Combs, but perhaps against venues and other entities that we believe were involved. You should know that of these 120 people, that they're from 25 different states. Twenty-five of them were minors at the time this alleged conduct occurred. And even since we had our press conference yesterday to announce the intention to file these cases, you know, as you might expect, we've received thousands of more calls.

I mean, you talk about making the band. Cassie gets it worse than anyone for 10 years. She believed she was working on an album. That was the method of control he used to keep her doing what he wanted her to do at night. During the day, she's working on an album. The album never had a title. It never had a release date.

And I asked, why did the internship stop? And I got no answer. And it wasn't until years later that I was finally told that Diddy had said, come home with me tonight or the internship is over.And I was shocked that he would have the audacity to say that and do that to somebody who is related to somebody in the media.
