So, we expect him to be talking with his lawyers.His co-defendant, Walt Nauta, had been traveling with him over the weekend and he is also expected to come to court over the summons from the Justice Department to make their initial appearance on Tuesday afternoon. So, what that means is, on Tuesday, they're going to be brought into this courthouse. We might not see them walk in at all and they'll go up to the federal courtroom and they'll meet with a magistrate judge where they will face the charges in the indictment. They'll be told exactly what they're charged with, obstruction for both of them, for the former president, 31 counts representing documents of national security, national defense importance that he is alleged to have retained knowingly outside of the protection of the federal government. And then they'll have a chance to enter their pleas. At this time, that's totally expected that they will say not guilty even if they could entertain plea deals down the road. And then we're going to get a little bit of a sense of how this moves forward after that in court, although the hearing could be pretty short.

So, Elie, walk us through what we've learned from the indictments about specifically the documents that were taken to Mar-a- Lago. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Erica, it's been a long, strange trip for these documents, and it starts back when Donald Trump was still president in Washington, D.C. Now this, of course, we recognize that guy, Donald Trump, but get to know this man. That is Walt Nauta. He's the second defendant in this case. He was Donald Trump's valet. And in the weeks and days before Donald Trump left office in January of 2021, the indictment alleges that Trump and Nauta, but Trump himself was directly involved in the packaging up of these documents and sending them down to Mar-a-Lago. There was some speculation. What would Trump know about packing up? The indictment says he was involved and he knew what was being sent down there. And the indictment gives us really important information about what's in those documents. Yes, there are some things that are souvenirs, trinkets, newspaper articles, but this is what matters for the legal case. There are documents created by and for the CIA, Department of Defense, NSA that relate to our defense and weapons capabilities, our nuclear programs, our potential vulnerabilities, and our plans for a possible retaliation.

That's a crucial text that's in the indictment.So, the documents start off in the ballroom. They then move to a business center, and then they're moved to the lake room.

He finds 38 documents he gives to DOJ. He says, we did a diligent search. This is what we got. Of course, there was many more.So, how did that happen? Well, the deception happened by Trump and Nauta because they took 64 documents out of there in the days before Corcoran and just put 30 of them back. We can do the math there.

Remember in Cincinnati, just days after the Mar-a-Lago search warrant, a guy with an AR-15 rifle came in and opened fire on the FBI's office there until he was killed in a shootout with police. So, you've got the group thing, you've got the crowd thing, but you've got the lone wolf thing to consider in these factors.And Florida is a funny place. Under Governor DeSantis, they made it easier to carry guns. You don't need a permit, you can have concealed weapons, but it's not an open carry state. So, you can't show up with your AR-15 rifles in full uniform or your pistols on your hip and fully exposed. But there's a trick, which is if you're a hunter is on the way to a hunting thing, or if you're a fisherman going fishing, or if you're a sportsman on your way to target practice, then you can.

Former President Trump's current attorney at odds with his former attorney general, who says Trump is not being treated unfairly in this classified documents case.Let's take a closer look now with Donald Ayer, the deputy attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, who's also worked with Bill Barr. It's good to have you with us this morning. We hear those comments from Bill Barr, I mean, very clear in what he sees in this indictment, how detailed it was, what this means for the former president. I wonder, how much weight do you think his words carry? DAVID AYER, FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH:  Well, I think what really carries weight is what the indictment alleges and the ability, if they have it, which I'm sure they do, to prove the events in the indictment. It's a very damning indictment. And if you read the whole thing, you actually see there's a long statement in there by the Donald Trump himself talking about how important it is to protect national security secrets and how he's going to do something about it. Bill Barr is the worst attorney general in the history of the United States. He did everything he could to help Donald Trump secure the position he wanted as an autocratic president. He did favors for his friends. He misused the Department of Justice, including using an investigation in order to get Donald Trump re-elected. So, at the end of the day, what Bill Barr has to say is of no weight in my mind. I do think, however, that the fact that this person who was such a scoundrel as the attorney general for Donald Trump, even he sees the force of this indictment and sees how clear it is that Donald Trump has done terrible things for which he deserves to be punished. So, I think a lot of people will give it weight. HILL:  Quite a picture that you paint of your assessment there of the former attorney general and your opinion of him, that some will give it weight. It's interesting, though, because so much of what we hear, it seems that the opinions are already baked in for many Americans. Even -- we're going to share some of this reporting later in the hour, but even some of our own reporters, in talking to Trump supporters over the weekend, asking specifically about had they read the indictment, there wasn't a desire to even read it. Do you think those comments from a Bill Barr or even Alan Dershowitz, who was writing in an op-ed about how strong the case is in here, those could actually begin to have some sway or at least encourage people read the indictment for themselves?",

I mean, again, I am not privy to all the evidence that they have, and there's always the possibility, although I think it's a small one, but somehow there are things that make it impossible to do that.But I think the attorney general, who has been unfairly attacked all manner of times by many people on the left and the right, I think the attorney general is forthright and solid on the need to hold people accountable. And I believe he's going to play it absolutely straight. And playing it straight, I think, here is going to mean that Donald Trump is all the things in the hearings on the Hill showed Donald Trump was at the center of the entire movement for January 6th. He's the one that drove that whole process. You cannot fail to hold that person accountable and have a system of justice that deserves to be respected. It simply isn't possible.",

And what is he going to perceive to be that?It's hard for me to imagine that he would agree to go to jail, and it's hard for me to imagine that the government would plea the case without having him go to jail.
