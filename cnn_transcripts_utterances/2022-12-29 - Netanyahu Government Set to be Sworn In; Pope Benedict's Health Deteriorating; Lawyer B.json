He outlined his priorities. He said that he would continue to ensure that Iran didn't get hold of a nuclear weapon. He said he'd boost Israel's security, boost public transport, lower house prices and also move forward with more peace agreements with countries in the region. Saudi Arabia was mentioned by the outgoing prime minister, Yair Lapid, as a very good prospect for a next peace agreement with Israel.One of the thing that he didn't (INAUDIBLE) in his speech, but which was outlined in his agenda for the government yesterday, is that there will be no change to the status quo of religion and state in Israel, and that including the holy sites. There were concerns that the status quo, particularly vis-a-vis Jews being able to pray on Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, would be changed. That is not something this government says is going to happen. However, given how far to the right and from -- previously from the fringes of Israeli politics his coalition partners are, Netanyahu has felt the need in recent weeks to go on a charm offensive, going on interviews with U.S. networks, maintaining that no one, whether they're from the LGBTQ community, from the Arab community, or secular people will be discriminated against by this new government. But as we've heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, this government, he said, will be judged by its actions, not by its personalities. And just finally, just to tell you that we're, probably in the next half hour, expecting Netanyahu to once again swear the oath to be sworn in as Israel's prime minister for a record sixth time. We're not there yet. But in the next half hour, that's what we're expecting. Kaitlan.",

That includes the Galilee in the north, the Negev (ph) in the south, and they also specify Judea and Samaria, a.k.a. the West Bank. So, it would be no surprise if this government does move forward with that plan on building more settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.That said, coalition agreements and also agendas that they published are not sacrosanct. They are not legally binding. So, until such time as it's done, we should wait and see and, as Secretary of State Blinken says, judge this government by its actions.",

But we are here waiting, along with all the other people who have come to the Vatican for Christmas time, who  have heard the news, who are asking us for updates, and surely along with much of the rest of the world for any update on the pope emeritus' condition.Let me just tell you where he is right now. This is St. Peter's Basilica. Just behind that are the Vatican gardens. And up a small hill is the Pope Emeritus' home, which they call a monastery. It's a bit like a small house. That's where he retired to just about 10 years ago now. That's where he is with doctors as the Vatican told us yesterday, saying that his -- due to his advanced age, his health is deteriorating. We know, of course, that the pope emeritus is quite frail. He is 95 years old. But as I say, at the moment, Poppy, we wait for an update from the Vatican. Poppy.",

There's very set -- rigid set of rules for when a pope dies and there's a conclave. Every day something has to happen. But nobody has a rule book for what happens when a pope emeritus dies. I think it will depend on two things. One is Pope Francis, how he wants to handle it. And the other is Pope Benedict himself. Has he left any instructions as to how he would like his funeral to go.Certainly considering his stature in the Catholic Church, I cannot imagine that Pope Francis would not want to give him the full honors and the full send-off.

And my colleagues and I, Jeremy Herb, Tierney Sneed and I specifically have been watching what he's been doing over those four years because this is a person who's very behind the scenes. You don't hear his name that much. But he has had an enormous influence on government and on how Congress wields its power. So, the tax returns coming out, that is largely because Letter has been the architect of many, many court fights trying to go after Donald Trump's finances and get access to information whenever he was president and then continuing on after Trump left the presidency. The tax returns fight, that was just one of many, many cases that Letter argued in courts and ultimately won. And the reason he was so different and the reason that the power of Congress is so different is because he approached the job differently. He's a litigator. That wasn't the type of risk that previous people in this position ever wanted to take. They weren't those types of lawyers. They were more negotiators behind the scenes. And one of the things that has made Letter so successful, we found, is that he had the ability to tell members of Congress, Democrats, hold on, be patient, stay quiet and pursue these tax returns behind the scenes. Now, we have the Republicans coming in. Letter is going to be out of a job. He's going to be going into the private sector. And we're going to have to watch how Republicans are going to flex all of the powers that they have. How they're going to be using subpoenas. We talked to one source for our story today about Letter and his legacy, and they told us that when the Republicans come in, the most consequential choice that they will make is who the next general counsel will be, except for that other choice, who the speaker is going to be. That's going to dictate a lot of what happens in these next couple of years. Kaitlan.",
