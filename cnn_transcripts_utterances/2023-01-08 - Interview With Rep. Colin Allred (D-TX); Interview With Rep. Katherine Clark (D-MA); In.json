      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is reeling from a wild week. This morning, after a historic struggle, Kevin McCarthy is House speaker. He won ugly, but he won. It took 15 ballots, a divisive speaker struggle not seen since before the Civil War, agonizing negotiations, concession after concession, the hard-liner holdouts, and a near brawl between McCarthy ally Armed Services Committee chairman-designate Mike Rogers and chief instigator Congressman Matt Gaetz.And it's not over yet. McCarthy needs to overcome concern now among established Republicans, the kind who actually want to, you know, govern, who are worried that maybe he gave away too much in his negotiations with hard-liners, before the House can pass a rules pack on Monday. In short, McCarthy has the title he's always wanted, but not necessarily the power that used to come with it. He got a win, but his mandate is less assured. McCarthy required the better part of a week to grind down the conservative opposition to his speaker bid and the way things had been done in the House for decades. One of the holdouts, Republican Congressman Chip Roy of Texas, was instrumental in delivering him the gavel. Roy negotiated a laundry list of concessions from McCarthy designed to spread power among the House rank and file, and particularly the House Freedom Caucus. And Roy's deal ultimately flipped up to 15 votes for McCarthy, paving the way for his victory Friday night. Joining me now for his first interview after the speaker election is Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy. First of all, congratulations on everything that happened and getting what you wanted in the negotiations. It's not -- it's not necessarily a sure thing that that happens. We're just learning some of the promises McCarthy made, capping spending at 2022 levels for fiscal year 2024, a subcommittee to investigate the Justice Department, more Freedom Caucus representation on important committees like the Rules Committee, a one-member threshold for a motion to vacate, which is what it used to be before 2019. What other commitments did McCarthy make that you can tell us about? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX):  Well, first of all, let's remember that a little temporary conflict is necessary in this town in order to stop this town from rolling over the American people. I don't think anybody on either side of the aisle could say with a straight face that they think that Washington is doing good work for the American people on a regular basis and isn't broken. We have to work to fix this place. And, look, some of the tensions you saw on display when you saw some of the interactions there between Mike Rogers and Matt Gaetz, some of that is, we need a little of that. We need a little of this sort of breaking the glass in order to get us to the table, in order for us to fight for the American people, and to change the way this place is dysfunctional. So, this all started going back last summer. We wanted rules to open this place up. We wanted more transparency. We wanted more openness, more ability to add amendments to the floor. So, for example, you asked, what else did we get? We got amendments to be able to -- I mean, I'm sorry. We got the ability to offer amendments on the floor of the House during appropriations that will open it up again. We haven't done that. So, since I have been in Congress, I have not been able to offer an amendment on the floor. There hasn't been an amendment offered in open debate since May of 2016. We changed it.",

Here's what we need to see in any speaker. And so we have been out and open about that. But I want to make clear this isn't about trying to -- Chip Roy wants a spot on a committee. I haven't been promised anything. Literally, I have got nothing out of this deal for me personally. Does that mean I might end up on a Rules Committee? Maybe, if that's what the -- my colleagues want. We still have to go through that process. But what we have extracted are the promises from the speaker to make sure that we have ideological diversity and representation among these committees. Appropriations, there are two Freedom Caucus members out of 33 that are likely to be in the majority. So think about that. HFC is 20 percent of the body, yet two of 33 appropriators.

And so our concern is that is a bit of virtue, signaling, a bit of just going to shift around the cups and putting -- making you guess where the ball is going to be.

I would imagine that there was some sort of agreement behind the scenes going on for him to stick by him during this whole process.

She wants to pass on this call to Rosendale. Rosendale is waving it off. He doesn't want to -- he doesn't want to talk.

They are united in what they want to do on the policy, which is to hold the American people hostage over the debt ceiling. They have been saying that for months. And that's not an establishment, right-wing -- there's no disagreement there. They are in total agreement around that. And just going back to January 6 really quickly, McCarthy became speaker the morning of the 7th, really the day of the 6th. He said nothing about the attack on the Capitol. I think it's an insult to the Capitol Police, who kept him and us alive that day. I think it's an indicator of what kind of speaker is going to be.",

I will share with you that a post-Election Day NARAL showed not only do 80 percent of -- eight in 10 Americans believe reproductive freedom -- in reproductive freedom. About 85 percent of Americans are concerned that that is the one of the first things Republicans will do. They're going to essentially see their concerns affirmed immediately.",

The upside of football is that the Damar had a toy drive that was supposed to raise $2,500. I think it's over $7.5 million now. That's the generosity of the American people. That's who we are. Football is an incredibly dangerous, violent game. But it also taught me a lot. It's part of who I am. I don't think my boys -- I have two sons -- will be playing football. But I also understand that there's aspects of it that teach leadership, commitment, the idea that you're part of a larger -- something larger than yourself, that we could use a little bit more of.
