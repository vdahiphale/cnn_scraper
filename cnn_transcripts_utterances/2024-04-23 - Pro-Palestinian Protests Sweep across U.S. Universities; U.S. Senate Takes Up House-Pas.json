It's 9 am in New York. Meanwhile, in Gaza 200 days of fighting more than 34,000 people killed the violence, now sparking huge protests halfway around the world, on several U.S. university campuses. It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. And we begin outside that New York court where my colleague Erica Hill is standing by with the very latest. Erica, what do we expect today?

      "sentences": "Thanks Becky. Good to see you today. So day one yesterday, we saw our first witness. We saw those opening statements. Rightnow of course, as you pointed out, Donald Trump has just arrived here at court in lower Manhattan to begin day two with that witness. But before we get to the witness later this morning, about 30 minutes from now, the judge is holding a special hearing. That's where he will determine whether the former president did in fact violate that gag order, which was imposed by the judge of this trial. The gag order says the Donald Trump cannot make public statements about witnesses, jurors' prosecutors on this staff courts on this case rather or court staff and family members. That of course also includes members of the Judge Juan Merchan's own family. Prosecutors say they believe Trump has repeatedly violated that order, in part by posting on social media about his former lawyer Michael Cohen. And they want the judge to find that $1,000 per violation and to punish any future violations with jail time. So after that gag order hearing which if it is not wrapped up by 11 am will then go on later in the day so they can bring the witness back. We will hear from that first witness David Pecker, the former publisher of the tabloid paper, \"The National Enquirer\" Former Head of AMI, the company that owns that. He's really central to the prosecution's case here. Prosecutors frame him as a key player in the quote, catch and kill scheme to keep damaging information from the voting public ahead of the 2016 election. CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is, of course, following all of these developments very closely for us. So one when David Pecker is back on the stand later today, we didn't get through a lot but we did get through that checkbook journalism that National Enquirer engaged in and a sense of what his role was, what more can we expect today Kaitlin? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: We're going to be expecting the prosecutors to ask David Pecker when he's testifying about specific instances where he had insight into Donald Trump. Conversations he witnessed, not what they would call hearsay. But when he was in the room when we was having conversations with Trump, about the catch and kill schemes that \"The National Enquirer\" took part in. So one of those situations we know the prosecutors want to bring up because they talked about it when they opened to the jury yesterday giving their overview of what they would present. There was a meeting in 2015, where David Pecker sat down with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump at that time discussing how his publication could be the eyes and ears of the campaign, how he could report back to them. If there were negative stories bubbling up people approaching his publication, wanting to sell tales they had about Donald Trump, one of those people ultimately became Karen McDougal, a woman whose attorney approached \"The National Enquirer\" to sell her story. She did get $150,000, from \"The National Enquirer\" to have them acquire her rights. They bought her story about an alleged affair with Trump and then buried it. It never came out before the 2016 election. This is what prosecutors want to say is one instance in a pattern of instances where Donald Trump was motivated by his campaign by his election, by his hope to win the White House and appeal to female voters so that he would keep women who had damaging stories about him quiet like Karen McDougal and of course, like Stormy Daniels, who's at the heart of these business falsification records charges facing the former president.",

The negotiations to freedom described by cattery mediators today as in a quote state of frustration meanwhile, civilians in Gaza enduring great suffering. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the last 200 days, mostly women and children. The true scale of destruction in Gaza is still being uncovered. More than 300 bodies have been found in a mass grave within the Nasar medical complex in Khan Yunis. The IDF says bodies buried at the hospital were examined to see if any of them were Israeli hostages and then returned to their quote place. And the IDF says its fighter jet struck 25 targets over the past 24 hours, including this eight storey building in Gaza City. Israel says its part of its continuing counterterrorism activity.

He says, you know, there's a state of frustration amongst the mediators, but also in a general sense that there was no agreement during Ramadan or during Eid. Now -- these real expectations, real hopes, that there will be a pause in the fighting a temporary ceasefire during that period last month in order to try and affect the release of these hostages, as you rightly suggests they remain in Gaza. Meantime, the independent review established by the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, to examine the role and conduct of UNWRA, which is effectively UN Agency for Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere, has said that the agency's neutrality must be strengthened.

And it was looking at that allegation which Israel has made, that numerous employees of the UN in the Gaza Strip, UNRWA have been members of Palestinian military groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. I mean, what the report concluded though, is that there's been no substantial evidence presented by Israel that gives truth to any of the -- any of those -- any of those allegations, nor has there been any substantive, substantive proof that members are the employees of the United Nations in the Gaza Strip, took part in the October 7th attacks on Israeli communities? Again, that's something that Israel has accused UN employees of doing. And you know there's been pushback by the Israelis. There's been a social media posting by the spokesperson for the Israel, one of the spokespeople for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, saying that this just shows the UN and I'm paraphrasing him. He's incapable of addressing this serious problem. But of course, it also doesn't do us anything, or do anything to get us any closer to this idea that UN employees may have been sort of complicit in the attacks on October 7th, the report doesn't find that.",

The only sign ofreal tensions at this point are the barricades and the caution tape that is up along with the security presence outside of the university gates. But over this past week is when we have seen those protests come in various forms, some that had been largely very peaceful, very much in solidarity with Gaza. Others, however much more anti-Semitic and even violent in its messaging but that contrast has also come from protests that have emanated from on campus and student led protests versus those that have been fueled from off campus. And even student organizers here at Columbia University have tried to distance themselves from those that have come from off campus, calling them essentially instigators and do not represent what they are protesting. And what they are protesting. The crux of all of this, at least here at Columbia University, is they have essentially been camping out on campus to urge Columbia University to divest from corporations that they say benefit from Israeli apartheid and Israeli genocide. That was the genesis of the actual protests, and they are still camped out on campus. Behind me, we got some aerial images earlier today to sort of show the setup camped out on one of the lawns there. A day after it started the university sent in the police to clear out that encampment and students were arrested. They were disciplined, some suspended and some say it inflames some of the tensions here tensions that we still feel, to this point, not just for those who of course, are part of the pro-Palestinian protests, but also Jewish students as well, especially as the Passover week begins here, take a listen to some of the students that we've spoken to about how they feel during this time.

So let's pick up with you know what Brynn and I were just talking about there is this question of is Donald Trump reposting or quoting what someone is saying, for example, there is a right wing host who said that the jury was full of undercover liberal activists, in his words? There was another post where he was quoting somebody talking about accusing the jury poll of being -- a being very liberal and bias against Donald Trump posting someone else's words, does that, in your view, would that violate this gag order?",

I think in that context, where instead of just pressing a button to re-tweet or repost something that he actually typed out with somebody else said, put quote marks around it, and essentially adopted it is his own. I think that I think the judge is going to find the -- adopted, endorse that statement is going to find that to be a violation of the gag order.",

The reality is that, first of all, if using contempt, in order to send someone to prison is usually to jail for some period of time is usually done when the judge is witnessing something in the courtroom. Let's say defendant lunges that someone in the courtroom or does something like that. I think this context is just too far afield. I don't see the judge actually.",

The judge rules on evidence, the judge rules regarding what questions are permitted or not permitted. The judge even decides whether or not his attorneys get a preview of which witnesses are going to be called the next day. And so I really think it's in Trump's interest to have the judge happy and not unhappy with him. And I think that Judge Merchan is going to do what it takes or should try to do what it takes to show Trump that that is a good thing for him to do and part of what makes the judge happiest when people comply with his orders.",

Right now the judge in that case holding a hearing on whether to find the former president for repeatedly violating a gag order so briefly, the order bars Donald Trump Republican discussing witnesses or jurors, court staff, prosecutors, their families in this criminal case. Later today after that hearing so right around 11 am Eastern Time, we will see the jury be brought well; we won't see it because we can't be in there. Of course the jury that will be brought back into the courtroom. And Donald Trump's longtime friend, the Former Chief Executive of American Media, which published \"The National Enquirer\" David Pecker will be back on the stand. He is of course witness number one here for the prosecution prosecutors looking to lay out his role in orchestrating two nondisclosure agreements for negative stories about Trump this is what is often referred to as catch and kill. I want to bring in CNN Political Commentator, S.E. Cupp. S.E. always good to talk to you, my friend you know, as we've been watching this, it's pretty clear. We've known this for some time you have your dug in camp of supporters and Democrats who may feel a certain way, there's probably not going to be a lot of budget. But among those voters who are still up for grabs, is there any evidence at this point that this trial is having an impact? S.E. CUPP, CNN CORRESPONDENT: No. And let me -- let me say, at the start, I don't think most voters are paying that close attention to this trial and the myriad other trials. I think they're going about their lives and waiting sort of for the election to get closer to really take a hard look. That is to say, this isn't important to cover it is. The nominee for president is on trial for hush money payments to a porn star. I mean, it was remarkable. But as you say, I think the other folks are baked, right? You've got Maga supporters who believe that the entire system around Donald Trump is corrupt. And then you've got, you know, people who are Trump critics, who can see with their own eyes that he's probably here for a reason. But listen, I think over the course of these trials, Trump is campaigning at the same time. You saw him up here at his hearing for the gag order, and it was all politics, all he was doing was campaigning. So it is important for him to use these trials and these public hearings that we are all covering and focused on and have cameras on, as -- you know, campaign events.",

Does he have to be in court? Yes, legally, he has to be here four days a week while court is in session. There are other opportunities and he is taking full advantage as you point out S.E. of those cameras as he goes in and out of court to essentially campaign.",

They really didn't like having to message around that legislation and those policies, their own -- their own policies, by the way. They prefer believe it or not to have to talk about Trump on trial, again for this very unseemly sorted hush money payment to a porn star. They prefer this than to have to go out and defend their own legislation and policies. That's how crazy and wild the state of affairs the climate is for the Republican Party as their nominee for president is out there on the world stage campaigning at his own trials.

But the prosecutor in court just now is saying he's still doing it. About Michael Cohen here in this very courthouse in the hallway outside and so that is part of the discussion now where Trump is not reacting, but they are talking about real things, not just online posts that Donald Trump made a few days ago, maybe 10 days ago or so over and over again on Truth Social.
