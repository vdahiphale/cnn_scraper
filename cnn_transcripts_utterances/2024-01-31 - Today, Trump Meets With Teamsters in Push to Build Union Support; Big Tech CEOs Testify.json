      "sentences": "Right, John. So, I mean, lawmakers have spent the past two-plus years doing a lot of talking about the potential harms to young people on social media, but not taking a lot of action.So, the big question today will be, can we hear more than just these flashy sound bites, especially in election year? Will there be pushes for real change from the CEOs? Already, we've seen parents filing into this hearing room, holding pictures of young people who presumably have been hurt in some way by social media. So, the pressure is really on here. There are reasons to believe that today's hearing could be different from some of the other online safety hearings that we've seen over the past couple of years. Among those reasons is that there are a number of more serious legislative proposals now on the table that could hold these companies accountable. There is the Kids Online Safety Act, which Snapchat has already said it's going to endorse. I think we'll hear some of these other CEOs face pressure to also endorse that bill. There's another proposal that would crack down on the creation of A.I.-generated non-consensual images, sexual images, which, of course, we know Taylor Swift was the latest victim of just last week. And from these CEOs, I think we're going to hear them tout their existing youth safety measures. Many of them have tools that let parents oversee their teen's social media use, but critics are saying that doesn't go far enough and it puts too much pressure on parents and on teenagers themselves to have a safe experience on social media. And so I think it will be interesting to see whether these social media CEOs can really reassure lawmakers that they're doing enough in this area, John.",

Well, we just heard this morning from Nikki Haley on Charlamagne tha God radio interview, where she offered, as you said, Kate, her sharpest critiques yet of the former president. She went after him in a way that we haven't seen her do today.We have seen her go after questions about his mental fitness. But this morning, she said bluntly that he is just toxic when she was asked about how he has changed politics. Listen to what she said. It seems like we don't have that sound bite. Sorry. But, obviously, this is a critical moment for Nikki Haley. She has been fundraising in New York. She'll head to Palm Beach fundraising today. She is really trying to do everything that she can to convince voters that is worth keeping her campaign alive. And another thing that she is doing, her campaign, is launching a new effort to cast former President Trump and Joe Biden as grumpy old men. Now, we have seen her tie these two politicians together, increasingly so over the last month or so. But this is a new effort to try and really cast them in the same vein, as two old men who are stuck in basements and the like. And over the course of the last few days, one thing I want to point out, Kate, is that she has made a point to showcase her foreign policy chops. And that is very clearly stating how she would have responded if she were commander-in-chief to this attack that we saw in Yemen that killed three U.S. service members, clearly saying that she would go after IRGC leadership. And contrasting to that, we haven't heard much from former President Trump on the matter. He has put out two statements. He blamed Biden for the death of those service members. But Nikki Haley obviously saw this as a moment to go on a media blitz, to really hone in on her foreign policy expertise. Of course, we know that for most voters, foreign policy isn't their top voting decision-maker, but it is a way for her to showcase what she would do if she were commander-in-chief very clearly.

Let's talk about Nikki Haley in just one second. I want to focus real first though on this battle for union support from Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The fight for union support, Astead, is really -- it is an interesting one. Biden won the support of the UAW last week, but we know that Donald Trump appeals to union workers, working class voters, and he has since 2016 in a way that Republicans traditionally have not for decades.

We don't know if that'll happen.We do know that both Biden and Trump are expected to meet with Teamsters. That's really rankling some rank and file union members who are writing letters to say, you know, come on. Like, Trump was not a very pro-union president. And so we see a lot of that split. We saw that in Michigan, where Trump was there in Detroit. He was at a non-union plant, because he wasn't able to get the union leadership to get him to hold his rally at a union plant. And so I think, you know, when you go and talk to those rank and file members, they don't necessarily like that, right, like both of these Trump and Biden are coming in here and using them as political props. They will vote as they will, and, in some cases, regardless of what the leadership will do.",

Choosing to go on the Breakfast Club, you know, do an interview with Charlamagne tha God. I think it's not a natural Nikki Haley audience. It speaks to someone who very much is still seeing themselves as having a long road in this race. And I think that's consistent with our reporting.She does not have a money problem. There continues to be a kind of elite donor class at the Republican Party who is supporting her. She has a math problem. She has a problem in South Carolina and in the kind of states coming forward that the grassroots base of the Republican Party isn't really speaking that same language. And, more importantly, a lot of the apparatus of the Republican Party, the state party officials, have really been squeezed since New Hampshire by the Trump campaign to try to wrap this primary up and really name Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee. I saw her in Nashville over right before the New Hampshire results. And you can see her ramping up these attacks, lumping Biden and Trump together. But the means today, the grumpy old men line, I think that shows that this is going -- she's not going to go down without having her kind of say clearly. I think the what if for the Nikki Haley campaign is what if she was making these kind of clear contrast with Donald Trump at the beginning of her campaign throughout the entirety, not just since he is one Iowa, New Hampshire and the electoral path for him looks a lot better.",

They say that there are thousands of displaced Palestinians who have been sheltering at that hospital, who are now living in, quote, constant fear and anxiety.They said that, last night, Israeli tanks actually rolled into the front yard of that hospital. The Israeli military, for its part, didn't deny that specifically, but they did say that they, quote, did not operate inside the hospital itself. They also maintain they have been closely coordinating and communicating with hospital officials to try and ensure the delivery of fuel and to ensure that electricity remains on at that hospital. But what is clear is that the Israeli military, for about a week now, has been engaged in a very significant offensive in that area of Western Khan Younis, where several key hospitals, including Al Amal Hospital as well as Al Nasr Hospital, are both located. Not only are those critical hospitals for the wounded and the ill but they have also become shelters for thousands of displaced Palestinians. And there has been very, very intense fighting in that area with Israeli tanks and armored vehicles surrounding the area of many of those hospitals. Strikes, artillery shelling also reported in the area of those hospitals. Despite that, though, the World Health Organization says that today they were actually able to deliver essential medical supplies to Nasr Hospital for about 1,000 of their patients, critically needed medical supplies, at a time when, again, the situation is growing increasingly desperate for the patients and the displaced people living in the area of those hospitals.

It also suggested that social media can provide significant positive benefits when young people use it to express themselves, explore and connect with others. Still, we're going to continue to monitor the research and use it to inform our roadmap. Keeping young people safe online has been a challenge since the internet began. And as criminals evolve their tactics, we have to evolve our defenses too. We work closely with law enforcement to find bad actors and help bring them to justice, but the difficult reality is that no matter how much we invest or how effective our tools are, there's always more to learn and more improvements to make. But we remain ready to work with members of this committee, industry and parents to make the internet safer for everyone. I'm proud of the work that our teams do to improve online child safety on our services and across the entire internet. We have around 40,000 people overall working on safety and security, and we've invested more than $20 billion in this since 2016, including around $5 billion in the last year alone. We have many teams dedicated to child safety and teen well-being, and we lead the industry in a lot of the areas that we're discussing today. Technology to tackle the worst online risks and share it to help our whole industry get better, like Project Lantern, which helps companies share data about people who break child safety rules, and we're founding members of Take It Down, a platform which helps young people prevent their nude images from being spread online. We also go beyond legal requirements and use sophisticated technology to proactively discover abusive material. And as a result, we find and report more inappropriate content than anyone else in the industry. As the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children put it this week, Meta goes, quote, above and beyond to make sure that there are no portions of their network where this type of activity occurs, end quote. I hope we can have a substantive discussion today that drives improvements across the industry, including legislation that delivers what parents say they want, a clear system for age verification and control over what apps their kids are using. Three out of four parents want app store age verification, and four out of five want parental approval of whatever -- whenever teens download apps. We support this. Parents should have the final say on what apps are appropriate for their children and shouldn't have to upload their I.D. every time. That's what app stores are for. We also support setting industry standards on age-appropriate content and limiting signals for advertising to teens, to age and location, and not behavior. At the end of the day, we want everyone who uses our services to have safe and positive experiences. And before I wrap up, I want to recognize the families who are here today who have lost a loved one or lived through some terrible things that no family should have to endure. These issues are important for every parent and every platform. I'm committed to continuing to work in these areas, and I hope we can make progress today.",
