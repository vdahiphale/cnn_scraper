      "sentences": "Hello and welcome, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we begin this hour with freedom for 12 more hostages whospent weeks of captivity in Gaza. The IDF just announced that ten Israelis and two foreign nationals are on their way back to Israel after being handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas. This will be the fifth straight day of joyful family reunion, not just for Israelis as well, also for Palestinian families. Thirty more Palestinian prisoners, women and children are expected to be released soon from Israeli jails under, of course, as you know, an extended truce. Earlier today though, a clash between Israel and Hamas in northern Gaza briefly violated the truce, but didn't derail it. Israel says it's using the pause to strengthen readiness to resume its war that says it is willing to extend the truce if hostages continue coming home. Let's get the very latest, our Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Kerem Shalom in Israel. So, Jeremy, Red Cross now saying that the hostages have been received and they're en route to Israeli territory. Just bring us up to date with the very latest.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right. And the Israeli military is also now confirming that and also adding that they areindeed -- they have crossed into Egypt via that Rafah Crossing where we have seen a number of times over the last several nights. That has been the first stop once the Red Cross receives them in Gaza, they go to Rafah typically and then they drive that very short drive less than two miles on Egyptian territory until they make it to the Kerem Shalom Crossing, which is right behind me. We have seen them come in convoys, several of these nights in convoys this way on their way either to hospitals in Israel or making a first stop at the Hatzerim Airbase in southern Israel. But tonight, it appears that once again, just like last night, it appears that these hostages are likely to board helicopters directly to hospitals which we saw play out last night. I can tell you that because what we just saw over us was four helicopters heading in the direction of Kerem Shalom, landing there, and so we expect that, that is the likely mode of transportation. There's still the possibility, of course, that they could be coming down this road, but I'm not seeing the same kind of military activity on this road that we have seen when there have been convoys. This is of course, the first day of that extended truce between Israel and Hamas to allow for the release of additional hostages, additional Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons, and also, of course, crucially, that pause in the fighting. But the question is very quickly going to turn to, what happens after tomorrow? Because for now, Israel and Hamas have only agreed to a two-day extension of that deal to allow for ten additional hostages each day to be released, 30 additional Palestinian prisoners. Tonight, there were ten Israeli civilian hostages released as well as two foreign nationals who were not part of that framework. But there are active meetings at this moment between a top Israeli-American and Qatari officials as well as Egyptian intelligence officials to work out whether or not this truce can be extended and also, critically, Isa, whether or not they can start to move beyond the question of women and children. There are active discussions we're told among those intelligence chiefs about the possibility of expanding this and beginning to allow for deals that could see men, fighting-age men and soldiers released as part of the next steps of this agreement. But that is a big question and a lot of things still need to be resolved. That would be a very prickly matter to be resolved over the coming days.",

Clarissa, appreciate it, thank you very much. And a heartbreaking goodbye, meanwhile, in Gaza. A grandfather struggles to cope after losing two of his young grandchildren in an Israeli airstrike. Our Jomana Karadsheh has the family story. We want to warn you, some of these images are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Khalid(ph) and Reem(ph) were inseparable. Her grandfather was her whole world. Her favorite game, pulling his beard, and he would pull her piggy-tails. \"I will let go\", she says, \"if you let go\". Khalid(ph) just can't let go of his little Reem(ph). Now, searching for memories amid the rubble of his home. \"This was Reem's(ph) doll\", he says. The family was asleep when an airstrike nearby brought down their house in southern Gaza last week. Khalid(ph) woke up screaming for his children and grandchildren, struggling to walk in the dark and through the wreckage to find them. \"I couldn't find anybody. They were buried underneath all this rubble\", he says. \"My daughter Mesa(ph) was here. Her children Reem(ph) and Toda(ph) were here in her arms.\" Mesa(ph) and her sister barely survived after a few days in intensive care, they're now recovering at a relative's house. \"I felt something heavy on top of me. I started screaming\", Mesa(ph) says. \"I heard Reem(ph) screaming next to me. I told her there's something heavy on top of me. I can't reach you. I said my final prayers and next, I woke up in the hospital.\" Mesa(ph) woke up to the news her three and five year old children were gone. Their lifeless bodies found together under the rubble. \"They slept next to each other that night. They slept early\", she says. \"I told them to stay up a little longer, but they said they wanted to sleep. At the hospital, I was just numb\", she says. \"I hugged them. I wanted to get as many hugs as I could. No matter how much I hugged them, I didn't get enough.\" Their final days lived in a war they were too young to understand why they no longer could dress up, go out and play or get their favorite treats. With their father abroad working, they lived with their grandfather, Reem(ph) was so attached to him and he spoiled her. \"They kept asking for fruit, but there's no fruit because of the war\", he says. \"I could only find them these tangerines.\" Khalid(ph) holds the tangerine he gave Reem(ph), the one she didn't get to eat and pinned close to his heart, her tiny earring. He breaks down as he remembers their final evening, how his grandchildren begged him to take them out to play. But he couldn't, airstrikes were everywhere. Khalid(ph) says he's not a fighter, they had nothing to do with the war. But like so many in Gaza, his family paid the price. Khalid(ph) held Reem(ph) in his arms for one last time. He hugged her motionless body, opened her eyes and kissed her goodbye. \"I was asking her to kiss me like she used to, but she didn't\", he says. \"I used to kiss her on her cheeks, on her nose, and she would giggle. I kissed her, but she wouldn't wake up\", he recalls. \"I held Toda(ph), I fixed his hair the way he liked it. I was wishing, hoping they were only sleeping\", he says, \"but they weren't sleeping. They're gone.\" Gone a month before her fourth birthday, a birthday Reem(ph) shared with her grandfather. \"She was the soul of my soul\", Khalid(ph) says. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London.
