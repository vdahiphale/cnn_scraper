About 100 Americans are safe this evening after being rescued from a warzone and a daring mission. Thousands remain behind. U.S. Special Operations Forces personnel carried out the emergency evacuation of U.S. government employees and their families earlier this morning. Today the U.S. embassy in Khartoum is closed, at least temporarily. The decision to evacuate U.S. personnel comes after a week of heavy fighting between Sudan's military and a rival paramilitary group. More than 400 people have been killed, including one American. The State Department says there are about 16,000 Americans in Sudan, most are dual nationals. And there are no immediate plans, the administration says, at this point to help evacuate them. We have CNN correspondents and a military expert here to break it down for us in this unfolding story that's developing hour by hour. Let's begin with CNN's Sam Kiley live from Djibouti. Sam, the sudden worldwide evacuations from Sudan is apparently overwhelming the airport where you are in Djibouti, crowding that airspace. It's not just Americans trying to get out of Sudan obviously. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, first of all on the American evacuation with which really was in the vanguard of a multinational series of evacuations began overnight with the American special forces, about 100 troops of three chinook helicopters involved in that, taking off here from Djibouti, which is very much the international hub for this evacuation. A series of operations.The Americans flew in to Ethiopia and then on low and slow into Khartoum over many hundreds of miles. Very dangerous operation, spending about an hour, less than an hour on the ground, officials say, rescuing some 70 plus Americans and other nationalities. Now these Americans who were working for the embassy and their dependents and a handful of other internationals that they were able to take out. They're leaving behind many thousands, 16,000 to 19,000 is the estimate of Americans, many of them dual nationals, remaining in Sudan. This is all going on whilst the ceasefire that had been agreed between the warring factions in Khartoum was failing to hold. Almost simultaneously, an hour or so after the American operation, British and French and other special forces were going in on the ground. The British special forces having to move people 18 miles, 30 kilometers from a collection point in Khartoum to an out-of-town airstrip that they had identified in operation that was actually flown mostly out of Cyprus, or those special forces again staged, that British special forces out of Djibouti here. Now here in Djibouti, local officials are saying they've got at least 11 foreign militaries involved in this operation. That is causing a degree almost of congestion at the international airport. And of course, their airspace is getting a bit more congested, too, because no civilian aircraft are flying over Sudan because the Sudanese government forces there are flying combat missions against their enemies, even in the capital. And it's that level of insecurity, which means that many countries are now looking at making ground moves. The Emiratis, the Egyptians moved nearly 500 people due north into through the Sahara Desert into their country over land. That's relatively easy inadvertent commerce for the Egyptians, but very much harder for other foreign nationals. And in the future there is likely I think to be a great deal of international focus on trying to figure out a way of getting people out, not just of Khartoum, but this is a civil war that is spreading around the whole of Sudan, the biggest country in Africa, causing a great deal of tension and dismay among the international community whilst the warring factions there promising but unable to deliver, it would seem, ceasefires to try to facilitate these movements -- Jim.",

      "sentences": "Potentially, but we also know there was some level of coordination at least between the United States and other countries, President Joe Biden and others thanking, for example, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia, which already begun its own evacuation operations. So there was at least some coordination between all of these countries trying to get their citizens and others out.But is there also a potential for a logjam? Certainly, based on what we heard Sam saying in the business of Djibouti's airport, which has become the hub for these essentially evacuation operations. The mission itself incredibly long. It's some 750 or 800 miles from Djibouti into Sudan to Khartoum. Then, of course, you have to get on the ground. Secure the embassy in some fashion, get everyone out. That is the diplomatic staff, their family, and some other nationals that the U.S. evacuated. And then you have the same long trip back. A trip that as you see on this map here required a refueling stop in Ethiopia right around the halfway point. So an incredibly long operation. And complicating that or at least making the decision difficult is the fact that this is the middle of a fight between two warring factions. They had both at least openly committed to the ceasefire, the Sudan armed forces and the rival paramilitary RSF, but we had already seen those violations. As Sam pointed out, the ceasefire does not appear to be holding in any important significant way. And yet there was enough of a critical need to get the American citizens out that the U.S. and as you see so many other countries have decided that it was enough of a situation, enough of a window that the U.S. decided to act, sending in three large chinook helicopters, three of the largest in the U.S. inventory in fact. Heavy lift helicopters to get about 100 troops on the ground and then bring out, of course, the troops and about not quite 100 others, including, again, those diplomatic staff, their family members and some others. So a long mission, a complicated mission, but one that was pulled off successfully in the dead of night -- Jim.",

Colonel Leighton, you were with us last night as this thing was getting going. We were able to go on air and talk about this, but let's talk. Let's start with this evacuation. U.S. forces spent less than an hour on the ground in Sudan, that is pretty remarkable. This is the kind of mission as you know that can go sideways in a hurry. What kind of planning do you think goes into an operation like this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jim, it's really one of those most intricate of military planning events and the special operations forces that conduct these kinds of operations is noncombatant or neo-evacuations. They train on this stuff all the time, so it's very important not only to get the training right but also to get all the logistical pieces right. So every single aspect of the logistics train, the fuel, the supplies for the helicopters, for other aircraft that would be used, the intelligence preparation for the area. All of those things go into this, and all of this really means that to the military units coordinate with a lot of different agencies in order to make all of this stuff happened, both civilian and military, and in the case of a situation like this, they're also coordinating with partner nations, such as those from the European Union who are also evacuating (INAUDIBLE) as well as nations in the region and the Sudanese forces on the ground, either from the army or from the RSF, the Rapid Security Force, there that is fighting the regular army.",

You know the most part, though, it seems as if the RSF and the Sudanese army are concentrating on firing on each other, but it's really easy to get caught in the crossfire especially in a place like Khartoum, which is a pretty crowded city. And that really is the danger right there that even an inadvertentstrike on a U.S. person could result in, you know, serious injury or even sadly death. At least one American I know of has been killed so far in this, so there are certain situations where, you know, anybody could get caught in the crossfire, and it really speaks to the danger of the situation and does require another truce I think before the majority of these people who want to get out could get out.",

And it does have that symmetry that President Biden is known to appreciate and we do expect it would come in the form of a video, and I am told that that video has mostly been shot. They're just working on some of the final edits now, but, Jim, we do have to include all those caveats that you always include with President Biden.You know this better than anyone, Jim. He can be fickle when it comes to these decisions, and we saw that in 2016 as well. We do know he's up at Camp David this weekend. He's talking to his team making some of these final decisions on staffing operations. That sort of thing. If he does make this announcement, I think it does two things. One, kind of the nuts and bolts of it, it unlocks this new fundraising potential for the president, and that's no small thing. This could be potentially a $2 billion campaign, and we do also expect the president to meet with some of his biggest donors at the end of this week. But the other thing that this would do is sort of put to rest this ongoing speculation about whether or not he would run and the president has been saying, you know, for almost two years that he does intend to run, he said. As recently as a week ago that he planned to run, but that hasn't necessarily put all of those doubts to rest. And you know, the main issue with President Biden is his age. That is the reason why a lot of people around this country, a lot of even Democrats have wondered whether he would go for a second term. If President Biden does run for reelection, he will be asking Americans to get behind the idea of a president serving well into their 80s. That is contributing to what you see in this poll today. And what you've seen in polls recently is this lack of enthusiasm really for a second Biden term. This NBC poll today said that 70 percent of Americans think that Biden should not run for office. That included 51 percent of Democrats, and that is in line with a lot of other polls. Now we should say that poll also included a majority of Americans who said that President Trump should also not run for president again, so really, not a lot of enthusiasm for a rematch between these two men.

He had all the way back to when he was a kid, you know, and I think sometimes we like to write it off as a cliche of politics when he talks about things like overcoming a stutter.But I can tell you, and you know this well, Jim, it is an essential piece of how he sees himself in the world and extends all the way through his political career. Moments when people didn't expect him to win, when he managed to turn it around after the '88 campaign when he had such a disastrous campaign, and came back and sort of found his footing again in politics, so I think in the White House, look, they are not unaware of these polls. They know this. He keeps close track on politics, watches a lot of TV, but he also knows that he has an idea why he wants to run and he's not going to be deterred from doing it.

Generally not because they think he's doing a bad job, most like how he's handled the economy, foreign policy, but many Democrats are worried about his age. Kevin Liptak was talking about this few moments ago. Biden is 80 right now, he'd be 86 at the end of his second term if he wins.A lot can change for a person when they are going from 80 to 86. Biden himself has said that he knows this is a legitimate issue. What are your thoughts on this?

I mean he was in the West Wing, in the vice presidency, and already at that point, people were wondering how many more acts he might have in this play. But you know, at that time, and I think this idea is -- has maintained a part of his thinking, he said, look, and you hear it today, he says, don't just judge somebody on the basis of the number. Watch me.You know, and that's become his mantra, and I think that's really also an indicator of his own self-perception. I mean, there is a degree to which in his own mind, he is built a team around him that can support him. He knows he's not the same person that he was 40 years ago. None of us are at the age of 80, but he also has people around him. He has the Office of the Presidency, which is in its own way, an apparatus of support. He gets to go on his own schedule. Go to places he wants to go. Doesn't have to go places he doesn't. But I think the most important piece of this ultimately when it comes from a pure political perspective is if in fact he runs, he's going to be running most likely against the Republican who is 76 years old, already been the oldest president in office. And so in some ways, it diffuses the age issue in a one-on-one contest because the Republicans are going to have a particularly strong leg to stand on if they've got Donald Trump as their nominee.",

It's about what he was doing in connection with, for example, you know, essentially the scripts he was reading, you know, how he was discharging those duties, it wouldn't really go to an unrelated crime.

Shell's departure from NBC is immediate.Let's discuss this now with Mediaite editor-in-chief Aidan McLaughlin. Aidan, this was pretty abrupt. I mean, this just came out of nowhere. Earlier this afternoon, what do we know about this? AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, MEDIAITE: Right. Really abrupt. So I just want to put this into context here. This is one of the most powerful people in the media business as CEO of NBCUniversal. From what we know from the reporting so far is he was still working last week as this investigation was ongoing. Basically NBCU received a complaint from a female staffer who's complained about an inappropriate relationship with Jeff Shell. There was an investigation that lasted several weeks. He continued to conduct his duties as CEO in that time, and then over the weekend, the decision was made for him to leave the company over this inappropriate relationship, which he admitted in a pretty short statement he issued alongside Comcast. So it's a pretty shocking development at the top of one of America's biggest media companies. And it's certainly an abrupt one. NBCU did not name a successor to Jeff Shell. It doesn't sound like from the statements they made to the press that they're anywhere near naming someone to that position. And right now, the people that reported to Jeff Shell are going to be reporting to Mike Cavanagh, who is Comcast's president, and who has been involved in NBCUniversal for some time now.",

So certainly, that is something that's happened recently at the network that Jeff Shell was involved in.

It was almost twice as powerful as NASA's space launch system Artemus One launched just a few months ago. And so for it to get off the pad, had a few issues with some of the 33 engines not burning, but it went through a full duration first stage burn.Three minutes is what that first stage is supposed to do, and that's when it got there was a problem with Separation Starship. Did not separate, did not light its own engines. And that's why you saw the stack tumble out of control. But the fact that it got off the pad and burned a full duration burn without any issues, except for a few engine shutdowns, that's a pretty significant success for a first flight test. This is a very aggressive development program. This rocket has not been in development that long and, you know, the philosophy of build, test, you know, find out what the issues are, modifying test again. That's what gets you going more quickly.",

And so we -- I'm not sure, we haven't seen any announcement yet whether they didn't ignite on liftoff, or whether some of them were shut down in flight. Those are different scenarios. Maybe it's a combination of the two, but the fact is, most of the engines were burning and got the booster to where it was supposed to go. It's somewhat tolerant of engine failures.The biggest issue is, why didn't the Starship separate? It could have been something as simple as -- or not simple but something as common as a software glitch, which we're all aware of, or it could be a different, you know, some kind of a different system failure. That will all come out. You know there was a lot of data, a lot of telemetry coming down from the flight test. No doubt SpaceX engineers have been poring over that over the weekend, trying to figure out the root cause. But I think we'll see them fly sooner rather than later. They've got several other Starships built, ready to go. Once they find the root cause of this, you know, and repair the launch site, I think they incurred more damage to the launch pad than they had expected.",
