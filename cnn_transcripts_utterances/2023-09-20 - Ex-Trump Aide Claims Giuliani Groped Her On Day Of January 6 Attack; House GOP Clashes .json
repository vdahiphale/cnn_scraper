Cassidy Hutchinson, the key White House aide, writing in a new book that Giuliani groped her on January 6th, with a lot of detail. Plus, Garland in the hot seat. Republicans grilling the attorney general even though some of them couldn't seem to get their facts straight. And, thousands of migrants just arriving at the border. One Texas mayor tonight declaring a state of emergency. And Mexico tonight halting train operations because of so many migrants illegally jumping on board. Our David Culver has been on that train and is with us tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, explosive allegations against a man once called America's mayor. Former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson accusing Rudy Giuliani of groping her on January 6th. It's a stunning allegation in her brand new memoir, which she says others also witnessed. Hutchinson claiming this happened as Giuliani was talking about alleged voter fraud. She writes, in part, quote, waving a stack of documents, he moves towards me like a wolf closing in on its prey. We have the evidence, it's all here, we're going to pull this off. Rudy wraps one arm around my body closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach for the hem of my blazer. Then Hutchinson continues. By the way, he says, she's referring to Giuliani, fingering the fabric, I'm loving this leather jacket on you. His hand slips under my blazer, then my skirt. I feel his frozen fingers trail up my thigh. He tilts his chin up. The whites of his eyes look jaundiced. My eyes dart to John Eastman who flashes a leering grin. I fight against the tension in my muscles and recoil from Rudy's grip, filled with rage, I storm to the tent on yet another quest for Mark. Mark, of course, being Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, for whom Cassidy Hutchinson worked. A political adviser of Giuliani telling CNN in response to this quote, it's fair to ask Cassidy Hutchinson why she is just now coming out with these allegations from two and a half years as part of the marketing campaign for her upcoming book release. This is a disgusting lie against Mayor Rudy Giuliani. An attorney for Eastman meantime calls the allegations libelous and says he does not ever recall having met Ms. Hutchinson. But, remember, Cassidy Hutchinson, well, everyone knows who she is. Certainly all these individuals know who she is. She was a key witness to the January 6th Select Committee, bravely coming forward to testify and revealing many things under oath, including Trump's refusal to do anything to stop the insurrection. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CASSIDY HUTCHINSON, EX-TRUMP AIDE: I remember Pat saying to him, something to the effect of, the writers have gotten to the Capitol, Mark, we need to go down and see the president now. And Mark looked up and said, he doesn't want to do anything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But if he's going to be a witness for them, it's important to know why he's so important. Wood led Stop the Steal rallies with Sidney Powell, filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the election, and was a vocal supporter of the pressure campaign to overturn the election in the state of Georgia.

RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: So, it's going to be up to the prosecutors if they can figure a way to get it into the trial. I think it would benefit them if they could.

And there's a through line. The through line is certain men in power abusing their power and being willing to break the law in doing it, that's part of the allegations that Hutchinson is now bringing forward as part of the sexual assault allegation. That's what it measures up to as a matter of law, and the allegation that he's breaking the law to stay in power and help Trump stay in power.

And Zelenskyy says that this has made stopping the war, quote, impossible. Tonight, Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT on the front lines in southern Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Ukrainian artillery hits Russian troops, one of those scoping out Vladimir Putin's forces and directing the fire is not only a career soldier but also a mom of three. Her call sign, Nezlamna, the unbreakable. I've seen so much at this stage that I can't be easily taken by surprise, she says, but, of course, there is a constant risk. Nezlamna has two daughters and a 5-year-old son. She hasn't seen them since April. \"Is it tough?\" I ask. Of course, they get offended when I'm not there, when they need me as a parent, but they understand someone needs to do this work for our country, she says. And that work is often gruesome for those on the front lines here in the south. The 47th Mechanized Brigade gave us this video they say shows their troops coming under Russian fire even while collecting the bodies of their fallen comrades. Their U.S. supplied Bradley fighting vehicles bearing the scars of relentless combat. This vehicle is really emblematic of just how tough the battle is down here in the south. You can see there's a lot of fire damage. Well, the Ukrainians say that's because this vehicle took hits from Russian artillery 152-millimeter Russian artillery shells. They say this is not an outlier, most vehicles look like this. The troops say they are making headway, but often still get bogged down in Russian mine fields and artillery barrages. Bradley driver nicknamed Revo (ph) recalled his toughest mission. The most scary situation was driving behind a demining vehicle while it was creating a pass for us, he says. We were coming under constant shelling, the rounds were landing a few meters away from us. Ukrainian forces remain badly outgunned as the country's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the U.S. pressing the Biden administration for more ammo. Nezlamna says she will fight on for the future of her children. I want them to live in a flourishing country, she says. I said many times that our job is small, we only have to win back our borders, but they will have to rebuild the whole country, and that is a much harder job. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Erin, her husband actually serves in the same brigade as an artillery gunner. And she says there are sometimes situations where she scopes out and spots targets that he then fires at. But what we've been hearing from her and other peoples on the southern front line is that they tell us they need more weapons and they definitely need more ammunition.
