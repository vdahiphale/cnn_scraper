Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with breaking news. The Supreme Court tonight agreeing to review the Colorado Supreme Court decision, which labels the former president an insurrectionist and bars him from the ballot. It comes on the eve of the third anniversary of that insurrection, whatever the high court or an upcoming federal jury determine his role and it was. The news also caps the day that saw the current president speaking bluntly and at length about what he sees as the ongoing threat his opponent remains. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: Trump won't do what an American president must do. He refuses to denounce political violence. So, hear me clearly. I'll say what Donald Trump won't. Political violence is never, ever acceptable in the United States political system. Never, never, never. It has no place in a democracy, none. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then the other side will come in about two weeks later. But the key thing here is that the justices have kind of left it open ended for the range of issues that it would take on at this point because they have not narrowed this down from, you know, big, broad questions as to whether is this the role of the judiciary to actually decide a question that's so politically charged down to did Donald Trump actually engage in an insurrection?

And I just wonder how much they struggled with whether they were going to already kind of narrow some of the issues or if they just wanted to quickly get out, as they did, we're taking the case and we'll iron out things later. You know, I'm sure that they -- you know, they saw this marching toward them, and now they're ready to act swiftly on it.

And the parties have briefed all of this below. It's not like anyone is going to be disadvantaged. Everyone will have their say. The court will have enough time to decide, but they're going to move it really swiftly.

There are just so many ways that the Supreme Court could decide to keep Trump on the ballot that, you know, the odds have got to be with Trump here. But as I think about this, you know, Trump's opening argument is, leave this to Congress. And that actually seems quite dangerous. What Trump is essentially saying is, let me run for office, let me potentially win election and then come January 6, 2025, when Congress counts the electoral college votes, let Congress decide if I'm eligible to run.

That's what it was. It's what we all saw.Whether or not President Biden is focusing on it to make a political point about the man he's running against, his description of January 6th matches the facts of what happened.

Right now, it's mainly down to whether the former president will be held criminally responsible. That's for a jury to decide. The rest is a matter of fact. But because his legal and political feature align in persuading the world otherwise, that is what he has been doing now for years, gaslighting. And for millions of Americans, it is working.

And so, everybody's grievances attached to him and Trump gets a free ride and people have sort of a gauzy recollection of what it was like during the Trump years. It is very important for Biden to be on the attack continually in this campaign and not just about democracy, but he should hold a clear lens up against what Trump's actual record was and remind people what those years were like. If you think that the world is chaotic now, think back to what those years were like every day when we woke up every morning wondering what crazy thing the president of the United States had done or said the night before and ask yourself, is that going to calm the country? Is that going to stabilize the future? You know, Biden has to make this case, and he has to do it on a daily basis, not just a periodic speech about democracy.",

And on a different plane trip, he met Prince Andrew. Now, Trump and Bill Clinton have not been accused of any wrongdoing in this case, and Clinton's team has said he hasn't had contact with him in 20 years.Prince Andrew reached a settlement with the accuser in this case of Virginia Giuffre, and he has denied any wrongdoing. But there are some other names that also came up in this document dumped today. One of them, Harvey Weinstein. His name appeared on a 2005 phone message log, like one of those old books that are spiral bound. And it just said that he had called for Epstein. You can see it there on the screen, just a handwritten note noting that. Now Giuffre's lawyer had written in a book that he published in 2020 that Epstein and Harvey Weinstein were friends, but they had a falling out when Harvey Weinstein was too aggressive with one of Epstein's favorite girls, as he put it. Now, another name that came up in a few of these papers over the past few days, David Copperfield, a magician. Now, one woman who was paid to give massages by Epstein, testified about him being at the house doing magic trips -- tricks, and that he had said to her, she testified, \"He questioned me if I was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls.\" And then one of the plaintiff's lawyers in this case was quizzing a woman who worked for Epstein, a separate person, and had asked if she was aware that Copperfield had obtained tickets for Epstein to give to some of the girls. And they invited them backstage. But this person sort of the Fifth Amendment, and didn't answer any questions about it. Copperfield's team has not gotten back to us.

She would have been 17 at the time. The prince emphatically denied all of it. In 2022, Prince Andrew settled with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount. And a U.S. district judge agreed to dismiss her lawsuit against him. Weeks earlier, Buckingham Palace stripped him of his military titles and according to a royal source, told him he could no longer use his Royal Highness in any official capacity. Epstein often ran with the rich and powerful, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and his two high profile defense attorneys, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz. None of them have been accused of wrongdoing. Trump once told New York magazine about Epstein, \"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\" Federal investigators had identified at least 36 girls and were still building their case when suddenly, in 2007, Epstein made a sweetheart deal. This non-prosecution agreement allowed him to plead guilty to a lesser charge, just two prostitution charges in state court, and register as a sex offender. He would serve just 13 months in county jail. The deal also granted immunity to any potential co-conspirators. None of those people were identified, leaving many to wonder if other powerful people were having sex with underage girls at Epstein's homes.
