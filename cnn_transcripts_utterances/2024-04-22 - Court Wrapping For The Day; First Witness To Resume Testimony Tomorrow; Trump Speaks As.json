What can I do from my platform with the National Enquirer to help?But when Donald Trump started \"The Apprentice,\" they had this longstanding relationship where he was even still doing it then. Donald Trump had more of a national platform, a national name, as he -- as \"The Apprentice\" was a popular television show. And the National Enquirer was helping then as well when women or people were coming forward with, with allegations about Donald Trump. So they have a very long history here. On what they're going to be talking about tomorrow and as they're figuring out the scheduling here on the gag order, this is significant as well because Donald Trump wants this gag order to be basically almost entirely lifted from him. He keeps asking for it to be released. Obviously, the question for the judge and how he handles this is what he does with these alleged violations of it. What the prosecutors have said are multiple times that he has violated that gag order, they believe he should be fined. And whether or not, one, he is fined, and two, if it works as a deterrent, and three, what the judge does if he continues to violate it.",

I wouldn't be surprised if he does testify in this case. And then, of course, there's the political aspect, which is missing from most cases, but he's running for president.

Jean Carroll case where he did not take the stand and didn't even show up for the first initial before that was the defamation damages determination.And he is deeply influenced by that because he's upset that he didn't do it. Even though there was kind of agreement among his legal team that he shouldn't get on the stand, he believes that he was adversely affected in the outcome ultimately there where he was found liable for sexual assault. And then, of course, defamation as we later saw the damages there. And so that is a driving factor for him here, too. He always thinks that he can woo people, that he can persuade people. But I think with Donald Trump, you know, he always says he wants to do it until he doesn't. We saw it with Robert Mueller. We've seen it in many other instances. And getting up in front of an actual jury in a criminal trial is much different than doing it in a civil fraud trial, as he did for mere minutes, as you'll recall. And so I think it's really a game time decision. It's ultimately that. But for him, at least, in his mind, and what he's been telling people, is that he does want to take the stand here.",

The defense and the prosecution were both given opportunities to present their opening statement. The prosecution went first, it lasted about 45 minutes. They presented what the case would look like and how this was a scheme that Donald Trump was involved in. The defense came after that and talked about how nothing the prosecution said was accurate. There was going to be plenty of reasonable doubt Donald Trump was innocent of the charges. They even denied that Donald Trump had any sort of rendezvous with Stormy Daniels. And then the prosecution presented their first witness, David Pecker who is the CEO of America Media tabloid enterprise. The judge is asking both sides if there's anything more they want to submit ahead of tomorrow's hearing on the gag order. The lawyers are asking to approach the bench.

If you see it on -- don't go on social media, because Donald Trump said a couple things that will never get in front of the jury. He said, Alvin Bragg, the D.., did not originally want to bring this case. Not even clear if that's true at all, but that will never become part of the proper evidence in this case.
