I wonder what is your understanding of what went wrong here.CAPTAIN MIKE SANTORO, V.P., SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOTS ASSOCIATION: Well, thanks for having me, Kaitlan. So, the storm that hit last week was the catalyst of this, but what went wrong is that our I.T. infrastructure for scheduling software is vastly outdated. It can't handle the number of pilots, flight attendants that we have in the system with our conflicts throughout the network. We don't have the normal hub and spoke, like the other major airlines do. We fly a point-to-point network, which can put our crews in the wrong places with our airplanes, mismatched, and that's what happened and our software can't keep track of it. So, they don't know where we are, they don't know where the airplanes are and it's frustrating for the pilots, the flight attendants and especially our passengers.

So, that kind of gives you a sense what the situation's like. The driving ban is still actually in place this morning.They did scale back on some of those measures in some of these surrounding authorities, but for Buffalo itself, that will be in place at least for now. Authorities will revisit that. I have seen a few more vehicles on the streets. But, look, we've been basically shelter in place along with other Buffalo residents for four, going on five days, Poppy, and so many people have told us that they are hearing that their pipes burst back in their home.

So, this is one of the furthest strikes in to Russian territory that the Ukrainians have launched. And it looks like they did it with one of their own drones. The U.S. has said no striking into Russia with American-provided weapons, but they haven't put any restriction on using Ukrainian-developed weapons.We don't know how much damage it did but the nature of the target is pretty interesting. Engels Air Force Base is in fact a strategic bomber base. That is, that's where they keep some of the bombers that they would use if they attacked the United States. So, to answer your comparison question, it would be a little bit like somebody hit Offutt Air Force Base out of Nebraska, out near Omaha, which is where the U.S. keeps some of its strategic bombers and where its strategic command is headquartered and then said, but don't worry, we weren't really going after your nuclear assets, we were going after the other assets. I'm not sure we'd completely believe them. And in this case the worry is the Russians would say, well, this is beginning to infringe on our nuclear deterrent. COLLINS:  And, David, what does this mean for Russia in the sense, are they being forced to move planes? How does this complicate what they've been doing in Ukraine?",

And that's, of course, what the Ukrainians are trying to force them to do, because we think from this base they have launched some of the planes that have sent cruise missiles into Ukraine, which have done huge destruction to the cities and to the infrastructure.The concern, Kaitlan, is this, that at this point, the Ukrainians are basically betting that the Russians are throwing everything at them except nuclear weapons. And they think the Russians won't cross that line, that basically Russia will not make this a nuclear confrontation. We suspect they're probably right, but you don't know that for a fact. And the question is whether Putin at some point will feel as if he is losing so on the conventional battlefield that he has to change the nature of the game by using a tactical weapon, and that, of course, is what the U.S. has been war-gaming, scenario-planning for months, but it's not clear how the U.S. would respond.",

But in this case there are many reasons to be a little bit skeptical, if not cynical about the offer.The first is that his next line, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Kuleba's next line was, and the Russians will have to face war crimes trials. I don't think any of us would doubt that war crimes trials are in order here, but it's hard to imagine the Russians entering a negotiation if that's a requirement. The Russians have said, we're happy to negotiate anything, but, by the way, we have annexed parts of the territory, the four provinces, so those aren't up for discussion. Well, what do you debate if not the territory and the lines of Ukraine? And, of course, one of the things that the Ukrainians keep saying is that their boundaries have to go back to February 23rd, the day before the war started, which would essentially mean the Russian would have to retreat. It doesn't seem right now as if either side believes that they have enough of an advantage that either one would really enter serious negotiations.",
