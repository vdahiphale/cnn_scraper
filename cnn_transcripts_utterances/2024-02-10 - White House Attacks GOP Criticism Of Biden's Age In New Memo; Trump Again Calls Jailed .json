She covers the White House for us and the White House not pulling any punches tonight in responding to Hur's report, responding to Republicans criticizing the president using that report.

In a newly released memo today, Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson said the following, \"This undeniable record referring to the president's legislative accomplishments speaks to why it's no surprise that Republican officials continue their desperate and inadvertently self-undermining age attacks after many years of failure. They're afraid of Joe Biden.\" This memo also goes on to name General Mark Milley and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as saying that they -- that they've engaged with the president. He's alert. He's sharp. And that's the message that the White House really wants to send out here, especially as this report calls into question the president's age, which has been a defining theme of this election year. We've seen in poll after poll that voters continue to express concern about the president's age and whether he's fit for office. And we saw it from the president himself at a news conference where he also took direct aim, especially the mention in the report that he couldn't remember when his son died. So all of these themes are converging here and really showing this very tricky landscape that the White House and the campaign has had to navigate. Now, in talking to senior campaign officials, what they'll tell you is the president has to be on the campaign trail. And when he's engaging with voters one-on-one, that is when voters can pass their own judgment and see the president the way that his aides say he is in private meetings, sharp and tireless. But, of course, he has to get out and do that. Now, there has been an uptick in these traditional retail politics. We have seen that he's in much smaller intimate settings. That's what he does best in. And that is what we're going to continue to see as the White House pushes the image of Biden that they say happens in the Oval Office, someone who is sharp and that is ready to serve a second term and going against what is in the report as it relates to his age and any memory lapses.",

Where is her husband?The South Carolina governor, the former South Carolina governor has responded to that saying that Donald Trump should say these things to her face. But Trump does have a track record of sometimes denigrating people who have served in uniform.

He doesn't understand what's in it for them. And that's really the heart of it. It's not just people in service in the military uniform. It's anybody who does anything on behalf of other people. Ultimately, Donald Trump's sole and dominant and overriding cause is Donald Trump. And he took millions and millions of dollars from foreign governments in blatant defiance of the Constitution, which bans the collection of foreign government emoluments from kings and princes and states, but he pocketed all of that. He ran the White House like a for-profit money-making operation. And he brags about it. So if he turns on other Republicans who don't get in line and act like members of a religious cult, it's not a matter of surprise anymore. He wants to be a dictator, and everyone has to follow his lead. So I would urge Nikki Haley to come on over to the Democratic side or at least leave the Republican Party and do her own thing. Follow Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and the other honorable Republicans who don't want to have anything to do with this drive towards autocracy in dictatorship in the United States of America.",

It's all on his hands because there was this historic bipartisan compromise that was forged. Meantime, it wasn't just the destruction of the border and immigration provisions that he was after working for the guys back in the home office in Moscow, he also wanted to blow up the $60 billion in aid that the vast majority of people in Congress want to get to the people of Ukraine resisting Vladimir Putin's filthy, bloody, imperialist invasion of their country.

Otherwise, I don't think he's got any chance at all. And I am going to be completely committed to the election of our Democratic nominee for the Senate.

Could they stayed just -- could the legislature just tell the electors that they have to vote for Donald Trump, even though the state went for Joe Biden? And the problem that we've identified in the book is that that seems to be the law as it is right now. No doubt Justice Kagan did not intend that when she wrote the opinion in the Chiafalo case.

It's not to police the election process in the states. It's not to second guess the judges or the governor's certification in the state. Its only job is to count the votes. So when Elise Stefanik or Josh Hawley in 2020 went around saying that Congress was the place where they would adjudicate whether the votes were properly counted or included or too many votes in Pennsylvania had been included, that was just completely ignorant or a defiance of our constitutional system. And so she can describe that theory. That's actually the first theory that we address in our book. And we conclude as John Eastman, who concocted the theory concluded in a podcast he did with us that there is no basis in law for the idea that the vice president has any authority except to simply count the votes that are presented. Pennsylvania presented one slate of electors. That slate was certified six days before the electoral -- before the electors were to vote.

Look, on one hand though, I've got to say, I agree with him in many ways. Not enough of our allies are living up to their commitments that they made, and this is not a new tune from Donald Trump or myself. Previous presidents have said it from Obama, Clinton, Bush, you name it. Only ten or 11 are living up out of 31 right now are living up to the commitment. So he is right on the fact our allies need to do more, but threatening to withdraw from NATO or not defend them is not the right answer. We need to incentivize them, encourage them. And look, at the end of the day, our partnerships and alliances benefit American security in the end, not just European security or allied security, it benefits the United States.",

So he just has an affinity for leaders he views as strong and having strength and authority and others he sees as weak, and again, I can't describe it, but it is what it is and it is something that as we look ahead to the 2024 presidential contest and the possibility that he may become president again, that Americans and importantly world leaders will have to take into account as they try to figure out how to deal with a new White House once again under Trump and the United States at that point in time.",

And so again, that will undermine the alliance itself and really signal weakness and vulnerability to Vladimir Putin, so whether that leads to a conflict or what, I don't know.

Who is going to win this thing? RACHEL NICHOLS, HOST, \"HEADLINERS\" WITH RACHEL NICHOLS ON SHOWTIME: Well, the San Francisco 49ers are favored, if you look at the Las Vegas odds. Personally, I'm going to have to go with the Chiefs just under the premise that you've got to give the team that's done it before the edge over the team that hasn't, and the truth is, when these teams met four years ago, it was the Chiefs, not only who were victorious, but they were deep into the fourth quarter, Jim. They had six minutes left to go and they went ahead and scored 21 unanswered points against the 49ers. So the 9ers will have to make up for that, have to keep tough, mental toughness, at the end of the fourth quarter. I expect it to come down just as much to the wire. We have two of the best teams of the last five years competing for this title. I wouldn't be surprised if either one of them won, but if you ask me to make a pick, I've got to go with Kansas City right now.",
