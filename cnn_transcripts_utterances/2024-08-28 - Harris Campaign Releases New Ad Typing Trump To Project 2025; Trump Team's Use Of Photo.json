The Vice President has changed her position on fracking in Pennsylvania. Do you know why she's changed her position? TYLER: Listen, I mean, she's been very clear here. She's proud of the work that she's done as a part of this administration, making sure that American energy production is at an all-time high. We want to continue that progress into her -- her first term in office here. And, again, I think whether it's energy policy, economic policy writ large, that you have a fighter in Kamala Harris who is actually keeping the interest of the American people front and center, coming together to bring people together in search of solutions that actually improve people's quality of life, improve our economy, improve energy production. I think that stands again in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who may say one thing when he's in Pennsylvania, may say one thing out on the stump. But frankly, if you look at the totality of his economic agenda, his Project 2025 agenda, writ large, the only solutions are those that benefit people at the very top billionaires, rich folks like Donald Trump, the wealthiest corporations, nothing for the American worker, nothing to actually improve the lives of the American people and our consumers.
