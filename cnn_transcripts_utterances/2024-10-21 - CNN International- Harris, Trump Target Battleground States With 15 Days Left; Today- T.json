His speeches over the last not just 48 hours, where he did make that Arnold Palmer anecdote that you mentioned, he has been using more profanity, vulgarity, but it's also been what I've seen over the last couple of weeks now. His speeches are getting more meandering. His rhetoric is becoming far darker. His attacks on Harris are getting far more personal. And I'm kind of told that's what we should expect between now and Election Day that Donald Trump is only going to lean into that further.Now, I do also want to address some of, like I said, the dark rhetoric he made, but he repeated some comments yesterday during an interview with Fox News about the enemy from within. And the reason, Omar, this is so important is because we've seen a lot of high-profile Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was on air with Jake Tapper yesterday, tried to argue that Donald Trump isn't talking about political opponents. He is not talking about Democrats when he says that. However, Donald Trump, I think this is the third time now in an interview where he has made it clear that he actually is talking about Democrats.

      "sentences": "Now, Omar, in some of these remarks, particularly when you're looking at his speeches that he gave this past weekend in Pennsylvania, I will say, similar to what Kevin was arguing about the Harris campaign wanting to deliver their closing arguments, so does the Trump campaign. Just moments before Donald Trump took the stage on Saturday in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Jason Miller, a senior Trump advisor, told reporters that this would be the start, this weekend of him campaigning would be the start of him delivering that closing argument.Again, however, though, it was a little bit scatter shot. We saw glimpses of what that argument would be tucked into more of the kind of over -- all over the place remarks that he was given. At one point, he said, quote, \"With your support, we will bring back our nation's strength, dominance, prosperity and pride.\" He went on to say that this will be America's new golden age. So, clearly, I know that is the strategy and that is kind of the rhetoric that they want him to be using. But, again, it was kind of lost in some of the broader conversation that he was having on Saturday. And just to very quickly turn your attention, because you mentioned this, to North Carolina today, I mean, I think there is no question how important the Trump campaign sees North Carolina. He won it in 2016 and 2020. But, I think the fact that they're having not just three events there today, but they're also going to be in the state tomorrow for a rally, shows how much they may be worried about it, how much they recognize that they really need to turn voters out for the former President. It also comes, of course, as we know that early voting has taken off in North Carolina despite the hurricane that recently ravaged major parts of it. Trump will first be going to Asheville today, a city that, of course, was very much impacted by Hurricane Helene. You'll hear him talking about that. But, I do think you can expect some of the rhetoric that we've been discussing to slip into his messaging at some of these other events. Omar.",

But, one thing I think about there is Republicans who find themselves caught because they don't support Trump or they disagree with him in many cases, and when Harris is on the campaign trail with someone like Liz Cheney, how much of an impact do you actually think that's going to have in this election? Do you see that impact in the people that you speak to as we head towards this election? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yeah. I -- that's a good question, because we don't know how many Republican voters are truly persuadable, are truly open to voting for a Democrat. However, in a state like Georgia, that is expected to be close, where Biden and Trump basically had, after all votes were counted, roughly a percentage point difference, then even one percent or two percent of Republicans willing to vote for Kamala Harris could be a difference maker, and the AJC will have some new polling out actually tomorrow on this. So, I think Kamala Harris, her strategy is every vote counts, particularly in the swing states. She is not just going after her face. She is not just going after black men. She is targeting multiple key demographics. There are surrogate events today targeting Asian American voters, rural voters, and of course, black voters. So, Republican voters are part of the map again, because we expect it to be close, which means just a small shift could make a difference.",

I think that is the biggest thing I think even her campaign and strategists within her camp are trying to do. They're trying to separate that and show them that her rhetoric and his rhetoric are completely different.I mean, we heard a lot from the former President just this past week, I mean, calling January 6 the day of love and peace, saying the S word, Vice President, the enemy from within, going after people within our country and calling them the enemy from within, and even talking about Arnold Palmer's naked body. So, we heard a lot. And also, I question too, because we talk on The Shade Room. We talk a lot about millennials and our audience, our generation Z, and millennials. And you think, are they latching on to this? Is this maybe something that goes viral and something that millennials or Gen Z snack on? Is this being done on purpose, these kind of viral moments being done on purpose, so that millennials, young voters, can snack on this kind of content? Some of them think it's funny.

But, for those who aren't inclined to support President Trump, are backing Harris, I've seen them. The truth of it is, this was a photo opportunity. It was very staged. There weren't real customers. There weren't real orders. And it -- so, a lot of people are saying this shows how out of touch Donald Trump is. He can't even fake work for McDonald's for a few minutes.So, I don't think it's going to move the needle. It's just reinforcing what people already believe about either candidate.",

The IDF says that it holds funds that have been used by Hezbollah for military activities. We know it has been sanctioned as well by the U.S. in the past. But also, we know that this is a financial institution which is used by much of the Shia community. It organizes, for example, interest-free loans for some of the poorer elements of the Shia community. So, it does have those two elements to it.We have heard from one senior Israeli intelligence official that they are trying to break the trust between this institution, this banking institution, and the Shia community with Hezbollah. So, this is the reason that they are going after a wider element of Hezbollah, not just the military targets, and certainly, it will be felt by many in the Shia community, especially at a time when the economy in Lebanon has been so dire. And of course, many of those in the southern suburbs, for example, of Beirut and also in southern Lebanon, have had to move away from their homes by the Israeli military for their own safety. So, it's an interesting tactic by Israel saying that this is affiliated with Hezbollah. It is helping them fund their military activities, which is why it is a target. Omar.",

Omar, this report contains testimony from local officers who were interviewed by the Joint Task Force, and that testimony really details the chaotic sequence of events between when the gunman was first spotted at Trump's rally until that moment that shots were ultimately fired. And look, that includes a moment when a local officer was pushed up onto that roof and first laid eyes on Thomas Crooks with a rifle in his hands. And this part of the testimony is really compelling. It says, quote, \"I tried to get him up on the roof\", speaking about the officer. \"He is kind of on the side, however he is up there. He comes back down screaming, THERE'S AN AR. AN AR. A GUY WITH AN AR\", obviously referring to the assault rifle.But, it's stunning, because this report says that to date, the task force has not received any evidence to suggest that the message was received by Trump's Secret Service detail about the gunman until after shots were fired. So, that really does underscore the broader communication breakdowns that are littered throughout this report and have been echoed by other investigations into these assassination attempts. Look, this report comes to a very similar conclusion as those other investigations that, as you said, this incident was preventable and should not have happened, and it really does increase the already existing pressure on the U.S. Secret Service, right? We just had an independent panel convened by the Department of Homeland Security that recommended the entire -- an overhaul of the entire Secret Service leadership as a result of their investigation into the Butler rally assassination attempt. And that's more of a longer term recommendation. But, in the short term, the Secret Service has faced immense pressure to ramp up security around Donald Trump amid these existing threats that he still faces. I mean, it raises questions, this report included, raises questions about the Secret Service's ability to protect Donald Trump during this home stretch of the election cycle. That's something that we really never thought we would see, right, a presidential candidate who has this level of threats against his life and questions about the agency that's tasked with protecting them. And so, ultimately, I think you're going to see a lot of big changes at the U.S. Secret Service as the result of these investigations. But, in the short term, still a lot of questions about whether or not the Secret Service is up to the task.",

They spent a lot of times interviewing about 23 different officials and officers. They collected thousands of documents from these local law enforcement agencies. The next phase of this investigation, I'm told, is focused on the U.S. Secret Service itself. So, without a doubt, more details to come from that side of it, and frankly, in terms of the long term impact, and this -- really the spotlight that's been on the Secret Service in the wake of this assassination attempt, more details and more relevant details coming from this congressional investigation, as well as the other oversight efforts that are already ongoing as well.",

      "sentences": "All right. Zachary Cohen, appreciate the reporting, as always.For everyone else, we're going to take a look now at the real world impact of social media companies scaling back their policing of misinformation online. So, as we take a step back, in 2021, when crowds stormed the U.S. Capitol, the major platforms, including Meta, Twitter and YouTube, responded with decisive action and suspended thousands of accounts and posts spreading election lies. Since then, the industry has pivoted away from many of those safeguards, and the evidence is pretty clear to see. So, this year, when social media sites were flooded with misinformation after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the platform said and did almost nothing. The scale back happened, really didn't happen, I should say, in a vacuum, and it's got a lot to do with politics. So, we're going to bring in CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung, who joins me now. So Brian, experts who study election misinformation say their jobs have gotten harder, since 2020, not easier. Why?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Omar, what we've seen since 2020 is a gradual shift away from the policies and commitments that, as you said, powered a lot of the anti-misinformation efforts surrounding the 2020 election. As you might remember, after 2016, a lot of the social media platforms came under fire for facilitating and spreading content that had been promoted by Russia to just -- to undermine the U.S. election. And they spent the last -- the four years between 2016 and 2020 really building out a ton of infrastructure to prevent that from happening again.[11:50:00] Now, what misinformation researchers say is that companies like Elon Musk' X and Meta and YouTube have rolled back policies, or shut down tools that were used by researchers to monitor these social media platforms for rumors and misinformation and understand really how they spread across networks. But, that wasn't all. There was also an effort by GOP officials at all levels of government to try and undermine content moderation by social media platforms, particularly against election misinformation, and that includes things like lawsuits filed against the Biden administration when it tried to warn social media platforms about misinformation. It also included state laws passed by Texas and Florida that tried to force some of these platforms to mainstream hate speech and other election lies. It also included efforts to intimidate social media researchers, some of the same academics that had flagged these foreign influence operations on Twitter and Facebook and other platforms in the run-up to the 2020 and 2016 elections. All of this, Omar, ended up creating a culture of fear and intimidation that ultimately raised the political cost of these platforms engaging in anti-misinformation investments, and it made it a lot easier for them to pull back. And as one academic -- one fact- checker told me earlier this year, he said, \"The impact of layoffs, budget cuts in journalism programs, and the crackdown on trust and safety teams at X and other major platforms have set troubling precedents as we approach the upcoming elections.\" Now, as these platforms have pulled back, what we've seen is also the rise of a vocal group of Silicon Valley financiers and venture capitalists who have generally promoted a message that they're not on board with corporate social responsibility, and that too has created more political space for some of these companies to retreat from some of their earlier commitments and policies. And as one academic from George Washington University told me, look, this is only ever going to be as convenient to -- this is only ever going to be supported by tech platforms as long as it was going to be convenient to them. And this is -- now, we're seeing just the amount of investment that they put in is really proportionate to the amount of political pressure they're under to maintain these programs. Omar.",
