      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. And thanks so much for joining me. I'm Jessica Dean, in for Fredricka Whitfield today.The Israeli Defense Forces fire news strikes at Gaza, as fighting resumes following a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas. The IDF is saying it carried out more than 400 strikes on Gaza in the first 24 hours since the seven-day truce expired Friday. And those strikes include targets in southern Gaza. It's an area that had remained largely unscathed during Israel's initial assault compared to the bombardment of Northern Gaza. Talks of a new truce have reached \"a dead end\" according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office. Israel just recalled its team of negotiators from Qatar, blaming Hamas for the breakdown in those talks and accusing the terror group of not fulfilling its promise to return all women and children who are being held as hostages. The IDF says there are still 136 hostages in Gaza, including 17 women and children. 110 hostages were released during the week-long truce. For more now let's turn to our CNN team who's on the ground. They're in Israel. Ben Wedeman is in Jerusalem, Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv. Oren, let's start first with you. Tell us the latest on these negotiations to bring the remaining hostage's home. Is anything being discussed at this point? And if so, what?",

That then collapsed as we saw early yesterday morning.The issue is where does this go from here? The challenge, according to a source familiar with the negotiations is over what exactly the terms of the agreement are and are there numbers left to continue what we've seen, which was for the release of women and children, Israel and the U.S., according to the source familiar with the negotiations, believe Hamas was still holding enough women to be able to continue the release of women and children under the current agreement. Hamas, however, insists it does not trying to push the negotiations into the next phase, which was supposed to be elderly men as well as soldiers, men and women. That is the point upon the upon which this fell apart. Israel we're looking to stick to the current agreement, which was for the release of women and children believing Hamas held enough to continue under the agreement, which was the release of 10 women and children for another 24 hours in the pause. Hamas insisting it was Israel in the US to blame for the for the breakdown in the talks. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is in the Middle East as part of a climate conference, spoke with both the emir of Qatar and a leader of the United Arab Emirates.

Meanwhile, we have seen a number of rocket launches, including most around the Gaza area, but some have reached Tel Aviv. I should point out that in the strikes on Gaza.

Thanks to you both for that reporting.Let's talk more about this with CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, former commanding general of Europe and the Seventh Army. Thanks so much for being here with us. We just heard from Oren and Ben there about how the fighting has picked up, seemingly where it left off Israel resuming those strikes on Gaza. Where do you see things moving in the next few days now that this truce has expired? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What I'd say just to counter what you just said, I think it actually has increased beyond where it was when it -- when it -- when we went into the pause. Israel has conducted a lot of intelligence gathering during the period of the seven-day paws. They have not only received information from released hostages, but they've also received information from captured Hamas members, which gives them the ability to target very quickly and allegedly from the Israeli Defense Force that is more accurate. What you're also seeing Israel is taking some advice from the Biden administration in terms of limiting their strikes to certain areas in town. As Ben just said, they are looking at the East northeast and northern part of the Jabalia and Gaza City. They will expand that into other areas, most likely in Darabala (PH), which is the city in the center of Gaza, and even further to the south and Khan Younis units. Israel knows that there are multiple tunnel complexes and subterranean maneuvers going on by Hamas. And they're attempting to strike those vehemently with time sensitive targeting, and a whole lot of munitions from not only aircraft but from mortars and artillery pieces. The fight is going to continue. And there is going to be increasing humanitarian -- just humanitarian trauma going on within the Gaza Strip. And you mentioned how the IDF is expanding its operations is into southern Gaza, and that's where 1000s of the Gazan civilians have fled after what happened in the north. We know that Secretary of State Tony Blinken said yesterday that he underscored the imperative of the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale we saw in northern Gaza will not be repeated in the South. That, that is what he said he told the Israeli government. In your opinion, with him saying, with Blinken saying that publicly what do you think the IDF does with that information that warning or wish from the United States?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is a tough question, Jessica. And that's the key to all of this, because Israel has their strategic objective of defeating and destroying Hamas. Hamas has their strategic objective of killing Jews, and embarrassing Israel. The United States has their strategic objective of trying to remain friends with Israel during these very difficult situations. But at the same time, avoiding a huge humanitarian disaster, and the killing of innocent civilians.And unfortunately, those three strategic objectives are in conflict with one another in terms of a war fight like this on the edge of Israel. So, I believe the Israeli government, Mr. Netanyahu has taken some of the advice from the Biden administration. But at the same time, he has a strategic objective of destroying Hamas. And that is not going to bend his will and the Israelis will all that much. And we've seen that even as, as the pause was getting ready to end, Hamas went back up and started firing rockets, as Oren just reported, back at Tel Aviv. The longest range rockets the Hamas has. So, all of those things are considerations of how do you stop this terrorist organization from killing Israelis, and at the same time, avoiding the killing of Palestinian -- Palestinians? It's very challenging to do for any military force.",

And here, there is unity that the U.S. needs to amped-up a -- not just to Israel, but also to Ukraine. And as you know, those aid packages are tied to each other.In fact, they note frequently, I was just listening to Senator Joni Ernst, of course, Republican from Iowa, and Adam Smith, Democrat congressman -- both of them saying that large majorities in their own parties support boosting aid to both Israel and Ukraine. And what they find is that it's a small minority, particularly in the House among Republicans, which we're very familiar with, we've talked about many times, the same group that brought down McCarthy that are standing in the way. [12:15:01] There is enormous effort right now on the Hill to get that aid package through, and quickly, because of the need not just in Gaza but also in Ukraine. There is some optimism that I'm hearing here, and I've heard in Washington as well that they will be able to get it through. But it's not there yet. And there's a great deal of urgency because, of course, the war is raging in Gaza, military operations resuming, but also, we can't forget, the war is still rate waging very much -- raging very much in Ukraine.",

There is been talk about, do you separate them? That's not what the White House want. That's not what, you know, Senate leaders want on either side.What are you hearing from the people you're talking to about putting any sort of, you know, putting strings attached to any of this aid, or the possibility that they would be separated. That maybe Israel aid would move, but not Ukraine? It looks right -- the plan right now is to do them all together. And added into that mix is border security, that there seems to be an awareness now and acceptance, even among Democrats, that to get Israel aid and Ukraine aid, there have to be concessions on border security, raising the standard for asylum seekers, other changes in terms of asylum laws to get this across the finish line. I mean, those things are not typically connected. Foreign military assistance to a domestic national security issue, but they are in this case, and it seems that Democrats, even the Biden administration are increasingly aware, they are going to have to be concessions on border issues. So, which if you speak to border state Democrats, there is support for as well, those changes. But then, there is just the urgency of the wars, particularly with Ukraine. I had a story yesterday, discussing the latest western intelligence assessments that it's going to be a very tough winter for Ukraine that Russia is going to amped-up attacks on civilian infrastructure, expressly to increase the pain on the civilian population. Trying to break their will. So, there's urgency to get that military assistance through and quickly. They are not there yet. I am hearing some optimism here, Jessica. But as you know, you followed the hill a long time, optimism doesn't necessarily mean a final answer. So, there is still -- there is still work to do. DEAN: There is always more work to do.

The process itself, though, it's really quite simple. You see, Governor Kathy Hochul now has 10 days to announce a special election. That's supposed to take place 70 or 80 days after that announcement is made. And unlike your typical election, it would not be a primary that would decide those candidates, it will be party leaders at the county level that would then bring forth a list of candidates that would eventually end up on the ballot. Already, the pool is quite significant. Everything from a retired police detective, a war veteran, to even the man who used to fill George Santos position before he left in pursuit of an unsuccessful bid at the governorship. And eventually, that's when constituents would elect the next person that would represent this critical district. You just mentioned, that slim margin Santos would have four Republicans that flipped districts that were traditionally blue. So, Republicans certainly have a lot riding on this. So, this is a process. It's just beginning -- really just started yesterday, Jessica, in terms of what the residents are saying. We've heard them time and time again, expressing frustration, expressing anger this morning, I had an opportunity to speak to a couple of residents here, as to what are they looking for in their next representative?

This is the case filed here in D.C. by Special Counsel Jack Smith. The trial, remember, is scheduled for March. But before we get to that point, Donald Trump is trying everything in the book, everything he can do to get the charges dismissed and thrown out.So what he was arguing here was that he enjoyed absolute immunity. He argued that everything in the indictment covered actions that he took while he was the sitting President of the United States, and therefore, he can't be charged with any crimes. The only problem there is that the judge completely disagreed. She resoundingly rejected that argument. She said, it's not supported by the text of the Constitution. It's not backed up by any Supreme Court precedents. And she also said that wasn't the intention of the founding fathers. This 50-page ruling, Jessica, got into the Federalist Papers, and Alexander Hamilton and George Washington's farewell address, where they tried to make it clear that they did not want the president to be like a king, they did not want the president to be above the law. Let me read for you a quote from Judge Tanya Chutkan who wrote this opinion. Here's what she said, quote, whatever immunities a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time. And that position does not confer a lifelong get-out-of-jail- free pass. Strong words there from the judge. But it won't be the final word. This is almost certainly going to be appealed by President Trump. Maybe go all the way to the Supreme Court. So they will definitely have an opportunity to weigh in.

Chutkan, following on that said, well, he's now left office. He's now fair game, Mitch McConnell, in his speech, at the time of the impeachment said the same thing. And so it's pretty classic, that when you are private citizen, Trump, then you are liable for the criminal acts that you undertake, whether you're taking them now or whether you undertook them when you were president. And it seems pretty straightforward. But of course, the Court of Appeals will have to rule on this and then perhaps there'll be a petition to the Supreme Court for them to hear it depending on the outcome at the appellate level.",

That just does not comport with the tradition of our Constitution.As Marshall said, the framers of the Constitution said exactly otherwise. But they're going to pursue this.

She integrated a space where women were not welcome. And while her legacy as a justice is somewhat complicated, I do think that her legacy still recognizes that she was a well-respected jurist, she had a brilliant legal mind. And she also opened the door for every brilliant woman to join the court after her. So we owe her a debt for everything that she did to bring women into that space.",

She also wrote the five-four opinion upholding the University of Michigan law schools affirmative action program in 2003. We saw both of those decisions overturned by the court just in the last couple of years. Does that impact her legacy at all? Does it tarnish the impact that she had on the court in the sense that those kind of pivotal rulings were overturned?",

      "sentences": "I don't think it tarnishes her legacy per se, it may tarnish the legacy of the court overall. But I do think that those decisions reflect how crucial she was as a swing vote and how difficult it was to sort of cabin Justice O'Connor as justice that was to the right or the left. So for example, in Planned Parenthood versus Casey, which Justice O'Connor joined, she reaffirmed roles commitment to recognizing the right to terminate a pregnancy.But at the same time, the decision limited. I'm sorry, the decision made it easier for states to regulate pregnancy at the very outset, right? So in some ways it recognized the right of -- to terminate a pregnancy but it also enlarged the power of the states. And I think that maybe the sign of a good justice is one that issues decisions that really please no one, right? Like, you know, she definitely has some decisions that were complicated. Another space in which her legacy is probably more complicated is in the democracy space, right? She was the last person to serve on the Supreme Court who had been elected to public office. And I do think that informed her views on subjects such as gerrymandering, for example, where she treated it is one of the spoils of winning off. Its right, if a majority is able to come to office, the ability to gerrymander is something they have a right to do. And federal courts did not really have much to say about it. Yet at the same time, she cast one of the decisive votes in Bush versus Gore, which ended the 2000 Florida recount. And that decision went on to arguably politicize the court and involve them even more in political disputes from then on. So her legacy is definitely complicated. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily tarnished by what the current court is doing, even if it has the effect of undermining some of her earlier decisions.",

But I do think that, and I miss them very much, but I do think that when I taught subjects like constitutional law and election law, Justice O'Connor featured quite prominently in many of the cuts -- in many of the cases that we read and studied, in part because she was the quintessential swing justice.You know, we talk about Chief Justice Roberts is kind of serving that role now, but I think Justice O'Connor paved the way. It was -- there are cases where, you know, she would join a majority. And then she would write a separate concurring opinion where she would lay out kind of what she thought that the majority opinion stood for, right? And it's not too many justices who are brave enough to do something like that. So Justice O'Connor really does, at least in the law school context feature quite prominently as an example of what it can mean to be a Supreme Court justice, and in particular, an effective one.",
