CNN is on the ground in Kyiv and in Moscow, amid new estimates of Russia's losses, the bodies said to be piling up.Also tonight's, five former Memphis police officers plead not guilty to second degree murder and other charges in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. Nichols' mother at the arraignment, saying the defendants could not look her in the eye. I'll speak with the Nichols family attorney, Ben Crump, this hour.

And we have seen the beginning stages of a new Russian offensive, and that offensive is not going well.A senior State Department official on Thursday said that what they are seeing is very pathetic. And just earlier today, Pam, we did get an update from the White House about one area where the Russians have been trying to push forward for months in Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces have been facing off against mercenaries and convicts from the Wagner mercenary group. The White House, the National Security spokesman, John Kirby, says that they have suffered tremendous losses. They've had some 30,000 casualties, including 9,000 death in this brutal, grinding fight in Bakhmut. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) MARQUARDT (voice-over): Just a week from the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, this is, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the toughest fight in Ukraine right now in the eastern city of Bakhmut. Called a meat grinder by both sides, Russian troops from the Wagner mercenary group, most of them convicts, continue to be sent in wave after wave to their deaths.",

We believe the Wagner continues to rely heavily on these convicts in the Bakhmut fighting. And that doesn't show any signs of abating.MARQUARDT (voice-over): The battle, laying bare the stark divisions on the Russian side. With Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin openly blasting Russia's official military leadership, saying they managed soldiers from beauty salons and country clubs. Arguing that if there were more of his private troops, they would be halfway across Ukraine by now. The toll has been so severe on the Russian side that according to Ukrainian officials, regular troops have been backfilling Wagner to mechanized infantry and tank units supported by artillery and aircraft. If Russia were to take Bakhmut, it would change little, but be a symbolic victory as Ukraine struggles to keep them at bay. President Zelenskyy today urging world leaders at the Munich Security Conference to speed up their military aid, comparing the fight to Goliath taking on David and his sling. PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE: We need to hurry up. We need the speed, speed of our agreements, speed of our delivery to strengthen our sling, speed of decisions to limit Russian potential. MARQUARDT (voice-over): That Russian potential is still significant with hundreds of thousands of mobilized troops believed to be in reserve and Russian President Vladimir Putin able to call up more to offset his enormous losses. Now, according to the U.S. State Department, numbering over 200,000 Russian dead and wounded. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

We did learn today that 635 Ukrainian troops have just graduated from a newly formed U.S. training program in Germany that lasts five weeks. Another 710 have just started the second phase. And there they're learning both combined arms and maneuvers with those armored vehicles that the U.S. says will be crucial in the next offensive. Pamela.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Alexander Lukashenko. And he certainly is a key ally for Vladimir Putin. Probably right now, he's the most important and most loyal ally that he has anywhere. And Lukashenko, of course, is also so important because Belarus has such a long border with Ukraine, and the Russians have been using that border to mount attacks towards Ukrainian territory. Of course, it was one of the main points that the Russians used to get their invasion going into Ukraine when this war started, and now they're still launching missiles and drones towards Ukrainian territory as well.So, Lukashenko extremely important for Vladimir Putin. Now, Lukashenko, he said yesterday at a press conference where were present that he would continue to allow Vladimir Putin to mount such attacks, but he would not use his own forces unless he is attacked from Ukraine. Now, of course, we know that right now that is not in the cards. We also have to mention, Pamela, that of course, Lukashenko is also very dependent on Vladimir Putin, he was telling Vladimir Putin that the cooperation between the two countries was going very well and was being expanded. But the one thing that really caught our eye is that Lukashenko also said that he believes soon the Belarussians could start making combat jets. They're called the SU25. It's a strike aircraft. It's pretty much like the A10 of the Soviet bloc, although it is a lot less capable than the A10 is. But it's certainly a jet that the Belarussians think they can start manufacturing, Lukashenko says, if they get of help from Russia. Because one of the things that we have to point out and I think Alex just mentioned that, as well as the Ukrainians, of course, having some trouble with munition, running low on some munitions, the Russians also having some problems as well, and they have said that they need to ramp up some of the production of munitions but for other war inventory as well, like, for instance, jets, but also howitzers as well. So, very important that cooperation, two leaders had said. And you know right now it's also a pretty pivotal time here in Moscow as well. We're already looking towards next week when Vladimir Putin is going to hold a key speech right before the one year anniversary of this war. And then we'll really see whether the Russians escalate even further. Pamela.",

Pamela, I was going to say, this is a race. Russia has to commit mobilized forces, and Ukraine is trying to train and integrate western weapons into their formation. Putin's army is not ready for a large scale offensive, but Putin is forcing them to go on this offense because of their fear of the new weapons being delivered to the battlefield. You heard Fred just mentioned right now that -- or I think it was Alex that said they just graduated close to a battalion of mechanized soldiers at Grafenberg, Germany. There's going to be another one. So Putin is very worried about this. So he is pushing these conscripts into the fight, and is being reported they are being mauled. Again, it's a race between the two armies to see who can get an advantage. And I think Ukraine is going to have that advantage if they can hold on the defenses for a few more weeks.",

And there is the, you know, Putin people have been definitely trying to inculcate as much patriotism and war fever and all of that in people to support Putin and his war.So, yes, whether they will be turned in the end against this war, it's very hard to say.

They have been desperate in their attempts to hold that city as a counter propaganda tool against Mr. Putin, and they don't want to give up any part of their territory in this phase of the operation. So, Putin will, no matter what happens, will declare that he's had multiple victories, as Jill will probably say, but he hasn't. He has killed a lot of his forces.

Mitch McConnell, of course, had a vested interest in making sure, trying to get back into the Senate majority.They had a disagreement about this issue. McConnell did not want to have an agenda in which Democrats could attack. Instead, he wanted to focus squarely on Joe Biden. But when Scott put out this plan, it gave Democrats something to seize on. But it wasn't just that. It was about certain tactical disagreements that the two men had. McConnell wanted to get more involved in some Senate primaries. Scott's decision to stay out of Senate primaries did not go over well with some of McConnell's allies, who wanted them to take a more assertive posture. And of course, ultimately, Senate Republicans fell short, did not take back the Senate majority, and it's been a blame game all along. And things have only intensified, including after the elections, when Rick Scott decided to mount a challenge and try to knock off McConnell. Blaming McConnell for not embracing this plan is one reason why the party took a drubbing in the Senate races. McConnell, of course, defeated Rick Scott, but that was the first challenge to his leadership he has faced as he became the longest serving party leader in Senate history. But real tension between these two men as their disagreement still is pretty intense heading into the next election cycle.",
