So that timeframe seems to be rather quick.But Elon Musk was, several days before this launch, was putting really, like dampening expectations as to what might happen. Even thinking there might be some catastrophic failure on the launch pad as it launched. But it was a stunning, thunderous site here as the Starship rocket cleared the launch pad and then started traveling east for several minutes. You can see this long, giant smoke trail. And then just about the three minute mark, at the time that we thought that the booster was going to separate from the rocket ship, we heard another loud, thunderous explosion and bright orange light below that smoke trail. I'm assuming now at this point, given what we know now, that that was the failure of the rocket ship exploding there over the Gulf of Mexico. Ideally, if everything had gone right, this ship was supposed to travel almost around the Earth, falling into the Pacific Ocean around the state of Hawaii. But that clearly didn't happen, so they are -- we'll continue working here. And of course, all of this significant because this is the rocket ships -- rocket ship system that will eventually partner with NASA as it returns to the moon and eventually trying to create human travel to Mars. So all of this intertwined with what NASA is doing and that's why so many people are paying such close attention to this.",

Remember this is a big rocket but it goes into orbit and then it's got to refuel.

But if you are able to get this kind of protection, that is one way you can share what you know within this case. Congress, of course, federal investigators have been investigating the president's son since around 2018. We know from our reporting that they have contemplated bringing charges that include tax crimes and even a possible false statements charge related to the purchase of a weapon. But as of now, no charges have been filed. This agent says that he has, among other things, evidence that would contradict the sworn testimony of attorney general Merrick Garland, who testified before Congress that he would not interfere in that investigation. According to this letter that was sent to lawmakers, this person says they can share, quote, \"information related to a failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition of this case and examples of preferential treatment and politics, improperly infecting decisions and protocols that would normally be followed.\" But Sara, we have no specific information about exactly what this person would say. Republicans on the Hill, while the federal criminal investigation hasn't yielded any charges, they have launched their own investigations into the Biden family. They would shortly like to see lots of headlines about a whistleblower and Hunter Biden.
