HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: They're exceedingly rare, even the trials. They have a checkered history before this episode. The last one the department brought about 10 years ago ended in acquittal. Whitney is exactly right. This is the crown jewel, top charge, that there is. Now it stands to reason, in a sense, because it's conspiracy, and conspiracy means an agreement to do something unlawful, an overt act. No reason lower-level people can't be part of a conspiracy. And yet, given how difficult these are always to prove, it is, as Whitney says, a very significant victory for the Department of Justice. Now, we'll see how the Proud Boys suit, featuring Enrique Tarrio and four other defendants, comes out with the same charge. But this is about as big a victory as the DOJ could have with respect to the thousand or so defendants, the actual marauders who stormed the capitol on January 6th.",

Albuquerque police say that he was fueled by election lies. He was a staunch supporter of former President Trump. He believed his own election back in November had been stolen despite having been defeated by nearly 50 points. Prosecutors allege that Pena then concocted this plot targeting the homes of Democrats he wrongfully blamed for his election loss. Police say he texted the addresses of these targets to a hired gunman to carry out the shootings. One of the, a man by the name of Jose Trejillo. He got caught at a traffic stop. And inside that vehicle, police found guns that were traced back to the shootings as well as more than 800 fentanyl pills. That car was registered to Solomon Pena. Separately, as pointed out in the intro, CNN has learned that the alleged gunman for hire also happened to be Pena's top campaign donor. Albuquerque police are investigating whether Pena's campaign was funded in part by cash from narcotic sales that might have been laundered into campaign contributions. Of course, New Mexico's attorney, we have just found out, attorney general has also launched his own formal investigation into his campaign finances -- guys?",

And Poland is actually saying they are in a position where they would move forward with about a dozen of these European countries and send these German-made tanks to Ukraine without getting the green light of Germany. So that would be extremely an interesting situation to watch. The other thing that we need to watch for is, if Germany doesn't give that green light, does the Biden administration feel like there's mounting pressure on them to give Ukraine these Abrams tanks that right now they have said just wouldn't be effective on the battlefield.",

      "sentences": "Alisyn and Victor, the concern really remains over high inflation, and the Fed's war on high inflation, right?The fear really remains the same, that the Fed either already has or will soon go too far, right? Raise interest rates so high they slow the economy right into a recession. And there are some flashing yellow lights. We've got two more today. The leading economic index out today, down 10 months in a row. This is a compilation of 10 indicators on the real economy and financial markets, everything from jobs and wages to stocks and bonds. And the problem is that every time this index -- and you can see it on your screen -- is down, and every time it's fallen by this much in this short amount of time, a recession has followed. Let me read you a key line from this report. They wrote, quote, \"There was widespread weakness among leading indicators in December, indicating deteriorating conditions for labor markets, manufacturing, housing construction, and financial markets.\" Another report out for the National Association for Business Economics found that more economists expect that their own companies will cut payrolls than add to their payrolls in the next few months. We haven't seen that since 2020. I think that the truth is, though, there are some conflicting signals about the economy, right? On the negative side, consumer spending certainly has slowed. Manufacturing service sectors are in contraction. And housing is getting crushed by the spike in mortgage rates. But there's positives, too. And those positives are leading some economists to predict there won't be a recession. Inflation is cooling off. The unemployment rate is tied for the lowest level since 1969. And the Fed has gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to merely tapping the brakes. And that is a good sign. I think, you put it all together, clearly there are some risks of a recession, but it's not a foregone conclusion.",

Spotify is cutting 60 percent of its work force. That equates to about 600 people.Just last week, Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet, they announced they plan to cut thousands of jobs. Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook owner, Meta, they've all done the same. Of course, the question is why tech? And the Spotify CEO alluded to this in his memo to employees. He said, look, we thought some of the positive trends that we saw in our business during COVID were going to last. They haven't. The advertising market has slowed down. I think the bigger question is, what does this all mean for the broader economy? And it's important to remember that tech is a small part of the overall employment in terms of employment. And it's possible that they could cut jobs and it does not spread completely to the rest of the economy.",
