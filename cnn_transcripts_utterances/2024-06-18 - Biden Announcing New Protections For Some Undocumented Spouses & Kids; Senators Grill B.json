So I think that's where the priority will be in any new administration and there's a variety of different things that you can put in place to address that issue first and foremost.I will say that I served all four years in the Trump administration and we did negotiate with Congress. We were not successful in both 17 and 18 in both the border security and immigration bill. So there is precedent for, you know, obviously negotiating and looking at different actions that work. But I think first and foremost you've got to deal with the border and you've got to stop these hundreds of thousands and - millions of individuals coming across the border illegally. You've got to address that issue. Otherwise the law enforcement officers of DHS will never be able to get their arms around it, will never be able to fully vet individuals coming into the country.

It's kind of common in white collar crimes where essentially you get amnesty for the crime so long as you clean up your act over a certain period of time. But what it looks like is the act - cleaning did not work. We've seen plenty of evidence of that. So it will be interesting to see if the Department of Justice goes on a criminal direction. I should note, Boris, that in the aviation world, it is kind of famously not criminal when it comes to safety. The idea is that we want to have everybody in the community willing to speak out and identify a safety problem without fear of any recriminations. But some of the allegations and what has been proven in the midst of those two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 step over the line into the area of what you would say would be more willful disregard.

And we've heard from whistleblower after whistleblower exactly that, Brianna, that there is almost this sweatshop mentality on the Boeing factory floor as they try to match the pace of Airbus and meet those quarterly earnings reports. You hear stories of parts that are not properly documented, being put on the aircraft and put in service. And when those whistleblowers attempt to raise concerns on the factory floor, they are ruthlessly intimidated by superiors. In one case today, they told the account of one whistleblower being called dozens of times by a supervisor and threatened by the supervisor that he will break him. Ultimately, he did. So that's not conducive to safety by any stretch. And what is happening also is they have this idea of stations for the aircraft as it moves along the line. And there are many open issues which kind of travel with the aircraft. And so the process of putting the airplane together is put out of order, so there's a lot to look at here.",
