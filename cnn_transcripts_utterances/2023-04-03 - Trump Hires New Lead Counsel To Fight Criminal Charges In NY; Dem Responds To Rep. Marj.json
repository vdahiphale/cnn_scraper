And we are now just hours away, from Trump's historic arrest, as our Jeff Zeleny, has new reporting, from inside Trump's camp, this late hour, this evening.Plus, I'll be joined by a reporter, who's talking to Trump insiders, and why they are worried, tonight, about the protests, tomorrow. And new word, about the American journalist, jailed in Russia. As one of Evan Gershkovich's closest friends is here, what Evan said to him, the night before his arrest? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I am Erin Burnett. And welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT, tonight. Hours from surrendering, former President Donald J. Trump, right now, huddling with advisers, in New York, as he is about to make history, as the first President, to formally be charged with a crime. In just hours, Trump will head Downtown, and he will turn himself in. And, at this late hour, this Monday evening, we are still waiting for the judge, in the case, to rule, on two important motions. And this could come at any time. The first of these is whether to allow cameras in the courtroom. Trump's legal team opposes that move. They say, it would create a circus-like atmosphere. That's the first motion. And then, the second one that we're awaiting, a ruling from the judge on, is the motion to unseal the indictment, before tomorrow's arraignment. Again, we are told that these rulings could be issued, tonight. And if they are, it would be an incredible cap off, to what has been a pretty unbelievable day. The former President, leaving his home, in Mar-a-Lago, this afternoon, followed there in his convoy, supporters lining the roads, flying to New York, where he made his way to Trump Tower, cameras catching the former President waving, as he entered his home. Sources telling CNN, the former President faces more than 30 counts. These are related to business fraud. And the charges come after a lengthy investigation, into Trump's alleged role, in a hush money payment, to the adult film star, Stormy Daniels. And that payment, of course, happened, just before the 2016 election. Our Kara Scannell is OUTFRONT. She is outside the courthouse. Jeff Zeleny is at Trump Tower, with new reporting, there. Let me begin though with you, Kara. Because I know, we are waiting, and this could come down, at any time, here, these crucial decisions, from the judge, on these motions. What's the latest you're hearing?",

      "sentences": "Erin, so, we are waiting to see, when the judge will issue these rulings. He did indicate, earlier today that he would, or he was expected to issue a ruling, on these, tonight.And just a reminder, CNN and other news organization has asked the judge, to allow cameras, in the courtroom, to capture the moment, the first time in the nation's history that a former President will be arraigned, on criminal charges. And the media request is, given the historic nature of this, given the great public interest in this, this should be something that Americans can tune in and watch. Now, the Trump team is opposing this. They're saying that this could add to the potential circus-like atmosphere, here. Now, it is - there are a lot of media cameras, here. We don't know what kind of protest or counter-protests could show up tomorrow, if any. And they're saying that it could also harm the former President's presumption of innocence, by allowing the public potential jurors, to see him, sitting behind a defendant's table. Now, the District Attorney's Office is saying, in this manner, they're not going to weigh in on it. They have noted in the past, in other high-profile cases, they've allowed a still photographer, to come in, and capture the moments, before the proceeding begins. We're waiting for the judge to rule on that. The media has also asked the judge, to unseal the indictment. We've been reporting, there's more than 30 charges, and some of them will be felonies. We're asking the judge, to unseal the indictment. Still no word on whether he will do it ahead of the arraignment, tomorrow afternoon. So, these are the key things that we have teed up. It's also possible, we'll hear from the District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, tomorrow. They have been silent, on this, other than this statement, last Thursday, confirming that the grand jury had returned an indictment. We'd be interested in hearing from him, what the theory of the case is, and why he thought this was a significant case to bring, an important case to bring, the first case to bring, against the former President.
