They mingled with wheelchair basketball players at the event and Harry scored a basketball shot, cheered on by excited kids at the end. Their visit to Niger has been special for Meghan in particular who has been on a journey of discovery to learn more about her Nigerian heritage. She had previously disclosed that that she found out she's 43 percent Nigerian after a gene test. And during the trip she described Nigeria as \"her home and her country\". She also shared at a women's leadership event how meaningful it was to learn about her roots especially as an African-American. During their Lagos visit, Harry and Meghan also met with the Lagos governor and held a private fundraiser to raise money for a state-of- the-art Invictus Center in the country.

Joining me now, Pratyusha Sharma, lead author of the study and Massachusetts Institute of Technology doctoral student in electrical engineering and computer science.

And their dance is assembled by combining these two features.Theres also like other examples. And for example, in birds and chimpanzees.
