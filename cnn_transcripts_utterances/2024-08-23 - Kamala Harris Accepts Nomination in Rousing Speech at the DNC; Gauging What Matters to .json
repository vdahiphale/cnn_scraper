Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the first black woman and South Asian woman to be nominated for president by a major party. So, can she carry some of the momentum and enthusiasm we saw in Chicago this week into November to defeat Donald Trump? We'll take you live to Chicago. Donald Trump for his part back on the campaign trail today. But the biggest headline on this Friday may go to the independent candidate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as we wait for his next move, Plus, take a look at this video. Ukraine striking a Russian railroad ferry at a key port connecting Russia to the Crimean Peninsula. Just 74 days now until Americans elect a new president in what the newly minted Democratic nominee is calling a choice between the past and the future. Vice President Kamala Harris formally accepting her party's nomination on Thursday night with a rousing speech in Chicago where she also made the case for normalcy, painting a stark contrast between what she described as what her time in the White House would look like versus a second term for Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our nation, with this election, has a precious fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past. A chance to chart a new way forward. I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There was music, there were celebrity appearances, there was Democratic star power, and there were also lots of Republicans. Here's Julia Benbrook with a look at some of the bigger moments.

Monday night seems almost like an eternity ago when President Biden was addressing this crowd to the end of the week when Vice President Harris is going on her way on a 74-day march toward November. But I think I was struck by this serious nature of the speech. For all the talk about potential celebrities, is Beyonce coming or not, no.

Things complacency was the word I heard over and over again. Democrats cannot be complacent in this election, which many of them thought they were in 2016, no one imagined that Donald Trump would actually be elected. He was.

And from that ravaging of an entire densely populated neighborhood where Hezbollah is based, came Israel's so-called Dahiya Doctrine, a strategy of massive disproportionate use of force, including targeting civilian populations and infrastructure. Until now, the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has been largely limited to the south. Yet after the Israeli strike in late July on Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah military commander ended the group's vow to retaliate, war threatens to engulf the rest of the country. In the past few weeks, Israeli war planes have frequently broken the sound barrier in the skies over Beirut. A grim warning to all Lebanese of what could come. (Voice-over): A warning voiced Wednesday by Israel's defense minister. Our center of gravity, he said, is gradually shifting from the south to the north. The Dahiya Doctrine for all intents and purposes is being put into practice in Gaza where tens of thousands have been killed and much of the strip reduced to ruins. Yet after almost 11 months of war, Israel has yet to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas. Hezbollah represents a far greater challenge to the Israeli military than Hamas, says analyst Imad Salamey.

The final body which was recovered is believed to be that of the 18-year-old daughter of British tech tycoon, Mike Lynch. His body was recovered on Thursday. Seven people were killed when violent weather hit that yacht on Monday, 15 people survived. Heavy rainfall and flooding are blamed for 36 deaths in Bangladesh and Northeast India. Hundreds of thousands are displaced at this point. India had previously said that release of water from its Dunbar Dam was not to blame for the floods, but noted a breakdown in regular communication between the two countries on Wednesday evening. Authorities in Thailand are searching through the crash site of a small plane. Nine people were on board when it went down near Bangkok on Thursday. The passengers were Thai and Chinese nationals. As for the cause of that crash, it is not yet clear. Canada's two major freight railroads are preparing to restart their engines after the federal government forced an end to a management ordered lockout. The lockout lasting in total about 17 hours. But boy, was it threatening to disrupt multiple sectors across Canada and the United States. We're talking about lumber, auto parts, agriculture, all heavily dependent of course on cross-border trade. The lockout threw some 9,000 rail workers on the picket lines.

They don't want to get ahead of the other person, but I want to note one thing. There's probably a lot of questions as to why it matters if RFK endorses Donald Trump. Let's talk about the state of Arizona. This is a critical battleground state, one they really want to win. Donald Trump's team really wants to win. I mean, both sides really want to win. He lost it in 2020. RFK is currently polling here at 6 percent. That is compared to Harris who is polling at 45 percent and Trump at 42 percent. Does the Trump team think that if RFK drops out and endorses Trump that all 6 percent is going to go to him? No, absolutely not. They understand that's not how this works. However, can they siphon off enough of that to either tie it up or put Donald Trump ahead? Remember, both sides right now believe that this race is going to be determined by razor thin margins. So any single vote that they can get, they believe that could help put them over the edge. And it's not only Arizona. You're seeing this pattern in various places throughout the state. Overall, RFK is polling at around 5 percent. Again, they don't think they're going to get all of this if RFK endorses Trump but if they can get anything from it, they view it as a win.",

I don't know that they're going to get that big of a bump out of the convention simply because they've already had a bump leading up to it.
