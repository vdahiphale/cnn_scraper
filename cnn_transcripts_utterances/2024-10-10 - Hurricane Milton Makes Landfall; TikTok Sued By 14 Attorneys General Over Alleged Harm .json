      "sentences": "One of the biggest concerns with Hurricane Milton is storm surge. The National Weather Service forecasting life-threateningstorm surge levels here. So the basics, a storm surge is rapid rise in water levels caused by strong winds pushing water onshore. In parts of Florida, we`re talking 12 to 15 feet of water from this storm in a surge. And I want to give you an idea of what that really means beyond just the numbers. This shows you a storm surge of about two feet. At this level, low-lying coastal roads would be inundated with water. The next stage would be surge of five to eight feet. This is enough to submerge cars. But remember, Milton is expected to bring much worse storm surge of 10 plus feet in places. And this is taller than a city bus. The average first floor of a commercial building is typically around 14 feet high and Milton storm surge could reach a foot higher than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now to TikTok, where the app is facing more legal pressure. A bipartisan group, or a group consisting of both Democrats and Republicans,filed lawsuits this week against the platform. The group consists of 14 attorneys general from across the country who allege the app has addicted young people and harmed their mental health. The lawsuits pointed at some classic TikTok elements in their arguments, like endless scrolling content and TikTok challenges. The lawsuits are the latest legal pressure facing TikTok, which is also battling a law that could see it banned in the United States. CNN`s Clare Duffy has more on this and TikTok`s response.

      "sentences": "Yeah, these lawsuits take aim at a wide range of TikTok`s business practices and features that these attorneysgeneral say can harm young users` mental health and well-being. Things like the endlessly scrolling feed that they say can keep users scrolling to see what the next video is going to be. Late night notifications that can interrupt teen sleep. And they claim that TikTok has failed to do enough to address so-called TikTok challenges. These viral video trends where teens try to replicate videos created by other users and can sometimes be encouraged to engage in dangerous behavior. TikTok has repeatedly said that its platform is safe for children. This is not the first time that it`s faced claims like this. A spokesperson told me today that the company strongly disagrees with the claims and they pointed to new features that the platform has rolled out in the past few years. Things like a default screen time limit for teens, default privacy protections for teens under the age of 16, and parental oversight tools. But these state attorneys general clearly think that those things are not enough. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Saturn and Jupiter, Jupiter and Mars, Earth and Venus, or Venus and Mercury. If you said Jupiter and Mars, use a star. That`s where millions of asteroids can be found. Some outer space news now. A unique mission is now underway to see if NASA`s attempt to redirect an asteroid in the name of planetary defense was successful. NASA`s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, was a first of its kind asteroid deflection technique that was used two years ago in an attempt to alter the path of an asteroid named Dimorphos. NASA crashed a spacecraft into the asteroid at 13,645 miles per hour to test its plan to defend planet Earth against potential future impacts. And now a European spacecraft and two shoebox-sized satellites have launched to survey the results of NASA`s DART mission. We`ll need to wait a while though before we hear those results. The spacecraft and its two CubeSat companions are slated to arrive at Dimorphos and the larger asteroid it orbits named Didymos in late 2026. They`ll conduct an investigation at the crash scene to see whether or not their attempt to redirect this asteroid was a success. All right, we have heard a lot about emerging and potential uses of artificial intelligence lately, but here`s one that`s news to me. We soon may have the ability to wear AI. Technical outerwear brand Arc`teryx and wearable technology startup Skip teamed up to create a pair of pants that basically give your legs robo power. They do a lot of the work for you. They`re calling their gear movewear, but they could also say they`re giving whole new meaning to the term fancy pants. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): These aren`t your ordinary hiking pants. They contain a battery powered exoskeleton to help you get outdoors. They`re the first of a new type of clothing the creators are calling movewear. KATHRYN ZEALAND, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SKIP: The same way that sleepwear is something that you wear when you want to sleep, movewear is something that you wear when you want to move. ANNA ROUMIANTSEVA, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, SKIP: You can think of it like an e-bike for walking.",
