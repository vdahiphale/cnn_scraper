The new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to steer the country to what he calls calmer waters. His win is an anomaly in Europe right now as France heads to the polls this weekend. Right-wing leader Marine Le Pen says she's confident in her party. And in the Middle East, voting is wrapping up in Iran's presidential election. Voting will have to last a few hours  more because of the number of people at the polls, we'll have report on the country's starkly different -- two starkly different candidates. Also, the Biden campaign is still trying to shake off last week's debate disaster. This time, a new campaign strategy. It's 7:00 in the evening in the U.K., dreadful day for the weather, but it's first-ever new political era. The past 14 years of Tory rule is over. Now, it's Labor Party's turn, with Britain's new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after a landslide win. He spoke today outside 10 Downing Street, promising to heal a deep lack of public trust in government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, President Biden so far has really resisted the calls for him to step aside, as there are serious doubts amongst some top Democrats and donors about keeping Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. A bit earlier today, as he was traveling here to Wisconsin, the President told reporters that he does still believe that he can beat Donald Trump in November after that halting debate performance last week. But the President's mission right now is really trying to convince the American voters that he is up for a second term. The President has privately acknowledged to allies that he knows how critical this coming stretch of days will be to the future of his candidacy. Here in Wisconsin, he is set to rally voters. As you can see, there's already a big group assembled here, who are waiting for the President, and he will also sit down for that high-stakes interview with \"ABC News\". This is an interview that is far different than anything Biden's ever held before. As past interviews, you know, really focus on preparing for possible domestic policy, foreign policy questions. But this interview will really be trying to judge the President's viability as a candidate going forward. Now, while we've been waiting for the President to arrive, I took the temperature of some voters who are here in attendance. And this really been a mixed reaction. There are some fervent supporters who believe that the president should remain in this race. They think that he has the accomplishments, the record to sell, and presents a very viable alternative to Donald Trump. But then, there are others who do have concerns following that debate performance and wants to see how the President will perform,  not just here at this event, but also in that interview. Take a listen to what one of those voters told me a bit earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was, of course, the president who was killed in that helicopter crash on May 19. As far as Saeed Jalili is concerned, that would no doubt mean a very tough stance towards Israel. And of course, also a very tough stance towards the United States as well. Both these candidates, by the way, have been campaigning over the past week.

It was quite low in the first round of voting around 40 percent. And Iran's supreme leader who's also traditionally the first person to cast his vote in elections and once again, did so as well this morning. He says that high voter turnout is something that strengthens the political system in Iran, whereas low voter turnout is something that weakens Iran's political system.
