The U.S. Coast Guard says it has found a debris field near the search area.As we work to find out more details about what exactly that debris is, we do know that deep underwater rescues have happened in the past, though at far more shallow depths than where this was. The deepest off the coast of Ireland. Our Tom Foreman has been tracking this and with us here now. The depth of the \"Titanic\" here at 12,500 feet, about two and a half miles down.

Does that tell us the search is over, tragically, in its own way? But in the meantime, everyone else has to go forward with all of those pieces of information and say we must assume that they're still down there, that there is still a rescue to be affected here. The simple truth is, when these things come along, you have to bring all the bits of expertise together from the examples you have and see if you can make them work. And as we found looking at this a little bit deeper, that's a complex equation. Let's take a look.

They held on to hope especially because of the banging noises, so- called banging. They didn't know exactly what they were. The U.S. Navy had determined that, right now, they were inconclusive as to what they were. They were hanging on to hope as they got each and every piece of information from U.S. officials.
