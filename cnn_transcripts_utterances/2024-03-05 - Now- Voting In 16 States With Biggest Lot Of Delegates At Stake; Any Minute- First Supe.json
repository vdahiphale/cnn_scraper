That's where we get the first results from our exit polls. We have our reporters fanned out across the nation right now as voters are heading to the polls. I want to start our special coverage with our David Culver. He's joining us tonight from San Jose, California, where people have been filing into vote all day.

This is Santa Clara County election center. This is part of the Silicon Valley area. So, you've got a big range in wealth. And you've got a working class here, too, huge Latino population, about 25 to 30 percent. The mail-in ballots are going to be the chunk of what comes in here. Interesting to see, all of these stacks, these are the votes have come in. They go through the processing here, and then they continue back through machines like this and get divided up into the many precincts in this area. So, it's incredibly active as they are obviously full speed ahead here on this Super Tuesday. But go into those voters, the folks who are filling out these ballots, you really get a sense that for a lot of them, this is becoming personal. And I asked one guy who showed up. His name is Pearson Randall (ph). He's 24. What brought them out here on his lunch hour to cast a primary ballot? He said for him, it was to go a different direction for the country.

I said, what about Donald Trump? He said, you know, I'm really not comfortable answering that question. And then he seems to have echoed what a lot of folks here in California have said to me in recent days, and that is he's not sure who he is going to vote for. Is that positive of an answer?

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it's because of all the states there go fairly heavily red, Utah is the one state where Donald Trump does the least well, traditionally. In 2016, he lost the Republican caucuses here pretty handily to Ted Cruz. There are other factors here that I'll talk about in just a second.But first, let me set the scene for you. This is a caucus site. It's not a traditional polling site for primary. It's a caucus site. So the caucusgoers have not come here yet. This is Alta High School here in Sandy, Utah. They're going to be coming in that entrance there. We're not allowed in yet because school is in session now as we speak, but in about four hours, the voters will start to arrive for the caucus session, which will be held inside those doors there. Thirty-two precincts voting here. So it'd be caucusing in 32 different rooms, then casting ballots like this one. This is a kind of a sample ballot here. Nikki Haley, Donald Trump, and the third candidate, Ryan Binkley, on the ballot here. They cast their ballots, then they start counting at about 8:00 p.m. local time, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Hopefully, we'll be able to bring all of that to you live because we're going to get access inside there once the caucusing begins, talking about the Haley-Trump dynamic here. Another reason, Kate, why Nikki Haley could do well here in Utah is because she's got some good endorsements on her side. The Republican Governor Spencer Cox has not formally endorsed her, but he has said publicly that he likes Nikki Haley as a candidate. He does not like Donald Trump or Joe Biden as candidates. The governor's wife, Abby Cox, has endorsed Nikki Haley. The lieutenant governor. Deidre Henderson, has endorsed Nikki Haley. So you've got key endorsements there. You've also got the Mitt Romney factor here in Utah. The retiring U.S. Republican senator, former presidential candidate, we know of course, has been very critical of Donald Trump over the years. Will his pull matter in this state? It might. If she's going to have a chance to pull out of state, it might be here in Utah, and we're going to see how that vote plays out in the next few hours.

We already know that they don't like either one of them very much. We know that according to one poll, more than 70 percent believe Joe Biden is too old to be president. And there are questions about Donald Trump and how he does with women in suburbia. And I think with independent voters.

Bernie Sanders did likewise. She's now in a sort of issue campaign and she's basically building and solidifying behind her. I don't think it's hers to control or anything, but a faction that is just not that into Donald Trump. And that's significant. Pat Buchanan in 1992 averaged over the course of the all the primaries, about 22 percent. Nikki Haley's overperforming that. And that puts her in a good place sort of no matter what, but not to be president in 2024.",

We did a youth organizer training around and relational organizing tool called Reach that we are going to implement across the state this year. In particular, on college campuses, to help young people organize young people, because we know that's what's going to drive out the base this year in North Carolina. It's what won Barack Obama, North Carolina in 2008. And it's one of the most important voting blocs that we have. And her being here, you know, the last visit that she made in North Carolina, she went to A&amp;T, one of our historically Black colleges and universities and our state. And we have the most of them in the entire country in North Carolina. And it's so important for this state to see her because the South deserves to see the first Black woman vice president, come here and really embrace the fact that 55 percent of Black Americans live in the South right now.
