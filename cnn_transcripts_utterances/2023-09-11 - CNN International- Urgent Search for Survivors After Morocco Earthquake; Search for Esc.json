But this search and rescue operation is very much ongoing and it could be for several days. And it has been a struggle over the weekend for search and rescueteams to make it to some of the areas hardest hit by Friday's earthquake. Many of these villages are located in remote areas of the Atlas Mountains, which are typically hard to get to, but also the roads have also sustained damage and that has pose an obstacle to rescue teams. But what we are beginning to see now is international search and rescue teams joining the effort, coming to Morocco to support on that front. But there will also be a focus on the humanitarian relief front as well. Of course, many of those across the Atlas Manners, across the areas impacted around the epicenter have lost their homes. Have lost absolutely everything. And so they will be needing that support for some time to come. Here in Marrakech, what we have seen over the weekend, for three nights in a row now actually, is families sleeping in the street, choosing to sleep outside for fear of another aftershock, or potentially another earthquake. Many have said that they're too afraid that their homes aren't safe and that the structures of their buildings could give way. So that is a real fear for many across the country in those areas impacted by the earthquake. But we have seen an outpouring of community support as well. There has been a real push for people to go out and donate blood. We've seen queues of people lining up to support on that front. And we're beginning to see people gathering crucial items for those impacted. Loading vans and travelling almost to the areas impacted to support with the humanitarian relief effort. But this is going to be a process that takes days, if not months. And when it comes to the recovery effort, the rebuild effort that could take years. Nada Bashir, CNN, Marrakesh. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Investigators here earlier said that the latest developments are considered, quote, a minor setback. Though when you look at those developments, that certainly could be considered an understatement, given that authorities really have no idea where to begin searching right now. And here's why as you retrace the steps of this escaped killer since Saturday night.They believe at one point he managed to escape that perimeter near Lockwood Gardens, which was being looked at by authorities for several days. Eventually he made it his way into, or at least onto a dairy farm, which is where investigators believe he managed to steal a van. Because the keys were left inside. Cavalcante believed to have gone on a drive of about 22 miles or so north into the Phoenixville, Pennsylvania area, where a surveillance camera at the residence of a former colleague of his actually captured him there. And when you look at it, this is really the latest image that we have, or at least one of them that we have showing Cavalcante. Appears to be in fairly good spirits, especially for being somebody who's been on the run for a week and a half. The hoodie that he's wearing, according to investigators, he actually stole from that dairy farm. Eventually, Cavalcante then resumes its drive, making it west to Northern Chester County, specifically in East Nantmeal Township. That is where investigators say the vehicle literally ran out of gas forcing him to ditch that car. And that is where there is a temporary perimeter set up. Authorities are searching that particular area, though they have no reason to believe that it could potentially still be there. During a press conference on Sunday, Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens addressing some mounting criticism that this individual was able to slip past hundreds of men and women in law enforcement. LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I'm not going to make an excuse to you. I wish it had not happened. Unfortunately, there are a lot of circumstances. There are a lot of issues associated with that property. Tunnels with very large drainage ditches, things that could not be secured. You couple that with weather, aviation being down for a night. There are a number of reasons. Again, no excuses.",

They're still after him. But he needs money. He needs transportation, he needs food. The longer he's out there, the more desperate he becomes. And of course, I heard the reporter mentioned the possibility of carjacking or whatever. But he does need transportation. He's going to have to find a way to get out of this immediate area.

And we heard from President Biden saying there's going to be deep cooperation and investment in cloud computing, semiconductors and the AI industry.

This is also America shoring up its alliances, its friends countering Chinas influence and assertiveness in the Indo Pacific region. Vietnam is a key player in that.

He's had 81 national players go on strike and refuse to play for him. And then on Friday the Spanish prosecutor opening those criminal proceedings and he has remained defiant. And the manner in this of this resignation has certainly not won him any more fans. It hasn't placated the people calling for him to resign.You know, a headline grabbing television interview with this statement where he has continued to maintain his innocence. There is no mention of the Women's World Cup winning side. There is no apology or mention of Jenni Hermoso. There's no acknowledgment of any wrongdoing. Let me read you some of it. It says: It's evidence I can't continue in my position. To insist in waiting around and holding on to that won't contribute anything positive, neither to the Federation nor to Spanish football. Among other things, because there are actual powers which will prevent my return. My daughters, my family, the people who love me have suffered the effects of excessive persecution as well as many falsehoods. But it's also true that on the street, more and more everyday, the truth is prevailing. He has said he's going to continue to fight. The Spanish prosecutors will continue their investigation. The Spanish Football Federation will be looking for a new man in charge. But what we're talking about here is now so much bigger than just one man. The Spanish players have been talking about wanting a cultural change. That's what has become the wider topic of conversation in Spain as a whole. And one line in the statement referring to the World Cup bid that Spain have on the table for 2030, alongside Morocco and Portugal, perhaps suggests the real reason behind this move from him now.
