Justices today heard oral arguments in two cases challenging Biden's plan. The Biden administration argued that, yeah, they have the power to forgive financial loans in order to protect Americans from financial harms brought on by the COVID pandemic. Six Republican states and a conserve advocacy group, however, questioned Biden's authority to do so, without Congress play anything role. And they also asked whether it was fair to relieve those loans when so many other Americans had already paid theirs off, or did not take any loans.

One Ukrainian soldier tells CNN the street fight there is, quote, much worse than reported. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy's troops attempt to cling to that symbolic city in areas that Ukraine has liberated from the Russians, there is still dangerous work to be done. CNN's Alex Marquardt takes us now near the front lines where so many unexploded mines litter the ground, it could take literally decades to clear them all. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The hulking armored mine clearer lurches into an open field. Over 40 tons, it spews exhaust. Its tracks struggling across the muddy ground. Following close behind, the mine clearance team called sappers. They advance deliberately on the hunt for deadly explosives. This is delicate work. This was a Russian position, Russian trenches. And now, these guys are working through here carefully, methodically, looking for mines, for booby traps and even Ukrainian ordnance, those fired at the Russians who were here. Last September, a Ukrainian counter-offensive pushed the Russians out of these trenches. Now, Colonel Maksym Melnyk's team has been charged with clearing any remaining explosives. They have left many traps behind, and many of our brothers, our sappers have died, Melnyk says. Russia doesn't obey national conventions. They put mines on top of mine, leave booby traps and use banned mines. Russian and Ukrainian mines are scattered throughout the eastern front, making Ukraine one of the biggest mine fields in the world. Rockets and other explosives can often fail to detonate when they land too. All of it posing immense danger to civilians. The sappers of Ukraine's DSNS emergency service, like Eduard Herasimenko who has a daughter of a 10-year-old daughter are keenly aware of the danger. It's dangerous for everybody, he says. I wouldn't say we take more risks than others. Everybody is taking risks now. Herasimenko was demining before the war started. Seeing what Russia has done to his country infuriates him. They are just animals, he says. There is no other way to describe them. He finds and carries an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade to the side. Working day after day all across this country, deminers know how much they still have left to do. After the war, the soldiers get to go home. But your work will continue for years. We will keep working for decades, Colonel Melnyk says. This will go on for decades. Alex Marquardt, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
