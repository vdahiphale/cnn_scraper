I'm Nick Watt live in Los Angeles.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Israel released details of the deaths of three Israeli hostages killed by IDF soldiers but says operations in Gaza will continue. Thousands rally in the streets, calling for negotiations with Hamas to resume to bring the remaining hostages home. And the number of homeless Americans has reached an all-time high. A 12 percent increase in just one year. We look into the how and the why. We begin in Israel where the families of some hostages held in Gaza are demanding a new plan to bring them home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to suggest that talks could be under way in an effort to get more hostages released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You saw thousands gathering in the renamed hostages square, which is opposite the Israeli Ministry of Defense's headquarters. There is disbelief that something like this could happen. And I think this is really for them just kind of heaping trauma upon on top of the trauma of October the 7th, when Hamas carried out that terrorist attack and kidnapped those Israelis and some foreign workers as well. So, they want the government to do more.

Their brutality was there for everyone to see on October 7th, the beheadings, the burnings alive, the shootings, terrible, terrible, gruesome violence that they inflicted. We have no illusions about who we're dealing with. They're not going to release hostages because they've suddenly become humanitarians, on the contrary.

This was their first time doing this kind of case. But I think what this case does is it sends a message to those in the church's H.Q. and central government of the church that financial mismanagement, misconduct, is going to be cracked down on seriously. And the pope, who marks his 87th birthday today and is almost approaching 11 years as the papacy, I think it's a moment to see that there have been important steps taken to tackle this long-running problem, but also that there's still a lot more to do.

An Israeli Army spokesperson says two drones were launched from inside Lebanon on Saturday. One was intercepted and the other struck Israeli positions killing one soldier and wounding two others. Hezbollah claimed on social media that they targeted Israeli soldiers in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's military says they responded by targeting Hezbollah positions in Southern Lebanon.

      "sentences": "A U.S. Navy ship shooting down 14 drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, this according to U.S. Central Command, this is the latest in a series of attacks by Houthi militants on apparent U.S. targets and on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that the group says is in response or in retribution for the Israeli war inside of Gaza.The Houthis are a broadly Iran-aligned militant group that U.S. officials believe are opportunistically seizing the moment to try to cast themselves in the region and at home as defenders of the Palestinian cause. They're not under direct command and control from Iran, but Iran does offer them weapons, training, funding. The issue for the United States here is that while they are deeply concerned about securing shipping in the Bab al Mandab Strait and beyond, so that the global economy isn't impacted, they also want to avoid a situation where the Israel-Hamas conflict sucks in Iran and the United States directly. So far, U.S. officials believe that Iran is calibrating its response to the Israeli invasion of Gaza by allowing proxy groups to launch attacks on the United States and Israeli-linked targets up to a certain threshold, but not beyond. That's why in part that you have seen the U.S. act with restraint so far and avoid responding directly to these Houthi attacks. They're trying to keep the situation from escalating. U.S. officials also largely believe that they're capable of dealing with many of these Houthi-launched munitions. They have repeatedly shot down one-way drones, homegrown Houthi ballistic missiles, aren't seen as especially accurate, and the cruise missiles, a little bit more accurate, but it's not clear that they could actually sink a ship. So, in this situation, it's likely that the Houthis were trying to use what's known as a swarm tactic, launching multiple drones to try to confuse and overcome U.S. air defenses by sheer numbers. Clearly, it doesn't appear that this worked in this instance. So, I think the thing to watch here will be at what point does the Biden administration consider that these ongoing attacks from the Houthis have become so risky to international shipping that they can't go unanswered. At this point, not clear that that threshold has been reached. Katie Bo Lillis, CNN, Washington.",

The lines are open 24 hours a day. If you live elsewhere, you can go to findahelpline.com.And now for a closer look at the drug ketamine and the role it played in the death of Friends star Matthew Perry back in October. The autopsy revealed he died from, quote, the acute effects of ketamine and subsequent drowning. Perry was found unconscious in the hot tub of his home in Pacific Palisades, California. According to the autopsy report, the star had been receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety a week-and-a-half prior to his death. I want to bring in family physician Dr. Scott Miscovich. He joins us from Kailua, Hawaii. First of all, Doctor, can you just give us a little bit of the history of this drug? I mean, as I understand it, it's an anesthetic, mainly been around since the 60s. DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, FAMILY PHYSICIAN:  Yes, it really is. It's one of those things that we all kind of look at and tilt our heads with all the advancements in medicine. And this was used back in the 60s, developed in Michigan, and it was an anesthetic that some of the findings they had, they ended up coining it as a dissociative anesthetic. Because one of the things that people complained of is they felt attached from their body, and hence they gave it the term a dissociated feeling. That's followed it throughout. And it was used probably successfully in the Vietnam War in the field for rapid anesthesia for the unfortunate soldiers in the field. After that, there were so many other better things that came up. It just kind of faded away until -- there was always small studies, but, eventually, 2019, we had some pretty solid studies out of Harvard and Johns Hopkins that kind of resurrected it again.",

They've tried all the oral medicines and they were usually picking out people that were literally having active suicidal ideation, and that their lives were just -- couldn't -- they had no feeling of worth and they were often contemplating suicide.Now, people would have seen one of the alternatives on T.V. shows. And that was a lot of these people would have proceeded on with what we call ECT or electroconvulsive therapy, where they're hooked up and they're put into a convulsive and shaking. I mean, so when you now have a medicine like ketamine to replace that type of aggressive treatment with really good success, it really started to take off. And I do have patients that are using it. And it really -- when used effectively, it's a terrific medication.",

Well, one of the reasons it's used I.V. is it was used as an anesthetic that rapidly gets into your bloodstream within about 45 minutes and it fades out. So, that was no way near his system and it was gone. They did find it. It was in his stomach and the half life for oral ingestion, it's about four to four and a half hours.And put this in perspective. They found 3,540 nanograms of medicine in his blood. Normally, it takes about 2,000 for anesthesia. So, he basically had enough of that medication in him to be anesthetized. So, that's not something you want to be having in your system and being around a swimming pool or behind a wheel of a car or walking along a steep edge.",

It's still not used as much as some of the other things, like ecstasy and things in the clubs, but it is definitely being used and it's being used in the standard forms where it will be snorted, it will be smoked, it will be put into drinks.And so, unfortunately, in the club scene, we've seen that it's common in the 18 to 25-year-old age group and it is unfortunately a date rape drug because it also has this amnestic feeling with it, where after you have enough of it, people will not remember what happened. So, you know, I feel strongly we need to have a better look at this in our FDA to start saying, you know, where is it and is it being used safely.",
