So, what does that tell us about the urgency of the president's message.Florida's six-week abortion ban turning up the heat on Donald Trump. He's a Florida resident. How will he vote when it is on the ballot there? New reporting this morning about how his campaign is working behind the scenes to address it. And then $30 million in cash stolen. New clues in one of the biggest heist in history. I'm John Berman, with Sara Sidner and Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR: In just a few hours President Biden is fully prepared to express his anger and frustrations to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a crucial phone call today. A call people close to Biden say will be very important in the next step for U.S.-Israel relation. And we've just learned that this meeting was not previously on the books and was scheduled after an Israeli airstrike killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. This will be the first time the two allies will be speaking since those deaths. A CNN analysis of the aftermath video found that the attack may have consisted of multiple precision strikes. The team was traveling through a deconflicted zone. They had coordinated their movements with the IDF. And Israel claims the strike was unintentional. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Arlette, what is the Biden strategy today? We know we've been hearing behind the scenes that he is outraged.",

Now on Tuesday, Trump surprised his own campaign when he promised to make a statement on abortion next week. Of course, people who have followed him for years know he has often promised to release something. He never does. His tax returns, for instance.Over the last several months, Trump has seemed to test different messages on abortion, hinting he would support a 15 week ban, other times being more vague. CNN's Alayna Treene is with us now. So, what exactly is the Trump campaign doing now?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, John, it's really interesting because this is something that Donald Trump has struggled with for over a year and throughout his time on the campaign trail. And it's an issue that, of course, Donald Trump and his campaign recognized is going to be a top vulnerability for both him and Republicans overall as they look forward to November.And you're totally right, Donald Trump hasn't been very clear on what his position is. He's really tried to have it both ways and tow the line. To some people he says, look, I'm taking credit for the overturning of Roe versus Wade. It wouldn't have happened without me stacking the Supreme Court with three conservative justices. But then in other times he publicly and privately acknowledges that the issue is a political loser, especially in a general election. And that's why we've really seen this waffling from him over the past several months. Now, my conversations with Donald Trump's team is that over that time period they had been quietly working behind the scenes, his policy team, to craft some sort of policy on it. However, they hadn't really had any plans to roll that out anytime soon. And that's why when Donald Trump said earlier this week that he was going to be making a statement on abortion next week, it did catch some of his team off- guard. Take a listen to how he's been putting it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Pretty soon I'm going to be making a decision. And I would like to see if we could do that or all how - I would like to see if we could make both sides happy.",

Anthony Pro-life, all of them pressuring him to clarify his position on abortion.However, once he became the Republican nominee and secured enough delegates for that, his team recognized that there is some sort of vulnerability there, why don't you just keep continuing to be vague on this issue? However, they also recognize that he can't avoid it forever and it's probably better to come out sooner with that specific language rather than later.",

And they discussed it there. She's really been encouraging him to take a stance on a specific threshold, a specific amount of weeks for when abortion should no longer be allowed. And that's why you're sort of hearing him run out these ideas. Maybe 15 weeks. Maybe 16 weeks.He's also been talking to Lindsey Graham. I spoke with the senator yesterday over the phone and he was telling me, look, Donald Trump wants to reach a consensus. He wants both sides to be happy. And he argues, Lindsey Graham argues, that that is around 15 or 16 weeks. He's also been talking to a lot of pro-life leaders, anti-abortion groups. People like Ralph Reed, one of his close friends who heads up an evangelical organization. A lot of these people, again, who helped get him elected in 2016. Remember, this was a key issue in 2016 that helped Donald Trump make it into the White House. These are the people who are saying, you need to clarify this. But again, there's also his advisers internally who are telling him, you need to be careful with this issue because it is such a vulnerable issue. John.",

And my heart goes out to their families on this.Look, American policy has actually been for a very long time that we do not provide military aid to people or countries that are in violation of international law or domestic U.S. law. And our laws are clear that anyone engaged in combat has to be careful about civilian life and has to give access to humanitarian aid. Prime Minister Netanyahu is clearly not doing that. And people have tried to give him a lot of space. He is not doing it and he must be held accountable. We need four things to happen, and we need them to happen now. A ceasefire, the hostages need to be returned, humanitarian aid has to be opened up, and America needs to be pushing the parties toward a two-state solution where everyone has the opportunity for self- determination for security and living with dignity going forward.",

The judge rejected his last- ditch effort to postpone the trial, writing, quote, \"the fact that the defendant waited until a mere 17 days prior to the scheduled trial date of March 25, 2024, to file the motion raises real questions about the sincerity and actual purpose of the motion.
