Well, when Donald Trump was in Washington, D.C. last week, one of the promises he made to lawmakers was not just to help the people in the room get reelected this fall. But also many of the candidates that they're hoping will get elected and can help them expand their majority. Remember, they have a very slim majority right now, it's very hard forMike Johnson to get done a number of the priorities that Republicans had hoped. They also don't have the Senate. And so, what Donald Trump wants out of this is he wants to make sure if he is elected in the fall, that he has the power within Congress big enough majorities that they can help him implement that agenda. And also, not push back on some of the big things that he's been planning. And we've been hearing him talk about for the past year or so -- year or so now. Now, the other thing I'm also told is after Donald Trump's conviction in the Manhattan trial and 34 counts of falsifying business records. Days later, he called up Mike Johnson and he ranted to him about how he wants Republicans in Congress to do more to wage war on Democrats. Donald Trump is still very much caught up with this idea of retribution. It's something we heard some of his allies talk about this weekend in Detroit at a conservative conference. And so, that's the other part of this. It's very hard as well for Mike Johnson with such a slim majority to try and push back on Democrats because he doesn't have that much power with such small numbers. And so, a lot of this is planning out how Donald Trump can help them win in November.",

However, he is still having these policy discussions with his team, gaming out how to respond to certain questions. We know last week after he had met with House and Senate Republicans in Washington, D.C. He actually held a policy discussion meeting with Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Eric Schmitt. They talked about January 6th itself, thinking that that's probably something that will come up at the debate.

But the bottom line is, the Biden campaign has struggled to break through this idea, sort of comparing the two and, you know, some call it Trump amnesia, that people have forgotten some of the exact things that Trump did in office, some of the chaos. So, they're trying to raise that point. But, look, this has been the subject of much discussion among Democrats, among operatives and elected officials I've talked to, should they be spending so much time talking about Donald Trump or should they be talking about the Biden agenda, his accomplishments? We'll see. But they're making a very big decision here to try and use these summer months going into debate to try and get people to focus on some of the negatives of Trump.

They do it all the time trying to point out that, you know, you're not being fair here.So, some of it is just the advent of social media. Some of it, its infighting, you know, just for the sake of, you know, sort of getting people to think about the coverage a little bit more. But the point is, do voters care about this? My thought is no, the voters I talked to in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, other swing states and beyond. They don't necessarily are even online following how the candidates are being covered. So, sure, there can be disputes about how much time President Biden gets on the air, are we covering Trump too much, these things are always the decisions every day.
