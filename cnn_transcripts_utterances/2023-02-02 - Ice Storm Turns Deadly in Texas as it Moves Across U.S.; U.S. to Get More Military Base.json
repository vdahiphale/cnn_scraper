And if you are just joining us, me bring you up-to-date with our top stories this hour.The FBI completed a search of President Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth, Delaware on Wednesday but found no classified documents. The White House reiterated the president is cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation. And the district attorney investigating the death of Tyre Nichols says up to 20 more hours of video footage from the night of Nichols' brutal police beating has yet to be released. The northeastern U.S. is preparing for a brutal cold snap to sweep in as a deadly ice storm in the south slowly comes to an end. This video was taken near San Antonio where the ice coating power lines that it's knocking the lines into trees and then causing small fires. According to poweroutage.us, more than 375,000 homes and businesses across the state are without electricity right now. At least three people have died in Texas from dangerous road conditions as the snow, freezing rain and sleet continue to fall making travel treacherous. But the ice has led to a few surprises.

The outage brought busy terminals to a standstill and temporarily halted passenger screenings. Air traffic control reportedly was not affected by the blackout but there were some apparent disruptions to departing flights. The White House wants do away with the extra fees that airlines can charge families for sitting together on flights. It can amount to as much as $200 in extra charges on some carriers. And the Transportation Department has already urged airlines to allow children younger than 13 to sit next to an adult family member for no additional costs. But the White House is now calling on lawmakers to fast-track those efforts as part of its Junk Fee Protection Act. The proposed bill also targets all other kinds of charges that the White House says are unnecessarily draining money from consumers. Among them hidden fees slapped on entertainment tickets bought online and credit card late fees which officials hope to slash from an average of $31 to $8. President Biden said that the bill would give breathing room to American families especially those that are already struggling to pay their bills. And the U.S. will get access to four more military bases in the Philippines. Part of an effort to increase cooperation between the two countries.
