President-elect Trump's former pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, is defending himself as the House Ethics Committee is expected to release the results of a years-long investigation into his alleged misconduct by the end of the week. Sources tell CNN members voted in secret this month to release the findings of the probe after initially voting against that in November. In a lengthy post, the former Florida congressman stressed that the Justice Department did not charge him after looking into allegations that he had sex with an underage girl, illicit drug use, and other improprieties. He writes in part, quote, \"My 30s were an era of working very hard - and playing hard too. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\" Let's discuss this and more with Congressman Larry Bucshon. He's a Republican from Indiana. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. When this came before the full Congress earlier this month, you voted against releasing the ethics report on Gaetz. What's your response to hearing that the Ethics Committee has now voted to release it and that that includes Republicans who changed their mind? REP. LARRY BUCSHON (R-IN): Well, I voted against it because there's only been a couple of other cases in recent history where a former member had an Ethics Committee report released after they were no longer a member of Congress. So it was procedurally a problem for me. You know, the Ethics Committee can change their mind. I'm not part of the Ethics Committee and if they vote to release it, that's up to them. And so we'll see what happens. I think it will be one of the few times that that has been done. And so I understand why this is a difficult issue for the Ethics Committee.",

You can violate House ethics rules but not do things that are criminally prosecutable. So those are two separate issues. In the other case, you know, I think that it seems that the Trump transition team might have been blindsided a little bit with the DOD nominee, but I'm not privy to that conversation, so I wouldn't know. But I'm fully confident that they can vet people. But on the other hand, you know, sometimes people have to tell them up front.

And if they don't buy it, they're still giving them a chance to convict him of kind of a more conventional homicide followed by a bunch of weapons charges.But the key to it is he was arrested with, allegedly, a letter - a claim of responsibility where he talks about taking out the head of the biggest health insurance company to send a message to these \"parasites,\" quote-unquote, and to intimidate the industry, which, if you flip that to say, what if the target had been the Israeli ambassador instead of the president of UnitedHealthcare?

Knowing exactly what he's doing, exactly what this person, meaning the CEO, where he would be, calling him a bean counter, talking about it, sending a message. But that very moment of the crime, he had a mental break? I just don't know that you buy that or jurors will buy that. What I am concerned about though, Boris and Brianna, is whether there will be jury nullification in this case. What does that mean? Now, many people may think, what are you talking about, jury nullification? He did it, it's clear, right? The evidence is compelling. Not so fast. This person is being called, the defendant I'm speaking of, Luigi Mangione, he's being called saint, right? Saint Nick, saint, you know, the - he's being given sainthood, right? It's unbelievable. Saint Luigi is what they're calling him. They're selling trinkets about him. People are buying into his narrative. If you went through - if you see social media, they're like, well, hey, you know, maybe I should have done it instead. It's about time. So there is a concern that the jurors, given the problems we're having with the healthcare system, the extent of the cost, the fact that, you know, many people are denied, right? As we look there, right, 157 deposits in his commissary, many people in custody would be very glad to have commissaries, right? To be able to buy anything. He's getting emails. He's getting, you know, pieces of mail. This all buys into the notion of him being a little different, the times being a little different, this case being a little different. And if ever there was a case that a juror, right, may hang up on this case, meaning they may either hang the jury as a mistrial or potentially say, you know what, nothing to see here.

We're in different times. We're in times that there's a lot of distrust against government, where there's a feeling that society's not working for everyone, where people are not living in the manner in which they believe they should be living. We saw that in the last election. And so the issue is, is there any carryover with respect to people's feelings, their emotions, their ability to support their families, their ability to believe that corporate America is corporately responsible and cares about them. Is there a carryover onto that jury? If I'm a prosecutor, I'm concerned about that, but I'm going to make every argument I can to say this case is about this case, these facts, these circumstances and his guilt.
