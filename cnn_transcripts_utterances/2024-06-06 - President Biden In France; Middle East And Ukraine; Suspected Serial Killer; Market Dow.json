This is video of the aftermath. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza says that 6,000 people were sheltering at the school when it was hit without warning. The Israeli military confirms it carried out the strike saying it was targeting a Hamas compound operating inside the school. Meantime, conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate. The U.N. is now warning that half of Gaza's population is expected to face death and starvation by mid-July. And we want you to take a look at this number, 90%. According to a new report by UNICEF, about 90% of children in Gaza are experiencing severe food poverty. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following the latest developments live from Jerusalem. Jeremy, let's start with the strike on the school. What more are you learning?",

The Israeli military says that 20 to 30 militants were in this U.N. school turned shelter where thousands of displaced Palestinians were living. They say that these militants were actively planning attacks on Israeli troops that they used precision munitions to target them in this shelter. But they also said that they weren't aware of any civilian casualties. But that just does not square with what we are seeing on the ground, which is to say that according to hospital records from Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital where the bodies of the deceased were brought as well as the wounded from this strike, 14 children were among those killed, the youngest four years old, and nine women were also among the deceased. Meaning that the majority of the 40 people killed, according to hospital records, were indeed women and children.This is not the first time, of course, that a U.N. school or any U.N. compound in general has been targeted inside of Gaza. UNRWA, which is the main U.N. agency in Gaza, says that 180 of its facilities at least have been targeted since the beginning of this war. And the UNRWA chief, Philippe Lazzarini, also saying that targeting those premises or using them for military purposes, as Israel is accusing Hamas of doing, is simply unacceptable and cannot become the new norm. But this is also, of course, there is a bigger story in central Gaza, which is one of an uptick in Israeli attacks there, uptick in Israeli airstrikes. 168 people, according to hospital records, were killed this week alone in central Gaza.

And today, he joined other world leaders in Normandy to commemorate eight decades since D-Day. On June 6th, 1944, thousands of Americans were among the coalition of allied forces that stormed the beaches of Nazi Afghanistan. And the first of those was the German army that occupied France during World War II. And their successful landing that day marked a major turning point that ultimately led to Germany's defeat the following year. Now, 80 years later, Biden met with some of the last remaining U.S. veterans who fought on D-Day. All of them are around 100 years old now. In his remarks, the president stressed the importance of defending democracy, and he warned about the threats that it's facing around the world.

About 180 American World War II veterans were on hand today, made the journey to Normandy for this D-Day commemoration, including about 41 who were actually part of that Normandy campaign. And the president used the backdrop of Normandy to make the argument that there need to be strong alliances around the world in order to continue to fight against dark forces that are trying to thwart democracy and freedom. And he warned about the threat that isolationism poses to the world order. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago, is not the answer today. We know the dark forces that these heroes fought against 80 years ago. They never fade. Aggression and greed, the desire to dominate and control, to change borders by force. These are perennial.

Now, the White House says that he will be using this site to really try to make his case against isolationism, the need to preserve democracy. The president also is at some point expected to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It would be the two men's first meeting since the U.S., since that additional aid to the country, and comes really, as the White House says, that they are in an inflection point, not just in the war in Ukraine, but also other international matters, including the war in Gaza.",

You know, most of the heroes never get medals. They're the ones who died. No one reports it. No one knows. And that's just a sad fact of war. But this celebration reminds us of Americans pulling together, really coming together, to change history. And we did. That was the greatest generation.

And the generations that have come after the greatest generation, they didn't understand the gift that was given to them. They didn't have to pay the price for it. We got rid of the draft, for example, in the early 1970s. So, what is the obligation of an American to help other Americans? You go to church and they say you should treat your brother and sister as you'd want to be treated, but what's the obligation? And so that civic obligation, except to pay taxes and obey the law, it's not there anymore. That's part of it. Part of it is there's a lot of Russian mischief in the American political system today. We know this. We know our own politics is one of the, has to be considered one of the, the theaters of conflict. When you hear what Putin says, and then you hear what some people in politics say that echoes that talking point, everything from supporting Ukraine is hopeless to the American justice system is no good.Those are persistent. Before Russia, they were persistent Soviet talking points. And for years and years, for decades, the Soviet Union tried to plant stories and get Americans to use their propaganda lines. Usually it failed because they didn't have the means to get the false information into the United States. Now they do. And those, that false information, disinformation, Soviet propaganda, Russian propaganda lines are out there all over our airways. It's hard for Americans who don't travel abroad, haven't seen the devastation of war, don't understand the fear that people in Europe have of Russian resurgence. They don't understand this. You have to talk to people who've lived under Soviet domination to understand what that really means. The Ukrainians do understand it, and that's why they're fighting the way they're fighting.",

Stick with me for this, because we kind of have to go through a couple things. The timeline that's laid out in some of Hallie Biden's testimony to the prosecution today and what that account is going to mean for whether the jury thinks Hunter Biden lied about his drug use when he bought the gun. If we remember that he purchased the gun October 12th, eight days before that, Hallie Biden texted him, I'm afraid you're going to die. Prosecutors asked if she was afraid of him dying from an overdose. She said, maybe suicide. I didn't know. Then 11 days after the gun purchase, that's when she discovered the gun in his vehicle. She was cleaning it out where she also found remnants of crack cocaine and related paraphernalia. How do you think the jury sees all of these data points?HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Wow, it really is a kind of a dark and tawdry tale. I think they obviously-she's given she is the star witness, as Paula says, and she's given each side something. So I think they will see that Hunter was generally using during this period. She finds paraphernalia just a few days after. On the other, he's hoping to make a kind of technical but also sympathetic defense that says, you know, there's a reasonable doubt about whether he thought he was lying when he says on the 18th not a user and they haven't come forward with proof. And this is probably their best shot. I don't think Hunter will testify to come forward with proof that on that fateful day, he would have been lying when he said, I'm not a user. That's the form the language on form 3383 of drugs. You know, it's a bit of a combined hyper-technical, but also sympathetic defense. The whole thing is so kind of, you know, tawdry and sad that, you know, possibly Abby Lowell, his lawyer, hopes that plays to their advantage.",

You know, there are reasons that this case maybe shouldn't have been brought or not in its form in the first place. But those reasons no longer play in front of the jury.
