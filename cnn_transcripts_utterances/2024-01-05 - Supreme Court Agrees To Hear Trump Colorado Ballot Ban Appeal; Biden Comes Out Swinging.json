The justices now poised to decide whether or not Trump is eligible for office under the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban.Also breaking, President Biden comes out swinging at Trump in his first campaign speech of 2024, warning the former president is a real and present danger to American democracy three years after January 6th. We're breaking down the president's remarks and Trump's message at a campaign event in Iowa tonight. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin tonight with breaking news, the United States Supreme Court teeing up one of the most consequential cases in decades, Donald Trump's removal from the Colorado ballot as his eligibility is being challenged in states all across the country. Our legal and political team is here with more analysis, but I want to start with CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, how significant is this and how will this unfold?",

      "sentences": "Wolf, this is the most significant election related case before the court since Bush v. Gore. They have accepted a request from Trump's legal team to determine if the Colorado Supreme Court improperly removed Trump from the ballot.Now, the biggest question here is whether Section 3 of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the so called insurrectionist ban, that bars those who engage in insurrection from holding public office, if that applies to presidents, that is a question that has divided judges even within the same state of Colorado. Another issue they may have to weigh in on is, well, how is that executed? Is that something the states should handle or is there a rule for Congress? Now, the way the Trump team has framed this case, they are arguing that this is a request to return the choice of candidate to voters. But the challengers are arguing that the so-called insurrectionist ban applies to Trump and that he should be barred from holding future office because of what occurred on January 6. How will this all play out? Well, one source close to this case tells me they're giving it the, quote, Full Monty. They have a briefing schedule. They're going to have oral arguments on February 6th, and then, of course, they will issue a decision. But what's not clear is whether that decision will come in time to offer clarity for Super Tuesday, because while that is on March 5th, the ballots are mailed out weeks in advance. And a lot of the folks here involved in this case have been pushing for clarity ahead of these primaries. But, Wolf, the one thing that all the parties, Trump, the Republican Party, the challengers, all agree on is that time is of the essence here.",

First of all, I do not expect the Supreme Court to address the issue of insurrection, whether Donald Trump did or did not engage in insurrection. That's not the kind of thing the U.S. Supreme Court normally does. They're not a fact-finding body.I expect them to deal with the procedural and constitutional questions, too, in particular. First of all, is it up to Congress to pass laws telling us how the 14th Amendment works, or is it up to the states to figure it out on their own? If the Supreme Court decides this is only up to Congress, that will end the Colorado challenge, put Trump back on the ballot in Colorado, and effectively end all the challenges we've seen all across the country. And I think the second issue is, does the 14th Amendment apply to the president as a, quote, officer of the United States? Again, if they answer that, no, it does not apply to the president. That ends the Colorado case. That ends all the other cases around the country. Wolf, this will be historic, no matter which way they come out. They will answer questions that have been around the 14th Amendment for over a century, and it will determine how we vote in 2024 and moving forward.",

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Wolf, this has been one of the cases that they're actually the least worried about, at least when it comes to the legal team. And I was told this was because of what they had seen in courts across the country. They're wanting to not take this issue up. They believe that this is one of the most solid legal cases that they have. However, we did hear from one of Trump's lawyers who indicated there might be another reason they were so confident.

He believes that it's possible that some of these Supreme Court justices will rule against him so as not to seem, quote/unquote, pro-Trump that he believes that that could even be people who had -- who were appointed by him in the first place.

As I said earlier, that's a question that has divided judges even within the same state. The other question is, well, all right, how does that operate? Is that something that the states should be deciding? What is the rule of the courts, or is there a rule for Congress? Now, there's also this question of, did former President Trump engage in an insurrection? As one of the other panelists said earlier, it's highly unlikely they're going to want to wade into that.

While the Colorado and Maine decisions throwing Trump off the ballot have made the most headlines recently, those are two of about two dozen or so challenges that have been made across the country, virtually all of them other than Colorado and Maine have been rejected. Even in Colorado, you had a seven-justice state Supreme Court, they're all appointed by Democrats. Even that was 4-3.

And I think Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Elena Kagan, could be real partners with the chief justice in trying to figure out the best way forward. So, that's where I would put Brett Kavanaugh is someone who really is not trying to shake up anything here.Now, Neil Gorsuch has a very distinct approach. He is someone who -- he succeeded Antonin Scalia, and he has had a very distinctive, textualist, originalist approach. I am sure he will be very deep into the history of the 14th Amendment, as all of them will be. But he is someone who has always taken a little more of a conservative, limited approach to the scope of the provisions of the Constitution. And then, finally, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, our most recent Trump appointee, who came on in 2020, succeeding Ruth Bader Ginsburg and so much changing this court, she also has been a little bit tentative on things, so that I actually think the three of them, in their own distinct ways, will try to continue putting their own signatures on this kind of case.

I think the other thing that part of this, and this goes to some of what Kate said, one of the most important constituencies here is the most active progressive Democrats, who right now aren't really enthusiastic about voting for Joe Biden.

It also is probably a message that works well with your most persuadable voters, those voters in the suburbs.

They're criminals.What they're doing with voters and what they're doing with the weaponization of the system and elections, what they're doing is incredible. I mean, I've gotten indicted more than Al Capone. Do you know Al Capone, Scarface, you know? He had a scar from here to here, and he didn't get it. I always say playing tiddly-wings, right? He was a rather rough guy, and if he had dinner with you, he didn't like the way you smiled, they'd shoot you the next day. You'd get killed probably the next night. But you'd be gone. He got indicted less than me. I got indicted because they said we had a rigged election, and it turned out I was right. It was rigged much worse than anybody thought. But unlike every other candidate in this race with me, you know, in your heart that I will always put America first. We put America first. And with God's help, our job will get done. Victories cannot come soon enough for our country. As we speak, the last remnants of our open and broken border are crumbling into rubble, as millions and millions of people storm into the United States in the largest illegal mass migration in the history of the world. Look, there's never been a country in the world, third world country, banana republic, there's never been anything like what you're watching on television, and they pretend like they've got it under control. Last month they set a record, hundreds of thousands of people, bigger than practically any city in your great state. I think bigger just about than any city came in just last month, and numbers like nobody -- and they pretend like it's under control. It's not under control. It's totally out of control. And part of the reason they want them to come in is, in my opinion, because, look, they're not stupid. Anybody that can cheat on an election like that is not stupid, okay, because their professionals are cheating. But anybody that can cheat like that, they're not stupid people. So there's two things, and then a third. Number one, they're stupid. Number two -- right? Number two, they hate our country. And number three, they want those people to vote, and that's a bad one. That's the one that scares us most. And I'm telling you, they're signing people. That's what they're doing. And I believe now that that's why they're allowing these people to come in. People that don't speak our language, they're signing them up to vote. And I believe that's why you're having millions of people pour into our country, and it could very well affect the next election. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

No, the election was not rigged and there were all of these court cases, and that's been proven, he's just -- he's going to live in this world where he continues to sell the falsehoods of the 2020 election and continues to promise to govern in an undemocratic way should he win the presidency again.Again, that -- trying to flip the script on Biden on the threat of democracy, again, it has appeal because when you look at the polling, this notion of democracy is actually very -- and elections, it is very important to both Republicans and Democrats for totally different reasons. And he sees an opening there to galvanize support on his side. The whole weaponization of government, there's no proof anywhere, anywhere that the Biden administration is weaponizing the government, but he's using his own legal peril as a way to make this argument to galvanize his supporters. By the way, Ron DeSantis himself, his opponent, has said the indictments have basically altered the entire trajectory of the Republican nomination race because it has done exactly that. It's brought Republicans to Trump's defense in belief that the Biden administration -- by the way, the same Biden Justice Department that's investigating and prosecuting the president's son is the one that he claims is doing this all to get Trump out of the way, and that it is purely an election interference kind of effort. No evidence to support that.

Part of what you saw Joe Biden try to do today was to not only remind everybody about how violent it was, that was one component of his remarks where he, you know, really tried to amp up the threat that political violence is posing.He also tried to take it and draw it forward. And so, the longer Trump -- the more time Trump dedicates to, you know, talking only about 2020, as Kevin was saying, sort of, you know, relitigating the same grievances, not looking to the future, the more opening that gives Joe Biden to say, here's my vision for the future, here's the way I'm going to protect democracy, I'm going to protect your right to make reproductive health decision with your doctor and not have the government be involved, here's what I'm going to do to keep making the economy better.

I was there as Capitol police officers valiantly fought not only to protect us but our democracy, and I had a firsthand view of the very true reality, which is the president of the United States led an effort to try and stop Congress from certifying an election. Thankfully, because of the bravery of so many that day, he was unsuccessful. The insurrectionists were unsuccessful, and that is why I'm committed to ensuring we beat Donald Trump at the ballot box because he cannot in any case return to the White House.
