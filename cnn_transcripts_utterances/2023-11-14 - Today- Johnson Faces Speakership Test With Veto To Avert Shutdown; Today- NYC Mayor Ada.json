And he will need Democratic help to do it, especially now that the House Freedom Caucus, made up of conservatives, they say they are a no. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill this morning counting the votes. Where do things stand, Lauren?",

And you could have a position where Johnson loses more Republicans. And I think that is a calculation that doesn't likely put Johnson's job in jeopardy. But obviously, it is sort of a point on the board, right, as one of the very first speakers that he is coming into this, a new job, a newly minted speaker, and yet he finds himself in the exact same position that Kevin McCarthy found himself in, in fact, doing a very similar thing that got Kevin McCarthy ousted from the job.

I mean, this new House speaker, Mike Johnson, he's heard that he doesn't have the Republican votes yet. He is full steam ahead. And what if he has more Democratic support than he does Republican support? Why is he feeling so emboldened? Or is he simply looking at the calendar and saying, we got to get this done?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, he's got a couple of things that are going on. One is that he's still in a bit of a honeymoon period. The reality is if you go back to the vote that actually made him the speaker. There were of people, including some of the hardliners, who recognized that there was a lot of damage being done by simply their ability or inability to govern, that it was going to hurt some of them in their reelection bids, that it was going to cause a lot of pain and anguish.The last time there was a government shutdown was like 800,000 federal employees who had to either be furloughed or go without any certain pay date. And that hurts people all across the spectrum. And so I think there was an agreement to kind of just move it forward, kind of look the other way. Some of the problems with McCarthy were actually personal. And so they tried to settle on this compromise. And now the question is whether they're going to sort of go back and put us right back where we're again without any leadership in the Congress.",

But then they decided, all right, we're going to go ahead and let this happen after all. Does this speak to, I guess, them being those hardliners who are willing to acquiesce, or does it speak to those who are advising the new speaker?",

But they were drawing, if you remember, caustic remarks, you know, where they were being referred to in some cases as charlatans and as, you know, as a group that was going to blow up the whole Republican majority and prevent them from governing. And again, sort of draw the kind of negative condemnation on the party as a whole that would hurt all of their reelection chances. That I think is going to be the primary driver of whatever happens next. If the moderates, those who are in districts that Joe Biden won, make their voices heard more loudly and say, look, we're going to lose the entire majority if the 15 of us who are in pro-Biden districts all get wiped out next year because of what you guys are doing, what was the point of the entire exercise?",

And today, he may answer some of those questions surrounding his campaign cash and possible foreign influence when he meets with reporters today. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is at city hall with much more on this. Gloria, when asked questions about this in recent days, the mayor has continued to push to this weekly meeting with reporters, saying that's when he's going to take questions. Is he going to answer? Is he going to actually answer questions while he's under FBI investigation? What are you hearing could happen?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, we're certainly going to try and get the mayor to answer some questions, but I think he is definitely in a difficult spot. Since we last heard from the mayor, he has gotten a lawyer, and we have learned that he is under the investigation, or at least part of what the FBI is looking into, some of his contacts, his fundraisers, his donors, his campaign.So, so far, what I've heard from sources inside city hall and those who are close to the mayor is that today we will expect to hear something similar from what we have been hearing in the past several days, I've done nothing wrong. I have nothing to hide. We will cooperate with the investigation, but this is continuing to develop and getting closer and closer to the mayor. We know that the mayor's electronics were seized by the FBI last week. They presented him with a warrant in order to confiscate those electronic devices. And we know that the FBI is looking into the campaign and whether the campaign funneled donations from foreign nationals into their coffers. So the mayor has a lot to answer here. And the question really is, what did he know, when did he know it, and what did he do about it? And we are expecting to hear questions about what could possibly be on those electronic devices. The key part of all of this is that now you have the mayor facing off with reporters and probably lawyers who would probably want him to keep the information to a minimum, because if this is going to go directly to him, all of this could be used as part of that investigation. So he has to be very careful about what he says in the next several days and hopefully we will learn more details today. But certainly a lot of questions for the mayor and waiting to see just how much more this investigation continues to unfold. Kate?",
