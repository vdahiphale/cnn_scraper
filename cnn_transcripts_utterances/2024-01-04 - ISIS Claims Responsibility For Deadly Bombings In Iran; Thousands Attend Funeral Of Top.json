      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, ISIS claims responsibility for thedeadly blast in Iran which reportedly killed more than 80 people. We'll have the very latest for you on that. Then, an extremely tense situation in Lebanon as mourners attend a funeral for a top Hamas leader who was killed, if you remember, in Beirut. Plus, police say there are multiple victims after a school shooting in the U.S. state of Iowa. We'll have the very latest on that developing story. But first this evening, we begin tonight with a chaotic day right across the Middle East as a threat of a wider regional conflict looks even more serious. ISIS is now claiming responsibility for a pair of explosions that happened at a memorial for Iranian General, Qasem Soleimani on Wednesday. More than 80 people were killed in a major attack that could ripple throughout the entire region. And that's just one of several bursts of violence in Iran. Let me line it up for you there. The U.S. says it targeted a commander of an Iranian proxy group in a strike in the nation's capital on Thursday. Over in Lebanon, thousands are gathering in Beirut to mourn the death of the senior Hamas official who was killed in a suspected Israeli airstrike there on Tuesday. And this is all going on while intense fighting, of course, continues in Gaza on top of the attacks in the Red sea by the Houthis. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins me now for more on all these strands. And Nic, let's start off with the very latest lines and claims of responsibility here, because some Iranian leaders in the last 24 to 48 hours initially appeared to blame Israel for those twin attacks inside Iran, but now we have a claim of responsibility coming from ISIS. Just explain why, Nic, ISIS would target Iran and why now? What does it get out of it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and I think one of the sort of things to say here is that possibly, because ISIS hasclaimed this, it takes a little bit of heat out of the very heated situation in the Middle East right now, because it is not Israel that was behind this. It never looked like it, and now ISIS has taken responsibility for it, despite what Iran said, its president said just yesterday, that Israel was responsible and would pay a heavy price. Why would ISIS target Soleimani's commemoration? Because they see him as responsible for targeting ISIS. They see Iran as being part of a coalition of forces that tried to -- tried to kill off ISIS in Iraq and other places. So, that would be their rationale. ISIS says that they claim that they killed what they call 300 mono-atheists. Now, that's what -- a word they use when they talk about Shia -- Shias. Now, ISIS is a Sunni Muslim organization, an extremist, but they do target Shias. They have targeted Shias in Iran before. They have targeted large gatherings of civilians. They do have a track record of killing innocent people. So, the M.O. fits their M.O. There are some discrepancies in the information that they've given in their claim of responsibility. They say 300 dead, the Iranian leadership has said that it was only 84 dead. But it's not a typical of ISIS to overstate their claims. The other difference is that ISIS said it were two brothers who were the suicide bombers behind the attack, but the Iranians yesterday said that one of the bombs was in a suitcase that was detonated remotely. So, again, ISIS maybe has its narrative wrong. They haven't put up evidence so far, but also, not a typical for ISIS to claim something potentially very really big behind it, but overstate it and get some of the facts wrong intentionally or unintentionally.",

And of course, we did see that funeral procession as thousands marched towards what is the martyrs cemetery in Shatila now. For Shatila is a refugee camp established after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to be displaced after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. This is an area in Beirut where the sentiment is one of deep support for the Palestinian cause. And there were certainly deep reverence for Saleh al-Arouri, for many of those people who had gathered today, they viewed him as a symbol of Palestinian resistance. He was, of course, number two in Hamas' political bureau. He was considered one of the founders of the Al-Qassam Brigades; Hamas' military wing, but that is exactly why he was also considered a primary target for Israel. We have previously heard those warnings from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would target senior Hamas leaders wherever they are located. Now, of course, no denial, no claim of responsibility just yet from Israel. A U.S. official, however, has said and told CNN that Israel is believed to have been responsible for that strike that we saw in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Tuesday night. But again, there is mounting concern that this could trigger a broader escalation between Lebanon and between Israel. And more particular -- in particular, between Hezbollah and Lebanon. We heard yesterday, that reiteration of a warning from Hezbollah Secretary- General, Hassan Nasrallah. He spoke yesterday, warning that if Israel seeks to wage war on Lebanon, if it carries out any strikes on Lebanese territory, the response from Hezbollah, in his words, would be limitless.",

We heard from the Lebanese Foreign Minister yesterday, who said that Lebanon isn't seeking a war with Israel, that they are trying to convince Hezbollah not to wage war with Israel, and that they want peace on their southern borders. And of course, for the civilians who live around the southern borders of Beirut -- of Lebanon, there have been escalated tensions. We have seen at the outset of this war seen that near-daily exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. We've seen civilians killed on either side. We have seen journalists killed on the Lebanese side of the border while they were reporting on those escalating tensions, on the exchange of fire. For many in Lebanon, there is also mounting concern that this country could be pulled into a new phase of confrontation with Israel. Many feel that the country simply isn't in a place to see a war break out. Already dealing with its own issues and crises from the economy, from poverty, for many.

His aunt says that Mohammed's(ph) learning difficulties mean he's unable to fully grasp the horror they have left behind. \"When we call our relatives in Gaza, there are always airstrikes around them', this civilian says. \"They've been displaced over and over again.

I just hope they will be OK. That's all we can hope for in this life.\" Holding on to that hope grows more difficult with each passing day. And while the medical team here does its best to heal the physical wounds of its patients, it's clear that the emotional scars of this war run deep. \"When the patients arrive here, they all have this look in their eyes. One which makes you feel they have come out of something very difficult\", Dr. Huber(ph) says. \"It's a bit shocking for us. We're not used to seeing this look, especially from children.\" Inside Gaza, death seems near impossible to escape. And for the thousands wounded, there is no respite. The vast majority of hospitals in the Strip are no longer operational. Doctors forced to work under Israel's unrelenting airstrikes with limited medical supplies. Only a small handful of more wounded have so far been evacuated. Facilities like this are few. The evacuation process, precarious.

It is arguably Secretary Blinken's most important yet, and that is reflected in the number of stops that he's going to make. A very long list of countries all across the region in which he will be discussing not just the conflict between Israel and Hamas, but of course, the broader implications of that strike in Baghdad today. You can -- you've seen that the U.S. is trying to strike this balance of retaliating against groups that are targeting U.S. forces and coalition forces, but at the same time, trying to make sure that this conflict doesn't really expand. And so, what Blinken is going to be doing with the leaders in these regional allies is really to try to enlist them to help tamp down the tensions, communicate to groups, to communicate to Iran as best they can, to make sure that this conflict does not expand more than it already is. But as you noted, there are a number of hotspots all across the region. But of course, at the top of the priority list, Isa, is going to be what Israel -- what Secretary Blinken does in Israel. You know, Blinken is just the latest in a string of top U.S. officials to go and see Israeli officials, it's clear that the administration wants to keep top administration officials in the Israelis face. The secretary -- the State Department said earlier today that it is clear that Israel needs to do more when it comes to protecting civilians in Gaza, to getting that humanitarian aid that you and Nada were just talking about into Gaza. And perhaps most importantly, Isa, the pressure from the United States is going to be applied by Blinken to transition this fight from what has been called a high intensity phase, what we've seen for the past three months, to a lower intensity phase in which Israel would carry out more targeted operations. The U.S. has been very careful to not try to make it look like they're telling Israel what to do, but no doubt about it, they are applying significant pressure.",

You know, you have -- you've had these numerous votes at the United Nations about calling for an immediate ceasefire, which, of course, the U.S. has voted against.

There are a lot of countriesthat have been impacted by this incredibly heavy rainfall and the colder air as well. This video here from northern France, again, you can see those streets just entirely under water. And it's not an isolated thing. You've had this problem across much of northern Europe. It's the low pressure system that has since moved through, but we have this secondary one, it's bringing that additional rain. And even though the secondary system doesn't have nearly the amount of rain that the first one did, it's that exacerbation. It's that the ground is already saturated, and now you're adding more rain on top of it. But as we go through the next few days, that system will gradually move out, finally, providing those drier conditions. We still have several areas looking at medium and high weather alerts across areas of France as well as Germany and numerous other countries until that system can finally make its way out. And it will. It's eventually going to push all of that remaining moisture down south into the Mediterranean. So, more of the heavy rain will now be focused more across Italy and Greece as we finish out the rest of the weekend, finally allowing things to dry back out. You can see the forecast overall, very dry conditions across northern France and areas of Germany. The heaviest rain here going to be along the Adriatic Sea. Now, another concern we've been talking about is the incredibly cold air across many of the Scandinavian countries. Taking a look at some of these numbers, now all of these cities are located inside the Arctic Circle. But even for them, these temperatures are extreme. All of them reaching colder than minus 40 degrees. And  again, for some of these areas, it's been multiple days of these temperatures well below average. Even farther south, places like Oslo and Helsinki, not in the Arctic Circle, but still well below average even for this time of year. We are going to finally start to see that frigid air begin to move out, but it's slowly going to exit. So, you're still likely going to have several more days of these bitter cold temperatures before we start to see things rebound. Take, for example, Oslo, even through the weekend, these temperatures well below average. Talking minus 18 Saturday, minus 16 on Sunday. It's going to be next week, Isa, before we finally start to see those temperatures getting back closer to where they should be this time of year.",

He's the multimillionaire accused of sex trafficking before suicide in 2019. And it's important to note the inclusion of someone's name is not an indication of wrongdoing. More now from CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Long awaited documents finally released. The first batch of sealed court filings pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public Wednesday. The document stemmed from a civil defamation lawsuit brought in 2015 against Epstein's Former Girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Prominent figures including Prince Andrew and Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, included in a 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, a former employee of Epstein. She says in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and quote, he said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls. When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein, she said she understood Epstein had quote, dealings with Clinton. Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein and has denied any kind of criminal activity. But in 2019, he admits to having flown on Epstein's private plane but knew nothing of the financiers quote, terrible crimes. Sjoberg also recalled a time she was with Epstein on one of his planes and pilots said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffrey said, great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to, I don't recall the name of the casino but we'll go to the casino. She says in the deposition, she never gave him a massage to Trump. This is the first reference to Donald Trump but he is not accused of any wrongdoing. LISA BRYANT, DIRECTOR, \"JEFFREY EPSTEIN:  FILTHY RICH\":  Right now the only person who has been prosecuted is a woman; Ghislaine Maxwell who certainly you know should be behind bars. But it's interesting in this you know network of all these men who've been trafficking young women and underage women for decades and yet the only person that's been prosecuted you know it's a woman. There are many, many other people that you know should be held accountable as well. PROKUPECZ (voice-over):  The documents also contain excerpts of depositions taking a Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who previously reached an out of court settlement in her sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew. Giuffre alleged in her deposition, that Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people including former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, Prince Andrew and tech guru Marvin Minsky. Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell said in a statement on Wednesday, she has consistently and vehemently maintained her innocence. This is the first set of documents to be unsealed under a December 18 court order, with more expected in the coming weeks. The documents are expected to include nearly 200 names including some of Epstein's accusers, prominent business people and politicians. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, I think what we're seeing is more of this universe. People kind of telling their story in their ownwords, from what we had previously heard. Some of these stories, some of these allegations but as the women have given them to news organizations. This time, this is their testimony under oath. Shimon's piece highlighted some of the newer, specific pieces of information, because we have known these names before. So just, you know, the references of Epstein making reference to Donald Trump and Donald Trump has, you know, publicly said back in a 2002 interview with \"New York\" magazine, that he thought Epstein was a terrific guy. Then he later said that he had thrown Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago, his social club. So these connections were known. But this just provides a little bit more detail that kind of gives you a sense of the relationship between some of these men. You know, this is just the first tranche. It was 40 documents. We were expecting, you know, dozens more. You know, the names that came out in these documents, they are the names that we've heard of, the prominent men. So I'm really going to be looking to see if we see any new names that come out through the subsequent release in this kind of rolling release of documents. You know, a lot of these documents, you know, it's lawyers' legal papers. So a lot of it is kind of technical motions. We have to comb through it all to look for the actual documents that provide a little bit more information. I think that's also something that maybe there will be something about this case and how it -- it was a civil lawsuit but how it was ensued (sic), what people were doing to fight subpoenas or not fight subpoenas, just to shed a little bit more light on that world.",

They always take a little bit longer to post than you like. And whether it all comes today or if this bleeds into Friday, that's also a possibility. This is a huge volume of material. Even if we're not necessarily learning any kind of bombshells from it, it's still this breadth of material that was obtained through the course of this litigation.",
