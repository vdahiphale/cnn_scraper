Judge Scott McAfee announcing he will allow the proceedings to be broadcast live on the court's YouTube channel. Let's talk about all this with CNN national security and justice reporter Zachary Cohen; columnist Josh Rogin of \"The Washington Post\". CNN political commentator Karen Finney is with us; and Matt Gorman, who is former senior advisor for Tim Scott's presidential campaign. Good morning to all of you. Thank you, guys, for being here. Zach, let's walk through your latest reporting on what we're going to see here. And I got to tell you, I think the big-picture question for a lot of people is just whether or not we're going to see this trial start before the election.",

She's already asked for a trial to start on August 5th. That obviously would put it before the 2024 election. But McAfee has not answered her request. He has not said one way or the other whether or not he will schedule something, put it on the calendars if Fani Willis is pushing him and might push them again publicly to put something on the calendar.",

She has defended herself very aggressively.But on the other hand, there was an opening given to the Trump team; and they tried to take full advantage of it. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Absolutely. Look, you are prosecuting the former president of the United States. And you need to be holier than thou, or cleaner than possible. And she's showed extraordinarily bad judgment through this entire process. And then she was she was caught on that. And it has given an opening, because again, the audience here for Trump isn't necessarily the jury. It's, in a lot of ways, the American voter. And so helping to muddy the water and give a possible taint to this trial, which I think, if you asked a lot of Republicans eight months ago, this was one of the ones they were more worried about. Less so, say, the Alvin Bragg one starting up a little -- next month. This, and maybe the documents case were always ones they didn't really feel that great about. Now, we go into it with a little bit a little more confidence and feeling a little stronger.",

Kind of out of amazement, some out of fear and loathing and concern for what would would happen to American foreign policy if Trump is re-elected.So you have two sets of countries. You've got the allies, who are just mortified that they could be living in a world where the president of the United States is either convicted or facing a trial or in the business of looking out for his personal interests over the interests of the country. And we saw this recently in the TikTok debate when it seemed that Trump flip-flopped on TikTok, because at the same exact time that he got some money from a donor because he needs to pay his legal bills. So that's one thing. The other thing is that it really damages America's ability to project the values of sort of a good governance, democracy around the world. Because all of the dictators look at this spectacle, and they say, oh, look, democracy is messy. Our system is much better. We've got an authoritarian system. We don't -- we don't have to deal with all this stuff. So I think, you know, basically, putting this on TV is just taking the sort of disaster that is American politics and broadcasting it to the world in real-time. It can't really be a good thing. I mean, it's good in terms of transparency, but in terms of America's reputation, it's really a tragedy.",

He had a distinguished career here in Washington. He was the first Jewish vice-presidential nominee of a major party. And he was something of a maverick. He paved his own path. He was a Democrat with an independent streak. He had to break from his party in 2006 and wasn't afraid to break from the pack generally. Tributes have been pouring in, including from his old running mate, Al Gore. Gore says Lieberman \"was a truly gifted leader whose affable personality and strong will made them a force to be reckoned with.
