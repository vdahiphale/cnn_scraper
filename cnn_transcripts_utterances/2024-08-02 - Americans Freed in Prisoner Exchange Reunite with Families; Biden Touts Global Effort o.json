We speak with the Polish foreign minister about his country's role in those negotiations. Hamas calls for prayers and a day of anger over its political leader's assassination. And U.S. jobs numbers fall unexpectedly raising big concerns and taking a toll on the financial markets this Friday. Well, our top story this hour, the long-awaited return of three Americans detained in Russia is finally a reality. They were greeted by their families and by President Joe Biden with hugs and overwhelming joy after their plane landed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday. Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich, and the Russian American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva were part of a massive prisoner exchange on Thursday involving more than two dozen people and seven countries. Well, now they are in San Antonio in Texas where they will undergo medical evaluations. I want to bring in Nic Robertson and Priscilla Alvarez in Washington. And Nic, this exchange, historic as it was, has raised a very significant question as to why Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to this now. What are your sources telling you and how did this all play out?",

      "sentences": "I think it's very hard to read why the Kremlin does anything at any particular time and doubly sotrying to figure out what's going on inside President Putin's head. What is clear we understand because of the way that all this was put together over a period of time with ups and downs, that this is when it came together. But one of the last pieces was a couple of Russian spies being held in Slovenia, go into court, being charged with espionage, and that seemed to - - the willingness of Slovenia to let them be part of this seemed to sort of be the last thing of many hurdles that was blocking the way. So in part it appears to be the natural consequence of timing. What it means the Putin, the fact that he was there at the runway, the fact that there was an FSB colonel, Vadim Krasikov, who murdered a Chechen dissident in an execution-style killing in the middle of a Berlin park, and was in a German jail, the fact that Putin really resisted any other exchange that didn't involve him shows you the high value of Krasikov and we've learned more about him from the Kremlin, that he is part of some alpha special operations unit, a unit that is involved in protecting President Putin in that sort of close guard around him in the Kremlin. So you can clearly see that this FSB colonel Krasikov had high, high value for Putin. And the way that he's played this up, it's he's returning these important people to Russia and it's a sort of piece of symbolism, if you will, that could be important for him, you know, at a time of war when he needs to show that the state will look after its spies, its troops, people associated with the military. But of course, on the U.S. side not everyone was released, and John Kirby, the national security spokesman here, has spoken about the efforts to get Marc Fogel, a teacher in Russia who's been held in jail there for three years on minor drugs charges. The family has spoken about their heartbreak. John Kirby spoke about how this piece just couldn't fall into place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a system that they clearly intend to carry on, holding people on what in many cases are trumped-up charges so that they can exert a price at a later date.

And already we've seen how all of thisunfolded against this political backdrop with the former president weighing in as well as his vice presidential nominee essentially saying that it was -- that Russia wanted to do this now because they're afraid of a former president Donald Trump taking a second term. Now John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, was asked about that directly on CNN earlier this morning, and he said there's no evidence to suggest that. Instead, what we have heard multiple times from U.S. officials over the last 24 hours is what a feat of diplomacy this was and how all of these puzzle pieces came together to finally culminate in the release of these Americans among others yesterday. And that included a lot of high-profile calls and meetings especially this year in January. The president speaking with the chancellor of Germany then meeting with him in February. The vice president doing much of the same, meeting in February with the chancellor as well as the Slovenian prime minister. And over -- and the reason we should underscore that it was so important for other countries to play a role here is because the U.S. was in a position where they were having to essentially search for Russians -- who would Russia want to get back in order to release these Americans and in the case of Germany, they have that Russian assassin Krasikov, who was serving life in prison in Germany, then too you had a tune nationals in Slovenia, two Russian nationals in Slovenia. So all of this required the U.S. to work with Poland, Norway, Slovenia and Germany to make this come together. And that was why when the president greeted these Americans on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews yesterday along with the vice president, he also came over to reporters to stress how important these alliances were.

It's told them that they would have 90 seconds between warning sirens and potential impact to get into those shelters. We also spoke to a hospital here in Tel Aviv that said that they have cleared one of the underground parking lots of cars to be sure to have an area where they could potentially treat people if there was some kind of a strike, some kind of an ongoing situation.

And I think that's what I said about, you know, the mix-up of the military and revenge type of purposes. If a soldier is telling you or trying to explain something with military reasons that some things are true, and I've seen it many times in which in cases that that was true. It's very difficult to unprove it. And I could tell you 100 percent that we've destroyed houses at least for reasons that we're just not -- we don't care enough about the lives of Palestinians.

Khelif won silver at the 2022 IBA Worlds, but was disqualified from last year's championship before her gold medal match because the then governing body, the IBA, ruled that she had failed an unspecified gender eligibility test. Now Khelif, she won her bout here Thursday after opponent conceded just 45 seconds in. Now, Lin won IBA Worlds in 2018 and 2022 but the then governing body stripped her of her bronze medal last year claiming she failed to meet unspecified eligibility requirements in a biochemical test. So the IOC, though, Becky, is defending these boxers' rights to be here. They said, quote, \"Not a transgender issue,\" insisting that both women have complied with the rules in place and that they are victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA. The IBA was suspended. They haven't been recognized by the IOC since 2023. Now, Lin won her first match here, just this morning in Paris, just a bit ago. Khelif will return to the canvas on Saturday, but Becky, it's become, you know, a really uncomfortable situation for these women.
