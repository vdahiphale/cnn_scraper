Top of the hour where we're following major new developments. A just announced meeting between outgoing President Joe Biden and President- elect Donald Trump. According to the White House, the two men have now agreed to meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday morning. That meeting comes as Trump and his transition team are working quickly to fill key White House positions. And sources tell CNN we could learn some of those names at any moment. Trump just made history this week by announcing Susie Wiles as the country's first ever female chief of staff. And now, there's a scramble underway at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Resort in Florida, as members of his inner circle and the GOP sphere are battling behind the scenes for a spot on his team. We have a team of correspondents covering all of these developments for us. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering the Trump transition at Trump's Florida home or near his Florida home. But let's begin with Arlette Saenz. And this just announced meeting at the White House, Arlette, what more do we know about this Wednesday meeting in the Oval Office?",

That is something that the President has said he made clear to Trump in their phone call on Wednesday, saying that there will be a peaceful and orderly transition. And it comes just four years after that was not afforded to President Biden by then President Donald Trump, who had thrown up many roadblocks in the transition process and had never conceded in this race. Now, this will be a return to the tradition. Former President Barack Obama actually hosted Donald Trump, then the president-elect in the Oval Office for a meeting in 2016. And that is the tradition of many presidents before that. Now, we are also told that an invitation was also extended to the incoming first lady, Melania Trump. An East Wing official telling us today that the Bidens both had congratulated the Trumps and extended a joint invitation. It is unclear when exactly that meeting could take place. But it is tradition that when the president-elect comes to the White House, the first lady, incoming first lady has also come for a visit in the East Wing and potentially in the private residence. But for Biden, he has really tried to stress and his advisers have tried to stress that one of the key missions in the coming weeks is ensuring that there is this orderly transition. And this step in the Oval Office will be a key piece of that.",

But that has really ramped up in these past few days and being taken more seriously, of course, now that they know that Donald Trump will be in the White House come January 20th.There are a few areas of focus that they have been really paying attention to more. So when it comes to these executive orders, one is immigration, but also energy. And I do have some reporting on some of the energy executive orders as well as proclamations that they have been preparing. That includes withdrawing the United States once again from the Paris climate agreement. That is something Donald Trump had announced he would do in June of 2017, just a couple months after taking office, the first time around and has vowed since then to do once again. He's also promised to slash government jobs and offices dedicated to cutting pollution, particularly in poor communities. He also wants to downsize national monuments particularly those in the west to allow for more drilling and mining on public lands. That is just some of what I'm told that they are already preparing for him to sign once he gets into office in January. Fred?",

And then there's also additional work that they want to try to see completed by the end of his term.One of those issues relates to trying to get the additional or get the approved aid to Ukraine out the door as soon as possible as there are questions about what future U.S. support for Ukraine might look like. The Biden administration is also focused on that implementation part of the key legislative victories, trying to get as much money out the door relating to the semiconductor bill and also that Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a lot of climate policies. There could also be moves relating to the environment and climate issues. Just this week, they'd already announced a limit on drilling in one of Alaska's Arctic wildlife reserves. And then Biden is also trying to see if he can further put his mark when it comes to judicial nominations. Just yesterday, he nominated two more federal district judges. That is something that Senate Democrats could try to push across the finish line in the coming weeks. So it's unclear what the Republican cooperation might be like on that front. And then Biden is also expected to return to the world stage just this coming week. He will attend a pair of summits, one in Peru, the APEC Summit, and another in Brazil, the G20, at a time when many world leaders around the world are also grappling with having to work with President-elect Trump in just a little over two months. Biden has often talked about when he's met with world leaders that he has tried to assure them that America's is back. But now there is the question of what American foreign policy will be like going forward. We know that various world leaders have been reaching out to Trump, but this will also put Biden face to face with many of the world leaders as they're trying to figure out what the next four years will hold when it comes to foreign policy.",

And these were done openly in wide open spaces with children in the audience. My real problem now is not Democrat versus Republican. It's about this country and what we can expect from this country. I've studied the history of this country all of my life. I lived through Jim Crow. And I know that Project 2025 is Jim Crow 2.0.

You don't have to scratch beneath the surface to hear them, to see them, to read them on issues such as immigrants.There is a reactionary element to the new MAGA coalition and that coalition affirmed itself and its role in American politics right now. So I think that's part of what is troubling many Democrats, not simply who has power, but what this election means about the character of the United States. And some will be resigned and despondent.

One of the many reasons why the text messages deeply worried many people is that they addressed recipients by name.

When you move to the issue of Ukraine, I just recently traveled through Europe and northern Europe and central Europe and talked to leaders there who are worried about the potential of a Trump administration. Because while they have the will to go it alone in terms of aid to Ukraine, they do not necessarily have the manufacturing power to ramp up fast enough to give Ukraine what they need to survive. Not to compare with what the U.S. has or the stocks that the U.S. still has. What the U.S. has largely done is sent old stocks to Ukraine and then used the funds to ramp up new deliveries, which has been a real boast to the U.S. defense industry.

And Trump road over that. He also recognized the 1967 Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights. And time and time again, allowed the expansion of Israeli settlements. Now, Arab-Americans have bragged in some cases that they helped bring Trump back to office. I am surprised at that because, in terms of what is happening in Gaza and Lebanon, yes, Trump has probably said he wants Netanyahu to wrap those operations up.

So they have much better improving fire weather conditions there.Now, we have the fire weather conditions on the east coast. We have fires that have started to pop across parts of New Jersey. Even Prospect Park in Brooklyn had a brush fire night. So you can see some of that smoke on satellite. We have red flag warnings in effect for the New York City area, Long Island and going towards Hartford and Boston where you have winds up to 35 miles per hour and that relative community very full of dry air. And with these conditions that have taken over much of the northeast, more than half of the northeast right now with some drought conditions, that is what is fueling this fire threat in the northeast this weekend. I mean, the rain deficits since September is pretty large. We are seven inches, almost eight inches, below average in New York City. So they really have not really gotten rain. Temperatures have been very warm, up in the 80s. And that is what is sparking these fire concerns. Now in the northeast, we're getting some of this rain from this front as we head towards tomorrow. The bottom end of this front is really causing some flooding problems across Louisiana. You have some lightning in here. And notice that this front is not moving too much. You have heavy rain in the same spots, riding the same areas. That is why we have some flash flood watches in effect as we go through the day today. And a new flash flood warning includes Alexandria. We have a high risk of flooding. It's, a very rare level 4 out of 4. That includes Lake Charles. It has only been issued 4 percent of the time. It's responsible for 40 percent of fatalities and 80 percent of that damage. A lot of this moisture is being fueled by Rafaela. The pattern is kind of just stuck. There are a lot of things in its way. It is so close to the U.S., but it can't turn into the U.S. because you have got that storm and a high-pressure system in its way. So that is why it is kind of lingering and meandering in the gulf. But some of that moisture still making its way to Louisiana.",

One, of course, we know Trump has said openly that he would fire Jack Smith, pardon himself, have his A.G. dismiss the case, have some combination thereof immediately upon taking office. But it is also the Department of Justice's own policy that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted. So even if Trump were inclined to leave the case in place, it would be dismissed per DOJ's own policies. So either way, it is definitely going away.",

Right?Any prosecution would be completely baseless to the extent that he could even get his Justice Department to file such a case. You know, we have to hope, of course, that they would not. We would have to hope the judge would dismiss it and the grand jury wouldn't indict it. You're kind of really relying on the built-in protections and structures in the justice system to the extent that happens. Of course, we hope that was just bluster and that will not happen and Trump will move along from that threat.",

Thisis a judgment that Giuliani will have to fight using the system, which, of course, he's doing. He is appealing. He's trying to fight their efforts to get at the judgment, to get his assets. And he is doing that. There is really nothing Trump can do. And I think Giuliani knows that, which is why he does not say anything about pardoning him and so on. So he says, oh, he needs to fix the whole system. Which, ironically, when he talks about corruption in New York City for 150 years, eight of those years, he was mayor of New York City, of course.
