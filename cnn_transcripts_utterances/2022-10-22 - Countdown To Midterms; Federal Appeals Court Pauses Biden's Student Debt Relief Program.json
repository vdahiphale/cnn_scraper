He's going to some closed receptions, but he hasn't been to a lot of big political rallies with Democratic candidates running for office, and the reason for that is pretty clear and pretty simple. We're in an environment where he has low approval ratings. We have high inflation. There are concerns about recession and some -- some of these Democratic campaigns are looking at the situation saying would an appearance with the president help, would it hurt, or would it just be a waste of time?That's not to say the president is sort of hiding or sitting on his hands. He's still out there, but the things he's attending are more issues based appearances, things on infrastructure. Yesterday he was here in Delaware talking about his school loan debt cancellation program. So that's what they're trying to do.

The four months is actually a significant sentence under the statute, which has a minimum one month sentence.So the judge added on three more months to that minimal under the statute. And it was two misdemeanors, so these are not considered by the Congress who wrote this law to be serious crimes. I've often wondered why they haven't made it a little bit more serious than they have and give the judge a little bit more flexibility. Now the defiant act on Bannon's part was he refused to even talk to the probation offices about his financial situation so they could judge what would be an appropriate fine. He just said \"Go packing. I'm not going to give you any information.\" So the Justice Department asked that he get a full $200,000 maximum fine under the statute.

The last one is to Senator Lindsey Graham, where he has basically asked that the Supreme Court weigh in on his subpoena from a grand jury in Atlanta, Georgia, that Georgia, that is tied to an investigation in attempts to overturn the 2020 election.And Senator Graham is claiming that he shouldn't face questioning due to a clause for senators called the \"speech and debate clause\". What, may I ask, is that? DEAN: The \"speech and debate clause\" is a part of the constitution where the founders believe that our elected representatives to Congress, both the House and the Senate, should be able to debate openly without having any sort of criminal or civil liability for what they're discussing on the floor of the House and the Senate. So that's really what it is. Now, over the years, members of congress have used that as a shield and tried to protect themselves. It happened in criminal cases. It hasn't worked very well. Graham does have some privilege, but it's not clear he can block all testimony and the lower courts have already ruled that he must testify. The federal district court in Georgia as well as the 11th circuit have ruled that he must. In reaction to that, he went to Clarence Thomas who is the justice with jurisdiction over that and said, will you intervene and stay this and stop this and Thomas has not acted yet. He said I want to hear from the prosecutors by next Thursday and then I'll decide whether I'm going to pass this on to the court or I'll rule on it myself or what I'll do.

But I do want to say something that I think is really important to underscore, Sara. We have seen this narrative in so many places recently in the past few weeks and months about how Latino voters are running into the arms of Republicans, and that is just not true. Let me repeat that. It is not true. No es verdad. The Democratic Party still has overwhelming support 30 -- 35 points nationally, more in places like Arizona, more in places like Colorado, Nevada, than the Republican Party does. That doesn't mean that we should not be out there every single day making the argument that it is Democratic policies, the ones that have always had the back of the Latino community, and the ones that have always helped Latinos live a better life in this country. And that is as true today as it has been for the last 20 years. If there has been any erosion in the Latino vote, Sara, for a party, it has been the Republican Party. Barbara will be able to underscore this for us as well. George Bush got 44 percent of the Latino vote. The Republican Party has never come close to that ever since he left because he understood Latinos. He related to Latinos. And so the Latino community always is better off when both parties try to attract their vote in an authentic, organic, truthful and respectful way. The Republican Party has not done that, I believe, in like two decades since the Bushes left.",

Election deniers and candidate quality has really plagued Republicans and it's why in a year where the economy is bad and you've had Republicans -- certainly you look at Arizona, if Governor Ducey had run, we probably would have been picking up a senate seat there where we're not going to be getting a senate seat.Same thing in New Hampshire if Governor Sununu was running. Those are two seats because of Donald Trump, Republicans aren't going to pick up. Again here in Georgia where I think Governor Kemp and Brad Raffensperger are probably going to sail to re-election fairly easily, you have Herschel Walker certainly going to go to a runoff I would expect, but candidate quality is a big problem there. And I certainly don't think he is qualified, and I think he has been a big problem. And he's a problem that Donald Trump, you know, gave the party, again, as he has with any number of candidates throughout. Now, I certainly think because of the bad economy and the problems the Democrats have had this year, you're certainly going to see Republicans gain the House majority and they might well gain the Senate but not in the numbers that we would have, but for Donald Trump saddling these poor quality candidates that he has. And I am very concerned about these election deniers, people like Kari Lake running for governor, who had said, as Donald Trump said, you know, whenever he talks to her, she says she always leads it back to, you know, that she thinks the election was stolen in 2020.",

In Baton Rouge, two men are in custody in connection to a mass shooting overnight near the campus of Southern University.
