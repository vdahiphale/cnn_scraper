And tell us from that position of the border, what the situation is like on the ground as we wait for this pause in fighting. ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's been a flurry of activity. Frankly, our crews on the ground at the Rafah border say, they've seen so many trucks, dozens of trucks lining up from Al Arish to the Rafah border, frankly for the last 24 hours in anticipation for this truth to kick in. The fact that they've now agreed to over 200 trucks of aid to enter Gaza daily, while this truce is on the go is really big news because we've heard from international organizations that have been saying, they're in desperate need of all resources from food and water, medical supplies. And we have to remind our audience just what it means to be someone that is aided in Gaza right now, the chances are you'll get surgery without anesthesia, you'll get an amputation if that's required without anesthesia. These are some of the horror stories that we have been hearing. We also actually bumped into a group of people that had just come into Egypt from Gaza. And they were saying that for days they had no access to food and water. That is how dire the situation is. So, the hope now is, get that aid into Gaza.

But I must tell you that, you know, throughout the last six weeks, the pipe, you know if you can call it of releasing hostages and prisoners in both sides was very dry, nothing was moving there, no liquid. And right now, we are really, really, really hoping that this first day, assuming that it will actually happen because it was already, you know, delayed 24 hours. So just, you know -- just something that happens, we're really hopeful that this will be the beginning of a set of releases that will eventually gets all the hostages back alive in Israel, and all the missing, you know, citizens back in Israel, and this is something that I mean, even if -- I know it's really hard to say for us, but I truly mean it, even if other kids will arrive in this -- I mean, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and not ours will be extremely happy.",

All of this as we are learning new details about those 13 hostages were set to be released tomorrow, that won't happen until about 4 pm local time.
