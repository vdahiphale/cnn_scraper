It was in February that a Chinese balloon was shot down over American airspace, adding even more tension to an already frosting relationship. But things have since stabilized during this highly anticipated meeting in California, don`t expect the two sides to come to an agreement on authority issues such as Taiwan or human rights. But rather officials say this is an opportunity to set some barriers and limit to create some calm between the two nations. Right now, both nations are witnessing the war in Ukraine, as well as the war between Israel and Hamas. This meeting is a chance to prevent the relations between the U.S. and China, from deteriorating, with the goal of creating some stability. Despite the differences, this is also a chance to build on economic relations. As both nations have benefited from trade. This meeting comes as both President Xi and President Biden face domestic challenges of their own. Marc Stewart, CNN Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

TheU.S. Department of Agriculture or USDA says multiple states are affected by supply chain issues related to packaging. It`s a dairy precarious situation for distributors who sell cartons of milk to places like schools, nursing homes and correctional facilities. They`re running out of the cartons that hold the milk. Typically public schools are required to offer fat free 1% or flavored milk at breakfast and lunch. But the USDA is relaxing these requirements for now. As some schools are transitioning to alternatives like juice, shelf stable milk, and bottled water. Some have even considered pouring individual cups from big jugs of milk themselves. There`s no certain timeframe for when this shortage might end. Ten second trivia. Maputo is the capital city of what African nation? Mozambique, Morocco, Mali, or Madagascar? Maputo is a port city, the largest city and capital city of Mozambique. That`s the correct answer here. All right, let`s dive on in now to the aqua marine waters around Mozambique considered some of the richest in the world, full of fauna and marine life. It`s a hotspot for people who love to dive. And for researchers looking to work with coastal sea life. The diving industry there could be a big part of the local economy by employing Mozambicans and by helping to promote sustainability, could be but it`s not, at least not yet. Check this out.

And I started to see a decline in a lot of the populations of the animals that we were studying. And so I realized that when I finished my Ph.D., if I was to move on that none of this information would be captured that this conservation probably wouldn`t take off here. And so for us, it meant, well, if we`re going to take this journey, it might be a 40 or 50- or 60-year journey, but I`m all in. I mean, that`s, what I want to do is, is protect this coastline.",

The dive centers here in Mozambique, because they`re working with researchers, have become really aware of, you know, what the limits are and how they probably don`t want to develop this area too quickly. Because it`s very difficult to wind things back when they get out of control. It`s much better to develop things slowly and sustainably. We have to show caution and we just have to put the animals and the environments first. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
