And it goes on to call Donald Trump's plan counterproductive. Jeff Zeleny is with me. We have much to chew over, Jeff. I will put the economists to one side because although arguably, you know, that sort of important, but this business about Hitler and the generals and whether or not he did admire -- Donald Trump did admire Hitler's generals.

As we travel across the country, as we've been doing throughout the era of Donald Trump, it is actually difficult outside of his rallies to find Republicans who agree with everything he says, but they are willing to sort of make a bargain and sort of rule out the oh, that's just Trump being Trump and they like the Republican policies. So the challenge for Vice President Harris is to sort of win over some of those in the middle, and there are many Republicans, I cannot recall a campaign where there are as many Republicans supporting the Democratic nominee, from the Cheneys, to all the people who worked around the former president, it is just extraordinary. The question is, does it matter? I don't know if it will or not. It gets down to people are just voting because they believe that Trump is strong, but Harris also has a lot of support.

But when I read your article, you're suggesting that actually this is telling us something wider about what is happening in the economy structurally. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, ECONOMIST AND ADVISOR, ALLIANZ: Yes, Richard, I am not a gold bug. In fact, I don't own any gold unfortunately, given the 30 percent plus gain.

Remember you had Warren Buffett saying it is a complete wasted asset but yet, its price keeps on going up, and that is why I am saying what is going on here is something to pay attention to.

They are sort of homing in on these fresh slivered onions that are included on Quarter Pounders and McDonald's says that as they continue this investigation they have pulled those as well as the Quarter-Pound beef patties from stores in affected states. Here's how the McDonald's U.S. president you were just talking about is trying to reassure folks that it's safe to eat at McDonald's. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE ERLINGER, PRESIDENT, MCDONALD'S USA: We've taken steps to proactively remove slivered onions, which are used in Quarter Pounders from restaurants and select states. We also made the decision to temporarily remove the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in select states. It's important to note that the majority of states and the majority of menu items are not affected. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Typically the case numbers are larger than the number of people who are hospitalized and who died, which is good. I mean, typically whenpeople get infected with E. Coli they recover on their own within about a week. We have seen 10 hospitalizations here out of a total of known 49 cases and that one death. All we know about that person is they were in Colorado and they were elderly. We know that one child has developed this hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is a severe kidney disorder that can be associated with E. Coli illness. And that is worrisome. But typically people do recover from E. Coli and if they do get infected, it takes about four days usually to start to see these symptoms and they can be severe, you know, these stomach cramps. This is a bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever. And so health officials are saying that if folks are experiencing those, they should get care and they should alert the care providers to what they ate.",
