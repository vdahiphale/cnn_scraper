I don't think that was in the best interest of the Republican conference and frankly for the House overall. So, there were conversations last night by some members, there will be conversations today to see if a pathway still exists.I think the key thing for everybody to understand is you can get into the semantics about rules and committee assignments, but what this is about is having a deliberative conversation about what leadership is going to be like in the nation's Capitol in the House of Representatives. For far too long in this town, too many things have been by acclimation and that's actually not worked for the American people. So, we need to fighting for budgetary restraints, reforms, securing our border, all the things that the American people want to see, but the root of that starts in how you actually set up leadership and rules in the House.

But this situation is one that has not been confronted in any way. Because you don't go into a game expecting a player to go into cardiac arrest off of a tackle. You know everybody who is on that field, they're praying for one another. They may not like each other.I mean, you do certain things to sort of get yourself ready to play, but when you come together, you see everybody is -- when the game is over, they're patting each other on the rear end, they're exchanging jerseys.
