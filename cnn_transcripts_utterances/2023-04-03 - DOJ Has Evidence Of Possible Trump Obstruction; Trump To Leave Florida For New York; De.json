He'll be arraigned tomorrow on possibly 30 charges stemming from the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. He will surrender at a courthouse in Manhattan where he will be processed and also appear in court, making him the first former American president to face criminal charges.",

That is according to \"The Washington Post.\" Trump apparently wanted to keep certain things before the files were handed over to investigators.CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following all of the details. Katelyn, so we were - we're here -- seeing this reporting from \"The Post\" that he allegedly went through some of these boxes. What more can you tell us about this?",

Now, we have known for some time that it's very likely that Trump was looking at documents, or at least came across them in his day to day business after he got that subpoena last May demanding that all classified records in his possession should be turned back over to the Justice Department. We knew about boxes moved out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. We know that the FBI, when they went in to do the search, they found documents in his office, in his private residential area in the suite. And we also know that there was a folder on his nightstand marked classified that even his lawyers didn't turn over until much later in the year last year. But now the key here is that the prosecutors are putting together their cases. And that is a potential case into obstruction of justice, not just mishandling of records. But what happened after he got that subpoena when the Justice Department said we need it back.",

And also they note, and CNN has confirmed this as well, Kaitlan Collins was able to nail down, that one of Trump's top assistants, Molly Michael, the emails and texts that she had taken, her writing, was showing that Trump, what he was doing, who he was meeting with, and that now is becoming crucial as investigators are piecing together the day to day activities of the former president potentially around these documents themselves.

And it just goes to show you that this is not a typical movement for the former president. They are clearly using enhanced security here.And what we know, as you mentioned, President Trump, the former president, will leave Mar-a-Lago with a small group of advisers, including his campaign heads, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles. They will head to the airport at noon. They will take off shortly after that to arrive in New York. And, of course, ahead of that arraignment tomorrow.

All of the reaction we have seen so far, the idea that this is a political hoax, that he has said that this is a witch hunt, that has all been before we actually see what he is charged with. So, this will be the first time we hear from him since that public unsealing of that indictment.And I'm told that he will likely try to capitalize on this politically. You know, Trump and his advisers spent the weekend in between rounds of golf discussing how to make the most of this. He was on the phone with allies and advisers talking about how he actually believes that this is a political positive for him. He talked about recent poll numbers. He talked about his fundraising. So, this is something that he is viewing as a positive, or at least he is selling it as that, but it will be interesting to hear if any of his messaging changes once that indictment is unsealed and we actually see those charges.",

Just to put it into context for you, after he announced his presidential bid in November, 45 days after that, the fourth quarter, he only raised $9.5 million.So you're talking about raising over half of that in 48 hours.

It injured more than 30 people, killed a prominent military blogger known to be a major supporter of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The Kremlin has said that Ukraine could be behind the attack. However, no evidence has been presented yet to support that claim. And then there is this, newly released video which shows this same woman now under arrest outside the cafe that same day carrying a box and Russian media have also put out photographs of that woman standing near the blogger who was killed. This was just inside the cafe right before the explosion. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is following all of this from Berlin. He's joining us now.

It was quite interesting because just a couple of hours ago the Russians put out a video of her apparently being interrogated by that anti-terror committee. And she was asked, look, do you know why you're here? And she said, yes, because I gave the figurine to Vladlen Tatarsky, who, of course, is that military blogger who was killed.She was then asked who she got that figurine from. And she said that she didn't want to say at that point in time. So, clearly, they are already confronting her with that, And we did see those photographs also on that video of her apparently going inside that cafe with that box. We also have an eyewitness testimony of someone who saw her give that to Vladlen Tatarsky. I want to read you with that eyewitness said. She said, quote, when she gifted him the figurine, she went to sit in a different place at the window, so obviously away from the stage where the explosion took place. The host at this stage took the figurine from the box and showcased it. Vladlen held it for a bit. They put it back. And shortly after the explosion happened. Now, that's sort of a rundown what happened then. Her husband, Trepova's husband, he came out earlier today and he said he believes that she was framed, that she didn't know what was inside the figurine that she gifted to that military blogger. Obviously, you were already saying that the Russians are saying that the Ukrainians might be behind it. The Ukrainians are already denying that. They're also saying that they believe that she had contact with Alexei Navalny - with Navalny's organization. Of course, the opposition leader. That organization has also denied that as well, Kate.",

No, that's exactly right, Kate, because just in Russian state media is reporting that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich has filed an appeal to his arrest. Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison after being arrested there last week. He is the first U.S. journalist to be detained by Moscow on espionage charges since the Cold War. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, to demand his release. Lavrov blamed Washington and the western press for politicizing the arrest and said the fate of Gershkovich would be determined by a Russian court. Secretary of State. Blinken also called for the release of Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16 year sentence for espionage, which, of course, Whelan and the U.S. disputes. Blinken and Lavrov have only spoken three times since Russia invaded Ukraine. Each of those calls focused on trying to free detained Americans. Sara.",
