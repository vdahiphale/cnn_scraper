Wow, that's high, but it's actually cooling for a second month from a 41-year high in October. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now leaning barely higher. I would call that undecided. The Dow, yesterday, fell more than one percent after disappointing earnings by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. But the Nasdaq extended its winning streak -- seven days now. On inflation watch, gas prices crept higher overnight, now at $3.36 a gallon. Later this morning, key inflation data -- the Producer Price Index. Year-over-year readings are expected to cool to levels not seen since April 2021. Still high, but cooling. That is the story in inflation. Also in just a few hours, December retail sales. That's the number that measures spending in stores, online, and in restaurants. Sales fell six-tenths of a percent of November from October. It was the biggest monthly decline last year as sales slowed in holiday-related purchases, in home projects, and autos. So let's bring in CNN Business reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn. And Nathaniel, it's so interesting. We're seeing this week that a lot of big companies are slowing down their price hikes. They've been raising prices because their prices have been going up. They're slowing down their price hikes because consumers are balking now. Consumers are getting picky about higher prices. What's happening?",
