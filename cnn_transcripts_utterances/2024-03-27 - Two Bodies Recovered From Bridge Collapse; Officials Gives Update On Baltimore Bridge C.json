I also want to announce that the Coast Guard along with our federal and state and local agency partners have stood up a unified command. Our number one priority in that unified command is to reopen the waterway so that we can safely move commerce in and out of the Port of Baltimore. That's our number one priority. We're going to do that as soon as possible and as safely as possible. So, that's what we're doing from a unified command perspective. Thank you very much.",

So, Pete, they did reiterate not just the challenges of trying to remove the debris from here, but the cost and the interim of waiting to do that.

It comes, as we've been hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu, more about his hope that American bipartisan support for Israeli efforts in Gaza will remain strong. Not only, he told a meeting of bipartisan congressional leaders here in Jerusalem today because of what's been achieved so far against Hamas, but also, he said, because he believes that the end is in sight.

So far, Israeli officials have said that they are on listening mode. They're willing for those conversations to continue. But there is no suggestion yet that they're willing to back down, Julia, from the idea of an all-out assault on Rafah and on the city itself. In fact, as we heard Yoav Gallant leave Washington this Wednesday, it was the night before on Tuesday, that he told journalists that this is twofold. First of all, of course, it is about, he said, getting rid of Hamas, dismantling it entirely, but also about the hostage negotiations and the importance of sending an important message to Hamas about what might follow should a deal not be found.

Former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman ofConnecticut has died at age 82 following complications from a fall. He was America's first Orthodox Jewish senator as well as the first Jewish vice- presidential nominee of a major party running alongside Al Gore back in 2000. He later left the Democratic Party, winning re-election to the Senate as an independent. Thailand's lower house of parliament passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. The vote Wednesday was overwhelmingly in favor, 400 to 10 in fact. It brings the nation one step closer to marriage equality. Both the Thai Senate and the king still need to approve the bill. If they do, Thailand would become the third territory in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Argentina is accusing Venezuela of cutting power to its embassy in Caracas after the diplomatic mission hosted a meeting with Venezuelan opposition leaders. Venezuela's opposition says President Nicolas Maduro is stifling free and fair campaigning ahead of July's presidential election. The leftist, Maduro, has also been harsh critic of Argentina's President Javier Milei. And officials in Maryland giving an update just minutes ago about the Key Bridge in Baltimore. A cargo ship rammed into the bridge early Tuesday morning. Officials say two victims were found earlier on Wednesday. The families of Alejandro Fuentes, originally of Mexico, and Dorian Castillo Cabrera, originally of Guatemala, have now been notified. Four others that remain missing are presumed dead. Two people had been rescued around the time of the collapse. This has left one of top ports of East Coast of the United States fully out of commission. Authorities say there are now 11 ships stuck inside the port in addition to the Dali. When the Francis Scott Key Bridge was built in the late 1970s, container ships like the Dali, they didn't exist. Well, now these vast cargo vessels are essential to feed global supply chains. Ivan Watson has more.

At least five people died as vehicles plunged off the stretch of collapsed bridge. Authorities initially blamed the crew for the accident.

      "sentences": "Thank you for having me. Probably three points I'd like to make. This technology is super different. It's anatural language. So, you do not have to be a software engineer to use A.I. The second is the rate of diffusion that you just described is unprecedented. From when the transformer models were first launched, in about six weeks, we had a rural farmer in India access a messaging app in a local vernacular language to determine the best proceeds that they could get from the government for agriculture and agricultural productivity. That's the pace of diffusion. And thirdly, it is pretty left to right in where it can create impact from a student in Southeast Asia learning maths and science using co-pilot to a doctor in sub-Saharan Africa looking at pregnant women and getting them better advice to an energy development board working with Microsoft to find a low lithium battery. Why this becomes critical for us, Julia, is because if you think about the infrastructure requirements for any technology to develop, look at the railways. When the railways came into being, the U.K. was investing 10 percent of GDP. Microsoft is making a similar commitment to investing. We announced a $5 billion investment in Australia to further A.I. in the market. We have skilled 80 million people over the last four years with a commitment to skilling 10 more million on A.I. in underprivileged world. And finally, because we're a company that has been in existence for almost 50 years, we are able to enable our partner network to create examples of the best. I'll probably give you a few that might be relevant to the Asian audience. Let's start in Vietnam. VinBrain is working with doctors and A.I. technologists to identify cancer screening with about 95 percent accuracy. Now, remind ourselves, this technology is about 18 months old in the hands of people. In India, there is an organization, a start-up called Karia (ph), which is actually enabling women in villages to create new roles on language prompts in languages that are not ubiquitous and have a small following. So, these are some examples of why we describe this as one of the fastest diffusion technologies that the world may have experienced.",

Just to be clear, leap seconds are used now and then to make up for a divergence between atomic clocks and the rotation of the Earth. Removing one has the potential to cause havoc on susceptible computing systems. Interesting. Now, to a brewing canine controversy in Germany.
