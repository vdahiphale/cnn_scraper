A deadly strike takes a new turn, with Moscow appearing to blame its own soldiers for their deaths.A tumultuous turn of events on Capitol Hill, as the man expected to take the speaker job failed to get the votes. But not once, not twice, actually three times. And knee jerk or just cautious, health officials around the world are grappling with how to deal with China's reopening, and Beijing isn't happy. Well, Ukraine is claiming another devastating hit on Russians forces, as Moscow appears to blame its own soldiers for a deadly strike in the occupied eastern region. Kyiv says around 500 enemy troops were either killed or wounded near Chulakivka village in southern Kherson area on New Year's Eve. Further north, the Kremlin is now increasing the death toll in Makiivka attack to 89, and says the use of cellphones among Russian soldiers is what allowed Ukraine to track and target them. Ukraine says the death toll in that attack is in the hundreds. CNN's Scott McLean joins me now live in Kyiv. And what's interesting about this, away from the devastation of the deaths, is that there's a blame game going on with Russia about what actually happened here.",

      "sentences": "This is a remarkable statement, Max, coming from the Russian Ministry of Defense, essentially blaming Russian soldiers for their own death. Statement says that there will be an investigation, a full investigation carried out, but that the conclusion is already abundantly clear and that is the mass use of cell phones by soldiers too close to the front lines in violation of Russia's own policies around this kind of a thing, which ultimately allowed the Ukrainians to find, based on those cell phone signals, the precise location of a large concentration of Russian troops that they were able to very quickly strike. The Ministry of Defense says that the military officials who allowed this use of cellphones on mass would be held to account. The statement also said that it was the HIMARS rocket system, this is the mobile U.S. supplied artillery system that the Ukrainians are using that was used in this strike.According to the Russians, this kind of a system has allowed the Ukrainians to really strike much deeper inside of Russian held territory than they had been with earlier artillery systems. They say that two of the six rockets were shot down, four of them hit the target, causing the roof to collapse. And the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, that breakaway region, says that there was terrorism on display from the Russian soldiers. Some of them managed to escape on their own and then went back inside of the building to help their comrades, and some of them were ultimately killed. The Russians have also updated their official death toll from 63 up to 89 as they find more bodies in the rubble. And a pro-Russian blogger, who is well read and frankly well respected by the Kremlin as well, having recently received an award for courage from President Putin himself, says that his expectation is that that death toll will continue to rise as they continue to find and identify more bodies. That blogger, his name is Semyon Pegov, was also remarkably critical of this assessment that it was simply the use of cell phones, saying that soldiers know better, they know when they can and cannot actually use them. And he said that this was a deliberate attempt or a blatant attempt to smear blame. Max?",

This as China deals with soaring COVID-19 infections after easing its zero- COVID policy.

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a real tussle over what to do after China is basically ending nearly three years of self-imposed isolation, now allowing its citizens to travel freely. It's going to lift quarantines on people coming into China as of Sunday of this week.And other countries around the world are concerned because of just the sheer colossal spread of the COVID infection within China, the world's most populous country. So, as you mentioned, the European Union on Tuesday conducted a meeting and considered three potential approaches, which would be pre-departure testing for travelers from China and then stepping up wastewater monitoring, which other countries are doing as well, and increased domestic surveillance. They're going to have a subsequent meeting about this to try to sort this out. There is a map that we've put together that shows just a swath of different governments around the world that have introduced different kinds of restrictions on travelers from China. The U.S. also requesting, demanding a negative COVID test within 48 hours of departure. That's at one end of the extremes to the other, which is Morocco, which is completely banning any travel from China, whatsoever. The airline industry is not happy with these moves, particularly after China threatened reciprocal measures. So you have the head of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, who came out basically slamming these restrictions, saying, quote, \"It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years. We have the tools to manage COVID-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs. Governments must base their decisions on science facts rather than science politics.\" And I'm going to direct you now to the government of New Zealand. Unlike Australia, which has also imposed some of these requiring testing, New Zealand has said it is not going to take this measure. Take a listen to the Health Minister of New Zealand.

And the head of essentially what gets done. Now, a few examples of what is grinding to a halt now, you know, every new Congress, they need to come in and start putting together a rules package that essentially sets the rules up of how they'll operate. If that does not get approved by January 13, which is, you know, drawing near, people on the committees, they will not get their paychecks. People who work on Capitol Hill will not get those paychecks. That certainly important. Committee work is really affected here with no committee chairs in place. That means the committees who are in charge of going through, working through legislation, advancing them to the floor to potentially turn into bills in law, that grinds to a halt too. So no new legislation right now is going to be happening. And of course, you mentioned new members will not be able to be sworn in. So they're in a state of limbo as they start their new jobs or hope to officially start their new jobs. And, of course, the line of succession also a very real question given the fact that the speaker of the House is next in line to the presidency after the Vice President. So certainly, an ominous way that many Republicans feel about this start of the new Congress, wondering what that portends for how Republicans will rule going forward in the House and lead. But, of course, the big question is how long this will drag out. There are very real actionable items that are right now grinding to the halt because they don't have a speaker. Max?",
