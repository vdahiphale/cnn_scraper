Tonight, the Middle East teeters on all-out war,tensions escalating even further as Hezbollah's leader says, Israel has crossed all red lines, and Israel vows Hezbollah will pay an increasing price. Plus, the U.S. calls for restraint as diplomatic efforts hang by a thread. We'll be joined by the Lebanese ambassador to the U.K. And we take you to deserted border towns left lifeless by tensions between Israel and Lebanon as communities scarred by war count the cost. But first, tonight, escalation, fury and tensions in the Middle East as the region edges closer to the brink of full-blown war. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is accusing Israel of crossing, quote, \"all the red lines\", calling two days of unprecedented attacks across Lebanon, massacres. He gave a televised address earlier today, threatening retaliation, and vowed that Hezbollah will not stop hostilities with Israel until the war in Gaza ends. Well as Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes as you can see there, broke the sound barrier over Beirut, shaking up residents already as you can imagine, on edge. The IDF says it's striking new Hezbollah targets in Lebanon today without disclosing those locations. It's also suggesting that further escalation could be coming. Israel released this video you're looking at, saying a top commander has approved plans for the northern area. And we've just learned that security consultations involving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are underway right now at Israel's military headquarters. The Israeli Defense Minister issued this morning. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, DEFENSE MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price in the new phase of the war, plus significant opportunities and also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it's being persecuted, and the sequence of military actions will continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's no question that this is once again a moment where many Israelisare fearing that this conflict could escalate into all-out war. People calling their relatives in the north to see whether or not it is time for them to move south for those who have not done so already. We are also watching military movements by the Israeli military, the 98th division, which has been a key fighting force in Gaza, being redirected away from that front and towards the northern front as the Israeli Defense Minister repeatedly now talking about the war entering a new phase as the Israeli security cabinet adds the goal of returning those 60,000 displaced Israelis from the northern part of Israel to allow them to return back to their homes. There's no question that the military preparations are being made for that all-out war. But as Ben was pointing out, they are -- what we didn't hear from Hassan Nasrallah today was the kind of escalatory rhetoric that would indicate that an all-out war is in the offing. And for now, the preparations on the Israeli side, yes, they are significant, but they are still short of what you might see in the event of a movement towards all- out war. The call-out -- call up of tens of thousands of additional reservists then being sent to the northern front, that hasn't happened yet. And so, we are certainly seeing quite bellicose rhetoric on both sides as Nasrallah vows retaliation as the Israelis talk about a new era in this war, the center of gravity in this war moving north. But we are also seeing the opportunity once again as we have in the past for these tensions that are soaring sky-high without a doubt, to once again de-escalate and for things to effectively remain where they have been, and that is to say, that there has been a steady increase in the kind of nature of the attacks on either side. But for now, both sides seem incline to try and avoid all-out war, although, it's certainly -- that possibility is still very much in the air tonight. Isa.",

A pollfrom the \"New York Times\", \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" and Sienna College shows as you can see there, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remain in a statistical dead-heat nationally. The new numbers do show that the Vice President holds a slight lead in the critical state of Pennsylvania. Both candidates are back on the campaign trail today, Harris will be joined by Oprah Winfrey at an event in Detroit, that will be live-streamed. Trump is appearing with mega donor Miriam Adelson and speaking at an event called Fighting Anti-Semitism in America. We're joined by CNN's Eva McKend and Alayna Treene with more on the campaigns. Eva, to you, first the music -- first the music. Vice President clearly there placing a focus on the swing state of Michigan. Just talk us through what we can expect from this virtual event. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this is another example of how the campaign is trying to be innovative, in terms of how they reach voters. Instead of sort of the headache of pulling off the logistics of an event that involves Oprah and all of the interest that you would have. Now, you can do watch parties across the country and get more and more people engaged and to physically donate while the event is ongoing. So, that seems to be part of the strategy here. They're also partnering with women, black women, they of course, on organization that held one of those early Zoom calls immediately after the shake-up on the Democratic ticket happened where they raised $1.5 million in about three hours. More than 90,000 black women from across the country tuned in, and what you saw is that black women who have long being the backbone of the Democratic Party really feel engaged and represented at the highest levels. So, all of those things are what they are trying to leverage tonight in this event with Oprah in the battleground state of Michigan.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's funny, Isa, because whenever you ask Donald Trump himself about polls, he often will only note to polls ormention polls, you see this at his rallies a lot when he thinks that they're good for him. It's a similar strategy when you talk to his campaign advisors, they say, look, polls don't mean a lot. And I will say to their point, is that a lot of the polls that we've been tracking all the entire election cycle now have showed, first, former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden. But now Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris as being very close. There really hasn't been a lot of change overall when you look at national polls about how tight this race is going to be. However, they do acknowledge that Harris is in -- far closer in a lot of these states than Joe Biden was. And that's why you're seeing Donald Trump really change some of their campaign strategizing around this. Now, one key thing they note is the importance of Pennsylvania. We have been saying on this network for months now, but it is so clear how key Pennsylvania is to this race. A lot of people say that, you know, you have to win at least four of the seven major battlegrounds in order to win the election. However, that does change when it comes to Pennsylvania and maybe some of the southern states. I know that Donald Trump's team recognizes that. Unlike Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is actually more competitive in places like Georgia and North Carolina. You're seeing the Trump campaign pour a lot more resources into North Carolina than they have in the past. That's because they recognize they really need to throw everything they can at all of these states because Kamala Harris is much more appealing to voters now than perhaps, you know, Joe Biden was when he was running before. And so, that's weighing very heavily on their minds, particularly that we're only 47 days now away to November 5th.",

Officer Tom Knie (ph) says they regularly find people trying to enter Germany illegally. It's daily business here that people don't meet the entry requirements for Germany, he says, and perhaps even for the Schengen area, and then have to be subjected to further police measures. Germany's problem, many people from around the world continue to flee to Europe and many of them want to come to Germany, even though they should register in the countries where they first crossed into E.U. territory.
