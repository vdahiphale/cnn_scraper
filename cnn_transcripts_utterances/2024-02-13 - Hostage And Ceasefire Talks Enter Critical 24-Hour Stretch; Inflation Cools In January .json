But at this stage, we are not believed to be anywhere close or at least a deal is not believed to be imminent right now. But of course, some progress on that front. And another Hamas official telling CNN that the organization stands ready to return to Cairo for further discussion. Of course, a delegation was sent last week. They are prepared to return if, indeed, there is progress in these talks and negotiations. Again, focused on that prolonged truce with a hook. This could eventually lead to a lasting ceasefire. But there is concern around the situation in Rafah, the potential for a ground operation by the Israeli military. We've had concern expressed by a number of international allies of Israel. Of course, Hamas has said that if there is, indeed, a ground operation by the IDF in Rafah, that could put any talks and negotiations in jeopardy -- Brianna?",

ROB D'AMICO, FORMER DEPUTY OPERATIONS CHIEF, FBI HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM: Good day. Good to be here. SCIUTTO: So we now have some video of the operation that rescued two Israeli hostages, as well as some details. Two hostages rescued. Perhaps some 100 Palestinians killed in that operation. I wonder, what does that mean for those who remain in captivity? I imagine Hamas might look to protect their hostages more. But also you have the issue here of civilian collateral damage. D'AMICO: I think there's two things. I think Hamas understands that there may have been some hostage rescues going on. They planned for that, knowing that Israel was going to hunt down their hostages and try to rescue them. So I don't think that surprised them. I think the hundred casualties on the Palestinian side could -- could throw a roadblock in -- a little bit into the negotiation because they're so close. I think it just gives Hamas something to push back on saying you -- you rescued two, but you killed 100. But it's still all part of the play. True negotiators are going to go back down like don't let something like this interfere with the overall bigger picture that we're trying to do?",

D'AMICO: It is a good point, but I think everyone knows that that was going on. This is just public now, bringing it to light. We'll see if Israel starts playing that. It's all that information game to begin with. And if they start putting pressure and start releasing stuff on that to try to get to turn some of the Palestinians against Hamas. But I think they're at a point now where it was understood because, in the neighborhoods, they knew there were hostages there. You never did one of these in Iraq or Afghanistan where the civilians didn't know that hostages were being held.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the word gets out.OK, big picture here. Israel is at two goals since October 7th. One is, and they've stated it publicly, eliminate Hamas. The other is to get the hostages home alive. Those are fundamentally in conflict because, from a practical standpoint, those hostages are leverage for Hamas to some degree to survive, right, to survive as a group there. So as a negotiator, how do you get around that fundamental contradiction in effect? D'AMICO: Absolutely. Hamas took the hostages just for this purpose, in order to be able to negotiate the end of the war. So I think it's one of those things that you have to sometimes just play to exactly what's going on. And Israel says that there are two firm things. They may be willing to get to a point where they've destroyed a percentage of Hamas or the intelligence chief comes back and says, look, we got 80, 90 percent of them, we can now start looking at -- at doing a ceasefire because they have plans down the road. So it's one of those things that goes back and forth. The stated objectives are not always the true objectives. I think that's what you're starting to see in some of this on the last negotiation pieces.",

VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It's certainly a cooling from the numbers that we saw in December, but we're sort of going back to the prices that we saw in November. Analysts were expecting a rate of below 3 percent. That did not happen. We're at 3.1 percent year-over-year inflation for consumer prices. And on the month were up 0.3 percent. Now one of the reasons that we've seen cooling in January, because energy prices have continued to fall, down 0.9 percent in the month of January, and actually coming down 4.6 percent over the course of the year. That's really encouraging for people who are filling up at the pump and heating their homes. But what has really kept these inflation numbers high is shelter. So that's rent. Shelter on the month up 0.6 percent and on the year up 6 percent. And that is really where Americans are feeling the pain the most. That's the biggest share you're going to be paying every single month. And shelter alone accounted for two-thirds of the monthly overall increase. And that increase that we've seen on the year at 3.1 percent. Food prices also still pretty stubbornly high at the grocery store. We also saw some upward trends in services. People may be taking trips at the beginning of the year. We saw lodging increase, airfare increasing, medical costs increasing. Some savings, though, for folks, used car prices continuing to fall. That was a big pain point for people over the last couple of years. And maybe something that makes people feel a little bit better is wages are still outpacing inflation. Hopefully, that helps people grapple with these still too high prices. As we know, the Fed really wants to see inflation down closer to 2 percent. So we do still have a ways to go -- Jim and Brianna?",

The forecast, based on this report that we have, signify that the first rate cut would come maybe in July. So that is why you're seeing investors really not loving what they're seeing right now.
