It was debt on arrival in the Senate. The president certainly objected to it but he thought it would force President Biden to the table, to start negotiations over raising the debt ceiling as the calendar gets closer and closer to a potentially catastrophic default.The White House response to House Republicans succeeding in their efforts to pass that bill? Nothing has changed. White House Officials making very clear the Republican bill not only is a nonstarter but it will not set up a meeting between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy over the debt limit. They are happy to discuss longer term budget and fiscal issues, but when it comes to the debt sealing, their position is the same as months -- they want a clean debt ceiling increase and they want it off the table and then willing to have the negotiations, and if it wasn't clear from White House officials, well, the president just a couple of hours before the vote made it clear himself.

That means they're not moving any time soon, which is, of course, a problem if Republicans don't agree to put a clean debt ceiling onto the floor, which they have made abundantly clear they won't. So, the big question in Washington right now is, how does this end? Someone is going to have to break. There is no threading the needle or finding some pragmatic middle ground between these two positions. They are completely -- completely against one another. White House officials right now feel they hold the political high ground on this issue and believe the Republicans eventually have to break. Whether they do? Well, the U.S. economy may depend on it.

The bull is on to something there.There is a potential for hail today, but also, the potential for flooding, that's kind of a slow moving disaster across the Midwest. We will talk about that in just one moment. But you got to see this photo, 4-inch in diameter sized hail. Think about what it takes to create something like that, the droplet of water starts to form and get pushed into the upper levels of the atmosphere by updraft of a thunderstorm and it has to be so powerful that it supports the weight of a grapefruit-sized hail stone to stick into the atmosphere and freeze and eventually fall. I mean, that is just incredible. Right now, we have a line of thunderstorms is moving into the Baton Rouge area. So batten down the hatches, if you're watching this morning, maybe you're up earlier. You're an early riser. That's our severe weather threat. That's level 2 of 5 across the gulf coast. Large hail and damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes but greatest chance of hail today really around the extreme southern portions of Texas and along the coastline of Florida as well. Lesser sized hail there, but the potential for monster sized hail across southern Texas. Let's take you to the upper Midwest. This is the other big story we're following. There is some rainfall in this forecast. It doesn't look that impressive but it's the cumulative effects of record breaking snowfall that took place this winter. That has led to flooding along the Mississippi River, the Red River, and other tributaries leading into this particular area. We got 400-mile stretch of flash or flood warnings, I should say, stretching from Minneapolis southward St. Louis, right along the Mississippi River and places like, well, let's say, Davenport, the Quad Cities is expected to crest this weekend and we're talking about a 21.6 foot forecast crest for Monday and Tuesday. According to the government there, the water will be at the base of the south employee entrance of the Quad City times building. So that just kind of puts it into perspective.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE CONTORNO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal court against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The 77-page lawsuit alleges that he engaged in a year long effort to punish the company for its opposition to a state law that bans the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools. According to the lawsuit, the company's First Amendment rights were violated by Governor DeSantis and there was, quote, a targeted campaign of government retaliation orchestrated every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech. In a statement to CNN, DeSantis' office criticized Disney and said, quote, we are unaware of any legal rights that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state. The lawsuit is the latest escalation in a year-long fight between DeSantis and Disney, one of the state's largest companies. And it now heads to a federal court where a judge will decide who is the victor. For CNN in St. Petersburg, Florida, I'm Steve Contorno. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
