There is the investigation being led by the special counsel, Jack Smith, who is looking into two cases, the one, the potential mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, and Trump's actions during the January 6th attack on the Capitol.A federal grand jury is currently hearing testimony in Washington, and as CNN first reported yesterday, prosecutors are actively working to gain access to files on a laptop belonging to at least one Mar-a-Lago staffer close to Trump, basically trying to see if there's any kind of electronic paper trail when it comes to the classified documents he took with him. The Department of Justice is also looking into the effort by Trump and others to overturn the 2020 election and incite an insurrection, which has already resulted in hundreds of criminal indictments and nearly 500 guilty pleas. Also, the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, who is looking into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, she has said that grand jury in that case has recommended multiple indictments. Her decision about whether to bring charges is also imminent. New York State's Attorney General Letitia James is suing former President Trump and his three eldest children and the Trump Organization for fraud. According to James, they misled lenders, insurers and tax authorities to enrich themselves. I should note, the Trump's have denied any wrongdoing in that case. The Manhattan district attorney has also started presenting its case to a grand jury about Trump's role in hush money payments to former adult actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential race. That's according to The New York Times. Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges related to those payments Cohen facilitated while he was working for then-Candidate Trump. For more, let's bring in CNN Correspondent Kara Scannell. This is a pretty big escalation given -- we initially thought this hush money payment situation wasn't going anywhere, the broader look into Trump's business practices.",

I mean, this hush money payment was the -- that's how they started this investigation back in 2019, looking into the hush money payments, and then it expanded, and they took this broader look at the business practices.You know, there's been a change in the district attorney. Alvin Bragg is now the D.A. He paused that previous investigation because he didn't believe they had enough evidence to bring a criminal case against Trump, because the burden of proof so much higher. They just had this big conviction last month of two Trump Org entities for tax fraud. They seem to be emboldened and they have really picked up the pace with this focus now on hush moneys yet again. I mean, we first reported that Michael Cohen went in two weeks ago, and we first reported that David Pecker, the former chairman of the National Enquirer, which is involved in those catch and deals, was going in this week.
