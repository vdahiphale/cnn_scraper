And the outcomes today could reveal the mood of the nation less than a year before the presidential election. Actually, 363 days before November of 2024, to be exact. The ballot issues include abortion rights, marijuana, legalization, taxes, and foreign spending in elections. Meantime, Kentucky's Democratic Governor Andy Beshear is seeking a second term in that red state. Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin is hoping to take full control of the legislature in Richmond. And a cousin of Elvis Presley is trying to shake things up in Mississippi and become the first Democratic governor there in nearly 2 decades. We've got CNN Political Director David Chalian here to break it all down. David let's start with the key issues of abortion.",

There's an amendment to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution. Since the Dobbs decision came down a year and a half ago, 6 states have had abortion measures on the ballot. All of them, the abortion rights, pro-abortion rights side of the equation, won those contests. We'll see if Ohio keeps that up.And also in Virginia, the battle for control of the state legislature. You've seen Governor Youngkin out there. Abortion rights has been central to that as well in a lot of these key state Senate districts that have a lot of suburban populations, where Democrats have seen success on an issue like abortion rights.

And rising star in the Republican Party, the attorney general in the Commonwealth, Daniel Cameron, in a close battle. And I think, you know, a key question here is, can Beshear, even with his popularity, overcome the political DNA of Kentucky, especially with Biden races, where Biden is right now, publicly?And then down in Mississippi, you noted the Presley-cousin connection in the intro. Tate Reeves, the Republican incumbent governor, dealing with a corruption scandal. That could have an impact on the outcome here. This would be the shock of the night.

And quite frankly, time is running out for some of these candidates to make their moves in this race.So, what we are looking for, first and foremost, there are 5 candidates on stage at the debate tomorrow evening, the smallest we have seen so far. It started in August with 8 candidates. It's slowly been whittling down, and we are seeing a consolidation here. But the 2 candidates at the centre of the stage, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador, have been on a collision course for several weeks, if not months, and look for that to continue tomorrow. There is no doubt that these candidates are trying to win the race, if you will, for 2 place. Of course, the former governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, has been going after Donald Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, the Ohio entrepreneur, still trying to show some life in his campaign. And Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, also on stage. So, it really is a key opportunity for Nikki Haley to continue her momentum and for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in his home state here to try and show that he can be the leading alternative to Donald Trump. But Boris, as we said, time is running out on all this. But as we watch the election results today, when voters are going to give us some indication of what they're thinking on abortion, on crime, on education, other matters, this is all part of a piece of what the candidates are trying to do tomorrow night here, of course, as we are now 1 year away from the general election next year. So even though it seems like separate pieces of the puzzle here, it's all part of the, the ongoing campaign. But tomorrow night, there is no doubt, Boris, I will say the Florida governor in his home state knows that he needs to make a move here to stay very active and alive. We'll see if he does it.

I've heard a number of different proposals from American officials. One is that you basically build a several miles deep DMZ between Gaza and the rest of Israel so that they would see anybody coming over the border and stop presumably the kind of attack that you saw on October 7th.I've heard proposals under which they let the Palestinian Authority run the civilian operation, but the Israelis hold on to the security side.

I'm told that the conversation between President Netanyahu and President Biden yesterday was equally stiff. So, there's clearly not a good conversation underway here. And it tells you something about the limits of American power. The United States provides three $3.8 billion a year in security assistance.

Just the amount of time it took the IDF, the Israeli military to make it down to the areas where the, where the terror attack was underway. At some point when the war ends, there's going to be a big investigation of this. And that's going to, I think, reflect pretty poorly on the government he was running.So, it's hard to imagine how he survives this when the war is over. People don't want to sort of take that in. His other problem is that he has not talked very much about the hostages, the Israeli hostages. And that's what the protests have all been about. The other day, he met some of the hostage families, but I think it was for the first time.",

I'm sure that the Prime Minister thinks, though, that some of those released the last time were involved in the terror attack and including the commander of it or inspirer of it. So, I'm sure he's worried about that along the way.These humanitarian pauses they're talking about seem to be related to whether or not they can negotiate some hostage releases. Some American officials I talked to, though, can't imagine why Hamas would release many of these hostages because it's their last leverage over Israel. Once they're gone, then the Israeli forces would be free to do whatever they, they feel they need to. And maybe they feel that way now.",
