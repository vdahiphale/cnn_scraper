It gives requirements to get a large vehicle, but one that can go fast, find a crowded street, but one with narrow sidewalks where pedestrians will be in the street. It talks about having secondary weapons so that when you finally are stopped or crash, you can continue the attack. And we know when he finally crashed into that crane, he jumped out and opened fire. And luckily for everybody, the police were on the scene to engage him in that gunfight and quite heroically, two of them were wounded. But you know what the president referenced earlier today is that he had remote control transmitters that were connected to the two pipe bombs that were placed in the coolers, two blocks in every direction. So it appears that his vision was that as he was running over people and 911 calls were coming, that first responders and crowds would be streaming in from either side, and that he would then detonate these devices by remote control.

We don't know yet if there was specifically a political motive here or an ideological motive. I suspect that we'll learn more when law enforcement has an opportunity to really start digging into his background, start accessing devices that might unlock some of those mysteries for us -- telephones, computers, laptops, iPads, things like that that might show us his browsing history, his contacts, his activity on social media, all the typical places we go to try to understand someone after they've done something like this.

They are probably, from an investigative standpoint, starting to drift apart. The indicators they're seeing around Livelsberger, the individual involved in Las Vegas, the Special Operations Green Beret, is indicators that there were issues at home, stressors in his personal life, stressors in his military life, including potential depression, concerns he was having about the role of Special Forces, the PTSD involved in the long deployments in very dangerous situations, the civilian casualties that are collateral damage in some of the operations that these operators see, and it appears that this may have been triggered by a final stressor that sent him into a suicide that was going to send a big signal. Perhaps, and it's a supposition here that the choice of the location to blow himself up and he is the only casualty here in terms of fatalities, was to get the attention of the incoming president for some of these issues that he may be going through.

It's literally out of the instruction manual that ISIS pushes out to its supporters and adherents looking for mass casualties in a cheap and kind of obvious way. The use of a secondary weapon to continue the killing after you crash the vehicle. All that stuff is designed to kill as many people as possible in a high profile event that's going to get a lot of attention. This attack seemed very different to me. You've got a guy who drives from Colorado to Las Vegas. He gets there early in the morning. He ultimately brings the car to Trump Tower for the final time. He goes once and takes a look at it. He comes back and sets it off at a moment when really very few people are there to get hurt. It almost felt for me more like the Christmas Day RV bomber in Nashville just a couple of years ago. As an individual who is suicidal, built a large device inside his RV, took it to downtown Nashville on Christmas morning. Very early in the morning, played music from the RV in an effort to kind of distract people, to detonate it at a time to minimize casualties, which is the assessment of FBI. So, this Las Vegas bombing or the truck explosion felt a lot like Nashville to me and that is fundamentally different from what we saw in New Orleans yesterday morning.",

After I told him I couldn't walk and I was paralyzed, he stayed with me. And I asked him what had happened. He said, we don't know. We're still trying to figure it out. And I said, was it just a drunk driver or something? Did someone blow up something? Because I didn't know. I still hadn't put two together. The truck had done anything really. And even though I had seen the truck, I never even thought that that's what had happened because I was like out of it.",
