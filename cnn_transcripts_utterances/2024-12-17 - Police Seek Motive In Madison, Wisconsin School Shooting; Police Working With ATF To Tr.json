Law enforcement is still trying to figure out any details about the motive here and what they have not been able to say yet, and we hope to get an update about here in the next few minutes, is where she got that gun, who was the lawful owner of it and how she obtained it.The big question in this case, especially when you look at past mass shooting cases where parents were eventually charged, the question here is, is there any possibility that parents in this case would be charged? We've asked that to the Chief repeatedly. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't have any evidence that it was.But we also want to look at if the parents may have been negligent. And that's a question that we'll have to answer with our district attorney's office.

Two people who were injured have since been released and two people are in stable condition.We're hoping to get many more updates today. But again, and I'll leave you with this because I think this is one of the most gut wrenching details of this entire case was that it was a second grader who called 911 in a neighboring classroom.

Also with us is Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Thank you both for being with us. Daniel, first to you.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Yeah, it's tremendously uncommon. Data sources vary a little bit, but it's somewhere between 2% and 5% of mass shooters or school shooters are female. And, you know, I think basically these types of attacks typically have a constellation of factors that are just more attractive to men and boys in general.You know, it's homicide. It often has a suicidal element, as we saw yesterday. You know, we're talking about firearms, of course, as the weapon. And then the victims in these cases are often strangers, not someone who's close to the shooter or has a personal kind of conflict with them. And if we look at the data, it's like homicide in the United States. 90% men, suicide, 80% men, firearms much more common among men who are interested in violence or self-harm. Women and girls tend to be more in favor of poison, arson, drug overdoses in the case of suicide. And women tend to strike out with their aggression at people they're close to rather than strangers. So ultimately, there's a lot of different reasons why mass shootings and school shootings are more common to men as a form of violence. But of course this is an exception and we want to learn more about that.",

So one of the things -- and look, the job of threat assessment experts is really difficult because you have so many threats and really not enough resources often to examine each one as closely as you want to.So, you know, when they're kind of doing this triage, they're trying to decide which are the top priority cases, you certainly might look at a simple thing like gender and say, ok, if we have two cases that are similar, let's look at the one that's a young man first and prioritize that before we look at the other one. But, you know, on the other hand, that can be a big trap, right? So, you know, I guess what I would say is we really need to get a good sense of what the details were. A credible threat matters. You know, if it was a -- if it was a four-year-old, right? If it was a 95 year old man? those are things I would say less credible as a threat. But of course the sad state of things is we live in a society where there's a large number of people who can commit these attacks if they're interested to. So if this is something she had the motive for and expressed that, then it's really important to treat it seriously.",

The Manhattan DA says there are indications that Mangione may no longer fight the process of being extradited and transferred to New York. We will of course bring you his remarks live in our next hour. In the meantime, those outraged by their health insurers have further embraced Mangione with some calling him a hero for allegedly killing the industry executive who left behind a wife and several children.

She's with the Community Service Society of New York, a non-profit that advocates for low and moderate income New Yorkers who on multiple fronts, including on health care. Elizabeth, my apologies to you. We have to go straight to Madison, Wisconsin, where law enforcement is giving an update on the shooting yesterday at that private Christian school.
