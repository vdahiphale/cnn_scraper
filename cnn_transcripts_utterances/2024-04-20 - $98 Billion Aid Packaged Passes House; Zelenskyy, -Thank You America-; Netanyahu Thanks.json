After months of delays in political wrangling, in a rare Saturday session today, House lawmakers passed a $95 billion foreign aid package for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson was finally able to advance the bills through Congress with the help, it must be noted, of Democrats. It's a move that could cost him his job, as some hardliners in his party have threatened to introduce a measure to remove him from his speakership. The Senate is now set to take up that aid package on Tuesday. President Biden now urging Senators to send the legislation to his desk quickly so that he can sign them into law \"right away.\" Let's get straight to our correspondents in both Jerusalem and Kyiv. Two countries set to benefit directly from this major bill. CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen is in the Ukrainian capital and our Senior Diplomatic Editor, International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson joins us from Jerusalem. Fred, I want to start with you. We're talking about more than $60 billion for the Ukrainians. They have said time and time again that this is so desperately needed. You've spent a lot of time on the front lines. How is this going to impact the Ukrainian soldiers?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think in so many ways. I mean, one of the things that we have to keep in mind, Alex, is that over the past couple of months, the Ukrainians have been suffering from a severe lack of ammunition on the front lines.In fact, one place that I went to about two months ago, near the front lines in the east of the country, near Bakhmut, the soldiers there were having to fire smoke shells out of artillery launching systems. So, ones that don't even really explode when they hit targets near where the Russians are. So, these weapons had absolutely no effect because the Ukrainians simply didn't have enough regular shells to fire at the Russians. It's a problem that's been going on for months as this aid has been delayed by the United States. So, the Ukrainians are hoping that they can get some fast relief from that very quickly. The other thing that they said that they need immediately is air defense missiles. They do have some air defense systems that have been helping them. However, they say that they simply, at this point in time, don't have enough missiles. Of course, one of the things, Alex, that we've been reporting about over the past couple of weeks, the past couple of months, is that the Russians have launched this massive aerial campaign, especially against energy infrastructure in this country, destroying or badly damaging a lot of energy plants here in this country. And the Ukrainians are saying they simply don't have enough ammo for their air defense system to shoot those Russian missiles down. So, they're hoping that they're going to get fast relief for that as well. We also spoke to some soldiers on the front line who said that this aid bill now going through the House of Representatives and being OKed by the House of Representatives does so much for morale for the Ukrainians on the battlefield, knowing that new ammo is coming. The president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he also came out and thanked the United States. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We appreciate every manifestation of support for our state and independence, our people and our lives, which Russia wants to bury in ruins. America has shown its leadership from the first days of this war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's no strategic gains yet as far as the Russians are concerned. However, they are more effective at using their air force now, they've made some advances on the ground as well.The Ukrainians are saying they understand that this aid package is not going to completely reverse that, but they do hope that it is going to help them hold the Russians up and possibly even start some sort of planning for what could be as the summer progresses a counteroffensive by the Ukrainians. But of course, right now, immediately, they say the main thing is trying to hold the Russians up, Alex. [19:05:00] MARQUARDT:  Yes. That most recent counteroffensive didn't go terribly well for them. Fred Pleitgen, great to have you back in Kyiv. Thank you so much. Nic, to you now, we have $26 billion that are going to Israel and Gaza, $9 billion of it is going to be for humanitarian aid, $17 billion going to the Israeli military. We've seen Israel go through a lot of those interceptor rockets in the past few days as they were fending off that attack from the Iranians. Of course, the Israelis using a lot of tank shells, for example, in Gaza. What is the reaction in Israel to these billions that are coming their way?",

      "sentences": "Very happy, from the top of the political leadership from the president of the country, Isaac Herzog, saying that Israel has no better ally than the United States and saying the United States has no better ally than Israel as well.The prime minister, like other political leaders here, has said he's very grateful for the bipartisan support. He says, this bipartisan support shows support for Israel. And I think that's significant coming from the prime minister, because there's a sense among many people in the country here, particularly those that are critical of him, that he has really grown tensions with the White House between himself and President Biden, and particularly over the way he's fighting the war in Gaza. More than 34,000 Palestinians dead there now. The war is not over. More military operations to come. That's what's expected. So, the prime minister domestically making it clear that this is bipartisan support. We haven't damaged that relationship. The defense minister talking about the seven different enemies that Israel is fighting at the moment. That this is, he says, shows strong support from the United States. The foreign minister talks about strong ties, talks about strategic partnership, all of these words welcoming that money, that military support, the ability to be able to hold off the enemies of Israel. And that's what the speaker in the Knesset said. It's an important message for the enemies of Israel. And that, I think, has particular resonance here as well, because there's been an assessment here that the reason Iran just last weekend, you know, we were standing on the roof here watching some of those 350 Iranian drones and missiles coming into Israeli airspace getting shot down, and the sense was that Iran believed that there was a weakness in that relationship between Israel and the United States because of the strains between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Biden. And this is what is understood that encouraged them to strike. So, when the speaker of the Knesset says, our enemies understand that bond with the United States is strong, that's sending that message. So, it isn't just the military aid it is that perception for the enemies of Israel. And for the aid money that goes to Gaza, an important sort of point on that was that none of the money that's being given for aid for Gaza is going to go to the U.N. body UNRWA, which oversees the aid distribution in Gaza, which Israel has been incredibly critical of as having members of Hamas with it within their numbers. And there's a big tension, obviously, between UNRWA and Israel at the moment. Some nations not funding UNRWA and to the detriment of the people of Gaza, they say.",

We've been hearing Ukrainian officials, from President Zelenskyy on down, sounding the warning about what it would mean if they didn't get this aid. So, what is it going to mean for Ukraine's troops in concrete terms? MAJ. GEN. MICK RYAN (RET.), AUSTRALIAN ARMY:  Well, good day, Alex. This is a major shot in the arm for Ukraine in the war fighting realm. They should see very quick infusions of artillery and air defense munitions. These are the two big priorities in the Pentagon and European commanding. Places throughout Europe will have been planning on a very quick injection once this bill is placed. So, we should see that moving quickly. But more importantly, it provides a big morale boost for Ukrainian citizens and for their soldiers on the front line.

I mean, it basically only went in the direction Republicans wanted, but not as far as they wanted, and ultimately they decided they didn't want to do that. I mean, I would say, what was interesting about this vote is it kind of -- it reflected, but didn't fully express how divided each party is over these issues. I mean, the fact that a majority of House Republicans, again, as they did last fall as a majority of Senate Republicans did in February voted against the Ukraine aid really is an historic kind of inflection point that says the international sway of the Republican Party is now the subordinate minority in this kind of Trump coalition and their influence is likely, more likely to diminish than to increase. I mean, one of the Senate Republicans noted that virtually everyone voted -- elected since 2018 on the GOP side, voted against this, and then on the Democratic side, this really just puts off the reckoning that is coming about aid to Israel. There were not that many Democrats willing to vote against the Israeli aid package. But on May 8th when the administration is required to report to Congress whether Israel is using the arms in accordance with international law and allowing international aid in.

They read it according to police, didn't even finish it before calling authorities to report what they saw as an imminent threat of a school shooting, and that kicked off this investigation. And since then, police say they have uncovered many more disturbing details. Online searches by Ye about school shootings, AR-15s, and gun ranges, as well as some alarming messages, including one sent back in December allegedly to the very same friend where Ye said: \"My homicidal ideation has been getting worse lately to the point I might act on it eventually to.\" Take a listen. Here is a little bit of what the Montgomery County police chief said was in this manifesto. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Back in December 2022, police say Ye was hospitalized for threatening to shoot up a school. The next month, in January 2023, he was reported to be released from the hospital, but police say he was still hill preoccupied with self-harming, school shootings and explosives. Then in February, he was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins pediatric unit where he remained for five months until July when he was released to a residential facility. What we don't know is what happened in the eight months after that, how much treatment are monitoring that Ye received before March last month when his friend notified police of that potential threat of a school shooting. Now, the Montgomery County School District says Ye has not physically been inside one of their schools since fall of 2022, and that's when he started taking online courses, according to police. Ye did appear in court on Friday on that misdemeanor charge of a threat of mass violence. It carries a potential maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He is now being held without bond until his trial is scheduled in early June. Gabe Cohen, CNN, Washington.",

[19:50:04] The 22-year-old will make only $76,000.00 in her first year in the league as the WNBA's first pick, $76,000.00 while the first pick man who is headed to the NBA will make 137 times more than Caitlin Clark, some $10.5 million. Here to talk more about this is CNN's sports analyst and columnist for \"USA Today,\" Christine Brennan. And Christine, this is stunning when you see these numbers side-by- side. And when you think about women athletes here in the US, the soccer players, for example, had made so much progress, but it is clear that female basketball players and the WNBA, the league, still need to make a lot more progress. So what do you think that this says, this $76,000.00 salary for the first year of this basketball player, the likes of which we may have never seen before, what does that say about women's sports?",

They haven't watched games, they haven't bought tickets in any kind of significant numbers.They have ignored the WNBA, a great product now for our generation and so those people who are shocked about this, have they ever watched a game? Have they ever bought a product that they've watched be advertise during a game, bought a jersey for their daughter or their granddaughter? On and on it goes. So really what we are talking about here is capitalism. I am not discounting, of course the incredible disparity but what it shows is that if people don't pay attention and that's when the story line for women's sports for generations, then this is what we are going to see. The great news here is now the spotlight is shining on it and it is going to change the contract, the contract, the TV contract is up and there will be new negotiations and Caitlin Clark will of course show the incredible difference and the interest and it will be a much, much bigger contract and better salaries moving forward in the next few years because of Caitlin Clark.",

She could soon have a massive deal with Nike and her own signature shoe, I believe, but that obviously doesn't change the fact that she is only making $76,000.00 in her first year.So you do expect things to change and how quickly do you think that could change for these basketball players?

I mean, again, Caitlin Clark taking us to amazing national conversations on so many  issues.And so Alex, yes, it is going to change. Will it be close to the men? No. But will they get maybe closer to a million dollars a year? That's certainly a possibility. There are also a couple other things. One is there is a quarter of a million dollars, $250,000.00 contract available for marketing the WNBA. Guaranteed, Caitlin Clark is going to get that $250,000.00 and that is part of the package to obviously sweeten the contract a bit. A lot of the players go overseas. Caitlin Clark won't have to do that, of course. But that's why Brittney Griner was in Russia, it wasn't because of the sunshine and the great politics. It was because she wanted to supplement her salary when she was arrested and in jail for all of those many months. So this has been happening for a long time. The fact that we are talking about this week and there is so much attention and outrage, that's terrific because it will help force change. And of course, as you said, I mean, this record-breaking numbers for Caitlin Clark in terms of the endorsements and the sponsorships and that Nike deal is expected to be between $20 million, maybe even up to $28 million. So again, Caitlin is fine, but she is going to -- the rising tide lift all boats. She is going to help everyone else make more money. And that's fantastic.",
