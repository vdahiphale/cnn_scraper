Now he also seemed to suggest that another hostage deal, a new framework, in his words could be on the table, adding that the Israeli government will leave no stone unturned in its design, in its quest to get those more than a hundred Israeli hostages who were kidnapped on October the 7th as part of the Hamas led terrorist attacks, get them back into Israel. Now we know that more talks are due to take place this coming Friday. In Paris, Bill Burns, the head of the CIA will be there once more, along with his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel. And the hope is that there will be more moves towards reaching some kind of compromise. You may recall that Hamas's proposal for the release of thousands of prisoners, including many who have been convicted for killing Israelis or being involved in attacks that led to the killing of Israelis, in addition to a complete cessation of hostilities and Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Those demands or that proposal by Hamas was decried as delusional by Prime Minister Netanyahu, his chief hostage negotiator, adding that they are not connected to reality. So, I suppose the hope is that Hamas may be moderating its stance a little bit so that there can be some kind of compromise reached to see those hundred plus hostages freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a pause in the fighting and of course, more desperately needed humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip, Rosemary.",

General Assembly asked the World Court back in 2022 to issue a non-binding opinion on the issue, but no decision is expected for months.Well, as the airstrikes and fighting continues, there's growing fears of starvation in northern Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says children and the elderly are dying because they don't get enough food. Some families only get one meal for the whole week. And the World Food Program is halting a delivery to the area due to safety concerns for its staff. The Hamas run Ministry of Health says Israeli attacks killed at least 118 people in the past day. An airstrike allegedly hit this home in Rafah killing a doctor and his family. The U.K. and Jordan air dropped four tons of life saving aid to a hospital in Northern Gaza. The packages of food, medicine and fuel was sent with trackers to ensure it reached the hospitals safely. On the ground, some aid convoys appear to have been attacked amid the fighting. A CNN investigation found Israeli forces fired on a U.N. truck carrying food as it sat stationary at an IDF checkpoint. Katie Polglase has our exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): This is how desperate the people in northern Gaza are. This aid truck filmed at the end of January is one of the last enter the region. And here's why -- aid so often caught in the fighting. Now CNN can exclusively reveal that this truck carrying vital food headed for northern Gaza was hit on February 5th by an Israeli shell, despite an agreement to provide a safe route. CNN has seen the internal U.N. incident report and the correspondence between the U.N. and the Israeli military that show the route of this convoy was agreed upon in advance. And with starvation imminent for many across Gaza, experts say hitting a food truck is a potential war crime. JANINA DILL, OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS, LAW AND ARMED CONFLICT: Looking at it with the available facts, its really difficult to see how this could be a legal attack. And so at minimum, it would look like a very serious violation of international humanitarian law, whether its also criminal, then depends on questions of intent. POLGLASE (voice over): The trucks that off as part of a un marked convoy of ten up Al Rashid road in the early hours. It reached an IDF holding point at 4:15 a.m., stationary for over an hour. It was then hit at 05:35 a.m. fortunately, no one on board was killed. The U.N. says they were hit by Israeli naval gunfire. And in satellite imagery taken just two hours after the attack, CNN identified ships that could only be Israeli naval boats.

UNRWA says half of its mission requests to the north have been denied since January and since this latest attack, they've taken the painful decision to stop trying to deliver aid to the north at all. The IDF says it's helping to coordinate humanitarian relief in Gaza, but aid agencies say they faced repeated delays while some staff are detained and even tortured. A U.N. mission and December described one aid worker who said he was stripped beaten, and blindfolded. Even when convoys are allowed through, some routes are simply not possible.
