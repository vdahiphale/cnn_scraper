And so, by being an office holder, quoting actually the D.C. Circuit, another January 6th case, the president should be agnostic to who is going to occupy the office next, right?So, it arguably, and I think a very strong argument, shouldn't matter that the president or that the candidate is out advocating for a certain position, right? That's not an official role of the president. I think that's what Jack Smith is really trying to get to here, is that this is candidate Trump, these are candidate actions. It's the president of the Senate, it's not Vice President Pence, and that's important because the president of the Senate is actually an Article I title. So, that's Congress, it's not the executive branch in Article II. So, you see these differentiations in there. Another key differential that I think gets around in those Supreme Court cases, the Fischer case. And if you see in this indictment, in the Fischer case, it was about an obstruction of official proceeding. You see mention of, you know, the actual certificates being carried out of Congress at 2:20 p.m., right? So, you see Jack Smith really not just taking the immunity case into consideration but also the Fischer case, which was a less, I think, publicized case but also just as important for how this case proceeds.",

      "sentences": "Well, the way the Supreme Court ruling on the immunity came down was it had three buckets, right? And the things we're looking at here are kind of core executive functions, which are official acts and absolutely protected and special counsel cannot bring.Then in the middle, there are these kinds of presumptively official acts that kind of fall within the outer perimeter of the office of the presidency, which both sides are going to dispute. And, you know, we have reporting tonight about how Trump's lawyers basically see the way the superseding indictment was written as -- in terms of the changes being too minimal, that they're going to litigate this, this is going to be this big fight, they will basically try and pare down the indictment far, far more than it currently is, and then at the third category, the unofficial actions. And I think the way that the special counsel wrote or kind of brought the superseding indictment back was clever because kind of to your point about how you are kind of phrasing it in the way that would be most amenable to an appellate court or the Supreme Court is to say, look, Trump was acting in his capacity as a candidate and not the president. And by referencing state officials, you're saying, look, you know, we're not touching the presidency, we're not touching the White House, we're not touching the executive branch, we're talking about state and local officials, we're talking about external lawyers. It had nothing to do with the government, nothing to do with the White House. And if you frame it in that way, and I think that's partially the reason why it went back to a grand jury because under the law, you've got to send it back to a grand jury if there's new additions or new information in there, by doing it and framing it in this way, they're kind of treading this path of keeping all of the counts but trying to satisfy the Supreme Court's ruling.",

Superseding is essentially the equivalent of saying, don't like that, how you like these apples, right? These are the new apples they got to bring in, and only a grand jury can actually prosecute a felony or they can actually return an indictment. You cannot have a prosecutor on their own just say you're charged with a felony offense.Jim, let me bring you in here. The prosecutors, they kept charges that Trump tried to enlist Pence in the scheme to undermine the election, but they talk about him as the president of the Senate. And in it, they say the defendant sought to enlist the vice president to assist in the plan to use his role as president of the Senate. As Costanza (ph) would say, yada, yada, yada. For the rest, the whole premise being it's not as my second in command, it's because his role as the president of the Senate is separate than our official correspondence.

That the grand jurors could have had and heard evidence along the same logic as the indictment presents, as a candidate, as somebody, the president of the Senate, taking away and essentially compartmentalizing the previous data that could have been used.And whether it's a piece of bread or a piece of ham, who knows? The grand jury, it's their prerogative. But Judge, let me ask you in this moment because many people are wondering, why didn't he just present this to Judge Chutkan to suggest a mini trial, to describe and define the contours of what an official act would be, how to give it to a jury? Would that have been a prudent course you as a judge would have welcomed or was this something that binds the hands of a judge that it did not even get to her? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER JUDGE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT: I think part of it is that he really did not want to continue with the indictment that he had. He did not want to put Chutkan in a position of having to make decision, what is an official act, what isn't an official act in there, and start parsing out portions of the indictment. That would only lead to more appeals and more rigor. I think that he wanted to present her with as clean an indictment as he possibly could. I think that there is one thing in the indictment that kind of troubles me with what Jim had to say, and that is that there is a reference to Mark Meadows, not by name, but as his chief of staff, and then tried to make a portion of what he did, not within the bounds of his presidential duties. That is by saying he also acted as a campaign worker, he coordinated things, trying to remove Meadows from the position of being in there. That's the only chink in this indictment that bothers me.

But Donald Trump had a post out tonight, and I'll read it. He says, it is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election, but they just have taken such action. Voting starts on September 6th. Therefore, the DOJ has violated its own policy election interference, he concludes. All of these comrade Kamala/Biden hoaxes should be immediately dismissed. Marcus, let me bring you in here because, yes, there is a policy, it's not written in law, it's not something that is written in stone, it's a policy, a guideline of sorts to suggest what you would influence, but this is already the identical charges that have already been brought, nothing has changed to the actual text of them.

The bottom line is a superseding indictment is always a little different flavor than an original indictment. And a policy is unenforceable no matter how much you want to talk. And I could talk for six hours about weaponization, about singular treatment of Donald Trump, of differences in this investigation and prosecution than anything I saw in my 27 years as a prosecutor. But, but it doesn't really matter. The moment, you know, you're not going to get a lot of leverage saying they've broken their own policy. You could argue that, you know, the 60-day policy is -- was written or was kind of created before there was early voting, so it doesn't matter that it has been 70 days. It's not -- you know, that's -- that's a momentary tweet in the wind. It's not going to really matter legally in terms of what happens next. The only thing I want to go back to really quick, Laura, whether I forfeit my 20 bucks or not, I think this idea that the vice president wears two hats is another instance kind of like Mark Meadows, where Jack Smith is determined to get Meadows and Pence on the witness stand. He was able to get them in grand jury as if there was no such thing as executive privilege. He wants them for this case. And so, he's out on a limb. And again, if the judge disagrees at a hearing, and there's going to be a hearing about what stuff is fair game and what stuff is not, if she disagrees that Pence doesn't really wear two hats when it comes to a president talking to his vice president, that's going to be a problem too, I think.",

The mics will likely be muted for the ABC debate between Trump and Harris on September 10th.

It's unclear if they'll be allowed to bring notes on the stage, but the Harris campaign says the debate negotiations are ongoing.

A traveling press pool is with her at all times.The most important interview she can continue to do is interviewing with the American people because that's who is ultimately going to decide whether or not she gets the biggest political promotion in her life. So, I think this interview, a couple things have to happen. Number one, is survive in advance. Don't make a mistake. However, she cannot fall into this idea of playing not to lose. She must play to win. So, part of her journey over the next 70-something days is to continue introducing herself to the American people.

It is not an opportunity for political appointees to decide they don't like the election results and delay or stop the certification or to conduct even any kind of inquiry.There's another path for that in Georgia and in every other state. There's a path to legally challenge those results. In fact, in Georgia, certification is a precondition to following that path. So, what we could see happening, if the current configuration of the state board in Georgia is successful, it could facilitate an effort to delay or even stop certification, presumably only if the candidate that they don't like wins. And because a presidential election has a ticking clock that keeps ticking, there are certain dates that cannot be moved. December 11th is the date of ascertainment of electors, which Governor Kemp will have to sign. December 17th is the meeting of electors. January 6th, of course, the joint session of Congress. There could be a really desperate attempt to try to delay or stop those efforts. As Secretary Raffensperger alluded, though, I think this ultimately, this desperate attempt, will fail even if the state board is successful at this point, but it could give oxygen to false claims that an election was stolen, which could lead to some volatility and potentially violence.",

What I know of Georgia election law, though, is that it clearly states that certifying an election by the deadline set in Georgia statutes is a statutory requirement. It is the duty sworn by members of the state board of elections.And if they fail to do that or if they pursue a path that would potentially lead to that, there might be grounds under Georgia law for the governor to remove it. It's clear he's trying to follow the law here. He's asking the attorney general for guidance on what his authority is with regard to removal. It's clear that he's not particularly happy with the mess that the state board has become. It's very clear that Secretary Raffensperger, by his own words, is not happy with it. And it should also be noted, this is a fairly recent development. Up until a few months ago under a previous configuration of the board, Republicans and Democrats were working fairly well together on that state board of elections. This is after recent removals of some Republican members and replacements with other Republican members where they are now appearing at political rallies. Political appointees who have responsibility over elections is something I've never heard of. That is a real problem. It is clear that the executive branch in Georgia, even though they're led by Republicans, is taking this very seriously.",

Their ruling? Once a candidate files nomination papers, they're on the ballot -- quote -- \"except in case of death.\"Now, another third-party candidate who can stay on the Wisconsin ballot, Cornel West. He's one of three third-party candidates now still in the race. And it's the first time that West has qualified for the ballot in a swing state. It caps a string of recent ballot victories for Dr. West. But sometimes, elections can create some pretty strange bedfellows. Democrats have backed some of the ballot challenges against West. And it appears that the left- wing West has an ally in his corner, the Republican Party. Reports suggest that GOP operatives are aiding in West's quest to get on the ballot. Why? Well, West could possibly peel away voters from Harris. And in an election that could be decided on the margins, every single vote matter. But how they're doing it? Perhaps raising some eyebrows in Arizona where West did not qualify. One voter told the Associated Press she didn't know people visiting her home to collect her signatures were Republican-aligned operatives, adding her signature was -- quote -- \"forged.\" Now, independent presidential candidate Cornel West joins me now, and he certainly has taken issue with the association of those who have done the latter of which we speak. Dr. West, good evening. I'm glad that you are here because I would love for you to address some of the things that are being said. In particular, Dr. West, you're being criticized as somehow a spoiler for Democrats specifically, in part because you have received Republican support to get on the ballot. What is your reaction to the criticism and who do you think your supporters will ultimately vote for if you yourself were not on the ballot? CORNEL WEST (I), 2024 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Appreciate the question. Always a joy to be in conversation with you. Your brilliance is undeniable, my dear sister. It's always a blessing to talk with you.",

It's sad to see, you know, Brother Kennedy has a right to be wrong, but he's siding with fascists. It's immoral. But if they only respond to fascism when all of this lies in crimes, it's going to be more lies and crimes, then that's not a genuine antifascism. You're just postponing it.
