House Republicans today, it took them weeks and weeks and weeks to resolve some internal family differences. And we'll see in the end if they have the votes they expect that they will.They're passing there what they call the Secure the Border Act. It resumes border wall construction, has new asylum application fees, more funding for Border Patrol and border technology would reinstate the remain in Mexico policy. Democrats in the Senate say, sorry, we don't like this. Is there any chance? I know the administration doesn't like a lot of this. It makes it harder for a path to legal immigration, for example. However, both sides do say we should have more border security personnel. Both sides do say we should have at least technology. There's a disagreement about the wall and barriers. Is there any chance that this becomes at least the start of a conversation or is this a House Republican bill, period?",

Donald Trump was president. Republicans have become much more dug in on this issue. They feel like the border crisis is getting worse.That when I talk to even some of those moderate Republicans who might have been negotiators in the past on this issue, on some kind of comprehensive way forward, they say it's not just Republicans who've moved to the right, Democrats are moving to the left. And that makes it much harder to find partners across the aisle. Sinema and Tillis, they have a bill that would essentially do the same thing that Title 42 is doing and give the Biden administration a little more time, a little more runway to come up with a solution. But House Republicans aren't really interested in that coming to the floor. And a lot of Senate Democrats say we don't want to do anything on immigration unless it's the entire package that we are looking for.",
