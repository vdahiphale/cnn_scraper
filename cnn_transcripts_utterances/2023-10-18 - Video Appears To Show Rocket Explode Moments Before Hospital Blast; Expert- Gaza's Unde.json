      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, breaking news. New video tonight showing a rocket fired from Gaza, exploding high above Gaza City. The video was taken just before the explosion was seen at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. And it comes as the United States has new intelligence assessments on that blast.Plus tonight, a chilling phone call. I'm going to talk to the parents of two children who were taken from the music festival here. The daughter called her father frantically screaming as they were under attack. And you'll hear her harrowing call. And the underground nightmare for Israel. We have a special report of a sprawling underground tunnel system in Gaza. The IDF calls it the Gaza metro packed with explosives, some tunnels possibly 40 feet deep inside the ground. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a very special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett live from Tel Aviv tonight. And we begin with breaking news. And this is the new video. It appears to show a rocket fired from Gaza exploding high above Gaza City which, of course, is where the hospital that was hit is located killing hundreds of people sheltering inside, according to the Palestinians' latest numbers. Now, in this video, you can see the rocket fired from an area in northern Gaza, suddenly it makes a sharp turn back towards where it was fired. A streak of fire can be seen as the rocket flies significantly faster back towards where it was fired. That's gravity. Suddenly the rocket explodes. Now, in a second you're going to see that flash of light at the bottom of your screen as the camera pans down, a second flash of light and an explosion at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex was seen. Now, it's not clear that these two things are related. But I just want to watch it again in slow motion so you can see where the rocket turns around because obviously that's crucial. It's fired from Gaza. It is the turnaround that becomes so crucial as to whether it was an Islamic Jihad fired rocket that struck that hospital. On the ground, this was the moment of the explosion outside that hospital, a massive blast like what we saw in the video of the rocket exploding. Now, the United States National Security Council has released a statement just a few moments ago that reads, and I quote: The United States government assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday. Now, images somewhere that we just saw on the video of the rocket exploding, turning around, whether United States says, what Israel has put out, the reality of it is this does little to nothing to change the minds of many people across the Middle East. Protesters in the streets today in the West Bank Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt, Tunisian, and Lebanon. In fact, tonight, this is what we saw in Lebanon, thousands gathering outside Israeli embassy. And in Turkey, it was the U.S. consulate there says, in Adana, is now closed until further notice, and you know how many people were gathered in Adana, Turkey, reportedly, in front of the U.S. embassy? Eighty thousand people, 80,000 people to protest what is happening in Gaza. And President Biden who is now on his way home after visiting Israel earlier today was asked aboard Air Force One for his message to those who do not believe U.S. intelligence and he said this.

They are dealing with daily strikes, like this one, from earlier today.Just today, we hear the thuds here, that explosions there. There isn't communication towers have been destroyed. There's little fuel to run the backup generators at hospitals, right? They need fool fuel to re- power and that is running dangerously low.

The CNN crew in the area did hear those sounds of incoming fire from Israel at around the time the IDF said they were firing, we know that Hezbollah said that they had targeted Israeli targets just over the border inside northern Israel.That would've been earlier on Wednesday, but the details of what has been part targeted right now, I guess we'll have to wait to hear that when the IDF gives an update. What we are hearing right now in Gaza, a little uptick in the shelling. We were hearing some from very heavy shelling close to the border, and right now, it sounds a bit different distant. Gaza City where that hospital is about seven and a half miles from here and hard to say precisely where the destinations are that we're hearing, but they could be hearing that kind of distance away, around Gaza City, and again the IDF telling civilians in that area they should leave and try to find a humanitarian rounding out of the toward the south.",

The United States is saying Israel is not responsible, and they're not -- they're not going off of the IDF information, which, of course, we have had our fingertips on today. The U.S. has done its own analysis, they're pointing specifically to intelligence, as well as missile activity, missile activity as well as images of the incident and open source video such that we have all been showing you, likely to show you that new video tonight. One such video that Israel says shows that it wasn't responsible isthis one from an Al Jazeera news camera. It appears to show rocket fire from Gaza exploding above Gaza City, right, and that happened moments before you see the explosion of the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. The IDF also releasing this audio of a conversation they say is between two jihad opportunities, discussing the firing of the rocket. We haven't been able to independently verify this recording, but I want to play it for you. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) HAMAS OPERATIVE #2: They are saying it belongs to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. HAMAS OPERATIVE #1: It's from us? HAMAS OPERATIVE #2: It looks like it. HAMAS OPERATIVE #1: They shot it coming from the cemetery behind the Al-Ma'amadani Hospital, and it misfired and fell on them.

I mean, it does take time, but interestingly over the course of today, their statements appeared to only get stronger in saying that they did not believe that Israel was responsible for this attack.And in the morning, we get a statement from the National Security Council saying that they were still collecting information but that based on overhead satellite imagery as well as analysis of available open source imagery and video, they had determined that Israel was likely not responsible for this. But later on in the day, we got a bit of a stronger statement from the National Security Council saying that the U.S. government now assesses that Israel was not responsible for the explosion, and it was based on available intelligence including missile activity and open source video and images. Now, interestingly, in that statement, they also pointed to, apparently, intercepted conversations. It is unclear whether they are the same conversation that you just played there between Hamas operatives, according to the IDF, but they said that this intelligence indicates that some of these Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip were actually confused about this and we're discussing amongst themselves the possibility that this was actually an errant rocket that was launched by a militant offshoot called Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And so, the U.S. seemingly now taking the position that Israel really did not do this, and all of this comes, we should know, Erin, as the U.S., we are told, has actually surged intelligence assets to the region in the wake of this Hamas terror attack in Israel because they need to keep an eye on potential activity by Hezbollah or Iran in the possibility that he ultimately join the conflict. So the U.S. pretty confident here as we heard from President Biden, that they don't believe Israel was responsible.",

They -- I'm sorry, they specifically mentioned missile intelligence, Director.I know, you know, you were involved in MH-17 and how the U.S. was able to use missile analysis to determine that it was Russia responsible, right, with that BUK missile.

And that heat, those properties, the heat and light can be detected and measured from afar.And you can glean a great deal of technical intelligence about the nature of the explosion, its duration, the magnitude of it, direction of fire. There are a lot of ancillary information that could be gleaned from capitalizing on the laws of physics and the fact that missiles and explosives give off heat and light. When you marry that up, when you meld it with the other forms of intelligence, whether classified or open source, which is also very revelatory, you begin to put together the puzzle. And when the puzzle pieces fit, and it appears to me they do just as they did with the shoot-down of MH-17, I think that's what gave the U.S. confidence to assess that Israel was not responsible.",

So, on this hospital blast, Israel has put all the information out, the U.S. has supported it. It may not matter to many people. But do you have any questions in your mind about this at this point? EFRAIM HALEVY, FORMER DIRECTOR OF MOSSAD, ISRAEL'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICE: I have no questions at all about it. I have been looking at it all day and seeing how this story has evolved, and there is such an accumulation of sources now, which make this claim of the house, not a claim, but an established fact. And I think that, unfortunately, Hamas has taken this tragedy, which they have caused, and have turned it into a weapon, one of their weapons. But I think that we will have to continue the way we are at the moment and prepare now for the next stage of the campaign against the Hamas. BURNETT: The war that you are in. Now, I'm curious, obviously, in your role as director running national intelligence and Mossad, the responsibility for the attack itself. But as Israel prepares for the next steps, which will be significant ground incursion of some sort, perhaps, or who knows what form it will take, do you feel that there's any fear inside Israeli intelligence that, because they missed this, that they might not know what they don't know now?",

Just to give you a sense of how broad the effort is, Nigerian Mercy Corp. As Israel is beginning to prepare a ground assault on Gaza, there are so many challenges for them and perhaps the biggest is the underground tunnel system that the IDF actually calls the Gaza metro. It's a considerable maze of tunnels. It obviously could easily conceal an ambush and be boobytrapped. Also they say hostages there could also be filled with explosives ready to cave in on anyone who attempts to go inside. I'm going to go straight to Tom Foreman, because he has been looking at everything we understand and know about these tunnels at the magic wall.

Going to get big equipment in there and then it's reinforced with concrete so it cannot easily collapse.How long are they? Well, really when you're considering that Gaza itself is only about 25 by 6 miles, very long. One estimate holds that the tunnels may wind around for more than 300 miles. How deep? That is unknown. Estimates run from maybe 30 or 40 feet down to much farther. Although that would suggest some surprisingly sophisticated engineering considering how in these photos, many of these tunnels really appear to be quite cramped.

And, lastly, they offer a safe space, unreachable by many standard munitions. In some cases, it really could take a very hefty bunker buster type of bomb to be able to go in and smash through these reinforced areas under the ground like that and actually do any damage.

Just, for example, showers, places where people can rest, storage areas, the firing shafts, explosive tunnels.

Will Ripley is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Russian President Vladimir Putin, an accused war criminal in the West, a guest of honor in Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping feasting with a fellow strongman, triumphantly toasting their vision of a new world order, a world prioritizing Palestinians over Western-backed Israel, pitting the Putin/Xi world against the U.S.-led free world. Russia and China refusing to strongly condemn the Hamas attack. Putin placing blame on the U.S. for the conflict, not Hamas gunmen, who also took Russian lives. Both Beijing and Moscow criticizing Israel's actions, condemning Tuesday's deadly hospital blast. The Palestinians say hundreds died. Russia calling it an act of dehumanization, urging Israel to prove its innocence. China says Israel played a part in provoking Palestinian rage, decades of diplomacy without a two-state solution. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Israel has the right to establish a state. Palestinian has the right to establish a state as well.",

President Xi welcomed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in June, part of Beijing's bid for a bigger role for Mideast diplomacy and a desire to reshape the U.S.-led world order. Building on the historic deal it brokered this year, restoring ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia. China says it's sending a special envoy to the Middle East to help with the political settlement. China and Russia now calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, positioning themselves as possible peacemakers, both ignoring the irony of Putin's own brutal war, spilling blood on the battlefields of Ukraine. Far from the front lines, the leaders and representatives of some 140 nations are expected here in the Chinese capital. Leaders of key Western allies noticeably absent. A perfectly timed distraction from Putin's problems at home, parading himself before friendly state media outlets, Putin is heaping praise on China's powerful leader and Russia's loyal patron, Xi Jinping. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): He makes long long-term plans for the future. It's what differentiates the true world leaders from what we call temps.
