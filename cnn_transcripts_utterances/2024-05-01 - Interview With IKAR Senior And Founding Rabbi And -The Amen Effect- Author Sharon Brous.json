I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Police have again moved onto American campuses from coast to coast. Over a thousand people have been arrested at more than 25 colleges. And today, the New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, blamed outside agitators for creating chaos, he said, at Columbia University. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY): Young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children. At the request of Columbia University, after speaking with them throughout the week, at their request and their acknowledgement that outside agitators were on their grounds training and really coopting this movement.

House Speaker Mike Johnsonsays Republicans plan to target campus unrest \"like white on rice,\" pressuring colleges to further crack down on demonstrations. At the heart of it all, mostly peaceful protests against a dire situation in Gaza and a deep dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in the region. Even now, Israel stands by plans to invade Rafah, where more than a million Palestinian refugees lack even the basics to sustain life, that's according to Doctors Without Borders. And so, how does society find moral clarity in a moment such as this, in the face of antisemitic and anti-Palestinian hate? How do universities stand up for the fundamental right of students to protest peacefully, as they have done in the past, against U.S. policy over the Vietnam War, or South Africa's apartheid regime? Or even the global student movement that took up Greta Thunberg's call to skip class for a day and save our planet from manmade climate change? Rabbi Sharon Brous is the founder of IKAR, an influential, progressive Jewish congregation in Los Angeles. And last week, she visited both Columbia and UCLA to witness the protests, and she is joining us right now. Welcome back to our program, Rabbi.",

There was clearly a sense of both belonging and shared purpose and shared grief in that space. And that is really critical. And so, what I think is important is to acknowledge and call out where the language is violent, vitriolic, and maximalist so that there can be a protest movement that is a protest for peace, that is actually using the moral imagination that college students are so good at mustering to imagine what a different kind of future might be possible. But there's a kind of gaslighting that's happening, Christiane, right now, when Jewish students -- when many Jewish students say that they don't feel safe on campus because some of this rhetoric is truly egregious and violent. People are saying, no, no, no, it's all peaceful. Kids are braiding each other's hair and sharing food with each other. And that's not helpful either. Now, what I saw on UCLA's campus on Sunday, which I think is a precursor to what we saw on UCLA's campus last night was something -- was essentially the equivalent, but this time with a calling in of extremists from the pro- Israel side who came onto campus. And I saw them after the formal program ended, when essentially there was a group of Palestinian solidarity students who are all standing together and then Israel solidarity students who are -- not students, activists who are outside of them and there was a conflagration. And we are really lucky that it did not turn more violent than it was because you have a kind of fueling of extremism here. And literally, I was trying to weave in between these two camps saying to people, look, we need to deescalate. You need to go home. This is not helping anybody for you to be here. And God forbid, somebody gets truly hurt in one of these conflicts.",

And what I understand as of last night was that Columbia had actually made a very similar offer to what the Brown administration offered. And that these negotiations were moving forward until this group occupied Hamilton Hall and there was violence in that building. And so, that's what made them call the police. And I want to -- I think it's really important to know that they were actually trying -- they were in the midst of these negotiations first, but this is absolutely a model. There have to be grownups in the room. And, Christiane, I want to tell you what -- one thing that I witnessed when I was at UCLA on Sunday amidst these protests and counter-protests and increasingly violent language, and it seemed like people were gunning for a fight. That's what I saw. There was a group of people there who identify with standing together, which is an organization of Israelis and Palestinians who are working together to build a just and shared future. And in this city, in Los Angeles, there happens to be a Palestinian citizen of Israel who's married to an Israeli Jew and they're here in Los Angeles and they together lead the chapter in L.A. And I found my way over to this group and together we were walking through the -- around the encampment trying to help de-escalate. And one of the students -- I mean, one of the people who leads this group started chanting, in Gaza and Tel Aviv, all children deserve to live. In Gaza and Tel Aviv, all children deserve to live. And I saw something absolutely breathtaking happen, which is we're right in between the Palestine solidarity camp on one side and the pro-Israel camp on the other. And people on both sides started to clap and started to say those words because those words actually make sense. And when you're fed a diet of extremism, you think the only answer is eliminations. For my people to have justice, your people must be wiped out, but it's not true. We have been fed falsehood. And in fact, they're -- the only response to this will be when Israelis and Palestinians figure out how to build a just and shared future. So, that's the grown-up voice in the space. That's the de-escalation voice. You're right to want justice. You're right to be concerned about safety. So are we. And our safety is tied up in one another.",

So, I again was struck by what you posted on Instagram where you actually said, you know, I think -- if I'm not misquoting, you said, Palestinians are not Hamas. In other words, they are not that movement. Maybe there are some, but it's not all Palestinians. And you were very, you know, insistent in your sermon to your congregation that these people, a people had to have the right.

He basically said, are not these students, from varied backgrounds, who are supporting the Palestinians, only doing what we have taught them to do? Have we not taught them about the Holocaust and never again? And can we be surprised if the lesson many of them draw is that you need to be on the lookout for genocide, and to stand up and be counted and not a bystander when you believe you see it happening? So, I'm not asking you to declare on the genocide word. I'm just wondering what you think about that.

It's so critical that they also use their voices to speak out against virulent antisemitism, which also only undermines the cause and only underlying undermines the movement. And I just -- I do want to point out that I've seen a few people in the last few days who've really done this. I saw one Palestinian Muslim theologian in Chicago -- in Michigan, who stood up at a protest and said, there is no room for antisemitism in this movement. It undermines our call to justice. And we need to see more people doing that just as I -- in my own Jewish community are saying, there is no room for the kind of anti- Palestinian sentiment and anti-Arabism that I saw on UCLA's campus among the counter-protesters on Sunday. There is no place for that kind of vitriol and that kind of violent language in in our movements. What we need to do is use our moral imagination and create a language and a rhetoric that will help lead us not toward more violence, but ultimately, toward peace.",

We need to turn toward one another with compassion, with curiosity and with care. And that group is a very distinct and small minority right now, but it exists. And that's where the hope is for me, because we have to pull away from these very rigid extremes. They will lead us only toward more heartache and more anguish. I pray to God, this war needs to end. The hostages need to be returned. The staggering death toll in Gaza needs to be grieved publicly. They need massive amounts of humanitarian aid immediately.

And there was a group called the European Monitoring Center that was tasked with doing reports about racism, xenophobia, and antisemitism and have put out a report in the end of 2004 that found, in fact, that the -- some of the attacks were (INAUDIBLE) not only the traditional suspects, white supremacists and others, but also by young Arab and Muslim folks in some outskirts of Paris and other places like that. So, the data was right. But they said, we have a problem and that we have all these different countries that have people that are collecting information and no common score sheet, no common definition of what to look at. And then they also said, well, we're going to have a temporary definition that's going to look at issues of antisemitism based on stereotypes, about Jews. And they went through that exercise and said, what do we do if a Jew is attacked in the streets of a European city as a stand in for an Israeli? And they said, if somebody had these stereotypes and applied them to Israelis and reapplied them to Jews, that was antisemitism, but not if they were upset with Israeli policy. They said that's lamentable, but should not be counted. And that struck me as nuts basically, because I grew up at the time of the civil rights movement and I can't imagine somebody saying, well, lynching some black person is racist that they have these stereotypes about black people, but not if they were upset by a political event, Martin Luther King speech. So, it just so happened that the director of the European Monitoring Center was invited by a colleague to come to the American Jewish Committee, where I worked, for its annual meeting to talk broadly with others about what was happening in Europe. And as we saw then, as we see now, there's some discourse about Israel that's correlated with attacks on Jews, not necessarily causation, but we thought it was important to take the temperature. There were other reasons for the definition too, but that's how it started. And that's why there is real examples inside the definition.",

But, you know, all of them have also core, the basic idea that antisemitism is conspiracy theory about Jews harming humanity. And, you know, giving an explanation for what goes wrong in the world. But again, I don't want, you know, the shortcuts to be used to look at speech. And the parallel I look at is imagine if one put together a definition of racism that would also take into account some political things that may affect racism. Not to say, if you say these things are inherently racist, but they may be appropriate things to consider. So, opposition to Black Lives Matter, opposition to removal of confederate statues, opposition to affirmative action, then you can make the argument that those things might be in dishes of the temperature of racism to put into surveys and so forth. Would you want to then have a hate speech code in effect, let alone endorsed by Congress that says one has this particular view on any of these issues, they're therefore expressing racism? I don't think so. And you see the damage that that would do to the ability to even look at these things on a college campus.

We get into this sort of us versus them buckets. We get into the place where we crave simplicity. We crave certainty. We crave symbols. And I think part of what we're seeing around the question of the IRA (ph)definition and other things are questions of symbols, and we don't want to engage in the complexity of why these things are so contentious. We want somebody to tell us what side of a ledger we should put it on and not. And that's part of the concern I have about the push of the IRA (ph)definition and there are a couple of bills in front of Congress at the moment that are considering using it, more for educational purposes, also for funding issues and in Europe too. And I don't see that as different from what I object to, what, again, Governor DeSantis, not to pick on him, but what he's doing in Florida about what do we teach about gender? What do we teach about race? I may not agree with everything that's being taught. But I don't want the state to define what's OK to teach and what isn't. I want faculty and students and, you know, universities to do that. And antisemitism was a real problem, and there are Jewish students who are being intimidated, but the way to deal with it is not to use law to try to suppress speech we don't like, it's to encourage students how to treat each other, how to realize that we're all in the same community together. It's not a competition, you know, between faculty and students, but how do we engage this moment together? And why don't we have the intellectual curiosity? Aren't you curious as to why they have that view? Can't you have the emotional empathy to imagine yourself in their shoes.
