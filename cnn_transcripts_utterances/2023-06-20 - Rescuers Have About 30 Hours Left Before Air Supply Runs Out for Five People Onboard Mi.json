Rescuers think they've got about 30 hours left before the air supply runs out for five people onboard that missing submersible. The sub vanished somewhere in the North Atlantic on Sunday after heading out to see the site of the shipwrecked Titanic, nearly 13,000 feet below the surface. There are plenty of questions tonight about what went wrong and if any corners were cut with safety precautions. So, in just a moment, I'll speak to a team of experts in deep sea searches.Also tonight, Hunter Biden's plea deal, the President's son will plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and is reportedly negotiating a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve his felony gun charge. Would any of us have been offered the same deal? We have a reality check for you tonight. And a new CNN poll shows former President Trump's support is slipping following his indictment for mishandling those top secret documents. We'll show you those new numbers. But let's begin with the search mission for that missing submersible with five people on board and time running out. Miguel Marquez is in Newfoundland tonight with the latest on the search. Miguel.",

This is the sister ship to the Polar Prince that took the submersible out there, the Titan submersible out there. That's what it launched off and it is now that the Polar Prince is now taking part in the search for the submersible. There are three C-17 big military cargo jets that have landed here inSt. John's. They have tons of gear to bring on to this ship. We believe that, well, then, poured out a Canadian Coast Guard ship left earlier today and is on its way to the search area. There are planes in the air, planes to not only look on the surface, but planes to drop buoys and listen for anything coming from that submersible. The ships are doing that as well, at least the Polar Prince is. The concern here is the easy part of this operation should be locating that ship, hearing a ping from it, an emergency beacon of some sort. They have not been able to hear anything from the ship, so far. It is extremely -- the pressure is extremely great that deep down. It is extremely cold and they are running out of oxygen. And the fact that they cannot find that ship yet or that submersible yet is a great concern because the hard part will be once they find it, getting it secured and hopefully bringing those people home to safety.

Well, the investigation first was conducted by a Trump appointee, U.S. Attorney David Weiss of Delaware, specifically to reduce concern about politicized results. But of course, Hunter Biden has been demonized by the right prettythoroughly. Do you just one measure? Get this, Alexis Nexus search found that he was mentioned more than 2,200 times on Fox News between 2020 and 2022. For those doing the math at home, that's well over once a day. So, don't believe the hype. Instead, look at the cops. Now, we know that other Americans who've taken home classified national security documents often receive stiff prison sentences. It happened in several cases recently, as detailed by CNN's Daniel Dale. But willful failure to pay income tax with a guilty plea often does not result in prison time, especially if the money's been paid back with interest. And that's the deal with Hunter Biden's case. He underpaid the IRS by at least $100,000 in both 2017 and 2018 when he was admittedly a crack cocaine addict. He has since paid up and will receive probation. Now, the gun charge is a little bit stranger, but bear with me. Basically, Hunter Biden was charged with possessing a gun when he was a drug addict. That is illegal, but rarely charged standalone, unless the gun is used in a separate crime. Get this, over six months from October 22 to March of this year, federal prosecutors filed over 3800 cases of unlawful possession of firearms according to a database compiled by Syracuse University. But in only three percent of the time, failing to make a false statement to acquire the gun related to the lead charge. So, look, you can't reason someone out of something they weren't reasoned into, as the Irish author Jonathan Swift once wrote. But here's the big picture. The fact that son of the President was investigated by the government and charged is actually evidence that no one is above the law in America. That's a good thing. And that's your reality check.",

But putting that aside, yes, you would have a very good chance of getting probation if you paid back the money immediately, as Hunter Biden did.And think about this as well, because people were talking about this at the time of the investigation. Hunter Biden was a crack cocaine addict at the time of the offense conduct. That means if you are a prosecutor and you're thinking about taking this case to trial, felony trial, can you prove the mens rea to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury, right? That's a proof question. That's an issue for them. And so, as you're thinking about this case and how you charge it, that's another reason to think about trying to get a plea deal here, which is one of the reasons you saw in this demeanor.",
