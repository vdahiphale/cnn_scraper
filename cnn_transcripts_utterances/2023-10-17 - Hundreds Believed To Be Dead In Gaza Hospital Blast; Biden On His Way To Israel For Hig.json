But Israel denies that, saying it has intelligence indicating the hospital was hit by a failed Islamic jihad rocket.The blast is certainly complicating President Biden's high-stakes mission to the Middle East. He's on his way to Israel to offer a wartime show of support and to personally push for desperately needed humanitarian aid in Gaza. But a key summit with Mideast leaders was just canceled. There's also breaking news in the U.S. House speaker stalemate. Congressman Jim Jordan just set a vote for tomorrow morning on his bid to win the speakership, the GOP firebrand losing a first vote today with 20 of his fellow Republicans refusing to support him. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news in the Middle East, the deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza. Israel and Palestinian groups are at odds over who's to blame. Clarissa Ward and Erin Burnett are standing by for his life in Israel, M.J. Lee is over at the White House, as this blast threatens to become a flashpoint in the Israel-Hamas war. First, let's go to Clarissa. Clarissa, what do we know about this hospital blast?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we know that thousands of people were taking shelter in the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian officials are saying that hundreds of people have been killed and the scenes and the aftermath are just absolutely horrifying. Many of these people were seeking refuge. They thought that the hospital would be a safe place for them to go. You may remember that the IDF had ordered people to leave Northern Gaza. We've been speaking to people on the phone for the last few days. Many didn't feel it was safe or even possible to leave. And so a lot of people go to hotels, to hospitals to try to find a safe place.Now, there is a continued back and forth about who was responsible, how this happened, Palestinians on the ground pointing out that hundreds of people have been killed. That is not really consistent with the kind of death toll that you would see from a rocket. Also the enormity of the blast, the damage it did destroying that, one MSF, which is Doctors Without Borders, an NGO on the ground, one doctor said that the entire ceiling of the operating room collapsed as he was performing an operation with the force of that blast. And all of this now leading to a huge ground swell of anguish and outrage both in Gaza, the West Bank, but also across the Arab and Muslim world and beyond and really putting a huge amount of pressure onto this visit of President Biden. As you mentioned already, King Abdullah of Jordan has basically said that there will be no summit in Amman, where Biden was expected to meet with Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas, also Egyptian leader President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as well as King Abdullah, and a lot of questions now going forward as to what this means for humanitarian efforts, but also as to the real possibility of an escalation in violence here and across the region, Wolf.",

What more can you tell us about how this, this latest development, is impacting his plans?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, the president is on his way to Israel, but the White House just minutes ago announced that the Jordan portion of his trip has been canceled all together and releasing a statement for the first time addressing that hospital blast. Here is a part of that statement, the White House saying, after consulting with King Abdullah of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt. The president sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, in which a speedy recovery to the wounded. This, of course, coming after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas pulled out of that meeting that he was supposed to participate in with President Biden and other leaders in the region. This meeting was supposed to take place in Jordan after the president had concluded his meetings in Israel. And I can tell you this is going to be a very big sort of disappointing setback for this administration. We know obviously how important that meeting with President Abbas was going to be. Any chance of there being diplomatic conversations, any diplomatic efforts would need to include him. So, that is going to be a setback as far as this trip is concerned. And the fact that the president is no longer going to be meeting face- to-face with Egypt's president, President Sisi, that is a country that has been so central to all of the conversations we have been talking about in terms of the U.S. trying to secure humanitarian aid, getting into Gaza, establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that people who want to leave Gaza can leave. And I just have to stress, you know, President Biden is somebody who advisors around him will always tell you very much believes in the power of being in the room, meeting face-to-face with these leaders. So, the fact that he is no longer going to be having this meeting in person in Jordan, again, is going to be a disappointing setback. The White House has said, though, that this meeting is postponed, suggesting that they will try to have these conversations still take place. But, again, it is not going to be something that we see happen tomorrow, Wolf.",

You all were talking about how there are conflicting claims right now as to who exactly is responsible, obviously a situation that the administration is going to be incredibly careful as they wait into it.

Certainly, they said it wouldn't have impacted their plans for an invasion itself, but that they had thought maybe it would have had some sort of a positive impact on escalation. Of course, that's now off the table, at least for now.I was just speaking before joining all of you with the former head of operations for the IDF, a general. And he was saying, look, it's an incredible tragedy, what happened. It's an incredible tragedy. But the reality in his view is that Israel will still go ahead with a ground invasion. However, that actually looks like it may not be what people expect, but that there's no way around that. But there's no question it complicates it because public opinion in the world -- court of public opinion matters very deeply, Wolf.

A speaker is required to be elected to move on any legislation right now. And right now, no one can get the 217 votes needed to win the speakership, Jim Jordan losing 20 Republicans today in today's vote, he could only afford to lose three.So, behind the scenes, he's been trying to pick off members one by one. But I am told by Republican sources that his opposition could grow among the Republican ranks, something that they are trying desperately to prevent. At the same time, Wolf, there are ongoing discussions, bipartisan discussions about trying to empower the interim speaker, Patrick McHenry, give him more power in the legislative process. That is something that Jim Jordan is warning against as he tries to urge Republicans to fall in line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Nothing can be acted upon until the House elects a speaker. Whether they can do that tomorrow remains a major question, and it seems unlikely at the moment, is Jim Jordan weighs his next steps, whether to keep fighting, or whether to bow out, and potentially to another candidate who also could struggle to get the 217 votes needed, Wolf.",

It's Hamas' decision to embed itself in civilian populations in order to hide from accountability inside Gaza.

But, on the other hand, it is also clearly being more urgent because of the fact that President Biden is set to land here in Israel in a matter of hours now, really. This visit by President Biden is intended to be a strong show of solidarity by the United States with Israel in its campaign against Hamas, President Biden, and Netanyahu standing shoulder to shoulder at this moment ahead of an expected Israeli ground operation inside of Gaza. And, so, obviously, this is the last thing that they want is to have a sense that the Israeli military is responsible for a strike on a hospital in Gaza. Regardless of the evidence, this has already scuttled parts of President Biden's trip, he is not going to Jordan. But, Wolf, I do also want to talk to you about a very important conversation I had today with Yossi Landau, who is a 30-year veteran of this Zaka search and rescue group. I spoke with him today. He has been in conflict zones and visited the aftermath of terrorist attacks for the last several decades. But he has said he has never seen anything like these terrorist attacks that were perpetrated by Hamas two Saturdays ago. I need to warn our viewers that the content, the testimony you're about to hear is very graphic, and also know that CNN has not independently verified all of his testimony, that we do have evidence of similar atrocities carried out by Hamas.
