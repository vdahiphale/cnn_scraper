The funeralof Tyre Nichols is beginning right now in Memphis, we'll take you live to that city in just a moment. But we begin with breaking news from the U.S. Federal Reserve, CNN's Richard Quest is standing by in New York for us. And Richard, do we know, do we have as of yet a decision? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  I'm just going to keep looking away in various different places as I wait to see the announcement of a -- we're expecting a quarter point rise. It is a quarter point rise I am being told. The Fed has raised rates by 25 basis points in the official lease, that's a quarter point to you and me. Now, that's considerably less than the three quarter point rises that we've had so far. And what we will be waiting to see, it takes the Fed right now to just 4.5, it's a target rate of 4.5 to 4.75. So still under 5 percent. Isa, it's believed 5 to 5.25 is going to be what they call a terminal rate, when they stop raising. So the Fed is probably not done yet. I will pause for breath so you can get a question in.",

But I guess they're going for a quarter point because they know that the previous rate would not be sufficient to get inflation down to where they want, which is 2 percent. And therefore, they know they're going to have to keep raising rates. But it's best to do so cautiously, none of the bravado of three quarter percent. Do it slowly while you watch to see if the medicine is actually taking effect. Just being handed this statement -- here we go. The FOMC statement, here we go. We get, of course, that Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous -- the committee is seeking to achieve maximum employment, raise the targets rate -- here we go. The committee anticipates that ongoing increases will be appropriate. That means we're not done yet to get it down to 2 percent in determining the extent, they'll take account -- they could do percent, the lag. So in other words, they're saying, we are not done yet, but we recognize the medicine we've done so far hasn't fully taken effect. And I think this is crucial. The committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to 2 percent.",

Because it means the Fed is easing its foot off the brake, while it waits to see how fast the economy is slowing. So they've got what they wanted on that. The fact that they say they're not done yet -- quelle surprise, Isa, we had numerous Fed governors saying, look, the current rate, 4.25 to 4.5, 4.5 to 5.7 won't be enough to get rates down to -- inflation down to 2 percent. I think what you're seeing is a bit of hope dashed. They hoped that the doves(ph) might have got some wording in that would have suggested that enough has been done. The real test, Isa, the real test is going to come once inflation is down at 2.5 percent, 3 percent. Do they -- or even 4 percent. Do they give up and say, yes, we'll let it leave it there or does the Fed say, no, our integrity requires us to get this down to 2 percent.",

Any minute now, we are expecting to hear a eulogy from Reverend Al Sharpton. CNN's Ivan Rodriguez joins us now live from Memphis.

One of the reasons that people in Memphis and across this country have been asking for an end to street crime units, because often the more aggressive police officers in Memphis, that was called the SCORPION Unit, are the kinds of officers who get violent when they feel disrespected. And if you watch the videos, which is very painful to watch, I would caution anyone before watching it to make sure you're prepared. But those videos really demonstrate that they were very angry that he ran. They had to ran a while. They were winded. You hear one, the white officer, who was only later being investigated -- that was a question from the community as   well, made a comment about hoping the other officers stomped him. When I watched that video, particularly as someone who has done civilian oversight on police misconduct charges, I see police officers who wanted to punish him.",

Stay very calm, and make sure you're talking politely to police officers. Do what they tell you to do, do not run. Here's the problem. Even when we say that -- which by the way, we shouldn't have to, because quite frankly, often times, as we saw with Philando Castile, a black man who was doing all those things, he was still shot and killed. And we see it in this case with Tyre Nichols.

In fact, this is the smallest rate hike that we have seen since March. He did say, we anticipate ongoing increases where appropriate. \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" will have more in about 20 minutes. I want to take you now to the funeral of Tyre Nichols, that's underway in Memphis, Tennessee. Let's listen in. (MUSIC PLAYING) SOARES (voice-over):  Remembering the life of Tyre Nichols, 29 years of age. This is what so many people will be doing right now in Memphis, in that church there, in Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis. Representing inside that church and mourning alongside the family of Tyre Nichols as well will Tamika Palmer (ph), whose daughter, Breonna Taylor, was fatally shot in Louisville, Kentucky. We also will be expecting the younger brother of George Floyd to be part there. Of course, his name reverberated, really didn't, it across the nation, following his death in 2020 after a former policeman, a Minneapolis policeman, knelt on his neck and you know, and back for more than nine minutes. But what we are seeing and I'm sure what the family want to show this very moment is remembering the man, remembering the 29-year-old man, Tyre Nichols, who we know loved photography. We've seen that time and time again. He loved skateboarding. He is devoted -- his mother said he was a devoted son, who had tattooed his mother's name on his arm. And also, worth remembering, he was a loving father to a 4-year-old boy. And so we are -- while this is all happening, there is an investigation, of course, underway. Several police officers have been removed, then charged. Whilst we wait to hear from the reverend Al Sharpton, a eulogy is expected from him, at some point in the next hour, let's get more on Nichols' case and what we can expect going forward. I want to bring in Darrin Porcher. He's a criminal justice expert and a former lieutenant with the New York City Police Department. Thank you very much, Darrin, for joining us. And of course, we are -- as you and I talk now, we are looking at the celebration, really, of Tyre Nichols' life, so I interrupt, apologies in advance. From what I understand, the city of Memphis plans to release more videos of the beating once its investigation is complete. Do we know why they are holding onto them? Why they are not releasing them now?",

We are now learning, CNN is now learning, in the last 24 hours, that some of the officers who have been charged withinthe department, they had violations within the department.

And if an officer had violated the policies, he or she should behandled appropriately, whether it be removing that individual from the unit or creating a better source of oversight to ensure that a quintessential approach in policing occurred. And we -- I think this is just the beginning. There is a lot more that's going to come out of this. We have since disbanded the SCORPION unit but it really begs the question as to, what was the oversight and what was done from a corrective perspective to ensure that policing was done appropriately within this unit? (MUSIC PLAYING) PORCHER (voice-over):  Which we clearly saw was at fault. SOARES (voice-over):  Darrin, you say you expect much more to come out of this. What do you mean? PORCHER (voice-over):  Well, the investigation is ongoing, which is kind of at the beginning of it. Granted, we had a series of officers that were fired. But let's look to the root causes. Why did this act actually occur? What supervisory practice was in place to prevent this from happening? And so I think that you are going to see, from an organizational perspective, a dramatic change in how that department operates. SOARES (voice-over):  Let's talk about that. How would you describe the culture within police forces that has led to this tragic accident yet again? Incident, not accident; incident happening yet again? PORCHER (voice-over):  Well, whoever the chief of police is, that individual sets the policy and the tone and the temperament of that department. And so, we look at just regular operational responsibilities of policing an officer would do -- (CROSSTALK)",
