The focus of the DA's questions, the election presentation she witnessed that was put on by Trump's former attorney, Rudy Giuliani, now an unindicted co- conspirators, along with other Trump allies in front of Georgia state lawmakers in 2020. Former Georgia Democratic State Senator Jen Jordan joins us now. Jen, I appreciate the time. First, and I shouldn't (ph) really ask this question, but do you plan to comply with the subpoena?",

But the people who were actually here, who made misrepresentations, who lied, right, to officials here in Georgia with the intent to overturn the election, they were Rudy Giuliani, they were John Eastman, they were Sidney Powell. So, all of the undieted co-conspirators that y'all have been able to identify this - thus far, right, were the folks who were actually -- they were like the soldiers that were sent into the battleground states to actually implement the plan.So, whether or not they get named at the federal level eventually, I have no doubt that with respect to the indictment here on the ground that they're definitely a target.",

It's about the law and it's about holding people responsible when they break that law. So, with respect to that, she is putting together what I assume is going to be a very kind of sweeping RICO case. And when you do cases like that, they're very complicated and you have to make sure that you have all of the evidence, you know, all of the witnesses that you need to prove your case. Because what you don't want to do, I mean you don't want to take a swing at the former president of the United States and then miss. So, with respect to the evidence she's going to present before the grand jury, I have no idea who's been subpoenaed or who will eventually give testimony. But I have no doubt that her team has basically, you know, blackboarded, white-boarded, taken all the elements of the case, put the witnesses up, who do we need to get this piece of evidence in, because at the end of the day it's going to be a closely watched trial. But also, you know, it's so important because if he isn't held accountable for what he's done, and if the other people aren't, you know, what does that really say ultimately about our justice system?",

And in some ways it makes sense that, you know, the district attorney here in Georgia, hers is going to be last because really I think her case is going to be the most significant and probably bring in way more people even than the federal indictment that we saw released that was yesterday.So, look, there are 75 witnesses before the special grand jury. Seventy-five. They met for weeks and weeks. They know exactly who they want to bring in to present the evidence that then they want to present at trial. They'll get the indictment and then we're going to proceed to trail. And, look, I think they're going to have a case that is going to be -- I think it's going to be pretty lock tight. I mean and - and I think if people actually listen and have open hearts and open minds and see what was really going on behind the scenes because all we know, right, is what we know that's public. So, I can't even imagine what they've discovered and what their investigators have discovered. And we just need to listen and we need to learn and we need to understand that it doesn't matter who you are in this country, you can be the former president of the United States but you cannot break the law and you will be held accountable.",

And this is a mathematical impossibility, unless you want to say it's a total fraud. If you signed your name as Santa Claus it would go through. There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. But after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrive without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes. In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted.

Bush, Alberto Gonzales. He now serves as the dean of the Belmont University College of Law.Both the Justice Department and the White House Counsel Office playing pretty significant roles in these 45 pages of the indictment. To start, though, what's your reaction based on what you've seen in the indictment so far? ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, it's a -- I think it's a strong - strong indictment. It's pretty straightforward. Pretty clean. You know, it's been described as historic, unprecedented, momentous. I'd like to perhaps add a different word, which is potentially perilous. You know, I think the words and actions that are described in the indictment portray a picture that puts tremendous stress on our government institutions, it puts tremendous stress on the rule of law. And I was thinking about Attorney General Merrick Garland.  You know, the attorney general is viewed by many as sort of the guardian of the rule of law. That's the job of the attorney general heading up the Department of Justice. In this particular case, the attorney general is recused, and rightly so given the fact that his boss is going to be the Democratic nominee for president. And so, you know, I suspect that while he may have great confidence in Jack Smith, nonetheless, he was confirmed -- Merrick Garland was confirmed for his intellect, his character, his experience and integrity. And that's not on the table here in perhaps one of the most momentous cases in our nation's history. And the outcome of which will have a tremendous impact on the opinion of the Department of Justice and the rule of law in the minds of many in this country. And so, you know, again, he probably has great confidence in Jack Smith, but also perhaps, you know, very, very curious about how this is going to proceed because the outcome, I think, could have tremendous ramifications again for the country and for the Department of Justice.",
