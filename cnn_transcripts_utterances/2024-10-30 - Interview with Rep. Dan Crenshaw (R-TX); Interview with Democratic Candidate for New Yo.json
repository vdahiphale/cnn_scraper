In this most nail-biting American election, candidates are making their so- called closing arguments to the American people. Speaking from the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. last night, Where Donald Trump had rallied his supporters on January 6th, Kamala Harris reminded voters of the Capitol insurrection and Trump's outspoken threats to democracy. Meantime, the GOP is feeling bullish, looking at the number of ballots being returned by registered Republicans, with far more voting early than four years ago. And yet, Donald Trump continues to stoke fears of widespread voter fraud, making unfounded allegations to assert that if he doesn't win, the whole thing is rigged. Congressman Dan Crenshaw was among a handful of Texas Republicans who voted to certify the 2020 presidential election. Today though, he is sitting firmly in Trump's camp and promoting his vision for America. And he's joining us from Texas right now. Congressman Crenshaw, welcome to the program. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  Thanks for having me.",

Now, the vice president last night,basically, or recently, held a rally in your neighborhood in Texas, in Houston, which we know is not a battleground state, but she called Texas ground zero in the fight for reproductive freedom. Given the fact that there's this big gender gap, as you know, particularly amongst young people in this election, how is that message moving the needle and for Republicans?",

We've had multiple statewide elections since we put intoplace one of the strongest prolife policies in the country, and Republicans statewide continue to win by 10 points. And you know -- and I think more and more people are waking up to the fact that reproductive freedom doesn't necessarily mean kill a baby. You know, let's be honest about what we're talking about. Let's not use euphemisms for the actions that are being taken. And so, look, Republicans like myself are going to continue to be pro-life and continue to fight for that because it's the common-sense thing to do, it's the human thing to do, it's the right and moral thing to do. So, does it affect Texas? I'm not so sure. Does it affect other states? It really depends. It's state by state and it depends oftentimes on what is on the ballot. Democrats have been clever in getting this question put on the ballot. And then, they complain that Roe v. Wade is overturned, but all Roe v. Wade did, being overturned, because it was a terrible legal decision to begin with, any lawyer would admit that, all it did was democratize the issue, which I thought was -- what we were supposed to do in America, have policy debates about difficult issues and decide them at the state level, which is what's happening.",

I mean, any poll that you've seen for the last 20 years shows that about 60 to 70 percent of people think that abortion past 12 weeks, it shouldn't be allowed. It should be illegal. And Trump's position has been to -- actually to not even do that, but to say that there should be no federal ban and that it should be left to the states. So, Trump is a far more moderate candidate if people are actually being objective about what moderation is. The extreme position in this case is to be in favor of what just about every Democrat is in favor of, which is abortion on demand at any time in a pregnancy. That's not the case in Europe, and just about every country in Europe would scoff at that idea. Since the -- since European laws are usually prevent abortion in the past 12 weeks. Only here do we have these extreme abortion measures that Democrats support. And I think people should understand what the difference is.",

Certification process is completely illegal and unconstitutional. It was unconstitutional the last three times when Democrats did it and it was unconstitutional last time when Republicans did it. It's been unconstitutional this entire time. There's no -- the word certification is not in the constitution. There is no power for the vice president or the Congress to certify or decertify an election. So, we have to start there. I think everybody should know that. Democrats opened the door on this. They started it and it has become this accepted process ever since, which is really, really bad for our republic. So, let me start with that. To the extent that you don't certify -- I mean, you know, you're asking me hypotheticals in a situation that I can't predict. But I can say that the entire process is wrong to begin with and what we should have done since then is clarify the law, because that particular law that we're in process that we're following is based on the reconstruction era when there was actual shadow governments and shadow electors being sent to the Washington and there had to be a methodology for sorting that out. That's obviously not what the case is right now. So, I think we have to go back in time a little bit and tell some truth about what the actual process is and what the constitution says.",

I mean, most laws that get put in -- actually signed into law are bipartisan kind of by necessity. So, it happens a lot more than people realize and we shouldn't be -- and we should applaud that. We should make people feel better. As far as bucking your own party, I mean, I don't even think this is the case. I've bucked my own party, my own narratives pretty handedly. In this case, I simply stated what I think is the obvious, which is how can you have an opinion on something before you've read it? You know, and that's what I call the height of stupidity. And I still feel that way. You know, does it get you in trouble a little bit, but you know what, that's -- the truth can and often does and people don't want to hear a truth that they don't want to hear.

This is actually a very big question in a democracy, whether you actually set your military against your own people, which is, as far as I know, I think it's anti- constitutional in the United States.",

Does it mean he's going to do it? Of course not. And you might be able to justify those fears a little bit more if you'd never seen him govern, but you saw him govern for four years. And it turns out that in those four years we had pretty normal lives. We had a pretty good economy. We actually had pretty good foreign policy too, despite the -- many of the fears about what he was going to do on the foreign policy front. He actually governed well. Trump tends to understand the weight of the office that he holds and he does listen to advisers, good, smart people. So, four years to observe and then also observe the outcomes associated with those four years, maybe I'd be more worried, but the reality is that those four years compared to Kamala Harris' four years, I mean, they're night and day. And the outcomes associated with each of those four years, especially on the economy, they're night and day. And especially on foreign policy as well. They're night and day. One is better. And Trump's is better. Harris' is not. And so, that's what this election fundamentally is about. Again, I'm all for objective analysis. We can throw arrows at each other talking about who's the worst person and who said what yesterday about so and so and how bad and mean they are because of it. Look, in the end, I want people to think about one thing, which is what matters to you and your family at the kitchen table. And those things are the basics, right? It's how expensive is your food at the grocery store? How fast is your -- how fast are your wages increasing under Trump? The lowest quintile of earners wages increased like 15 percent overall 8 percent, under Biden, zero, because inflation canceled it all out. Mortgage rates doubled under Biden.

I think you're seeing a lot of the same names from the lastadministration who will probably be in this next administration. So, again, I don't have the insider scoop on who exactly will be doing what, but I have a pretty good idea. And this is especially important for foreign policy, let's say. You're going to have a pretty normal set of people there. And look, on the economy, I just want to say one thing. You have to connect policies to good economic outcomes. You can't just say, look, somebody is president now, the economy is doing better, and I appreciate you at least said it right. Biden didn't create those jobs, the economy did, which is exactly right. And we don't have access to a counterfactual multiverse, OK, where we can say, well, it would have been better or it would have been worse had he not done this or this. But you at least have to make -- and Democrats at least have to make the argument that we increase these jobs because of X, Y, and Z policies that Biden put in place. The reality is what they've put in place, Biden and Harris have put in place, are trillions of dollars' worth of costs of regulations, increase in taxes. They've done nothing that's pro-growth. So, we are growing in many ways and we are doing better but that's despite those policies. And I can make the exact opposite argument under Trump when you have tax cuts, when you have less regulations, all of these are pro- business, pro-growth policies. And so, the outcomes, are anticipated to be good, and exactly that, they were. Biden inherited a recovering economy from COVID. You know, in the quarters previous to Biden taking office, the GDP was growing by 35 percent in one quarter, and then 6 percent, and then 5 percent. Most of the gains of employment were happening because it was in recovery mode. And so, you have to take all of that into context, if you're going to properly analyze who's doing a better job.",

No question. We're better off than we were four years ago. But more to the point, the idea that Trump wasn't able to do much damage. I mean, put on your history lesson lens. You know, we had an attack on our Capitol in the base back of a lie that Trump propagated. If a Democratic president had lied about an election, tried to overturn it that led to an attack on a Capitol, I think Dan Crenshaw would be condemning that person and he'd be right to do it. We need to stop this situational ethics. We need to put country over -- party principles over party. And the fact is, as you pointed out, that 40 of 44 cabinet officials who work for Donald Trump are warning that he's a threat to the Republic. Take that seriously. Take that real serious. And that's the prism with which I think we should look at this election, the message America sends to the world if we reward someone for trying to overturn an election on the back of a lie that led to an attack on our Capitol. And then there's everything else from questions of reproductive freedom to rebuilding the middle and rebuilding the middle class and the policies in action and why we need to make that change.

Do you believe that on these big issues, the economy and on immigration that the administration has actually told a successful story around the numbers? Look, Trump claims that at least 21 million people have illegally crossed the border during the Biden administration. We checked the facts through September, the country has recorded under 11 million nationwide encounters with migrants during the Biden administration, including millions who are rapidly expelled from the country. The high-end estimate is that about 2 million have crossed during the Biden administration. So, that's one set of facts on migration and immigration. And then, of course, violent crime has gone down in cities. That -- I don't know whether it's getting out. You tell me what people are saying.

And I think the administration cantell the story more strongly, particularly around immigration. We've seen border crossings down dramatically since July, but they were too high in the first place. And we need that bipartisan border security bill. On the economy, I think, you know, we're moving in the right direction, but it'll never be fast enough. That's why it's important to point out facts. We can have a fact-based debate. It's important to have a fact-based debate around crime. I'm a tough on crime guy, worked for Rudy Giuliani once upon a time. But the fact is that violent crime rose under Donald Trump and it's fallen under Joe Biden. I think narratives are stubborn things, particularly in an era of partisan -- hyper partisan media ecosystems, where people get their talking points, and you see people become captive to those talking points, particularly in partisan structures. You heard Dan Crenshaw just do it a moment ago, where he couldn't confront certain facts because he's got a party to answer to, even though he can be independent on some issues. The other night in my debate, my opponent couldn't -- Nick LaLota couldn't even bring himself to criticize Donald Trump's praise of Hitler, which I thought was the lowest bar in American politics, but apparently, it's not because of this atmosphere of fear. And I think that's what people are sick of. You know, I've been focused on rebuilding the middle of our politics, rebuilding the middle of our economy. We need to take action on areas that are of deep concern, like border security, so that -- just like Democrats in particular need to be tough on crime because people -- you know, if people feel unsafe, they'll put other things to the side. But the fact is, there's more than unites us than divides us. Polls show that. Our politics doesn't reflect it. But that's what people need and want to see. And when Republicans take positions that are outside the vast majority of the American people, like on choice, they're on the wrong side.

But this is a classic swing district. It's a purple district in a blue state. And I think that's exactly where we can make some gains, because it demands the politics of addition, not division. They're actually more registered independent voters in our district here than any other district in New York State. And I think you're seeing the enthusiasm for Donald Trump has fallen. The hardcore supporters are still intense, but there is not that broad based support that there was. Instead, we have Republicans for Avlon, which has been an important part of building that broad coalition. Because people -- if they're Reagan Republicans, Bush Republicans, want to turn the page on this craziness. They want to move past this tribal divide. And I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing momentum. You know, that poll you showed was a week ago, but it showed clear momentum in our direction, and that's neck and neck within the margin of error. So, I like very much where we are. I believe we are fighting the good fight. And it's really about putting country over party, as you mentioned. I'm not a party first person. I'm a country over party guy. I wasn't independent when I was a journalist, and I see this as a continuity of the fact-based fight. I've tried to wage against hyper partisanship, warning about those dangers because they're so clear and present right now. But here on Long Island, on the eastern end of Long Island, we're seeing that broad patriotic coalition coming together, and the energy and the momentum is on our side, and I think that's where we can help reset American politics, rebuild the middle, and restore faith that we can reason together again using common facts to pursue the common good. That, to me, is common sense. That's the core of this campaign, and that's why I believe we will win here.",

      "sentences": "So, one important point to keep in mind, I think, is that one reason why the Trump appeals to that are leaning into the culture or onereason why he has an opening today is because there were some real failures in the Biden years and especially, the fact that for a lot of Americans real incomes fell in those first two years, that the transition from pandemic life was really hard for lots of people and that a lot of Biden folks were saying at the same time, though this is the best economy in the world, that the economic recovery is the greatest story never told, that that sort of tone deafness costs them a lot. And then, I think the other point to keep in mind is that some my own politics are often they -- this book is partly about how once upon a time the Democratic Party's base was in unions, now it is universities, like, listen, I'm a college professor, I have all the standard issue, college professor, blue America opinions, but, one of the arguments of the book and something that I got to by seeing how Sam Greenberg and Doug Schoen, for all their problems, whatever faults you want to point out, at their best they were really committed to trying to figure out just what ordinary voters were thinking about the world. And one reason why they did this, listen, they are consultants. It made for a good life. But they also had an argument. And the argument was that in a democracy, whatever else it has to be, it should be a system for turning public opinion into public policy. Because in the long run, you're just -- there's no other real alternative. Because if you ignore the public for long enough, then eventually someone is going to come along who responds to voters on an issue they care about. And if you're someone progressive politics, there's a good chance it'll be someone from the right with a lot of positions that you don't like. Where I think a lot of progressives fall into a trap is that they assume that it's either capitulation to the worst parts of politics or standing up boldly in defense of ideals that maybe they won't be supported by the public at large now, but you'll be vindicated by history eventually. And I think those either-or framings often do the very people we want to help a disservice. And that if, for instance, on immigration, you adopt this or more of a both and perspective where you assume that there are a lot of people out there who don't want ultra-draconian measures of deportation, camps, armed troops, roving cities, they don't want that, but they do want order at the border. I don't think that's an insane position, even if it's not my own. And it is a way for progressive politicians to meet voters where they are now on their concerns so that you can persuade them over the long run.",

So, I guess my question is, can you look back at civil rights as like that first great kind of realignment and say, is there something that Democrats should have done differently that would basically instruct us for today around these issues that are so -- you know, that are so emotional and so deeply ingrained for some people, even if those aren't your politics?",

No, no. They've won the popular vote. And what is it? It will -- if Kamala wins this year, it will be something like eight of the last nine elections. That is a historic run. They are capable of winning in states as diverse as Kentucky and Kansas, states that you might write off as the reddest of red will elect Democratic governors. We see, again, the success of abortion rights measures across much of the country. So, it's not as if the Democratic Party is an electoral shipwreck. And I don't think it's the case that the left is in ruins either. I think adrift captures the state of the party and the state of the left because, to me, it suggests that both a party and a movement that have many, many competing goals that it values, but no sense of real priorities. What it means to be a Democrat, that very simple answer. I think for a lot of people, what it means more than anything now is resistance. That ever since Donald Trump got on that golden escalator, Democrats have become the party of resistance. They've been opposed to whatever Trump is, which means that you end up letting Trump set the agenda. And I think that a party like that, no matter what its structural ambitions are, one, I think it's going to have a hard time winning the big majorities that you need to push through structural change. And two, I think it is kind of an inherently conservative party, where you're giving up on the energy that comes from taking on the status quo, when you say the status quo must be defended against Donald Trump at all times. And while I understand the electoral rationale behind this kind of thing Charli XCX to Liz Cheney coalition right now, I think that the future of a stronger Democrat Party would be one where it had a much clearer vision of what it stood for, which would be a Democrat Party that could explain where it went astray in some of the Biden years with presiding over this sort of -- this spike in inflation that resulted in this downtick in standard of living for so many Americans. So, the failure of Harris to be able to clearly and succinctly explain why she would be different from Biden, why voters who feel so angry right now, I think that you can't speak to that anger unless you can acknowledge that there are more things that have gone astray in our politics than just Donald Trump.

So, one point is that we do see that a shift like this is happening around much of the world today, and that as the left haspicked up ground with college educated voters it often struggles with working class voters.

While this is good, important, long-term legislation on climate change, it's also a fact that for a lot of disproportionately working class Americans what they care most about is the price of gas at the pump, the cost of electricity because paying that heating bill, especially when you have a family to feed, that is difficult stuff. And I think forgetting to deal with the cost of energy in the short-term is one case, while you are building up climate policy over the long-term, again, it's about delivering in the immediate run that those of us who don't worry about the heating bill in the same way, it's easy to ignore.",

But I think it's also crucial for Democrats to pay more attention to those crisis over the cost of living that's been unfolding around rising cost of housing, rising cost of health care, rising cost of child care, making sure that you can show that government can make a real difference in people's daily lives while making sure that those macroeconomic conditions, keeping up low unemployment, and making sure that inflation really is behind us. If you have a party that can do that while also delivering on the improvements in immigration that have taken place over the last year, that these are great of immigration and legal immigration in particular has fallen under Biden. I think one reason why Republicans aren't in a stronger position right now is really they are running against the United States of 2021 and allowing Democrats to consolidate the gains that they've made in the last couple of years, putting a fresh face on those policies and moving with serious solutions to address the cost-of-living crisis.
