Explosions in Iran leave dozens dead near the grave of military commander Qasem Soleimani, a day after Israel allegedly assassinated a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon. I'll ask the country's foreign minister how all this will -- how it will respond. Then, how all of this overshadows the Ukraine war as Russian missiles rain down. I speak to Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv. Plus, legacy from Napoleon to Nina Simone. A discussion about some of history's most extraordinary figures and whether we have their stories right. And finally, some folk for the soul. Pulitzer Prize-winning musician Rhiannon Giddens talks to Walter Isaacson. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Renewed fears today that Israel's war on Hamas is escalating beyond Gaza. In Iran, more than a hundred people have been killed and nearly double that number have been wounded in explosions at a ceremony marking four years since the U.S. assassinated Revolutionary Guards leader Qasem Soleimani. Iranian officials say at least one was a remotely detonated suitcase bomb, and state media calls it a terror attack. It comes a day after an airstrike on a Beirut building that killed a senior Hamas leader. Israel has not confirmed that it carried out that strike, but a U.S. official tells CNN that it was indeed responsible. The Lebanese prime minister accused Israel of trying to drag it into a regional war. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib is holding emergency meetings at the White House, and he's joining me now from Washington. Foreign Minister, welcome to the program. So, first, can I ask you the big picture? As your prime minister said, that he fears that you are being dragged into a wider war. Do you feel that?",

And so, we have problems. We -- yesterday, what happened in Lebanon, it is an Israeli attack in Lebanon, in Beirut. Would there be a response? I don't know whether it is this, but the government of Lebanon would not make any response. We'll go to United Nation and we'll have a complaint at the United Nation.",

And now, you know, 22,000 is 1 percent of the people of Gaza. 1 percent of the people of the United States is like 3.5 million. So, you know, that's too much. That's what Israel should think about what they're doing. They are not making peace. I mean, this is not like -- even if it captures all the leaders of Hamas, there will be new leaders coming. I mean, a few years ago or a couple decades ago there were different leadership for the Palestinians. Now, it is Hamas. And in the future, who knows what it will be. As long as there is no peace, I think more and more violence would happen and what you call terrorism, but -- what the West called terrorism and terrorists would be -- they are a factor for peace. Arafat was called terrorist, Menachem Begin was called a terrorist, and so is the IRA people were called terrorists, and then they became factors for peace.

Let me just read them quickly. Expedite the delivery of additional air defense systems and ammunition. Provide Ukraine with combat drones of all times -- of all types. Provide Ukraine with long-range missiles. Approve the use of frozen Russian assets for assisting Ukraine. Isolate Russian diplomats in relevant capitals and international organizations.

The coalition that in the -- during the Cold War, the coalition that outcompeted the Soviet Union and its allies was by all accounts much weaker than the coalition that is now helping Ukraine to defeat Russian aggression. The combined GDP of Ukraine and its allies is 21 times higher than the combined GDP of Russia and its very few allies. So, there are sufficient resources to provide Ukraine with the help we are requesting. All the West has to do is to start believing in itself in its capacity to prevail. And of course, time matters. We cannot sit and wait until -- and follow endless discussions on this matter. So, we call on everyone to expedite the decisions that are pending that are in the pipeline because the West has shown that it's capable of defending democracy.

Because if Russia theoretically prevails in Ukraine, other leaders across the world will be tempted to follow Russia's footprints and securing -- and ensuring security in these parts of the world and deterring these leaders and their countries will require a much, much higher price tag for the United States. And finally, you know, those who -- since you mentioned the NATO secretary general, I would like to say one thing. Those who, in their foreign policy calculations, believe that Putin will not dare to attack a NATO country if he sees that he can succeed in Ukraine are making a huge mistake, and they should change their job. So, whatever the price tag today is, the price tag of anything that will follow if Ukraine does not receive the help today will be much, much higher.

And I don't need any other signals that put in ascending, because when you genuinely want peace, you behave yourself differently. When it comes to the prisoner swap, well, it is true that since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the only real functioning negotiating track was the prisoner swap. As it -- and it's very common for any war in any part of the world to have that track working. So -- but even on this track, we did not have any swaps for five months. Five months off silence and Russia's total reluctance to return its own citizens, its own soldiers back home.

Many of the most imperialist patriotic Brits at the time thought he was ruining the name of imperialism through his corruption, greed. But he was also a very complex and flawed person.

And it's not just to remember the past, but it tells us something about society today, who gets a platform to speak, who gets silenced, and I think the way many of these protesters were actually attacked by the institutions that should have been looking into the claims they were making is an example of how unresolved a lot of this is, and that's something we discuss in the episodes.",

You know, I think before the enlightenment,biblical texts, every religion thinks about human relationship with the natural world, whether that's to do with animals, with food, with plants, with water, with drought and famine, floods, and I think that we sort of allowed ourselves to think that we could beat everything with innovation, with science and with money. And so, some of that question, I think today, is why we've gone through so many red traffic lights. So, you know, we're now 35 years on from James Hansen giving his warning in 1988 that we had to really deal with a changing natural environment around us and particularly with global warming. And when we go back through all the different accords in Paris and Rio, et cetera, it all feels like open goals that we've kept on missing. So, some of that, I think, is what we try to do with this podcast is you start by educating. So, when you listen to our four episodes about Picasso or, you know, you learn a lot more -- I mean, I -- it's been such an education for me to spend much more time thinking about Cecil Rhodes and his life I never thought I would want to do. But then, you sort of -- the more you can ingest, the more you can learn, the more nuanced your answers are going to be. So, I think with the natural world, it's how do we find ourselves at this place where scientists are talking about biodiversity, collapse and existential problems for us as a species, how can that suddenly be our world in 2024 and how do we miss all the warning signals before?",

So, that's when I found the banjo and kind of -- you know, that took me down roads that have now, you know, been a part of my life for a long time. I didn't expect to come back to opera, but when Spoleto -- the Spoleto Festival approached me about doing an opera about Omar, I kind of went, well, this is amazing because this is a story that's so important and an art form that is stigmatized, you know, and sort of put into this, you know, kind of classic or class warfare thing, you know, like only, you know, these kind of people enjoy opera, only these kind of people do opera And that's such a -- you know, that's such a false notion.

And so, there is this combination of people living cheek by jowl, you know, trading licks, like, learning from each other, and these genres that come out of this cultural exchange, but it's also all poor people, you know, it's people of the working class, people who are trying to make a living and trying to do the best they can, and they're bringing their music into the mix. And like there's a certain energy that goes into that and all the who are kind of like scrabbling together, you know. And it's -- I'm not romanticizing it, because they fought a lot too. But ultimately, the music kind of wins out. And when you look at the history of any kind of music in America, there -- that is at the heart of it, you know.
