She was really trying to hit a couple of boxes in that speech last night. Sure, it was a fiery broadside against Donald Trump. She called him consumed with grievance. She called him a petty tyrant. But it was also something of an introductory speech, trying to lay out her vision of the presidency for the American people.You know, for so long there's been this debate in the Democratic Party, should you focus on democracy and the threat to democracy? Should you focus on the economy, sort of meet voters at the kitchen table? This speech, I think, tried to bridge that gap. It is a distillation of the Harris campaign's theory of the case in this closing stretch that voters do care about both of those issues. And in fact, they're both intertwined. And so you saw her do that in the speech last night. Every aspect of it was really designed to drive that message forward, including the visuals. You saw her speaking there right in front of the south portico of the White House. That's exactly where Donald Trump spoke on January 6th. Those clips have been seeing so many times over the last four years. But it was also evoking this crucible of American executive power. Only 500 yards from the Oval Office. And to that end, she did tick through a number of policy areas she intends to focus on when she's president, including expanding Medicare to include at-home care, tax credit for homebuyers. She talked about immigration and a path to citizenship. She talked about the necessity of restoring the protections included in Roe versus Wade. And it really kind of all boiled down to this argument in her mind that Donald Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office ticking off his enemies list while she would be ticking off her to-do list. Listen to a little bit more of how she framed that argument last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's interesting if you look at the advertising spending in these two different battlegrounds, you can see the different approaches. In North Carolina, Democrats are outspending Donald Trump by nearly $20 million trying to flip this state. But look at the spending in Wisconsin. It's nearly even. Both sides spending about $45 million trying to win that key battlegrounds. So, it's really interesting to see the two different approaches as we head into this home stretch here. North Carolina is a state that Donald Trump never expected to have to spend so much time in, and yet because of the way that kamala Harris' campaigning has made a strong push for this state, much stronger than Joe Biden had been shape - looking like he was going to be able to compete for, it's been forcing Donald Trump to spend a lot of money and time and appearances here.

If Kamala Harris needs it, then, of course, Tim Walz would break the tie in the Senate. So, Republicans would need a gain of two.Let's sort of look at the map right now. What you see is a lot of blue seats going in purple, independents that also caucus with the Democrats. In fact, of the 34 seats that are up, 23 belonging to the Democrats or the independent who caucuses with them, just 11 belongs to the Republicans. So, Republicans have a wide open playing field. And at this particular point, we think that, in fact, they are going to get up to that 51 seats. Why is that? Well, let's go first to the wonderful state - take me home - West Virginia. Of course, Joe Manchin, the independent who's caucusing with the Democrats is retiring. At this particular point, Jim Justice, who's the popular Republican governor, is heavily favored to pick up that particular seat. Let's go out west to Maury Povich's home state of Montana. All right, this, of course, Jon Tester, the popular - or used to be popular Democratic incumbent. Not so popular anymore. Facing a very tough challenge from Tim Sheehy. We expect that, in fact, that will also be a Republican pickup at this particular point, tilting Republican. But it's not just these seats that are easy, right? Go into Ohio, right, a state that Donald Trump's easily expected to win. Sherrod Brown in a very tight race there. So, another Republican pickup opportunity. The bottom line is, across this map Pennsylvania, again, we have a tilting Democratic. Inside Elections has it tilting Democratic. But that's another Republican pickup opportunity. You just go across this map and there are so many Republican pickup opportunities, it's tough to think that Democrats could take control. One little last nugget on the Senate side that I will note. This is a very interesting race. Dan Osborne, who says he wouldn't caucus with either party. There was a \"New York Times\" poll that had Dan Osborne only down by two points against Deb Fischer. If, in fact, Osborne was able to win in that state, well, all of a sudden Republicans would be at 50 seats, not 51. So, it's not a sure thing on the Senate side yet. But the bottom line is at this particular hour I would definitely think given all of the potential Republican pickup opportunities that they have a much better shot of gaining control of this part of Congress than Democrats do at holding it.",

It had to do with the racist joke that was told about Puerto Rico at that Trump rally.My question to you, is President Biden, how much of a burden is he on the Harris campaign? O'ROURKE: I think he's an incredible asset. I mean he's arguably one of the most effective presidents that we've had, at least in the 52 years that I've been on this planet. What he's been able to accomplish on a bipartisan basis to invest in America, to reduce inflation, to create economic opportunity is wonderful. And that's part of the record that Kamala Harris can claim. But she's also turning the page on the presidents who preceded her and making a case, as she did last night, for doing an even better job in bringing costs down and offering opportunity to first-time homebuyers, to folks who are raising families, to people who are trying to start a business, and making sure that we stop this attempt to turn our country into an authoritarian or fascist state, which is the future of Donald Trump. John, I figured you might ask me this question. And one contrast I'd just like to point out. You know, within minutes of President Biden's statement last night, he clarified what he meant and added that apostrophe and said, look, I was just talking about the comedian who was dumping on the people of Puerto Rico. When Donald Trump was offered the opportunity to clarify his enemies within comment, where he talked about essentially turning the United States military against Democrats, an opposing political party. Instead of clarifying or apologizing, he doubled down and was very clear that he means to use force and violence against people with whom he has a political disagreement.

How do you feel about Robert Kennedy controlling all those things?O'ROURKE: It's pretty scary given the fact that he refuses to operate within the realm of facts or the truth, that he has gaslit and lied to the American public about a host of different issues. He's just somebody who plainly cannot be trusted. But as scary as that is, it pales in comparison to everything that Trump has promised to do himself. Whether it's turning the military against his political enemies, whether it's the Project 2025 plan that includes a national abortion ban, whether it's the violence and the polarization that he is certainly going to stoke. Whether or not he wins this election certainly as president, he will have absolute, untrammeled power to fundamentally change this country, to upend the Constitution, and to destroy this democracy. So, again, I think the choice is really clear. I think Vice President Harris laid that out beautifully and powerfully last night. We can turn the page. We can refuse to go back. And we can pursue an ambitious, aspirational future for America.",
