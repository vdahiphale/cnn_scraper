CNN has learned that Bryan Kohberger's father was with him as he drove cross- country, from Washington State to Pennsylvania, for the holidays after the crime took place. Now, police began tracking them at some point during the trip. The suspect is now charged with four counts of murder in the first-degree as well as felony burglary. He's expected to waive extradition and return to Idaho. CNN's Jean Casarez is in Pennsylvania. Jean, what else are you learning?",

And this person tells CNN that they were getting some work done on the Hyundai Elantra. That's the white car. And that the suspect -- the defendant, Kohberger, was talkative and he talked about how he had go to DeSales University here in Pennsylvania, and was doing his doctoral work in Washington and that he was interested in becoming a professor. The person said that they were -- he was a little awkward but communicative in talking. His father was there, too. And then when this all basically exploded on Friday, he recognized him, realized the conversation and contacted the FBI. So, December 16th, in Pennsylvania, December 17th possibly here at home, so there's a bit more to the timeline. Now, he is behind me right here in the correctional facility. He's all by himself. It's protective custody because of the high-profile nature. They monitor him to make sure of his welfare. But I asked him attorney yesterday just on a human nature, a human point, how is he doing?

They did say that a couple of them had defensive wounds, maybe they'd fought back and were able to get some exchange of DNA that way. But all of that is going to come out during the course of the trial. Now, getting the murder weapon is like the ultimate lock on the case. But do you really need that in order to get a conviction? It depends on how strong the other evidence is. Right now, they're also processing the Elantra itself, because that had to be a very bloodied crime scene. He left the crime scene in that car, which probably some trace evidence in that car from the victims.

In January, Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages. With the queen's oversight, Andrew stepped back from public duties to focus instead on defending himself against allegations of sexual abuse brought by accuser Virginia Giuffre. The prince paid an out of court settlement for an undisclosed amount and the case was dismissed. In March, William and Kate toured the Caribbean to a backdrop of negative media attention and accusations of colonial nostalgia. The trip was meant to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. However, the royals, William said, were not in the business of telling people what to do. For most Brits, the late queen was the only monarch they've ever known, ruler for more than 70 years, an unprecedented platinum jubilee delivered one last hurrah. Four days of pomp and ceremony was scheduled for the height of summer, a standalone opportunity to celebrate the life and legacy of her majesty, parades, pageants and a few old faces.",

Now, the publishers have been very tight about this, but there has been a source that gave comment to the London Sunday Times saying that actually the book is quite easy on Charles but not on William. And the source said, I can't see any reconciliation after this, because, according to the source, there were quite detailed accounts of the arguments that Harry and William have had.And, of course, in the Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary, which Max was just discussing there, in there was really a quite detailed account of the moment when Harry went to the queen and asked to have a half in/half out setup on how William apparently, he said, was screaming at him there. We don't yet know what's going to be in the book. They've been very tight about it. The source could be wrong, but I do think certainly that is going to be explosive for the royal family. Harry feels that he has not had a chance to speak out to tell his truth and to tell exactly what it was like growing up in the royal family when he was, in his words, seen as a spare. So, I think it's going to be a difficult few months for the royal family, and particularly for the king, even if Harry has been, as this source suggests, light on him, still, people are going to say the king was at the head of the family.
