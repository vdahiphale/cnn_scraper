What have you -- what is your view of how this all has played out?SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER OF \"THE BULWARK\": We've done a couple of groups since the debate, and these -- these voters are people who voted for Trump in '16, Biden in '20. But a lot of groups in that category -- we'd seen a lot of backsliding when Biden was the nominee. People were saying they were either leaning RFK or they were going to leave it blank. And what Kamala Harris has done is just put that coalition back together. This focus group was a clean sweep for Harris, both in terms of her winning the debate and in terms of vote choice. They were all going to vote for her. She had kind of gotten them over the hump. And the No. 1 word that came up that really struck me was several people organically referred to her performance as presidential, right? And this is the hump she's trying to get over. Do people see her as presidential, somebody ready for the big chair? And for these voters, she got them there with this performance. But I will say one of the things about this group is they all watched the debate. And as we know, lots of Americans don't always watch these debates. So the question is, is can she ride this into a much more high-level narrative about how dominating she can be that sort of filters out to voters who are paying less attention.",

She needed to show, you know, that she could essentially kind of take the -- the foundation out from under Trump. And -- and that helped sort of reinforce for people the idea that she's capable of being president, that she's strong. And she did that. So, I do think -- I do think it mattered. I think, you know, in a -- in a time and in a race where, you know, we're on this really condensed timeline having this really high-profile moment where she went out and kind of nailed the key things that she needed to do.

Just look at the polling. Yet somehow, if you were a voter who was not familiar with who these two people were and where this race stood, you'd come away thinking, wait a second. She's got -- she's far more serious on these two really profound issues that are important to me as a voter.

I mean, this is one of the things that debates really do, is people tune in who are just really starting to get a feel for the race. And you have an opportunity to tell them things that they don't know yet. That's not filtering down. And so, there was a guy in the group, he was the most skeptical of Kamala Harris. But he was saying, I didn't know Trump did that. I don't like that. And so, I think that that is a way in which -- and look, I do think there's always -- there's something about American voters. They want to be courted, right? They want to be told -- especially these late- breaking undecided ones. But what you see is when she turns in a performance like this. At the end of every election, there's a break in independent voters. They break one way or the other.
