Ukrainian forces are making progress near Kherson, but Russian forces remain present and dangerous. And John Kerry tells CNN that we need a lot of things we don't have, like money and cooperation, to win the fight against climate change. But we begin tonight with the U.S. midterms. A shift in the balance of power in Washington is underway right now. But we still don't know where it will settle. Two days after the midterm election, control of Congress is still too close to call. Republicans have a razor thin edge in the Senate, 49 seats to 48 seats with Democrats, with races in three states, still in limbo. Not one of those states, Georgia, they will hold a runoff election next month, which means that we may not learn who will control the Senate until December. Republicans do, however, appear on the verge of retaking the House from Democrats by a smaller margin than anticipated after a promise red wave did not happen. So, let's get some perspective now on these results from our very own Stephen Collinson. Stephen, I enjoyed your piece today on CNN.com. What stood out to you most from these results as we just said, the Republicans did get that red wave that many expected they would, why not, what happened?",

We had expect this to take place possibly on Tuesday evening, but as you said, that red wave did not materialize and counting is still going on in key seats out in California, for example. We still believe that the Republicans will get to the 218 seats they need. They are about nine short by now. But this reflects how disappointing this was for the Republicans. I think this election, as we think back on it, now clearly, it's a case of while voters are not happy with President Biden, with the state of the economy, with high inflation, they were not ready to hand power to a Republican Party full of extreme candidates created in the image of former president, Donald Trump.",

I think we will see one potentially over the debt ceiling, raising the debt ceiling next year that could really affect the global economy. This time around, there isn't -- that Republican majority, if it indeed materializes, will be very influenced by former President Trump at a time when we expect him to be running for president. He's already hinted that he will make that announcement next week. So, Trump will try to use that majority to do as much damage to President Joe Biden as he can, in terms of investigations on everything from Afghanistan, to his son Hunter's business dealings, ahead of a possible clash with Biden in the 2024 presidential election. So, things are always pretty nasty and a divided government. I think this time is every chance that it will be a lot more volatile and, you know, it's going to be worth watching.",

But if you -- we talked about the tightest possible accountability and I am absolutely convinced that it is one of the few ways that we have to be able to produce the amount of capital we need to accelerate this transition. We will be able to reduce emissions more in the methodology that's been put forward in this proposal, where you might actually be phasing out coal and assisting in avoiding -- coal and deploying renewables directly. That would reduce emissions and I think you are going to see once the rules get fully worked out and everybody's, you know, in their comfort place, hopefully this will be implemented because we desperately need the money.
