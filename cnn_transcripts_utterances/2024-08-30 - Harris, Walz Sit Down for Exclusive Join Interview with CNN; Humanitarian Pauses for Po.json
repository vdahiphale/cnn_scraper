The reality was, I think it was pretty mixed for Harris, and part of that is, yes, Republicans play the expectations game very wrongly here, just as they did in the previous midterm elections when they were promising a red wave and a red tsunami. That's not what do you do. And some of that is political malpractice. But as I watched her first answer, it was one of these word soups, word salads that doesn't really say anything, doesn't connect with voters because they can't figure out what she's saying, and it was reminiscent to me of 1980 when Ted Kennedy was asked the very basic question, why are you running for president? And he took two minutes not answering that question. She did fine on some things. She explained that, oh, no, I've totally flip- flopped. It was two years ago. You just didn't pay attention to me. Not a strong statement. She did fine. She should do more of these. I think it would benefit her to do more of these. And then we'll see how that moves moving forward.

What they've got, what the Israeli government and Hamas have agreed to, are these three-day separate port, three phase. And in each of those phases, three days of seven hours a day. So if you just kind of do the math, right, you've got three times seven, that's 21. Put that into, you know, 640,000 children they want to vaccinate, you're looking at trying to vaccinate as many as 10,000 children an hour. And you're not just trying to vaccinate them as well. You're trying to keep account of who you've done and who you haven't done in a chaotic situation where people are coming in from camps where there are big families, where there are families without parents. It's a very, very chaotic situation and they're aiming to vaccinate 90 percent of that 640,000. That's all the children below the age of 10. So the phases are going to work like this. The center phase comes first, first to September to the 4th of September. Then it goes to the south, 5th of September to the 8th of September. Then it goes to the north, the 9th of September to the 12th of September. About 2000 U.N. volunteers are being trained up to try to get that massive number of vaccinations in that short space of time. So, OK, even outside of a war, even outside of a situation where you've got this, you know, movable population who had difficulty getting to the, getting to the vaccination centers, all of that, then you have the chaos of the fact there's actually outside of those seven-hour periods there's a war going on and the war can easily spread over. No, this is not what's hoped for, but it can happen into those seven-hour periods on those nine different days. This is very tough, but it's what the -- it's the window that the U.N. has. And with one child in Gaza already suffering paralysis from polio, it's a clear imperative. The U.N. has made that extremely clear that this affects not just the children in Gaza, but potentially the whole region. And that is why in part, the IDF is vaccinating its troops against polio because they're right in the same area as children who could be infected.",

And then when you look at the under 30, that it goes up to 77 percent. What she appears to be doing is targeting those younger progressive Democrats who may not come out to vote in some of those critical states, and send them a message and the message in her message there was it's how Israel does that, it's how it asserts the right to defend itself. And incumbent on part of that will be how the United States follows through with its continued and committed iron clad support to the defense of Israel. And that comes down to weapons. So the question then becomes for Prime Minister Netanyahu is still in office if Kamala Harris wins the election, how she would interpret that as president? But this is really an issue to the domestic audience in the U.S. But there is something of a signaling in there that she could try to put more pressure than President Biden has on the Israeli government to bring an end to the war in Gaza. She said she's -- the United States is committed to a two-state solution so I think the interpretation here would have to be if she wins there could be a shift. Diplomatically Israel will absolutely rise to meet that shift with the same point they've probably been putting to President Biden over the past almost year.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's unlikely it seems that the U.S. will change its policy on easing with the restrictions forthe use of long-range weapons inside of Russia. Those weapons specifically made by the U.S. and there are few reasons for that. First, in terms of U.S. long-range weapons, the key one here is the ATACMS, army tactical missiles. Ukraine has used those very successfully to strike occupied Crimea. And that's where the U.S. sees the value in these, being able to hit air defenses, airfields, ammo depots in Crimea. Part of the bigger problem is that one of Ukraine's biggest threats right now is the glide bombs that Russia is launching. But they're launching them from air bases that are outside the range of U.S. long-range weapons so from the U.S. perspective there isn't much the long-range weapons can do against that. Instead, their focus there is that Ukraine using its own long-range drones to be able to hit targets like that. So from the U.S. perspective, although there might be some tactical gains from easing restrictions they kind of want to pull out and see a bigger picture where that's not the key issue here. For the U.S. the key issues remain, air defenses and they've made sure that Ukraine is very high in the list for a priority of air defenses, as well as how to still make gains in Crimea, seeing that that campaign is going well to slow down Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine. So these are the bigger, more important issues. Yes, certainly the Ukrainians have made very clear they're going to bring up those restrictions. But for the U.S. that's not the focus of those conversations. Even if Ukraine wants to make a point about that, there are much bigger and broader issues here. Even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy keeps sort of hammering that drum and hoping the restrictions or eased to keep up the political pressure. It's not the only issue on the agenda. And part of that, Elenie, is why these meetings are so important and it's also worth noting that, although today is the formal meeting as they left the Pentagon last night, I saw Defense Minister Umerov here. So perhaps a bit of a smaller informal visit here with what looked like some senior Ukrainian military officials. So making this a bigger event, perhaps more time for conversations because of the critical stage, the fight is in right now.",
