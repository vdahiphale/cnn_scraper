Just ahead, Ukraine warns that Russia is planning a large-scale escalation of the conflict whilst doubling down on its plea for more aid. A real-life needle in a haystack. A radioactive capsule, the size of a penny is found in a search area, the length of Great Britain.And two years on, fighting in Myanmar takes a devastating toll. CNN obtains rare and exclusive footage that gives us a sense of what the battle looks like. The worst may yet be to come. That's the warning from a top Ukrainian security official. Oleksiy Danilov tells Sky News that Russia is preparing what it called a maximum escalation of the war, and it could happen in the next few weeks. Ukraine points to recent changes in Russian activity at sea and in the air. Meanwhile, hours after Ukraine's President pledged new reforms, anticorruption searches were launched across Ukraine. A probe one official says cost high level customs agency officials their jobs. Let's bring in Scott McLean live from London. What intelligence is this escalation rumor based on?",

They're also saying that they're seeing more aviation activity that they suggest is in coordination with the Russian Navy as well, all in preparation for this spring offensive that the Ukrainians have been warning about now for some time.Though now they're putting a timeline on it, saying that the defining months of the war will happen in the next two or three months. So they're not ruling out anything happening in the next two or three weeks as well. I also want to update you, Max, on those corruption investigations, those raids that we're hearing about. The majority leader in the Ukrainian parliament has just announced that there were raids on properties including the property of a former Ukrainian interior minister. This is in connection with the helicopter crash that took place last month, killing 14 people, including the current Interior minister, and the contracts for the helicopters that were signed back in 2018. That minister, though, of course, denies any wrongdoing.",

Peshawar is near the Afghan border and a frequent target of the Pakistani Taliban called the TTP. The group, however, denies responsibility.

I want to make sure you can see it here at the skyline.But basically, this capsule that was found is used for mining. Here's the history. The capsule was discovered about six days, six days after it went missing, likely falling off a truck. Now, eventually, it was found off the side of a road by crews who are using special radiation detection equipment. It was not found too far from the Rio Tinto mine, suggesting it fell off the truck soon as it left. But the potential search area for this was enormous, vast. You mentioned the size of the U.K. I believe, we are talking about distance here longer than the California coastline. A perimeter was set up. And so now the goal is to transport this capsule in a lead container to the Health Department, to a facility they have in Perth. But this was very concerning because human exposure could cause skin burns, radiation sickness, even a risk of cancer in some cases. And just 24 hours ago, authorities felt that the chance of finding it was very slim. Now, Max, they have to determine how this happened in the first place, how it fell off that truck, likely.",

What they're calling for really is better training, more transparency, a change of culture and policing overall. It's interesting to listen to many of the family members speak and, of course, those associated with Tyre Nichols, they talk about -- it's different. Usually it's about police procedure, usually it's about training, usually there's some other issue because of a mistake, a tactical mistake.In this case, it's very different, Max. You know, we're not seeing that tactical mistake by a police officer or a police officer thinking someone is armed and is not and then winds up killing the person. This is very different and -- because of its brutality, because of the beating that Tyre suffered. And so what we're hearing a lot from the families is that they want a change in culture of policing. And that is what a lot of today will be about. That is what we will be hearing, certainly from the lawyer who -- for the family, who Ben Crump, who will be speaking, and other officials and family members. You know, and all of this is happening as the investigation is still very much ongoing. The five officers haven't been charged with the second-degree murder here, but there are still several other officers that are under investigation. And we could see more officers lose their jobs, certainly, and more video. We still have more video to come. The police telling us last night that they're going to be releasing more video at some point once they're done with their investigation. And there are a lot of questions also about whether or not the police -- the officers on scene here tried to cover this up and trying to establish an initial narrative, painting themselves as the victims, claiming that Tyre attacked them, claiming that Tyree try to grab their guns. None of that, from what we've seen in the body camera footage, shows that. So it contradicts the body camera footage certainly contradicts the initial reports that police filed on this. So, Max, a lot to come, but today is certainly going to be filled with a lot of motion and calls for justice and calls for reform.",
