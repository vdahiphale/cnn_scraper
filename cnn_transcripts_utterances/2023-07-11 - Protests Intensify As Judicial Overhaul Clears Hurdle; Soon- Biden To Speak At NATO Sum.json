At one point, they even unveiled a giant red ribbon representing a red line around the Supreme Court.Now, the legislation over this judicial overhaul that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has been pushing through had been essentially frozen for the past few months. That, after other massive protests and that massive general strike that even shut down McDonald's back in March, caused the defense minister to come forward and say he was standing against it. So the legislation was frozen, but after failed negotiations, it's back on the table. And last night, the first element of just one part of this massive judicial overhaul pass that essentially is attempting to strip the Supreme Court's ability to declare government actions unreasonable. They have broad ability to declare government actions unreasonable even if they don't necessarily break a law. This is just the first of three votes on this particular bill. This is part of a massive package of this judicial overhaul. And even though Benjamin Netanyahu has stepped away from some of the more controversial elements of this overhaul, namely allowing Parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions, that has not satiated these protesters. They are now up and -- up and out in force. They have stepped up their protests a notch. They haven't actually ever left the streets for the past 27 weeks but now they are coming out once again. They essentially want to disrupt daily life in Israel. They plan to be at Ben Gurion, Tel Aviv's main airport, later today. They are taking to the main streets and highways across Israel, across Tel Aviv. And even tonight, there are calls by some protesters to pitch tents in central Tel Aviv and to not leave until this overhaul is completely off the table -- Rahel.",

It comes as majority leader Chuck Schumer presents a framework for trying to regulate the technology. And with the technology and AI seemingly everywhere, sometimes it can be hard to tell what's written using AI. For example, is what I'm reading right now written by artificial intelligence? Well, no -- but with all of the AI toys out there -- yes, it is getting harder and harder to tell. It is also the topic behind a new CNN article \"Bot or not? How to tell when you're reading something written by AI.\" The first sentence really sets the tone. \"At some point this week, you may have read a sentence written by artificial intelligence and not even known it.\" Joining us now on set is the co-author of the author, CNN Business writer Clare Duffy.

Stoltenberg. The two men are entering the summit on the heels of a win after Turkey announced that it was dropping its block of Sweden joining the alliance. Sweden had been trying to join NATO for over a year at this point but had not been able to enter due to objections from Turkey. It really was a surprise reversal for Turkish President Erdogan and one that came after he met with Stoltenberg, as well as the leader of Sweden yesterday. President Biden, himself, placed a phone call behind the scenes to Erdogan from Air Force One as he flew from the U.S. to Europe and made clear that he wanted to see Sweden join NATO as soon as possible. So this is a real victory heading into this summit as they're really trying to show this united front with the allied leaders. [05:50:04] Now, also up for discussion at this summit is a possible pathway for Ukraine to eventually join the alliance. That is something that has already exposed some fissures among allied leaders. President Biden, before traveling here to NATO, said that now is not the time for Ukraine to join as the war in Ukraine against Russia still rages on. And there is concerns that if Ukraine were to join NATO at this point, that it would drive NATO countries into a direct conflict with Russia. He -- Biden also argued that there are still some reforms that Ukraine needs to make before it joins the alliance. Now, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy wants to see more security guarantees as well as a clearer pathway for membership. This morning, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the NATO allies would be providing a united positive signal on membership, though he has not laid out any timeframe for when Ukraine could join the alliance. President Biden is set to meet with Zelenskyy here tomorrow.",

Prime Day started in 2015 to celebrate Amazon's 20th birthday. Deal hunters will find everything from TVs and headphones to humidifiers and vacuum cleaners. Let's bring in Bridget Carey.

It feels like it's Black Friday in the middle of summer. But yes, this is something that is -- you're going to find sales everywhere. It can feel like an avalanche of deals. It can feel overwhelming. Take a breath. You don't have to go so fast. And I would say the big thing is have a game plan in mind because it feels likes everything has a sale. But you want to go in getting things you might already need, like back-to-school shopping. You've got birthdays coming up. You can get a lot of good tech on sale. So this is a time where, obviously, Amazon loves to push its own tech. You have all those Amazon smart speakers and tables. They get the biggest discounts. There's also a lot of TVs on sale and Amazon has Fire TVs. So you're going to see a lot of good deals there, too. It's strange when you're navigating it all because there are things like lightning deals where you have to act fast, and other things where it's like oh, is that really a sale because I don't normally buy a soda stream machine every day? I don't buy a face massager every day. So do a little Googling before you just go and jump on something because oh, look, it's discounted 30 percent off. Maybe it's always discounted 30 percent off because it's an older model. Do a little Googling and see what it goes for at other places to see if that sale is really a sale.",
