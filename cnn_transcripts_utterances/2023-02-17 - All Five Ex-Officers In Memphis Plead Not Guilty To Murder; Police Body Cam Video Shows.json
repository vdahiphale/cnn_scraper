Right now, the family of Tyre Nichols is speaking out after all five former Memphis police officers appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to his murder. For the first time since Nichols death, his parents were in the same room with the men who brutally beat their son last month after a traffic stop.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROWVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' MOTHER: We have to start this process of justice right now, and I want each and every one of those police officers to be able to look me in the face. They haven't done that yet. They couldn't even do that today. They didn't even have the courage to look at me in my face. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For the first time, we got to see them appearing all together inside this courtroom where they pleaded not guilty and really the legal battle just getting underway. Their attorneys really indicating that this is going to be a vigorous fight. They feel that the District Attorney rushed this case. They say that there's other evidence that's not been out there publicly that they feel will help their clients, right?Question is, what could that be after the video that was released by the D.A., which depicts a really just a severe beating of Tyre Nichols. So you can tell from the defense attorneys here, at least in talking to them outside of court, that they're going to launch a vigorous, vigorous defense. The other thing, obviously this is really a day for the community, a community to come inside this courtroom, face these officers, and as you've mentioned, Kasie, for the parents, the family of Tyre Nichols to come face to face with these men, and really his mother saying that she will be at every court appearance. HUNT: Shimon, we're also learning about some other cases that involve the Scorpion Unit. What can you share about that?",

The police chief disbanded that group after the Tyre Nichols beating. The D.A. here telling me finally we're getting some numbers and finally we're being told that it's up to about 100 cases that the District Attorney could be now reviewing that these five officers are part of. They were part of 75 cases that the D.A. is now reviewing.And then there's another 25 from an additional officer who has not been criminally charged, but was fired. You'll recall it's Preston Hemphill. He was one of the other officers on scene the night of the incident. And so he was fired as a result of his actions by the police department. And now his cases are also under review, so about 100 cases in total, and it could grow. And some of these cases could be dismissed over some of the activity by these officers, but that is a significant number. And finally, for the first time, we're getting those numbers from the D.A. So, again, more fallout, again, from this incident, and obviously there's still a lot more that is going to come out. We're expecting more video, more audio to come out in the coming weeks that the police say they're still reviewing. And once they make some decisions about additional disciplinary action against some officers, they will release that video, Kasie?",

Right after they watched the video, their emotions were completely raw, as you can imagine hearing their loved one trying to gasp their last breath was just something that hurt everyone in the family. His brother, his youngest brother was talking about the fact how much he loved him, and he didn't understand why this shooting had to happen, because he thinks when you watch that video, his brother didn't show any aggression toward the officers.In fact, he tried to get away from them. And so that's something that stuck out in the family's mind, is because the entire time he tried to leap from that second story balcony. And one of the things the attorney also pointed to is this is not the first time that Mr. Bagley has had an interaction with the police department. A few years ago, he actually sued the police department after some of his teeth were knocked out after another arrest. So that's showing that he might have been scared of police to start with. But take a listen to his brother in just the raw emotion that he had about losing his brother. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XAVIER SUDDS, ALONZO BAGLEY'S BROTHER: It was really, really sad to watch, hurtful to watch, hard to watch. I won't be OK until we know, we know, I know that justice will be served. Charges, that's fine. That's cool and all, but we need to see more action behind that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But listen to Officer Tyler's lawyer saying, it's hard being a police officers, and these are all split second decisions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DHU THOMPSON, POLICE OFFICER'S ATTORNEY: The mere fact that an argument is being made by the investigator in court that he was unarmed does not necessarily mean he's not a threat to the officer.

That's something they're going to go back and forth over in court.The mayor, for his part, actually apologized to the family yesterday, saying he didn't reach out and a fast enough time. The police chief tells us also he's reviewing all the policies of this police department and they will move forward also with an administrative look into what happened to see if they can calm some of the city leaders down because obviously a lot of questions, especially from community leaders who want to know how can they move forward as a city together when there's video like this out that makes so many people question what actually happened on that night?

How's that going to play out in your view?BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: So in terms of the prosecution, the prosecution is going to have an issue. They're going to have an issue in the sense of there is that split second where you don't actually see the hands of this man. And unfortunately, that gives the defense a way out in the sense of trying to describe what was a threat in his mind. Either way, the question is going to be for the jury, if it goes through a jury trial, is whether it was reasonable for this officer to use deadly force. Was it reasonable for him to see or foresee or believe that this man was a threat to him, that there was an imminent threat of deadly physical injury or serious bodily injury? That's going to be the question for the jury. It's still early on, but the first step, there has been an arrest.

And that pleading guilty part is going to be a huge conversation for the prosecutor to determine if they want to flip any of those officers to cooperate against the most culpable out of the group.But in my opinion, if I were the prosecutor, I wouldn't flip any.

And to your point earlier, this was the most extensive remarks he's given on the issue amid speculation over what these objects were, as well as some concern over the transparency the administration was providing on this issue. And while he said there's no connection that they have linked so far to China and spying, they did note that they were connected most likely to private companies or research institutions. Now, of course, recovery efforts are still ongoing for those three objects that were shot down over the weekend.

In addition to that, 20 air monitoring systems, he says, have now been set up in and around the area. Those air monitoring systems are mobile. They'll be moving them around. That testing is underway as well.As he said over the past few days, the municipal water samples in the area continue to come back clear as well. He's been in contact with the Department of HHS. They are going to be setting up a clinic here next week. So anyone out here in the area who is feeling symptomatic can come in and speak with experts. So what you have here on the ground is you've got this disconnect because you've got state and local officials who are saying the air is safe, the water is safe, but you have people on the ground who simply do not believe that. And so the governor was asked about that. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): I understand people have been traumatized, and I understand skepticism.
