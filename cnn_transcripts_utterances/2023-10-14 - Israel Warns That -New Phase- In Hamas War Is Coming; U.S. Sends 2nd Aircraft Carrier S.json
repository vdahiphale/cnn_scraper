      "sentences": "This is CNN special coverage of \"Israel at War.\" I'm John Berman in New York. It is a new day in Israel as that nation promises a new phase in its war on Hamas. That phase is looking like a Military ground operation as more troops amassed near the border with Gaza.Israeli airpower hit more targets on Saturday. Officials say, a Hamas commander who played a major role in last Saturday's deadly terror attacks was killed. Meantime civilians in Gaza are heading Samar. The IDF's warning to leave the northern end of the territory and head south. But United Nations officials and other agencies warn such a large scale evacuation, more than a million people, could lead to disaster. Hospitals in Gaza already say they are on the brink. Also today, an important development from the Pentagon. It has sent a second U.S. carrier strike group to the Mediterranean in a show of support for Israel and deter others, including the militant group Hezbollah from getting involved. CNN's, Oren Lieberman at the Pentagon for us tonight. Talk about this new U.S. carrier strike group, what it will be doing and why?",

Ford, as well as the accompanying destroyers and cruisers arrived earlier this week. Now a second one led by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, deployed from Naval Station Norfolk and other bases on Friday, it'll take about two weeks to get there.But right now we learned from defense secretary Lloyd Austin, a statement he put out just a couple of hours ago, and from U.S. officials, that the Ike will head to the Eastern Med. This is not intended to get involved with Israel's fight with Hamas in Gaza in any way. Won't be taking part in those operations. That's something neither the Israelis nor the Americans want. But it is supposed to send a message of deterrence to others who might look at this and see a moment of weakness in Israel and try to get involved, specifically Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iranian backed Shiite groups in Syria that might try to take the opportunity to fire into Israel. This is a warning to them with two carrier strike groups operating in Eastern Med. So this is a direct warning, essentially. And there are also other U.S. Military assets in the region. Some fighter squadrons were plussed up over the course of the last several days with more fighters, that to a message to Iran. And there's also an amphibious ready group that hasn't been ordered to Israel yet or are off the coast of Israel, but that's another option the Pentagon has, should it choose to continue bolstering its presence right in that region.",

And the challenge here, John, is that you need to get coordination from the Egyptians, some sort of coordination with Hamas in Gaza, and then at least a tacit understanding with Israel that there won't be any strikes in that area. But the problem from the reporting in the region is that Egypt doesn't want to open that gate without any promise of Israel sending in humanitarian aid, that something Israel has to this point refused to do. And then Hamas is just a wildcard here, do they open they're part of the border crossing? All of those challenges, as the U.S. tries to get American citizens out of Gaza.

It originally began as an offshoot from the Muslim Brotherhood.Sisi government has no interest whatsoever in creating new refugee problem that they're going to take care of, or having infiltration from Hamas operatives into Egypt property. So I think the Egyptians are pretty hard over on this. What concerns me and what stuns me, actually, is that the Egyptians appear to be using the Rafah crossing as a form of leverage in order to get Americans out. They seem to be saying that the United States needs to lean on the Israelis in order to allow humanitarian aid before -- into Gaza before they'll allow Americans and other third country nationals to leave. I mean, Egypt is an ally, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, you have 400 Americans. Not to minimize the problem that faces Palestinians, hundreds of thousands who need medical attention, food shelter. That's a very, very worrisome form of behavior from our putative Egyptian allies.",

So I think Hamas has no interest frankly in the wellbeing and the welfare of Palestinians who are faced with a excruciating choice. You can't move 1.1 million people in 24 hours, let alone in 24 days. Not to mention, moving the infirmed, sick.

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm still with them, actually. I'm with a battalion of Israeli soldiers near the Lebanese border up here in northern Israel. There's been, you know, quite a few forces concentrated up here, because Israel is determined to make sure that if a second front opens up here in the north of Israel, if Hezbollah, for instance, in southern Lebanon, starts lobbing missiles across the border, into the north of the country, they're going to be ready for it. And not just ready, but also ready to strike back.Israeli officials are saying that if Hezbollah crosses that red line, it could lead to the destruction of Lebanon. And so that's the kind of overt threat that the Israeli Military commanders and politicians are also putting out there to try and deter Hezbollah and its Iranian backers from entering the war inside Israel. Also, there's those American ships that the world's biggest aircraft carrier off the coast of Israel in the Eastern Mediterranean from the United States. U.S. saying they're sending now another aircraft carrier group as well to bolster that deterrence, but also to double the amount of firepower the United States has in the region, if it chooses to intervene in support of Israel, if, for instance, other countries get involved, if Hezbollah gets involved. So that's the threat that's been broadcast by both Israel and the United States to everybody in the region to stay out of this this course, as Israel prepares for that much anticipated ground offensive -- well air, land and sea, in fact, as they call it, into the Gaza Strip. That's something that we don't know when that's going to happen, but it's obviously going to be quite soon. And that's why tensions up here in the north are also very high, because it's when that ground offensive begins when that attack on the Gaza Strip really gets underway that we'll know, whether Hezbollah with other countries, or know how they're going to respond.

It had a big arsenal of weapons, of rockets, of which it did not hesitate to lob over the border, as you will remember very well.The difference this time, I think, first of all, is that Israel's arsenal -- sorry, Hezbollah's arsenal is believed to be much, much stronger. They've got more weapons than they had before. They've got more powerful weapons than they have before. There's also things like drones, which really didn't exist as a battlefield weapon in any real way back in 2006, and now it's a really prominent way that attacks can be carried out. At the same time, Israel has different technology as well. It's Iron Dome anti-missile system that wasn't really operational, as far as I remember back in 2006. But now it's very operational, as we've seen in the south. And those missile systems -- anti-missile systems are out here at strategic locations in the north in some considerable force. Because the Israeli army may not have been ready for the attack incredibly, but ready for the assault down in the south.
