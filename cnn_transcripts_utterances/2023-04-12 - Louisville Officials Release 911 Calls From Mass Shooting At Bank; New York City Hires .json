But let's start with what we've learned about the Louisville shooting. We have here tonight. Vanity Fair's Molly Jong-Fast, the one and only Mike Rowe here, Pollster Frank Luntz is here and our favorite player on and off the court, Patrick McEnroe. All right, that's our last moment of levity guys for this segment, because, as I said, we have heard more of the 911 calls. And Kaitlan Collins just sat down with the governor of Kentucky tonight, Andy Beshear, who lost a friend. I mean, he was choked up throughout this entire interview, basically, because someone close to him was murdered in this bag. So, let me just play another portion of that interview for you all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY):  I believe we can respect and honor people's Second Amendment rights to protect themselves and their family, but at the same time at least take a step so that we can intervene when we know somebody is about to go out and murder a whole bunch of people. Red flag law involves the court system. It ensures that everybody's rights are protected, that evidence is heard and has every check on it that we could ask for. But at least it lets us stop that next individual, at least when we know before they murder people. And, listen, I know people will say that wouldn't have stopped this situation, and it probably wouldn't have, but maybe it will the next one. I don't want another family go through this.

In just the past six months, okay, so, in a six-month chunk, six or seven months between July 2022 and February 2023, 2,000 protection orders, in other words, red flags.

Essentially, what has occurred is that means that now you have less time to sell beer. About, I think it was about 24 minutes on average or so, less time to sell beer. And that, of course, is something that MLB teams don't necessarily like because it turns out using let's say Minute Maid Park, which is where the Houston Astros play for example, last year, I believe, they sold about $28 million worth of alcohol. And now some of that was from concerts, but the vast majority that was from baseball games. So, my estimate is that they might have lost, you know, somewhere in the area of a few million dollars based upon these new -- the new timing rules.
