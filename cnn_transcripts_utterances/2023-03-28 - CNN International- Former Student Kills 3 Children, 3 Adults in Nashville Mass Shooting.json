CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I do think folks in this country are just furious about the way in which these AR-15s continue to be used in these mass shootings. I'm not saying that we have the votes in the House and the Senate right now to ban assault weapons, but I do think there are some things that could get bipartisan support. Like shouldn't you have some training on one of these weapons, before you're able to pick it up and bring it out into public? I mean, we require you to get training to drive a boat, to drive a car, but not to have a military style weapon that can kill a hundred people in five minutes. I think you could find bipartisan support for something like that. And we'll work hard this year to try to find that common ground. I mean, what do you say to families who have lived through this already and are now having their children still in lockdowns at nearby schools where there's been a shooting? REP. LUCY MCBATH (D-GA): You cannot serve your community, you cannot protect them and serve them at the same time without a willingness to do the right thing to pass legislation such as universal background checks, red flag laws, assault weapons ban. Those are the pieces of policy that 95 percent of Americans in this country and law enforcement have said over and over again are needed for us to feel safe in our communities and safe in America.

He arrived here and departed in a car with tinted windows, holding his head down, clearly trying not to be spotted by the world's media that had been assembled at court. But Pecker could potentially be a very valuable witness for prosecutors.Exactly one week ago, attorneys for the former president had requested that Robert Costello appear before the grand jury. And Costello's role was to attack the credibility of Michael Cohen and his version of how these hush money payments were arranged. Now over the past week or so, prosecutors have been contemplating whether they needed to call another witness to rebut Costello's testimony and button up their case before moving on to vote on a possible indictment. Pecker would be able to rebut that testimony because he was involved in putting together these hush money schemes or Stormy Daniels and at least one other woman to get them to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with the former president. Now at this point, the next time we know the grand jury will meet will be on Wednesday. We'll see what happens, then is unclear if they will move to vote on a possible indictment of the former president. Something that would be the first in U.S. history. Paula Reid, CNN, New York.
