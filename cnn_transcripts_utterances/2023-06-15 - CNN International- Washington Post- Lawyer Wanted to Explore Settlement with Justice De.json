The \"Washington Post\" reports the former U.S. president rejected efforts by one of his attorneys to try to negotiate a settlement with the Justice Department. Several sources told the newspaper that Trump showed no interest in finding an exit ramp and preferred a more combative approach. However, CNN spoke to sources close to Trump's legal team who are casting doubts on whether there was any real opportunity to cut a deal. Since what was listed in the indictment predates when that lawyer joined Trump's team. Meanwhile, the U.S. Attorney General is defending his decision to appoint Jack Smith as special counsel to prosecute the documents case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: As I said when I appointed Mr. Smith, I did so because it underscores the Justice Department's commitment to both independence and accountability. Mr. Smith is a veteran career prosecutor. He has assembled a group of experienced and talented prosecutors and agents who share his commitment to integrity and the rule of law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Kristen Holmes explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The former President Trump's campaign says it has now raised $7 million since that indictment on Thursday. Much of it coming from small donations, from digital fundraising, about 2.1 coming from the fundraiser he had Tuesday night after he was arraigned in Miami. This is significant. Because I spoke to a number of advisers and allies who weren't sure that he was going to be able to still get that big boost in fundraising after a second indictment. Now this is something that they are very excited about. I've talked to a number of his allies today who are saying that this is going to carry him through the election -- the indictment that is. And I spoke to a number of advisers who really laid out what they believe is a working playbook to help them get through the campaign with all these legal hurdles. The idea behind it is to essentially play this out in the court of public opinion, to change the narrative. And that is what you saw when Trump went to Versailles, that was a planned trip. His team wanted that video of him out there. They knew there would be no cameras inside of the Miami courtroom. But that would likely be some of the only video that existed of Trump from that day. Also what we saw afterwards when Trump called it election interference and a hoax, he is trying to spin his own narrative. Now I'm also told that Walt Nauta is going to be by Trump's side, that of course is his co-defendant, his body man. Even though he was told by a judge not to communicate with Trump about this case, nothing is going to change. That is according to an adviser. So as they roll out this campaign, Walt Nauta will continue to be by the former president's side at least for now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

President Zelenskyy just in the last few days made clear that that counteroffensive is under way. We do see intense fighting along the front lines particularly to the south, the Zaporizhzhia region and as well as to Bakhmut. And the point that we've heard from the NATO chief so far, Jens Stoltenberg, is that the help, the assistance, the military aid that these NATO defense ministers are providing is making a difference on the ground. But you have to remember these defense ministers are also under pressure. They have another meeting taking place tomorrow. They need to prove when they go back home that those billions of dollars that Ukraine is receiving is actually making a difference on the ground.

And the senior State Department official says that Blinken is expected it discuss the situation in Ukraine and to reiterate a call for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. And he was very cautious about the possibility of a breakthrough. Let's bring up this statement. This was what we heard from Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Pacific affairs. Saying, quote, we're not going to Beijing with the intent of having some sort of a break through or transformation in the way that we deal with one another. We're coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition in the most responsible way possible. Unquote. He also added that Blinken is expected to raise the issue of the three wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in China and also to call for appropriate high-level military to military communications. Earlier the U.S. Secretary of State had this phone call with China's foreign minister -- it took place on Wednesday. And in that call Qin Gang had some pointed words. He urged the U.S. to respect China's core concerns including Taiwan. And according to a foreign ministry readout of the call, the foreign minister said this -- let's bring it up for you. Quote, the U.S. should respect China's position on the Taiwan question, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests in the name of competition. Unquote. This diplomatic rift is there. It's been deepening between the U.S. and China over trade, over tech, over Taiwan, over territorial disputes, et cetera.
