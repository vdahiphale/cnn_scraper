      "sentences": "Although we expect that these next 25 days are going to be filled with events and travel that focus on issues that have really been central to Biden's presidency, but also his five plus decade career in public service.We know that the President will be traveling to Rome in the Vatican in mid-January to visit with the Pope. You may remember back in 2021, he met with Pope Francis ahead of the G20 summit in Rome, where he received communion and a blessing, which was consequential because there have been some questions over whether Biden's position on abortion is at odds with his Catholic faith and should therefore disqualify him. Pope Francis said that it should not. We also expect Biden to continue a series of speeches to try to burnish his legacy on policy issues like he did with the economy at the Brookings Institution earlier this month. Aides say that climate and foreign policy could be in focus as he looks to cement his legacy on some of these issues. But when it comes to specific policy advancements, Phil, we don't really expect him to do much more on that front because of how quickly the incoming administration could simply overturn some of those things. We do know that landing teams have arrived at various government agencies from the president-elect's team and that work of handing over the keys has already begun. Phil?",

It's been trying to push out all the money that was already signed off on there to furnish that legacy.But in terms of how people view the President right now, I think what's stunning to me, the latest Quinnipiac University poll, his approval is at 38 percent right now. In December of 2020, Donald Trump's approval after he'd lost the election was 44 percent now. That was pre-January 6. After January 6, his approval was 34 percent. That's kind of within the margin of where Biden is right now. And Donald Trump had January 6 -- EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Right.",

And he was able to sort of stave off of these tariff threats that he said would have helped Samsung versus Apple. So, and we were also seeing Elon Musk. Trump has sort of changed his tune on electric vehicles simply because of that relationship and the warming of those two relationships.

And this is true whenever large checks are written to any political party or candidate. But this level of giving is from companies that obviously are looking to be looked favorably upon.Donald Trump, we saw when he was president the first time, is transactional and there are things that he can do to help out when it comes to regulations, also potential carve outs when it comes to tariffs or deportation raids that would be not on the companies that are on the good list here. That seems to be part of what's going on in the minds of people, whether or not that it will prove to be the case. We'll find out. But look, I think that graphic that you had up when of all these logos of the companies. If Donald Trump had that behind him when he was campaigning a couple months ago, it would not have fit.

This really has nothing to do with whether these executives or companies they're affiliated with like President-elect Trump or support his policies or think he'd be good for America. Some do, some don't. In some cases, it's complicated. They like some things and don't like other things. It's about -- it is transactional or pragmatic. It is either about trying to get something or trying to be there for something that you want or trying to fend off something that you don't want, or just thinking, you know what? It's better to have the relationship and a little bit of goodwill than not to. That's all it means, but it is a lot of money riding on it. A lot of money. And it really, really inauguration time.
