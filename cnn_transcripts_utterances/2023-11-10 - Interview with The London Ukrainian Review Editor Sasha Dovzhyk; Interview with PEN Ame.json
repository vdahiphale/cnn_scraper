Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh on the fears of patients and medics. Then, out of the spotlight, but grinding on, Russia's war on Ukraine. I'll speak to Sasha Dovzhyk, editor of London Ukrainian Review. And ahead, jailed Iranian human rights activist, Narges Mohammadi, ends her hunger strike, but her struggle continues. CEO of Pan America, Suzanne Nossel, joins me. Plus, breaking through my life in science. Hari Sreenivasan speaks to Nobel Prize winner, Katalin Kariko, about her new memoir. And groundbreaking research into mRNA technology. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. A never-ending humanitarian nightmare. That's how the U.N. secretary- general describes the current situation in Gaza as tens of thousands of people flee south. The IDF today allowed another evacuation corridor for six hours and agreed to continue daily pauses in areas of Northern Gaza, according to the White House. Even the U.S., Israel's staunchest ally, denounced the civilian death toll. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying, \"Far too many Palestinians have been killed.\" Hospitals are again the focus of concern as fighting intensifies. Strikes were reported in the vicinity of several in Northern Gaza, and the director of a medical center said the facility was completely surrounded by tanks. Israel's military has not commented on the strikes, but accuses Hamas of embedding itself in civilian infrastructure. Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh has this report. And a warning, it contains video that is difficult and disturbing to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Night 34 of this war brought hell to Gaza's hospitals. Death so close for these medics outside Al-Awda Hospital, they recited their final prayers. The hospital says several were injured in these strikes and two ambulances were completely damaged. It was one of several hospitals struck in what was a night of horror for those sheltering at medical facilities in Northern Gaza. And on Friday, more heartache came with these devastating scenes at a Shifa hospital complex. The haunting screams of those who survived this blast, dazed, confused, searching for loved ones amongst the dead and injured. Images that infuriated humanitarians like Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert, who volunteered at a Shifa in the past.",

      "sentences": "Well, as you saw there, Bianna, in Jomana's reporting, the videos, the testimonies that are emerging from the Al ShifaHospital are horrifying to say the least. Once again, we are hearing testimonies of civilians being impacted in this latest strike. Eyewitnesses accusing the Israel Defense Forces of carrying out an airstrike on the vicinity of this hospital in the outpatient clinic. No comment just yet from the IDF on that strike. But as you saw there, this is really something that the doctors, the medics, the humanitarians on the ground have been warning about for weeks now, as we have seen airstrikes edging closer and closer to Gaza's hospitals. Al Shifa is the largest in Gaza. And it's not just patients, it's not just healthcare workers in the hospital that are impacted, but of course, the hundreds of civilians who have taken to hospitals like Al Shifa, thousands rather, taking shelter around these hospitals, hoping that these hospitals will remain a safe haven, a sanctuary amid these relentless airstrikes. And yet, what we are seeing day after day is these airstrikes or strikes rather edging closer to these hospitals that are at the brink of collapse, as we have heard from humanitarians on the ground. We have heard in the last hour or so from the U.N.'s relief chief, Martin Griffiths, he's spoken about the situation at Al Shifa. I'll just read you a quick bit from his statement saying, horrific reports of attacks on Al Shifa hospital coming out of Gaza today. The lives of thousands of patients, staff and displaced civilians are at risk. Under international humanitarian law, hospitals must be protected. Acts of war in places of grace must stop. Indeed, they must never happen. We have heard from the International Committee of the Red Cross issuing a statement on the situation facing Gaza's hospitals saying that they are overstretched, the situation is not safe, they are reaching the point of no return. And as we know, the vast majority of Gaza's hospitals are now out of service at Al Shifa. Several operating rooms have already been closed. And as we know, there have been strikes around other hospitals as well. As you saw in Jomana's reporting, the Al-Awda Hospital among them, at least 10 injured there. We have heard, of course, from a children's hospital in Gaza, the medical officials, they're saying that they have been surrounded now as ground fighting continues. They have appealed to the Red Cross to facilitate the evacuation of patients and civilians from this hospital. But as we know, as these airstrikes continue in the north, while there have been these pauses, humanitarian pauses established, it is very difficult for many people to evacuate from Northern Gaza southwest, particularly the elderly, particularly hospital patients who are not able to leave these hospitals. And, of course, as we know, these airstrikes have continued in Central Gaza, Gaza and Southern Gaza. And while the IDF says it is targeting Hamas targets, as we have seen repeatedly over four weeks now, more than four weeks now, civilian areas are indeed still coming under attack, including U.N. Run schools, including refugee camps, including hospitals and medical facilities. And as we've heard those warnings from the U.N.'s humanitarian chief today, there is, it seems, nowhere safe for civilians in Gaza to turn.",

He said, far too manyPalestinians have suffered in the last few weeks, according to Secretary Blinken. It's certainly is a subtle shift in U.S. position, though, it is important to note that the U.S. still has expressed its steadfast support and solidarity with the Israeli government, with the Israeli people. But what we are seeing is a shift. Secretary Blinken saying today that more can and should be done to minimize civilian deaths, to protect civilian lives, that there are ongoing discussions between the U.S. and counterparts in Israel on concrete steps that can be taken to ensure that civilian deaths are minimized, but also to ensure that humanitarian assistance is able to get in as well. And we've heard commitments from the U.S. now with regards to the situation in Gaza, with regards to the potential for a post-conflict governance in Gaza. We've heard, of course, earlier in the week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials indicating, signaling, that Israel would seek to establish overall security responsibility over Gaza once the war is over. And of course, that has been characterized by the U.S. earlier in the week as a mistake. Secretary Blinken today reiterating the U.S.' commitment to not only the -- against the displacement of Palestinians from the land, but also reiterating the U.S.' commitment for Palestinian governance, unified Palestinian governance in the future over both Gaza and the West Bank.

I indeed was in Ukraine just at the end of October, and what Isaw there was basically what I have been seeing through the entirety of Russia's full-scale invasion, incredible defiance, incredible resistance of the Ukrainian people. Almost all my classmates are on the front now and half of them have already been wounded. They recovered and they returned to the front lines to fight against Russia's genocidal onslaught on Ukraine. Ukrainian civilians continue helping in whatever way they can, be it weaving camouflage nets for the army, donating to support their defenders or keeping their story in the spotlight of international news. All of these efforts are absolutely inevitable in our case because we are fighting an existential war, which means we do not have a choice not to fight. If we stop fighting, there will be no more us. So, it's quite easy to continue in our case if we can -- if you -- if we want to continue to exist.",

Because if we lose our focus, it means that we lose on all fronts. If we allow Ukraine to slide down the scale of our attention, it means that we are letting down the people who represent a democracy. There is no doubt anywhere in the world that Ukraine is a democracy. We're letting them down. We show the world that democracies are not our priority. And we send a clear signal to authoritarians around the world that democracies can be attacked. It means that by staying with Ukraine and keeping our attention on Ukraine, although there are other horrible conflicts exploding around the world, it means that we will make the world a safer place if we continue supporting the people who are resisting a truly atrocious genocidal onslaught coming from an authoritarian regime.",

We very well may see a government shutdown next week because President Biden is asking for funding for both the war in Ukraine and helping Israel, and Republicans at this point seem to only be agreeing on the Israel aspect of this.

We are the ones who are sacrificing our health, our lives. And basically, at the time that could be invested into building our culture, developing our infrastructure, protecting our environment, we are losing this time to the battle against Russia's invasion, which threatens not only us, it threatens other countries in the European Union. We know very well that Russian TV propagandists threaten not only Ukraine, but also Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, Sweden, all the allies of the U.S. in Europe. And Ukraine, by fighting alone, in terms of, you know, bodies, our physical presence on the ground, is actually putting a shield in front of the allies of the U.S. in Europe. And by this, we are making the continent a safer place. If we receive the support that we need to defend ourselves and to win this war, we will send a clear signal to everyone around the globe who is now watching this war in Ukraine that democracies will be supported and that further international conflicts are not worth pursuing.",

This is not what a NATO country would be asked to do. This is not what is expected of our allies in the West. We basically persevered because we do not have another choice. There are people in the territories occupied by Russia who are suffering from the occupation regime. And when we liberate our territories, as we've done, I would like to remind us that Ukraine has actually liberated more than a half of the territories that Russia occupied since the start of the full- scale invasion. When we liberate those territories, we face what -- actually cannot be forgotten. We face the mass graves of our fellow citizens. I am among those who stood in front of a mass grave in the forest of Izium in the Kharkiv region, where a fellow writer was buried, Volodymyr Vakulinko (ph) was his name. And after this, you understand that you do not have a choice. You must liberate all the territories, and this is the only peace guarantee that exists for Ukrainians. We understand that unless Russia is pushed back to its actual internationally recognized borders, we will not have peace in Ukraine. Any ceasefire at the moment will be used by Russia to rearm and attack Ukraine. Because basically, for them, it is also an existential fight. The existence of our democracy and our fight for freedom is an existential threat to Russia's authoritarian regime. So, if we succeed, Russia will also experience an internal crisis, which will definitely push Russians to reconsider their current order.",

Ukrainians went out to the streets and protested. This turned into a three- month long revolution as a result of which Yanukovych was ousted and we actually succeeded in toppling the regime that tried to dissuade our European hopes and aspirations. The success of Ukrainian democratic revolution was not actually met with any optimism in the Kremlin. And what followed was the invasion of Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea. I would like to say that these days we see that the path towards European Union was not an easy one for us, but we are succeeding. And this victory for us means that we can also win on the battlefield, just because we persevere and just because we don't have other choice.

And she was insistent that she was not going to put on a hijab for this trip to the hospital. And she was on hunger strike demanding to receive medical attention. It was a standoff. And then, the Iranian authorities, from what we can tell, gave in and they let her go to the hospital. They said that the transfer to the hospital was conducted properly within all the appropriate regulations. And yet, we've heard from her and her associates she did not wear the job. And so, you know, her point was, if that was considered proper and in compliance with all the requisite authorities, if I didn't have to wear a hijab, no one should have to wear a hijab. And so, she used this moment to press her point as an activist and an advocate, not just for herself, but for all Iranian women in this campaign to shake off the hijab, certainly not have it be compulsory and to win their freedom.

One or the other had been in prison their entire lives. So, to cast aside your family life, your loved ones in service of freedom for other women, human rights in Iran is just extraordinary. And she's also been a remarkable documenter of, you know, just what exactly it is that happens in this regime. She put out a book about the experience of Iranian women enduring solitary confinement and did interviews with 12 women. This is like on a brief prison furlough. Manages to do interviews with 12 women who had endured solitary confinement in an Iranian prison and to tell their stories and make the case. She called it white torture, that solitary confinement is a form of torture and actually advance the ball internationally in terms of recognizing the ramifications of solitary confinement all over the world and that it really needs to be acknowledged as a form of torture. So, she's just relentless. And you could see how she uses every single moment of her life to wage this struggle. And I think over the last year with the uprising of women after the killing of Mahsa Amini in Iran, it's been an inspiration to so many young women who've taken to the streets, to their schoolyards, casting off their hijabs, challenging the regime with just enormous courage and in the face of really terrifying repression.",

If you could tell us a bit about what your home was like in post-war Hungary. You describe a scenario where you didn't have running water. DR. KARIKO:  Yes. But it was -- for me, it was a paradise, you know, because we had a garden, we had animals there, chicken and pigs, and we had beautiful flowers there. And of course, yes, we -- everybody in the neighborhood went to -- you know, to get water to the street. And that was, you know -- when we talked to each other, that was the chat room there.",

And, you know, in the school, more than 50 kids were in one class and it was, you know -- but we were quiet and we had to listen. So, it was a different environment in. From outside it seems like, you know, it's very deprived, but it was very vivid and very nurturing, and the teachers were great, and yes, you know, we had -- up until 10 years old, we had no television, we had no refrigerator, and many other things. But I didn't know that we don't have nobody yet in the neighborhood. Yes. So -- but we -- you know, the nature which surrounded us was interesting. And, you know, getting -- seeing the stork is coming back and the bird -- you know, the birds. And I have -- you know, we had chickens and we didn't purchase those, you know, we took the eggs and the -- you know, the sitting -- the hand was sitting on it. And then, we could see how the chicken is coming out from the eggs. And that's so it is great.",

And you know what happens when your sister is studying well, the teachers in this tiny village, you know, everybody's expecting you that you will be good as well. And so, I had to be good because they expected. And of course, you know, I was challenged with a different competition. We could participate. And when I prepared and I was winning, you know, it gave me more enthusiasm to study more. And then, eventually I was -- in eighth grade I was served best in the country in biology.

We lost funding for this research we were doing in Hungary. And I might say that four times I am not terminated in my position. We wouldn't talk today because that was part of it. And it is very important I emphasize that, you know, the decision was made and I did not spend time to feeling sorry for myself, but rather focused on what I should do next. And that was the mantra Janos Shaya (ph), the Hungarian scientist said, how you can handle stress that you always focus on what you can change. And when I was in high school, we read his book. And then I -- again, if I don't read that book, probably I'm not talking here because he -- we learned that how to handle the stress and focusing on things we can change. And that's why also that everything you have to look at the positivity. And when I received the other awards, I said, thank you to all of the people try to make my life miserable, because they -- we work harder and I get improved.",

That's when people really started to -- right? So, there might be so much other research that has been done and published that we're not really aware of or interested in until kind of a crisis moment forces us to start looking for answers. DR. KARIKO:  Yes. You know, so that's how science is. You know, that me in Hungary, when I started to work, my supervisor came from the industry. So, it's very rare that somebody in the academia is coming from the industry. It is usually the different -- the opposite direction. And then, it instilled from the first day that what we are doing has to be useful for something. And that's every time -- even if I was working at anywhere, you know, always thinking that what it would be useful for. So, you know, that I'm doing something. And many scientists started thinking on the same way. And I mean, more and more companies created in the university setting and, you know, the ideas were spent out and they test out. And so, that's the way to get to recognize. I tried the same. 2005, we published. 2006, you know, we -- Drew Weissman, we made the company. But we couldn't get the patent for our own company. That's maybe another one. That's what's painful for me from PEN that, you know, they did not give us the patent. And so, our company could not be functioning.",

I mean, you write, there's such a gap between what people know and what they would need to know to fully understand the vaccines and medicines that save lives. That gap right now is wide open for exploitation. We must somehow close it. I mean, because even though the vaccines were saving lives and we could see that result, there was still such a debate about whether or not the vaccines worked. DR. KARIKO:  Yes. So, that was absolutely surprising for me, because I remember when I was growing up in Hungary that we had a vaccine for many different things. And we were happy that we had vaccines so we will be protected. And I have to say that when people don't understand something, you know, that they try to come up with, think or they are reading something and somebody comes up with a stupid idea and then they just believe that, because, you know, when -- you know, you see a storm and, you know, like even long time ago they said, OK, Zeus is angry. And then, that's why we have. So, that's explanation. So, they need explanation. And then, if somebody provide them something, which is stupid, then they take and start to believe that that's happened. Somebody wants to put a chip on the vaccine, somebody wants to kill us, somebody wants to follow us. And I don't know this -- why people are so sensitive for this kind of distorted view. But what I think it is maybe you need psychologists and different science field experts to come up with a solution how we could fight, you know, misinformation.",

Is it science education? Is it about misinformation, along with the actual hard science? Where should we be investing our time and resources in preparing? DR. KARIKO:  Definitely. So, that's why I offered my time to -- you know, for education, to talk to the reporters together. We have to somehow simplify the language, which is the sciences, you know, we use terms that nobody understands. But -- so, we have to simplify it, help the public to understand better. You see, not just the mRNA, people learn too, they learn PCR, you know, they can learn and then they have some idea what it could be and we have to have them. And of course, the next pandemic, we need other preparedness, you know, which -- with mRNA, you know, we can respond very quickly, but definitely the gap is so huge.
