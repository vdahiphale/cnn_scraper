Tonight, democracy watch in one of the world's most traveled yet important regions. Israel is facing unprecedented internal unrest as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forges ahead with a controversial bill to allow lawmakers a political veto over the Supreme Court, the independent judiciary. Millions have taken to the streets in some of the largest protests the country has ever seen. Business leaders, legal experts, and ex-military chiefs are also voicing concerns. And many serving military offices and reservists are threatening to refuse if the bill passes. Ever since its creation, Israel has proclaimed itself the sole democracy amid dictatorships and authoritarians in that region. Its strongest allies, like the United States, have touted that democracy as a reason for its steadfast backing. Yet even their support is shifting. We discuss all of this and the ramifications with our guest tonight. First, a rare international interview with Efraim Halevy. Former head of Mossad, one of the pillars of the state devoted to security he joined me from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't thinkthere is any firmed-up arrangement as to how this arrangement been China in Ukraine will be eventually finalized. But I can assure you that there are channels of communication between China and Ukraine at the very top and in multiple ways. So, they keep talking with each other. And be in China and Russia, of course. They have hotlines. They can compare notes and talk with each other about many things, not only about the war but more importantly about China- Russian cooperation in many areas. China is probably the only country today, in the world of today, which is well equipped to broker a deal between Russia on the one hand and Ukraine on the other hand because it does not have a vested interest. China's only interest is to promote peace between these two countries on the basis of the U.N. Charter and full respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of a member state of the United Nations. On that basis, I think whatever territorial disputes between Russia and Ukraine can be really talked about in peace and diplomacy rather than through war. And no one should be allowed to pour more fuel onto the war in Ukraine, leading to more destructions and more loss of civilian lives in Ukraine.",

Of course, if it's a changing administration, then I think it is concerning what their future holds. I think it's important to understand during the Trump administration, for example, you had advisors like Stephen Miller who threw wrenches in the gears in order to lessen the number of special immigrant visas that were granted. And so, when President Biden came into power, he actually had a massive backlog of these interpreters of, you know, military aides who were just waiting in the queue. By law, they should have been processed in nine months. And in fact, the average time period was a least -- you know, was about three years.
