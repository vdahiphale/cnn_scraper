And, you know, it really was kind of the opposite of what we know some of Donald Trump's Republican allies and members of Congress were trying to do in defending that comment.So, first of all, this came during Donald Trump's Fox News town hall last night. It's going to air at 11:00 a.m. today. It was an all- female audience, which I think is actually very notable given how much I know from my conversations with Trump's senior advisors that they're trying to make inroads with women voters, particularly as they see that widening gender gap with Harris. But as for this comment, look, Donald Trump said over the weekend that he thinks our - the U.S.' greatest threat is not our foreign adversaries, but actually the enemy from within. As I said, a lot of Republican allies have tried to defend that comment saying he was referring to protesters when he talked about potentially sending in the military to deal with that enemy from within. They were saying it's the same thing when you see the National Guard go out to try and tamp down riots. Donald Trump, however, though, made clear he is talking about political opponents. I'm going to read for you some of what he said. He said, quote, \"it is the enemy from within and they're very dangerous. We have China, we have Russia, we have all these countries. If you have a smart president, they can all be handled. The more difficult are, you know, the Pelosis, these people, they're so sick and they're so evil.\" So clearly directly referencing the Pelosis there. It's clear he's talking about Democrats when he says this. Now the other thing, I think, just to add to this, is that we know that Republicans have been consistently arguing that the Democrats' rhetoric, particularly calling Donald Trump a threat to democracy, they are blaming that for the two assassination attempts on Donald Trump's life, saying that Donald Trump never uses the same type of language. I think it's clear here that this is very dangerous language. Now, one other notable thing from yesterday. We saw Donald Trump speak at the Chicago Economic Club. He did an interview with \"Bloomberg News.\" But a striking moment from then is, when he was pressed on whether he would accept the election results in November. And Donald Trump, once again, refused to say that he would do so. He also really tamped down what had happened on January 6th in 2021. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: People were there. People were there. And I'll tell you what, they never show that.

Twenty days left. This is about choices. With 20 days left, you've got to make choices as a campaign. And, Jim, I want to focus on what the vice president is doing today, appearing with more than 100 Republicans, giving a speech about patriotism in Bucks County. \"Politico\" is reporting today there are some Pennsylvania Democrats upset that she's not more focused on turning out Democratic voters, maybe black voters in Philadelphia. So, what about that choice? Is she making the right one there? JIM MESSINA, FORMER OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I think it's a silly choice, John. We can do both. We can walk and chew gum. We can turn out voters and talk to swing voters. And winning campaigns do both of those things. If she wins Bucks County or even breaks even, she's going to win Pennsylvania. Do we need to turn out the vote in Philly? Of course we do. And we will. And she's focused just on that. But we also have to talk to swing voters. Whether we like it or not, we're in a tied race.

So, targeting them is an effective strategy for some of those swing states, like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin and places like that. So, I do think it's thoughtful.
