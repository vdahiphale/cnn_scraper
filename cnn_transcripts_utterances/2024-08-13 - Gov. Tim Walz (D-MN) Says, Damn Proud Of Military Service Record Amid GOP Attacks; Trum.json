Take us inside how Elon Musk turned X, formerly known as Twitter, into a pro-Trump machine promoting disinformation and hate speech in the process. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Wolf. Yes, look, I mean, we shouldn't pretend that X or Twitter, as it was formerly known, was ever this kind of haven of just, you know, great conversation and no hate and no misinformation. It always had its problems. But, really, the transformation of this platform and still such a hugely important and influential platform, both in the U.S. and around the world under Musk, it has just been incredible. Of course, after January 6th, Trump had been suspended from Twitter, as had many election conspiracy theorists, white supremacists, and other people who were sharing hate on the platform. Musk basically brought them all back. When it comes to Musk himself, he has gone down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories. Himself, he is also, as well as being the owner of the platform, he has the most followers on the platform, 190 million followers. And what we've seen over the past few weeks, especially, is Musk really pushing totally discredited conspiracy theories about voting machines and also this conspiracy theory that is becoming popular on the far right and in MAGA circles that undocumented people will vote en masse for Democrats in November. That is false. There is no evidence for that, whatsoever. But that is something that Musk is pushing. So, you can really see, you know, just in terms of bringing characters like this back and pushing these lies himself, Musk has totally transformed this platform.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf, I think that the vice president is facing criticism for not sitting down, but it's important to point out where that criticism is coming from. It's coming from us in the media. Obviously, we are people who like to sit down with folks in power to ask some tough questions, something that we feel is within our guidance as journalists.And it's also coming from the Trump campaign who want her to sit down because they believe in a lot of ways that maybe she makes mistakes in those inscriptive moments, trying to kind of put her in a place where she could look bad or she could have a bad interview, something that has happened in the past, particularly we know that first interview with Lester Holt, her first year as vice president. But because of that is where that critique is coming, from the media and Trump, I think that's why you're seeing the vice president's campaign really kind of wave it off, dismiss it, because they aren't hearing those same concerns or wishes for her to sit down and do an interview or press conference from the American voters who they are very much so focused on right now. And they're not hearing it also from the other elected Democratic officials, something that we heard after President Biden did his debate in June. They obviously wanted him to sit down to show that cognitively he could take the case and make the case against Trump. And so I think that those are two of the reasons why we haven't seen her yet and why we may not even see her before the convention. We know when asked last week when she would do an interview, she said that she had talked to her team about it and that they were looking before September. So, that's a couple of weeks from now obviously after the convention, but I think that those are the two main factors in their kind of decision-making, Wolf.",

But you're right, Wolf, I think that we are in a majorly different media environment, social media ecosystem environment this election cycle than we were last time. And a lot of that actually has to do with after January 6th, a lot of people, including Trump, but a lot of his supporters, too, were kicked off the major social media platforms. Now, a lot of them, of course, have been put back onto those platforms. But what that allowed for was really this creation of a whole alternate universe of social media platforms, like Truth Social, but there's many others out there. And lots and lots and lots of Americans, millions of Americans, are getting their news information and misinformation from those platforms. [18:15:05] BLITZER: Yes, a lot of misinformation.

And on top of that, the head of UAW, Shawn Fain, and Donald Trump have had nothing but negative things to say about each other publicly for the last several months, if not years.So, it's not surprising that the two are at each other. And obviously the concern would be for the rank and file members because Donald Trump's team and Donald Trump himself, to an extent, know that they're never going to get union leadership behind Donald Trump. He is, if you talk to any labor expert, not a pro-labor president. But what they have tried to do is reach out to those working class voters, to those rank and file union members, and to some extent, they have been incredibly successful. Even if you ask some of these labor union leaders, they will admit to you that the rank and file often sides with Donald Trump. And that is something that could be of a concern with these comments. But when you talk again about labor in general, Donald Trump is not necessarily pushing a pro-labor agenda, but what he's pushing is a change in the economy. And he believes that reaching out to these working class voters, he can reach them by talking about inflation, by talking about the price of groceries, by talking about the price of gasoline at the pump. And that's how he thinks that they will be getting these kind of voters. Now, obviously, again, this could hurt him with them, but that's not entirely the platform he's running on, that he would be pro-labor 100 percent.",

There are still major sticking points, major differences between these two sides. And then, of course, there is this threat of Iranian retaliation, which is still very much looming. And should that retaliation come before those talks actually take place, depending on the severity of those strikes, depending on what happens on the ground here in Israel, it could derail those talks all together, or at least potentially postpone them until a later date. But for now, the United States, European countries are trying to bring enormous pressure to bear to keep Iran from retaliating before those talks actually happen. And the U.S. also has a number of officials in the region working to try and craft a bridging proposal, to try and bridge the difference between the Hamas and the Israeli positions on these talks. And so, ultimately, whether or not we can get to those talks will be the critical question.

He also lost a colleague, a 65-year-old woman who went missing after the evacuation orders.Her friends and colleagues say that they were looking for her. She went missing, and eventually her body was found here at a place of work. She spent over 20 years of her life at this business and her co- workers are saying how she was talking about going back to home country, back to her daughters at the end of this year. And sadly, they say she just didn't make it. And today, we find a rose left here by someone that says we'll remember her dearly. More than 700 firefighters, almost 200 vehicles and 35 water bombing aircraft have now managed to control the blaze. But 100,000 acres of land were lost. The extent of the damage so great, it can be seen from space. A scenario of destruction, just a few miles from Athens. Experts say the last few years of fires are drastically changing the city's climate, the loss of trees making winds and temperatures rise along with the risk of fire. A tough challenge ahead local officials are well aware of.",

One thing that really resonates is just what happens next, their new reality. I've been covering these wildfires for a few years now and the same question is, you know, what happens now, where are they going to go and live if their houses have been destroyed. They feel very abandoned and also the reality is that every single year, this is going to be a phenomenon that is inescapable. You've got prolonged heat waves not only in Athens, but also around Greece, which creates so much risk in terms of what lies ahead.",

We know what that can do to the power grid. But I want you to do is look at Puerto Rico right here and how much rainfall could fall tonight from Ponce all the way, there could be flash flooding with ten inches of rain. So yes, there'll be wind, but I think the biggest threat, Wolf, is going to be flooding.",
