Sergei Shoigu says Russian forces wounded and captured a lot of Ukrainian soldiers in the process.

I mean, all along the front lines, Russia is the one with the initiative.They are attacking in multiple locations and Ukraine is not only on the defensive but has been actively now for several months digging in, essentially taking a page out of Russia's playbook last year and digging lines of defenses. I think what's interesting, if you look at the behavior of Putin, the commentary that he made around Avdiivka, is he is taking a very central role. When he met with the defense minister Shoigu yesterday, it was Putin that sat there with the map and the pen asking for granular detail on, you know, a small village on the left bank of the Dnipro, talking about weapons and supplies and logistics and things like that. He comes across as someone who wants to be seen as the commander-in- chief of the Russian army. He's trying to bank these successes ahead of the second anniversary of the invasion, ahead of the elections that are coming up next month. He even came close to a smile, I would say, when talking about Avdiivka. So, this is a moment where Russia is emboldened and is taking the initiative on the battlefield. And I think, you know, that is essentially the situation that we are at. President Putin coming across very confident. And this morning, again, another military setting awarding awards essentially to members of Russia's aerospace forces for excellence in the special military operation. You can see him there again.

Russia needs to push further. And so, you know, that reveals his intentions. Obviously, we know that the four regions, within the four regions that Russia has illegally annexed in Ukraine or claims to have illegally annexed, they don't actually occupy all the territory within those regions.

With a queen-size bed and mini-fridge, his prison cell looks more like a hotel. And his recent jailbreak is shining a spotlight on the country's prison system that experts say has turned into the headquarters for criminal groups. CNN's David Culver reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's as though they're stepping into a war zone. Ecuador's military and national police trail an armored vehicle in a raid of one of the country's 35 prisons. Inside, prisoners stripped down, hands tied. Scenes like this have played out across Ecuador over the past few weeks, the armed forces making a very public show of force, attempting to reinstate order within their own prisons. It's part of Ecuador's effort to neutralize terror groups and weed out gangs, which have unleashed chaos nationwide, from a live TV studio armed takeover, to random shootings in the streets. This most recent surge in violence sparked by the suspected escape of this man, Jose Adolfo Macias, known as Fito. On January 7, officials reported that while serving a 34-year sentence for murder and drug trafficking, the notorious gang leader vanished from this prison in Guayaquil. A drone's view allows us to grasp the scale of this complex. It is sprawling.",

And over here, maximum security, known as La Roca, or The Rock. With a military escort, we go past the first of three perimeters. Any farther, we're told, too dangerous, even with armed soldiers.

The images captured last year by members of Ecuador's military. They appear to show Fito's cell, messy, but complete with home comforts, a mini-fridge, a queen bed, upscale shower fittings, artwork featuring an image of Fito himself with guns and cash. He lives like a king -- you can hear one of the soldiers say in this video, obtained by CNN and verified by Ecuador's military. Outside, his own courtyard, and a half-dozen fighting roosters believed to be his. A military source tells us Fito had fresh fish imported for his meals, and somehow even managed to shoot a music video from within the prison walls. Equavisa showing these images of Fito's 42nd birthday in 2022. The prisoners reportedly enjoyed cake, music, and drinks. The night capped off with fireworks. He had more power outlets than a Marriott hotel room, Ecuador's president, Daniel Novoa, said late last year. So why escape? Ecuadorian security experts believe that Fito was tipped off that he was going to be transferred in the same complex back to \"The Rock,\" maximum security. Fito spent a few weeks in The Rock last year. Moving him there involved an estimated 4,000 police and soldiers. His sudden disappearance, suggesting he wasn't ready to leave the comforts of his cell. The government's focus now is to reassert control within, but it won't be easy. Prison raids have turned up everything from laptops to guns.
