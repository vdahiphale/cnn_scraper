The U.S. gives Israel 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access to Gaza or face restricted military aid. Bow wow. Chinese giant pandas Bao Li and Qing Bao arrive in Washington, D.C. after their long trip from China. Burned bridges. North Korea blows up road and railway links with the South. And K-drama delight. Korean TV captivating audiences around the world. We go behind the scenes to help explain why. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, the Biden administration is demanding Israel do more to improve the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza or risk military aid restrictions. The warnings coming in a letter from the U.S. secretaries of both state and defense who say the amount of aid into Gaza has dropped by more than half since the spring. They're giving Israel 30 days to start letting at least 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day and to start implementing humanitarian pauses in the fighting to allow for vaccinations and that aid to be distributed. And Israel continues its assault on Gaza. It's facing its own crisis with Hezbollah. The group's de facto leader is warning Israelis they must choose between a ceasefire or, quote, \"pain.\" (INAUDIBLE) said without a truce, Israelis will be in danger at any hour of any day. CNN has gotten a rare look behind the frontlines of Israel's fight against Hezbollah in Lebanon, embedding with the Israel Defense Forces. Our Jerusalem Correspondent Jeremy Diamond and photographer Byron Blunt were under IDF escort at all times, but CNN did retain editorial control over the final report and did not submit footage to the IDF for review. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the ruins of this Southern Lebanese village, amid flattened buildings, crumpled cars and mounds of rubble, there are also Israeli soldiers. Two weeks into their ground operation, they now control multiple villages like this one. But for how long and how much deeper into Lebanon will they go?

What Harris is trying to do, she's trying to, as you say, talk to niche audiences. She's talking today, for example, she's targeting black male voters who are normally a Democratic constituency, but where Trump has been able to make some inroads. And when you're talking about states like Georgia Michigan, for example, that could be decided by, say, 5,000 or 10,000 votes in three weeks' time, every single vote you can, A, get out to vote for you and prevent from going to Trump is very, very important.

And that's the message she's trying to send to Republican voters. As you say, there are some of them who are disdainful of Trump. They're worried about his temperament. In the primaries, we saw in many states, about 20 percent of voters voting for Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, who is running against Trump, and saying that he was unfit to govern. If she can get some of those voters, and she's been having the help of former Rep. Liz Cheney in this quest, she could, again, build up a few more voters that could be key in these closed states.

He told Micklethwait, basically, you're wrong on this, and you'd be wrong on everything for your whole life. If you are a mainstream journalist asking him these questions, it's very difficult. But what that event also showed was Trump's compelling appeal to many Americans. Micklethwait is, you know, representative of a class of elite journalists, you know, classic economic journalist who presumably support the financial system as it is, but that's a financial system that many heartland Americans feel has really left them behind. Trump is showing the -- in that event, the appeal of his populism. It doesn't really matter to mere Americans if his ideas make much economic sense, he is acting as a vessel for people's unhappiness and frustration and resentment and it showed exactly why he's going to get millions of votes, tens of millions of votes on November the 5th.",

Kim Jong-un said he was going to do it, and it no longer appears in satellite imagery. So, this is also a movie we've seen before.

A version of that balloon drama is still happening today. So, back in 2020, to retaliate, North Korea blew up this building near the border, which was supposed to be a cooperation office between North and South Korea. So, bottom line, tensions have been much worse before. South Korea has actually had islands shelled by North Korea and a battleship also sunk by North Korea that happened back in 2010. Tensions now are nowhere near that point. The two roadways that were demolished in this most recent episode, well, they haven't been used for years. And when South Korea retaliated, its gunfire stayed in South Korean territory. It did not reach the North. Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'll explain why. First, oil trading at near two-week lows as fears eased of a possible retaliatory attack by Israel on Iranian oil facilities. The International Energy Agency also predicting an oil surplus next year, which is also helping to contain prices. Energy shares fell along with the price of oil. And U.S. stocks also closed lower. Chip makers were actually the biggest drag on the NASDAQ, with the chip maker ASML losing 16 percent after warning about sales in China in particular, and that then dragged other chip makers with it. Plus, the living la NVIDIA loca rally ending abruptly. You see what we did there? Closing down nearly 5 percent. There were also reports that the Biden administration is considering capping A.I. chip exports too. Meanwhile, luxury giant LVMH also taking a tumble with a fall in third quarter sales amid weakening demand in both China and in Japan. And speaking of which, there was a mixed close in Asia with disappointing September trade data from China sending the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite lower. We'll see what trade Wednesday brings. Now, Boeing is trying to shore up massive financial losses from a crippling strike and a catalog of operational and safety issues. Well, it's now going cap in hand to Wall Street and the banks to raise $25 billion by selling stock and debt. And it's announced plans to borrow $10 billion ahead of a new round of layoffs too. The company's debt levels surging to new heights over the last six years. It's currently settled with core operating losses of $33 billion. Vanessa Yurkevich has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Andthat, remember, was the warmest on record. 2023 was dominated by an El Nino weather pattern, which prevented many heavy snow events and even caused a snow drought in parts of the United States. Well, this year, it could be La Nina's turn. The cooler counterpart. The Climate Prediction Center, says it could roll in by the end of November and stick around until as late as spring of 2025. Let's find out more with Chad Myers. Does that mean more snow, Chad?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I don't think we can get less than eight inches for New York City. That's just -- that's a pretty low number.We've set the bar pretty low there. The normal in New York should be 30 inches. So, 750 millimeters, and we weren't even close. So, what's happened here? Well, El Nino is when the water here across parts of the equatorial Pacific here, South America, is warmer than normal. The opposite, La Nina is when it's cooler than normal. And that's, I think, where we're going. I don't know how far we're going to get there, or is it going to be a strong one or a weak one, but when they happen, they deflect the jet stream to the north. And then all of a sudden, it comes back down across British Columbia into the Pacific Northwest and then into the Great Lakes. That changes the weather pattern in North America, making a wetter pattern in the northwest. They'll take it because it's been dry. Even forest fires. We could take a little bit of rain in the reservoirs as well. Cooler across the north, which is the exact opposite that has happened in the El Nino and then warm but fairly wet here in the cross parts of the Great Lakes. Now, warm doesn't mean 40. Warm may mean 31, especially if you should be 26. So, many times those 31-degree snowfalls can be even heavier if you see that moist and warm, if you're supposed to be well below freezing, then you're right closer to freezing, then you get the heavy wet snow. So, that's kind of what we're hoping for. At least some of us. The kids are for sure. The drivers probably not so much. Dry across the upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and warmer across it. That's what we were. Here's where we were across parts of the winter of last year. Cool, but not cold enough and not snowy enough to really make any difference. Here's what the forecast is going to look like coming out on Thursday, a fairly above normal winter here and a below normal winter across the Pacific Northwest. And then, again, here is the rainfall that's coming through the Great Lakes all the way up toward the northeast. If you get that warmer and wetter right -- in the right place, then, all of a sudden, you do get more snow. Now, across the globe things are not as impressive of a change when it comes to La Nina, but it will be cool across parts of West Africa, maybe wet a little bit as well here and then drier through China and then cooler up to the word of the north, but not as significant of a change as the places across parts of North America, because that's where that La Nina truly moves the jet stream. Sure, it kind of slows down a little bit and it kind of waves and it changes a little bit east of there, but not as much as where we're probably going to see some significantly cool and very wet weather across the Pacific Northwest.

More than 800 people kicked out of theU.S. military under Don't Ask, Don't Tell have now been given honorable discharges. The policy prohibited openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. Congress repealed it more than a decade ago. However, it took until just last year for the Pentagon to proactively review the discharge cases. And Nepali teenager got a hero's welcome home after becoming the youngest person ever to summit all 14 of the world's 8,000-meter peaks. 18-year-old Nima Rinji Sherpa started his quest just two years ago. He's now one of only 40 people who've done it. But Nima says the achievement isn't just for him, it's a tribute to all of Nepal's Sherpas.

So, if we use New York as the example, you would download the New York City Board of Elections app. They wouldverify that you are a registered voter in New York. Then they have that defined that you're really you. So, the first thing is multifactor authentication. So, you get an e-mail sent to you, like you would, if you forgot your Hulu password or Amazon or whatever it is, you enter the code back into the app. Then they use biometric screening to determine that you really are you. So, in the way that like clear works at airports, same thing here. Once that is determined, the ballot pops up on your screen. It looks like any kind of simple internet ballot, but because it's digital, we no longer have the risk of straight pencil marks or under voting or over voting, or if you're ever back in 2000 hanging chads. You go through, you make all of your selections once you've decided, OK, I've got this right, you hit submit and two things happen. The first thing is the ballot is immediately encrypted. The second is you get a tracking number, like if it were a FedEx package. And you can track the progress of your ballot all the way through the process. It then goes back to the New York City Board of Elections. And the first thing they do is the air gap the ballot, which means they take it off of the internet. And after it's no more connected to the internet, then they decrypt it. A paper ballot is -- a copy of automatically printed out. It gets mixed in with all the other ballots from mail-in and in-person and whatever other ways people are voting, you're able to track the progress all the way through. So, you can see that your ballot was submitted, received, printed, tabulated, so on. And because all of the code itself is open source, it can be checked and audited and verified by any cryptographer or anyone that knows it. So, we think we have built a system that really takes every security question into account. And quite frankly, it's a lot more secure than the way we vote it right now.",
