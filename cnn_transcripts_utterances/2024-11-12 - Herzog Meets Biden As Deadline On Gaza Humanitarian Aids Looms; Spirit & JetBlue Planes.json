      "sentences": "New today, President Biden meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the White House. The timing of this visit is notable. A U.S. deadline for Israel to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza is set to expire in a matter of hours.And some aid groups say that not only will Israel miss that deadline, but it's actions on the ground right now are only making the situation worse. CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us now. So, Kylie, take us through what happened at this meeting between Biden and Herzog and what happens if Israel doesn't comply with this deadline?",

      "sentences": "That's right. So what we're watching today is what, if anything, the Biden administration does with regard to this 30- day deadline, that they actually put in place by themselves.What they said to Israel is that if Israel didn't make commitments, didn't make actions on a number of mandates that the U.S. was saying that needed to take, actions in terms of getting more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, that they could effectively jeopardize U.S. military assistance that is coming from the U.S. to Israel. Now, these aid organizations are out today saying that not only did Israel not live up to those demands that the U.S. made, but they've actually made the situation in Gaza worse. Now, we haven't gotten the formal U.S. assessment, the U.S. government assessment of what Israel has done in the last 30 days. But obviously, President Biden and President Herzog, of Israel, one of the things that we expected that they discussed today was that. We don't know the specifics of that discussion. But what we're told by U.S. officials is that they not actually going to make any policy changes that they're going announce today, any overarching policy changes with regard to this letter that they sent Israel. That is going to be incredibly frustrating for these humanitarian aid organizations who are saying that Israel isn't only ignoring the United States but making the situation worse. There's also a group of folks that have resigned from the Biden administration over the course of last year, saying that the Biden administration should have halted arms sales to Israel. They're coming out today and saying, once again, that they believe that the Biden administration should uphold their commitment to the demands that they made in this letter. I want you to listen to some of those voices in the new video that they put out today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But this could have been really serious.You know, this would have caused a rupture in the pressure vessel of the airplane. That's something that keeps the inside of the plane pressurized, high pressure inside the airplane, so you can breathe. The air is much thinner outside. This could have caused a rupture in that way. Thankfully, it didn't seem like that ultimately happened here. This flight was able to fly at a normally high altitude when it diverted over to Santiago there in the Dominion Republic. But this could have been really, really serious. And so there could have been major ramifications for people onboard. People could have been wearing oxygen masks.

The honor bestowed yesterday for Veterans Day more than a century after the abolitionist's death.Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece accepted the symbolic ranking on her behalf. Born into slavery as one of 11 children, Harriet Tubman spent 10 years guiding slaves out of the south beginning in 1850. But Monday's commemoration is the first official recommendation for what Tubman did after that, her military service. She helped liberate more than 700 enslaved people during the Civil War. And she was also a spy and a recruiter. Joining me now is Tubman's descendant, Ernestine \"Tina\" Wyatt, who accepted that honor yesterday. Thank you so much for being with us. What was it like to stand there in place of your Aunt Harriet, as you call her, and receive this incredible honor? ERNESTINE \"TINA\" WYATT, DESCENDENT OF HARRIET TUBMAN: Well, thank you for having me. It was overwhelming and it was just wonderful and so emotional of being able to accept something that is long overdue for her. Having made application for her pension for being a spy and a scout during the Civil War, she was actually denied for that, but did receive some later as a nurse and then as a widow's pension. But to have her recognized for the role she did play in the Civil War, something where she was commissioned or asked to go down to do that and to be that, to be a spy and a scout, it was just tremendous. And I just felt so happy for her and for us as a family.",
