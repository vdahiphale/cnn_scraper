The former president has been calling the Florida governor names when he is out speaking publicly, criticizing his past views on everything from Social Security to ethanol. Now polls suggest that DeSantis might have his work cut out for him, especially when it comes to one particular voting bloc among Republican voters.CNN's Harry Enten has been looking into the numbers. You find that there is one group of voters that Trump has a pretty significant advantage over DeSantis with. Which group?",

That is non-white Republicans, where he has a significant lead, 29 points.And I want to compare white voters with voters of color on the GOP side. You see among white voters, right, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis are within the margin of error of each other, right? It's just a one point advantage for Donald Trump. But, again, look at this ballooning lead that Donald Trump has among voters of color. It's 29 points. So, he's doing 28 points better among voters of color than he is among white voters. And, you know, I think there's this idea, you know, the Republican Party is much more white than the Democratic Party. But, in fact, the GOP is becoming more diverse. So this is the share of GOP voters who are people of color. This year, right now, it's 18 percent. Back in 2016, when Trump first ran, it was just 13 percent. So, Trump is doing better among a group of voters that is becoming a larger share of the Republican Party.",

And I think it kind of intersects with another sort of divide that we're seeing in the Republican Party, right, which is, we were talking about this before in the break, you know, voters in the Republican Party are breaking along income lines. So, voters making less than $50,000 a year, they favor Trump by 27 points. Voters making at least $50,000 a year, they, in fact, favor DeSantis by six points. And, again, it's this intersection of everything going on, right? So, 28 percent of white GOP voters make less than 50k, while 45 percent of GOP voters of color make less than 50k. So, essentially what we go -- what's going on here is this populous message that Trump has is working particularly well with voters of color at this point.",
