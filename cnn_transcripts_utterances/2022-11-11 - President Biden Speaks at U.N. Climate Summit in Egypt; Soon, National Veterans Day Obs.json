These consortiums can break off. Countries can rally around certain ideas. So, he says he's got 130 countries now signed up.Methane is the easiest one to control. Just in the Permian basin of Texas, they flare it, enough of it leaks to heat 2 million homes. The technology is there to crack down on that and cap some oil wells. He was most emphatic. He looked right down the barrel of the camera and says the United States will meet its emissions targets by 2030. Now, the pledge is to cut them by 50 to 52 percent over previous levels back in the early 2000s there. Right now, current policy gets us to about 35 percent. The Inflation Reduction Act gets us to 34 percent or so. So, what is baked in right now really doesn't get us there and then the variable is Congress. Kathy Castor from Florida last night in Sharm El-Sheikh said, look, it's going to be a lot harder for us to meet the goals if the GOP takes the House. It looks like that's going to happen. There are Republicans in Sharm El-Sheikh, including John Curtis of Utah, a lot of uranium in his state. He's there on a pro-nuclear mining message for the new energy economy. But a standing applause from the delegates there. They like what they heard, especially compared to his predecessor.",

I mean, we're moving to a world where it makes more sense to have your energy local and not be at the mercy of OPEC or Vladimir Putin starting these shocks around the world. So, yes, that message plays.What's interesting, and you talked about the history, as rich countries going into developing nations, taking their natural resources for energy, and so they get it twice. The promise of $11 billion a year by 2024, if you can get Congress to approve that, appropriate that, that has to go a long way to winning over the developing nations. They'll look at the U.S. and say, if you guys aren't doing more, why should we? A pivotal moment here.",

They're just dealing with the corrosive nature of war.I mean, the first thing I always say, Jim, is our veterans and our military families are one of our greatest national treasures. I mean, we saw that when Afghanistan collapsed in August of '21, with Operation Pineapple Express and Moral Compass and all these other volunteer groups that stepped into the fray. I mean, we need our veterans and our military families leading in these -- we always have. But I will tell you, it's not an endless well of resources. For our veterans, they have endured 20 years of really, really challenging times on top of a moral injury at the end of this war with the abandonment of our allies, and it's a tough thing to overcome.",

It's just very hard to understand the corrosive nature of combat. But understand that, you know, 775,000 Americans served in Afghanistan, out of 340 million Americans, you know. And that's a very, very small percentage.But what we consistently see, Jim, is that the -- I think we're on the front end of a mental health tsunami. Even though our veterans and military families are wonderful resources, we've got to come together as a civil society and help redistribute this emotional load that our veterans are carrying. I just lost a good friend, Brad, who was a green beret, who was involved in Pineapple, who was involved in our plane last out, and the demons finally took him. And it was the collapse in Afghanistan and things in Ukraine that took him there. And it just -- you know, 20 years after this war started, to lose friends like that, man, like, I mean, it's so senseless. And we have to come together as a society to figure out ways to deal with these mental health issues and help our veterans get back in the game and lead us the way they're designed to lead.",

And our military families are the most undervalued precious asset in our nation. And I hope as we go forward today and every day, that we remember our veterans and our military families, and that as a civil society, we have an obligation to reconnect and bring them back into the fold so they can lead us here at home. And I'm honored to be part of the military family and I hope that we remember them as well.",
