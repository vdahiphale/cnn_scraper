The world is watching as the region inches closer to the very real possibility of a widening war. This morning, Hamas accuses Israel of assassinating its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. The airstrike taking place during a visit to Tehran, and now Iran's supreme leader is vowing to avenge the killing, quote, you killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment. We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest. When asked, Israel's military said it is not responding to reports about the attack, which would not be unexpected. The U.S. says it will defend Israel if attacked, but hopes that the sky high tensions in the region can be diffused. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  I don't think war is inevitable. We're going to work hard to make sure that that, you know, we're doing things to help take the temperature down and address issues through diplomatic means. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This blast killed the top Hezbollah military leader that Israel blames for this past weekend's attack that killed 12 children in Israel-controlled Golan Heights.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in northern Israel. CNN's Ivan Watson is in Beirut. Jeremy, I want to start with you. How significant is this strike, both in terms of the target and the fact that it occurred on Iranian soil? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT:  And it is extremely significant for both of those reasons, Pam. We know that the Israeli government has previously carried out assassinations on Iranian soil, but none quite as significant with so many implications for the region at large as this one, as it relates to Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who, according to Iranian state media as well as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hamas itself, was killed while he was in a residence in Tehran. He was killed with an airborne-guided projectile, according to an Iranian state news agency, but we don't have many more details other than that. The Israeli officials, for their part, are neither confirming nor denying their responsibility for this assassination. What is clear, though, is that this is going to have enormous implications for this region. Even before this assassination, this was already a region very much teetering on the brink of a broader regional war, in particular after that strike in Beirut last night that took out a senior Hezbollah commander. In addition to that, we know that those ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations that had been picking up some steam over the course of the last few weeks, those talks are effectively dead in the water for the time being, at least in the short-term. And part of that stems from the fact that that Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor in those talks, even viewed as a more pragmatic voice in those negotiations as far as Hamas was concerned. We're now hearing from the Qatari prime minister, one of the key mediators in those ongoing negotiations. And he says this, political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side? Now, as far as those regional implications, the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, he today visited an air defense battery, saying that Israel is preparing for all possibilities, sending a very clear signal about Israel's preparedness should retaliation come.

Hezbollah the Lebanese militant group denied any link to this. Israel and the U.S. government accuse it of carrying out the deadly strike there.So, this city and this country was on edge waiting to see how Israel would respond. And around sunset yesterday evening, we saw a strike taking place, shearing off the side of a five-storey building that this senior Hezbollah official was in, Fouad Shukur. We don't know his status right now. We do know that at least four people were killed, two women and also two children, a 10-year-old Hassan Fadlullah (ph) and his six-year-old sister, Amirah Fadlullah, and their older brother, Ali, is wounded and being treated in hospital.

He will be sitting down with a panel of journalists from several different news organizations and ask questions. He will also, according to NABJ, be fact-checked in real time.Now, what made this clear that it's as part of his sort of reach to black Americans is a statement that he put out after it was announced that he would be speaking at NABJ. And there's certainly a lot of controversy around the fact that he is here, and yet the woman who could become the first black female American to become president is not here. Here's what Donald Trump said after it was announced that he would be speaking to this group of journalists. He said, President Trump's accomplished more for black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America first policies, on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, etcetera, which, of course, can be disputed in the sense when it comes to the economy, when it comes to black Americans, yes, numbers did of unemployment went down during his administration, but they're even lower with the Biden administration. So, some of these things you'll hear in the fact checks. That's what we're expecting today. But the controversy still swirling, where you are seeing people, members, someone who was the vice chair of the board of this conference stepping down partly due to this decision to have only one of the candidates. But the reason for the one candidate, NABJ says, is pretty clear, that they reached out to both candidates and they reached out to Kamala Harris before Joe Biden stepped down, they say, and that her comms people said, look, her schedule couldn't accommodate this. And she was not able to do it virtually, she was not able to do it in person, but Donald Trump ended up accepting, and so they went with the candidate that said they could be here even though the other presumptive nominee cannot. Here is the justification that we're been hearing from the president of NABJ, and remember, it's the National Association of Black Journalists, he points out the last word in their moniker.

The campaign saying in a statement, quote, Donald Trump is hateful, despicable, and should not be our president. He roots against America. He insults America. Why would we want to put him in charge of America? Donald Trump thinks he can score points with Jewish voters by denigrating them. He is wrong.So, let's discuss with CNN Senior Reporter Isaac Dovere and Senior Political Correspondent at The Wall Street Journal Molly Ball. This is a pattern from Trump, Isaac. I mean, he has repeatedly now denigrated Jews who are Democrats, right? And you are continuing to see this from him, even as his campaign is trying to focus on other issues, like immigration. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes. Like what this stems from in Trump's mind is that he moved the embassy -- the American embassy to Jerusalem. And he feels like that was a big move on behalf of America toward Israel. And so he feels like Jewish people should support him because he did that. And so he's mad about disloyalty. But, really, what that is rooted in is the idea that Jewish people should support whatever is good for Israel, and that there's a dual loyalties thing. That tracks back into a lot of complicated tropes that are through our history in this country and for Jewish people. And, look, what it really comes down to for Harris is, he says she doesn't like Jewish people, she's married to a Jewish person, she's spent a lot of time in her life around Jewish people. I think if she had a real problem with Jewish people, it would be clear by now. What Trump is talking about is in this political context about dual loyalty, and I don't know that it's anyone's place to call anyone else a crappy Jew or a crappy Catholic or a crappy Protestant, but that is what he is doing here.",

There was support in the House among Democrats and Republicans, until the moment when Donald Trump said, let's not do this. He said that in the spring, and he said very clearly then that it would be bad politics for him. He wanted the issue to be one that he could run on in the election.Now, here it is.

On the one hand, you know, the Biden administration tried to fix this problem, but Republicans killed it, or on the other hand, that the Biden administration caused this problem by undoing many of Trump's executive actions on the border. And most people continue to blame the Biden administration for letting the border get to this point and aren't necessarily persuaded by the idea that it's Republicans' fault for not agreeing to this action that they belatedly took to fix it.",
