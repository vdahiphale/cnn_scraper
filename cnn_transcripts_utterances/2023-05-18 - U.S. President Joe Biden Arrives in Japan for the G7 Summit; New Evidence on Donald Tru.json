We're just waiting for him to land at this moment. This is a live picture. G7 leaders are expected to discuss the war in Ukraine and how to counter China's growing influence around the world.But Mr. Biden has canceled visits to Australia and Papua New Guinea so he can head home and focus on the looming debt crisis. The U.S. government is expected to run out of money early next month, if lawmakers don't lift the debt ceiling. The President says he's confident of an agreement with Republican leaders to avoid default. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills. The nation has never defaulted on its debt and never will. We're going to continue these discussions with congressional leaders in the coming days until we reach an agreement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's something that these leaders, I think, will probably want to talk to the President about when he sits down. He won't want to reassure them that the risk of default is small. But of course, that deadline is looming. June 1st is the date, the earliest date that the U.S. could run out of cash to pay its bills.And so, when the President and his aides were deciding whether to embark on this trip, they really had to sort of come up, think about the trade-offs of staying behind in Washington, coming for part of the trip, canceling part of the trip. And what they eventually determined was, while they could postpone some of the diplomacy that will be under way or was supposed to be under way here in Asia, they cannot postpone these discussions about raising the debt limit. So the President's aides are meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill to try and come up with an agreement. Those talks are progressing. They have escalated, increased over the last several days. So, certainly, the hope will be that they can come up with an agreement that the President will then return to Washington early to sort of see-through and eventually sign. But I think there are some leaders here who will be disappointed that he wasn't able to fulfill his engagements in Australia and Papua New Guinea, where the message, implicitly or otherwise, is that he has more important things to do back home. And I think, you know, it doesn't do anything to rebut the notion among leaders, certainly European leaders that the American political system is sort of in a state of dysfunction at the moment. And so President Biden will have all those conversations when he makes it here to Hiroshima and participates in the Summit over the next several days.",

The couple's argument is that publishing those photos would encourage what they call all a highly intrusive and dangerous practice. And it seems so far that at least the British tabloids are taking this to heart, though one American gossip celebrity website has not. Those photos are still up there.Now, there were actually police involved with this whole thing. There was a police car escorting them, at least one that we know. And the reason why, you know, they weren't able to sort of escape the press more easily is because this wasn't a diplomatic escort. This wasn't closing roads, lights and sirens. That's that kind of a thing. This was the police having the police there for their protection. And clearly they didn't view the paparazzi as any kind of a threat. This was not a high speed pursuit. No one is claiming that it was. The reason that it went on so, so long, more than two hours, according to the Sussex's is because they didn't want to take the paparazzi back to the location that they were actually staying. They wanted to lose them so that the press where they were staying. And so after an hour and a half of trying and failing, they went to a police station to regroup. They ended up leaving in a taxi cab, as you heard from the driver there. That didn't work. They went back to the police station. Eventually they ended up making their escape when a shift change at the station ended up causing a traffic jam of police cars, which allowed the Sussexes to get away. All of this, of course, is against the backdrop of the fact that Prince Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was killed in 1997 while being pursued by the paparazzi. The driver in that case was drunk but Prince Harry very much has put the blame on the photographers who are pursuing her. This is what he said about it in 2019. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

First, in September, on September 15, 2022, he was observed taking notes on classified intelligence information, according to this record, and even putting that note into his pocket. For that, he was reprimanded. Yet one month later, on October 25, 2022, after the cease and desist order that came from the previous instance, He was seen doing a deep dive on intelligence information, which he didn't need to be doing. Another reprimand there. But at that point, according to these records, he was even offered the chance to change jobs and train into a different position, which would have still given him access to sensitive and classified information. And yet, once again, on January 30th of this year, one of his superiors observed him on a classified information system known as JWICS, viewing content that wasn't related to his primary duty. That superior told other superiors, and yet, at least according to these records, there was no action taken against him, and at least at the time, he retained his access to classified information. Prosecutors say he used that access repeatedly to do deep dives on classified and sensitive information, and then used that access to spread it online to a group of friends and others on a Discord server. It is for those reasons that prosecutors in this case say Teixeira needs to remain in custody, in detention, as this process plays out. His attorneys have argued that he is not the threat that the prosecutors portray him as and that she should let him be out. That detention hearing coming up later on this week on Friday. It is worth noting that last month we learned that not only were two of his superiors, including the commanding officer of his unit, suspended because of this ongoing investigation into how he had so much access to classified information that kept on leaking, but also the unit itself, their mission was suspended pending this investigation, the mission given to other units to perform that handling sensitive information. We have reached out to both the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau for a statement or an explanation as to how Teixeira was reprimanded and admonished for accessing this classified information inappropriately. And yet the problem persisted Oren Liebermann, CNN, in the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So based on this harsh questioning, it is very likely that these three judges will side with the anti-abortion doctors bringing this case and perhaps block access to the abortion pill Mifepristone.But even if they do that, the Supreme Court has already said that any restrictions or blocking the drug will not take effect until the Supreme Court has had time to consider the case, so a ruling on this issue could take several weeks from the Fifth Circuit and even then, whatever that court decides won't immediately go into effect. The Fifth Circuit is considered the most conservative federal appeals court in the country. It's repeatedly ruled against the Biden administration and now it has this case that could impact the availability of the abortion drug Mifepristone, which of course is used for the majority of abortions in this country.

Now we're talking about these deadly floods and they're really going under, faced with extreme conditions trying to rescue the people. We took a closer look at some of these amazing rescues.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice-over): Roads turned to rivers, as rain many hoped would alleviate drought conditions, now a serious threat in the central Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. There are already victims, and rescuers are searching for the missing. Hundreds of people were rescued from flooded homes, many brought to safety in rubber dinghies on flooded streets. More than 5,000 people are under evacuation, according to the Civil Protection. Among them, a four-month-old baby and an elderly handicapped man. The region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the River Po, a crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they're only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by five feet. This deluge of water will raise it even more, but it is still well below average. Extreme weather events are threatening other Italian regions, from Venice, where the Moseve floodgates have been raised to protect the city from high water, to Sicily, where heavy storms downed trees and flooded homes.
