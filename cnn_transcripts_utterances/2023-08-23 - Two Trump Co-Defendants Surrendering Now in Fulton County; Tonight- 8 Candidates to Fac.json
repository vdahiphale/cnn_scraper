More of Donald Trump's co-defendants in Georgia's election subversion case surrendering overnight. We're told former GOP chair David Shafer and Kathie Latham who allegedly served as fake elector were both being processed right now. They were both just released actually I'm learning moments ago. Today, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani will be in Fulton County, Georgia, to negotiate a bond agreement with the district attorney's office. Giuliani faces 13 charges in the Fulton County criminal case over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including a racketeering charge. Now, on Tuesday, conservative attorney John Eastman and Atlanta bail bondsman Scott Hall turned themselves in, both men were booked and released. And tomorrow the big day, former President Trump is expected to surrender. CNN's Paula Reid has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Rudy Giuliani is expected to meet with the Fulton County district attorney on Wednesday. Giuliani is expected to travel to Georgia, along with his longtime friend, former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Now, Kerik is not an attorney but he is an unindicted co-conspirator in this Fulton County case. Kerik has been helping Giuliani in his search for an attorney, something that has proven challenging given that Giuliani currently has seven figures worth of unpaid legal bills. But it does appear that they have someone with a Georgia law license who will at least help them through the bond phase of this process. It's unclear though if he has retained someone who has agreed to represent him in this case. It is an open question about whether Giuliani can even afford a lawyer to represent him in this case. Now, I'm also told by one source that Giuliani would like to get through the bond negotiations and his surrender before former President Trump shows up on Thursday. As CNN has previously reported, Rudy has gone to former President Trump pleading with him to give him help with his legal bills. As of now, Giuliani has only received a small portion of what he owes and that was from a Trump affiliated political action committee, not from Trump himself. Paula Reid, CNN, Fulton County, Georgia.

Not from his perspective, but in other words it was Trump's election that was stolen. So that defense doesn't shock me. Whether it holds water is a different thing. I think the bigger issue is that specifically for Donald Trump, all these lesser players if you will are having their own strategies and some of that may ultimately be he's not helping me, I don't want that to happen, I'm going to flip. And I'd not be shocked if somewhere down the line especially when you hear someone like Shafer say, it was Trump's team that told me do this, that someone will turn on the president.",

But I think that this is a critically important meeting because China in particular is looking to expand this grouping of countries to increase their economic and political cloud on the world stage. And though they haven't said it directly, it certainly is the feeling from China and Russia particularly that they want to counteract the G7 group of wealthy nations and also try to limit the influence of the World Bank and IMF. Those are critically important groups that lend money to countries all over the world. We've seen some divisions already forming, India, South Africa, in particular, are more likely to try to sit on the fence, to please both China and the U.S. when it comes to international relations and trade. But I think the fact that these groups hold 40 percent of the world population as you mentioned, but almost a quarter of the world's GDP and that will grow, if they get it right, this could be a force to be reckoned with on the world stage both in terms of business and in terms of politics -- Danny.",
