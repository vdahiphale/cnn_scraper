Here is part of that interview.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: There's one more thing from that press conference I want to get to, which is the sheriff using quite strong language when it comes to gun violence. He was talking about saying that the status quo is not working, so we need to reexamine what we're doing and what may work better. Saying that California already has pretty strict gun laws. What are your feelings about what can work better given that clearly this happened in a place where we're already pretty strict? REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): There is a clear path forward. I have been a member of the Congressional gun safety caucus since Sandy Hook. So, we're talking about a long time. And there is common sense gun safety legislation that should have been passed by Congress a long time ago. See, the universal background checks are the best way to make sure that guns don't get into the hands of dangerous and violent people. But there are loopholes. And people can buy guns without those checks, without the background checks, by buying online or at gun shows or through personal purchases. Those loopholes have to be closed. And I want to tell you, that the majority of Americans support these common sense laws, which would make us all much safer.",

Russia has long held that this is an existential threat to Russia's own state security. So, the concern is this could be another step now shifting NATO's involvement, Europe's involvement away from supporting Ukraine's defensive efforts and now more towards the offensive against Russia.",
