      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with major breaking news in our law and justice lead, and an absolutely staggering financial penalty for Donald Trump. This afternoon, New York state Judge Arthur Engoron ordered the former president and his companies to pay nearly $355 million for committing fraud. The judge found Trump submitted, quote, blatantly false financial data when he applied for loans, allowing him to get more favorable rates. There is one small victory in this ruling for Mr. Trump. The judge is not ordering the dissolution of the Trump Organizations as prosecutors had asked for. Instead, Trump will face restrictions over the next three years when it comes to how he can conduct business. Let's get straight to CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, this is a lengthy ruling by Judge Engoron and what else is he saying about Donald Trump and his companies?",

      "sentences": "Well, here, he is hitting Trump with his biggest punishment to date. You mentioned that over $350 million penalty, but let's look at some of the other things in this opinion.First, the judge bars first Trump from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years. He also bars him from applying for loans from banks registered in New York for three years. But he does not dissolve the Trump business, Trumps business certificates for the Trump organization. He's backtracking there. This is something that he's signaled he was going to do, but this is the so-called corporate death penalty, something the attorney general had sought. Now some people might ask, well, why didn't he go that far? This is something that is rarely implemented in the state of New York. And the few times it has been, there has been a clear victim, someone who was clearly ripped off or deprived of their money. And that was one of the lines of defense here from the Trump legal team, is that there was no victim. The banks, insurance companies all got their money. But the judge is imposing what he describes as significant monitoring over the Trump Organization. He is ordering the continuation of an independent monitor. This is someone who is actually installed back in 2022 to make sure that the company was in compliance with the law and regulations. That person will continue to be in place for another three years. And then the judge says that the company has to pay its -- out of its own pocket for an independent director of compliance. So the judge there installing multiple layers to ensure that the company continues to comply with the law and regulations. Remember, Jake, this case is so personal to Trump not only because it strikes at the heart of his identity as a successful New York businessman, but also because it involves his family. And penalties for his two adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, both of them were found here are liable for a host of civil fraud, both ordered to pay $4 million for their personal profits from the fraud. And then they are both barred from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for two years. And, Jake, Trump, his family, his lawyers, they took a very combative approach to this case, regularly attacking the judge, the court staff, the attorney general, something that may be working for Trump in the court of public opinion, but clearly didn't work in the court -- actual courtroom. And they are expected to appeal this ruling.",

      "sentences": "I mean, the judge here is saying that he is not giving any credibility to the testimony of the Trumps in this trial. You know, he's noting in his opinion that Donald Trump put himself out there as an expert in real estate. But finding here that, you know, that their posture this whole time they've never admitted any he mistakes or any -- any wrongdoing.And so the judge really seems to be seizing on that in this opinion. You know, he notes by saying, you know, their complete lack of contrition and remorse border on pathological, really underscoring here that even when confronted with things that perhaps were obvious to this judge has being inflated, that they would stick hold their line in that they wouldn't acknowledge that the judge pointing out that. Also in this opinion, he's pointing -- he's seeing the need for him to take these steps is not even just limited to what occurred over that three the month trial and the testimony of all those witnesses. He's also saying that he's taken to account their past run-ins with authorities, including settlements involving Trump University, the Trump Foundation, which was wound down, also the corporate tax fraud trial where the Trump Organization entities were convicted of tax fraud. That was a case brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office. So he's showing that they have not taken any steps throughout all of their over the past several years, all of the run-ins, you're not doing anything to try to rehabilitate themselves. They don't even currently have a chief financial officer since their former chief financial officer pleaded guilty to tax fraud. So he's just pointing out throughout this how they have not tried it to rehabilitate themselves in any way knowing this investigation has been going on. And so that seems to me why were seeing some of these bans, why were seeing the monitor ship continue, and why the judge really wants some independent eyes inside this company as a way to allow them to do business because now as Paula noted, he is walking back, this dissolution of the business certificates. So that is one benefit to the Trump organization, but certainly this is a significant penalty and significant amount of money that Trump its going to have to pay while he is facing other penalties. You know, all this judgment is coming back to him. He'd been someone who had people had wondered if he could ever be held accountable. And now were seeing both the E. Jean Carroll case of this decision today and now he is going to go to trial next month in the first criminal trial of a former president. So, you know, lot of shifts and Trump on the legal front, although, of course, he is still very much campaigning for president -- Jake.",

He goes property by property valuation by valuation, loan by loan, and gives us basically a line itemization of how we reached that number. Now, the bigger surprise I think is that the judge had signaled that he was going to impose the corporate death penalty. He was going to revoke the business certificates. He did not do that. Instead, what he did was install a monitor and put temporary several years suspensions on Donald Trump and his family members. So this could have been the death knell for the Trump Organization.

Well, what's the big deal?Well, the big deal was according to this ruling, that they lie, that they were not truthful, they did not credit their testimony. And in fact, they went beyond that. He talked about all the different times in which the Trump organization as an umbrella concept was not truthful. One of the reasons you impose a very strict penalty broadly, is for deterrence, and to get country tenuous injunctive relief to prevent someone from engaging in behavior. They will engage in again, they went through this. But I found really a really fascinating point here. Michael Cohen -- Michael Cohen was a witness in this case.",

He talked about how he credited the testimony of Michael Cohen and talked about the animosity between the witness and the defendant Trump being palpable, but the court found his testimony credible, he says, based on the relaxed manner in which he testified, the general plausibility of his statements and most importantly, the way his testimony was corroborated by other trial evidence. He said that this fact-finder does not believe that pleading guilty to perjury means that you can never tell the truth. Michael Cohen told the truth. What a significant moment to have that testimony credited above others and in conjunction with that also signals to you on appeal. It's very hard to undermine a credibility assessment by the fact-finder, in this case, the judge. TAPPER:  And, Elie, now there's this monitor that will oversee the dissolution of Trumps businesses.

But the flip side is and Judge Jones has been working on this for some time now, she issued a report a couple of weeks ago saying that in her initial review, she found several inconsistencies and sort of inexplicable numbers.

And here, the people who were lied to, the entities who were lied to were billion-dollar banks. They made loans, they were repaid with interest. And I do think that's one reason -- it's important to remember this in the bigger for scheme, several different prosecutors offices looked at this and declined to bring a criminal charge. And I'm speculating here, but from my experience as a prosecutor, I think that's an important consideration. Technically, this is enough that you could have brought a fraud charge under the criminal law, but its really hard to stand in front of a jury and say, oh, the victims here are multi-billion dollar banks that made money.

And I think this will make sure that he doesn't reduce the business even more by pulling assets out to a point where he couldn't pay the judgment after an appeal. But the big thing I think is the number itself, when you combine this with the judgment and the E. Jean Carroll case, you're up to $440 million and he -- there's no evidence he has that much cash. When we looked at his tax returns, 20 years of his tax returns, we saw his cash on hand had been shrinking since \"The Apprentice' heyday in 2011, down to about -- greatly shrinking to through 2018, the attorney general found the same thing. That year, he had maybe $44 million on hand. That's a lot out of money, but you need money to run the business and that's -- if he has to pay any of these judgments. I think what's going to happen is they're going to have to start looking at selling some things or trying to get loans, which is going to be a great challenge for him as well.

He's got again, this passive investment in two office buildings that he can't really touch, that is really subsidized a lot of what he's done.

He said for as long as it takes, saying that no one will be left behind. Also talking about that grant that he said is going to be going out there. He said that that grant well cover both a short-term and a long-term sort of study. And the impact of what has happened here in East Palestine.So those are certainly some of the words that residence wanted to hear, but we also have to say that there are a number of people here, Jake, who feel as though the president showed up too little too late. As his motorcade drove by, our location here, a number of people lined the road here and shouted their displeasure at the presidents motorcade. Some of them shouting obscenities. But again, the president saying that his administration is going to stick this out and that they will be looking at East Palestine, not just in the short term, but in the long term as well -- Jake.",

That's according to the Russian prison service. Russia, of course, the Kremlin itself, Putin, they all deny any involvement, but they're of course the ones who sent him to that penal colony. After recovering from the 2020 poisonings suspected to have been ordered by Putin, Navalny returned to Russia. He has been in poor health. He spent the last few weeks in these Siberian prison camp in north of the Arctic Circle. He slept on a newspaper. He had only ten minutes to eat his meals. Let's get right to CNN's Clarissa Ward in London and Nick Paton Walsh in Munich, where the Munich Security Conference is going on. And, Clarissa, you were part of the CNN investigation. You interviewed Navalny. It took months of painstaking reporting to present proof that Russia's government was involved. Given -- given that, do you think we will ever know exactly how Navalny died at all?",

But there's one thing I think maybe the Kremlin did not expect if you most generous assessment of this that they felt and their duty of care to keep Navalny alive. Well, the effect today has been taken security conference that was likely to be caught in a cloud of doubt about the U.S.'s persistent -- likely assistance of NATO in the face of the threat -- from Russia off the president -- former President Donald Trump's recent comments.Instead, the audience galvanized into essentially seeing quite how clear and present an immediate, the threat of Russia was. The fact of limited funding slowed down for Ukraine from the United States. Now, more furthermore, in the agenda and a real sense of urgency thank where previously many were concerned This conference maybe mired in confusion about quite where this lines stood, Jake. TAPPER:  And, Clarissa, people have already been detained attending vigils for Navalny across Russia, according to a group that monitors Russian repression. How are Russians reacting to his death?",

The Moscow prosecutors office came out and said, do not take to the streets. We have heard from that monitoring group in Russia that at least 73 people have already been detained.And yet we still have seen images extraordinary, courageous Russian citizens lining up silently carrying red roses, many of them with tears in their eyes and quietly laying them down at a memorial for Alexey Navalny. That seems to be the only level of sadness or grief that Russians are able to express publicly at the moment. When you talk to Russians, particularly those who are outside of the country they are many of them, millions of them in a deep state of grief, in a deep state of disbelief. What does this mean for the future of Russia's opposition movement, which quite frankly now appears to be in tatters. But there were also some positive words from Mikhail Zygar for example, who is a Russian journalist, also an exile and he wrote something that I thought was quite moving. He said, Navalny, now will truly become the founding father of the new Russia. And that the memory of Navalny and the example that he set can be rallying cry and an inspiration to people going forward and reminding people that one of the key attributes of Alexey Navalny was an indefatigable optimism which he asked that all Russians across the world and inside the country who are feeling such grievous loss in this moment tried to adhere to -- Jake.",
