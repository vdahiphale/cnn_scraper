We are live from Tel Aviv with more. Plus, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is announcing his key players today. What we know on who will be part of his cabinet. We have the very latest for you. And it's not -- it's just not just the U.S. getting ready for a Trump presidency, we will speak with Estonian Foreign Minister and what European countries are preparing for and what this means for the war, of course, in Ukraine. But first tonight, just days after Donald Trump's election win, a key Minister in the Israeli government says he is ordering preparations for the annexation of settlements in the West Bank. Bezalel Smotrich says 2025 will be, quote, \"the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria\", using the biblical term, of course, for the occupied Palestinian territories. Smotrich is Finance Minister, Bezalel is also responsible for civilian affairs in the West Bank, overseeing settlements there. It is unclear whether the government will go along with his plan. But Smotrich says Trump's election victory gives Israel an important opportunity. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEZALEL SMOTRICH, FINANCE MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  I intend, with God's help, to lead a government  decision that says that the government of Israel will work with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply the Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, and for American and international recognition, and to the end of the Israeli-Arab conflict in the Middle East.

And Jeremy, what we heard there from Bezalel Smotrich is basically instructions in many ways of the annexation of the West Bank, which shouldn't surprise us. As you and I have spoken before, he is one of the most far-right ministers in Netanyahu's cabinet.

He is one of the most right- wing members of this current government, which is the most right-wing government in history. And he sees an opportunity in the wake of Donald Trump's election, what he's calling an important opportunity to annex these Israeli settlements in the West Bank. And so, he's directing these government entities that he oversees to begin making preparations for that possibility. And he also says that he believes -- he said he has, quote, \"no doubt, actually, that he believes that President Trump, once he comes into office, will support Israel in this initiative. And he certainly has reason for that belief. And that is because in 2020, when Donald Trump put out his peace plan at the time, it did indeed call for Israeli settlements to be annexed into Israeli territory, in addition to creating a future Palestinian state that did not include some 30 percent of the occupied West Bank. Now, that doesn't mean that Donald Trump is actually going to go ahead and support annexation, certainly not right at the beginning of his term. Now, in terms of the Israeli Prime Minister himself, you know, he had the opportunity following that 2020 plan to actually move forward with annexation. He chose not to at the time.

And that drove a bit of a rift between the two men. But Netanyahu is saying that this was a very good and a very important set of conversations, and he also indicated that Trump and himself see quote, \"eye-to-eye on the Iranian threat.\" And that is, of course, quite notable because, you know, we've been trying to get a sense of how much latitude will a Trump administration give to a Netanyahu admiration? Who just this evening we heard from that newly-installed Foreign Minister talking about the threat of Iran, talking about opportunities as the Defense Minister did as well tonight to potentially go after the Iranian nuclear threat after having disabled many of Iran's air defenses in Israel's last retaliatory strike against Iran. So, it certainly is going to be very high on the agenda as Trump comes into office. And while Trump has indicated that he doesn't want to start any new wars, he has of course, signaled a much tougher posture as it relates to Iran than the Biden administration.

Well, Donald Trump has longindicated that he would reward loyalty if he returned to the Oval Office, and it certainly appears that way as he chooses his new staff. CNN has learned that staunch Trump ally Stephen Miller there, is expected to be named as White House deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. Miller played a major role in drawing up Trump's plans for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The President-elect is nominating Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, another of his strongest supporters, of course, to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier, Trump chose Tom Homan as his so-called border czar. Homan served as the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump administration. Let's get more then on these transition developments. I want to go in to Steve Contorno, CNN's Steve Contorno. And Steve, let's start then with the transition and not just the border czar announcement, but also in Stephen Miller. Talk to us about their roles and why they were picked?",

There are not two people in his orbit who have been closer to him on this issue than Stephen Miller and Tom Homan. And Miller was one of the architects of his policies throughout the first term. On immigration, and Tom Homan was the enforcer of those policies as his ICE director, and he will continue in that role now as a border czar, which will give him some additional leeway that won't tie him to one, not having to have a Senate confirmation. But he also will be in charge with overseeing what Donald Trump says will be an effort that will span not just the Department of Homeland Security, but also the Pentagon and local and state law enforcement as well. So, Homan will be in charge of all of that, and Miller will be helping Donald Trump execute that as his White House deputy Chief of Staff.",

Early signs you want to say suggest that when he moves back into the White House in January, bolstered by a thumping win, a Democratic mandate, he will act with maximum force.\" And I wonder then, what changes you think, given what you just set out we're likely to see from him.

His announcement of Tom Homan as the border security czar came on his Truth Social network at 11:30 on a Sunday night. So, Trump is going to still try to surprise people. When Presidents come in, they have a certain amount of time to maximize their power, the first 100 days or at least the first year or so in Congress before the specter of a midterm election starts to come into view. It's clear that Trump believes that the experience from his first term has taught him that he needs to act quickly and with focus, and I think that's what these new people around him and the ones still to be named, that will be their mission when they come to Washington. The first time around, it took Trump ages to settle on some of his key cabinet picks. There was this bizarre audition process, it's much more organized this time around --",

Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT, BRAZIL (through translator):  Well, I believe that President Trump, he has to think as an inhabitant of the planet earth, and if he thinks as the ruler of the most important, richest country in the world, most important has the high more technology, and that is better prepared from the arms viewpoint. He has to have the notion that the U.S. is in the same planet that I am, and that in an island of 300,000 inhabitants is. And so, all of us, we have to take responsibility for the maintenance of this planet of the earth. We need to guarantee that the planet should not be -- suffer a warming of more above than 1.6 degrees. We need to guarantee that the rivers should continue healthy with clean waters. And so, we need to guarantee that the biomes of all the countries should be preserved. And so, this is a commitment that I have not only as the President of Brazil, as a human being that lives in the planet called earth, and that there's no other place to live, only earth.

A U.S. official saysRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops, including some from North Korea, to push Ukraine out of Kursk. Now, Ukraine has held ground, if you have a look at that on your map there, since it launched a surprise counteroffensive that happened over the summer, although that incursion has since stalled. As the war enters its third winter, efforts are escalating on both sides, Russia and Ukraine exchange a record number of drone strikes that happened just over the weekend. And it comes of course at a time when Donald Trump's re-election brings uncertainty for the future of U.S. funding for Kyiv. Off the back of his election victory, The Washington Post cites unnamed sources saying Trump spoke with Russian President Putin about Ukraine on Thursday. The Kremlin, I should say, strongly denies this claim, while a spokesman for Trump declined to comment on the report. Our Fred Pleitgen has more for you from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I want to read some of the words that he used in this phone call that he had with journalists earlier today. He said, this is completely untrue, it is pure fiction, it is simply false information. So, basically, he couldn't go any further than that. He was then, once again, asked directly. So, there was no conversation. And then he said, yes, there was no conversation. Of course, all this comes as the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin saying they are looking quite favorably at Donald Trump taking office in the near future. Obviously, in January. The Russian president on Thursday at a forum in Sochi, in the south of Russia, saying that he obviously took note of some of the things that then- candidate Trump said about the war in Ukraine, wanting to end the war in Ukraine, of course, also, in general, trying to improve relations with Russia, and Vladimir Putin saying that that alone made it worth listening to. So, the Russians are saying that they want a conversation to take place, they believe a conversation between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump could take place before Donald Trump takes office, at the moment, though, however, they are also saying something like that right now, not in the works.

Foreign Minister, great to have you back on the show. Let me pick up really with these concerning developments, I think it's fair to say, out of Ukraine. U.S. official telling us that Russia is readying tens of thousands of troops, including some from North Korean troops, of course we know on the ground, to launch an assault on Ukrainian forces in the coming days.

We also heard President Zelenskyy today say that his troops were holding back a group of nearly 50,000 in the region. So, my question is then, Foreign Minister, you know, what would you like to see in the months ahead from the Biden administration who has got several months to try and push through aid, weaponry, there's long-range missiles, of course, that, you know, Ukraine and so many foreign ministers have been calling for on the show, do you think now that the election is over, Foreign Minister, that Biden -- President Biden may be more amenable to do that -- to go ahead with that?",

We got more military support and -- but without these U.S. elections, we are doing anything what we can to prepare for the probable invasion from Russia. So, we are putting close to 4 percent of GDP to fulfill the nature of regional defense plans adopted already in Vilnius last year at the summit - - the NATO summit. So, what I'm thinking about, with Donald Trump, what opportunity he has, actually, he has an opportunity to become our -- how to say, the Churchill in our time. And I published as well an article that we are in the year on 1938 when we can actually make the right decisions, we can understand, and we have this opportunity that Russia will remain a threat in the future. We must finish this aggression against Ukraine in just the proper ways, but also, we're talking more globally. We have many different conflicts in Middle East. We have a relationship with China and tensions there. And also, the one part of the Africa. So, I think that U.S. leader who's entering the office must understand as well the responsibility he has.",

This is all part of this continuing growth of what some researchers call the manosphere, these misogynistic online communities where the discussions range from anti-feminism to more explicit calls for violence against women. And there have already been some women who have said they've been targeted by this language. Women posting videos on TikTok saying that this phrase, your body, my choice was posted in their comments and their DMs. But I think the real concern for online expert -- online misinformation and extremism experts here is that this kind of language, the normalization of this, will end up spilling out into the real world in terms of harassment and violence offline, Isa.",
