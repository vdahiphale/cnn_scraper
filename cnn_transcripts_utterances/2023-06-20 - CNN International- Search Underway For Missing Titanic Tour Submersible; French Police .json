And that was the word from the U.S. Coast Guard, right? You have to think this thing is a little bit bigger than a transport van, floating, perhaps, we hope, to the surface in a very remote area. The U.S. Coast Guard admits that. Now, as you say, this is no easy search. I want to draw your attention, though, to two key pieces of equipment. One is the P-8 Poseidon, that is a Canadian aircraft that has been in the air now already, and it is designed to look for submarines. That is a good thing.But crucial, in the next hours, the new U.S. Coast Guard says that they will bring on board a submersible of its own, something that can actually do some deep diving to begin to look for that submersible in the area where they first lost contact, I have to say, Max, just an hour and 45 minutes into this expedition. I want you to listen now, though, to the U.S. Coast Guard talk about what comes next. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD: We have to make sure that we're looking on both the surface using aerial and surface vessels, but then expanding into underwater search as well. Right now, our capability is limited to sonar buoys and listening for sounds, but, you know, we're working very hard to increase the capability. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And a reminder that that is 13,000 feet, nearly 2.5 miles to the depth.They would have been by terms of the schedule of the expedition, close to the Titanic wreck when they lost communication with that submersible. Again, so many resources going to the scene right now, and this is difficult, right? It's not like you can keep aircraft out in the North Atlantic hour upon hour. Both the U.S. Coast Guard, the Canadian military, the Canadian Coast Guard needs to do these, you know, flights back and forth, going back to base and then sending other aircraft out. They are also trying to put the call out to commercial vessels that might be in the area. Anyone that can help on this point, on what the U.S. Coast Guard, you know, obviously says is a remote and challenging area to search.",

I mean, this company on its own privately decided to do these excursions because they admitted themselves that no government or public body would take this on. Having said that, they were assured that from a technical standpoint, it was all possible. They have done these expeditions before. Quite a few have been successful. But I will also say that we do have reports in the past that that submersible did lose communication with the support trip -- ship, which is right now the Polar Prince, which is a former Canadian icebreaker that's in the water there.A piece of good news, though, Max, is that according to our friends in the CNN Weather Center, there are no weather issues right now.

Blinken is meeting with the U.K. and Ukrainian foreign ministers and will also attend a conference focused on helping Ukraine recover from the impact of the conflict.

A year ago, the Ukrainian said a recovery effort to rebuild the country, in essence get the businesses back up and running, repair all the damaged infrastructure would be $100 billion, a year ago, $100.So we can imagine it's gone up considerably since then. But the aim of this conference will be to draw in business partners who can partner with governments, partner with the Ukrainian government. Find out what it will take for them to have an investment opportunity in the future in Ukraine to bring together some civil society as well. So this is about governments managing the longer term cost. This is about spreading the cost of it. But as we know, hundreds of millions, hundreds of millions, billions have been spent on shoring up Ukraine's military for a war that really, as we're seeing this summer, is becoming very clearly, very, very expensive. So that's what this conference will all be about.",

Pakistan, which says nearly 300 victims were its citizens, has begun to clamp down on human trafficking networks in the wake of the tragedy.

The company has announced that Joseph Tsai will become its new chairman starting in September, and Eddie Wu will take over as chief executive officer. They are taking over for Daniel Zhang, who was named executive chairman after Alibaba's co-founder Jack Ma stepped away in 2019. Alibaba is China's largest ecommerce company. It's also a leader in cloud computing and digital payments. Just a short while ago, online influencer Andrew Tate was indicted in Romania, on charges of human trafficking and rape. Tate was charged alongside his brother and two other women. The four of them were arrested last year, accused of recruiting Romanian women and coercing them into appearing in pornographic videos. Tate is a former kickboxer who gained notoriety for making misogynistic and violent comments about women online.

And keep in mind that Titanic is about 900 feet long. This submersible is about 21 feet to 22 feet long. So it shows you how difficult it would be to find something of that size in the very large ocean.Fortunately, our techniques for finding these kinds of things have increased and have expanded and have improved since 1912 and even since 1985, when Titanic itself was discovered. Nevertheless, it's still a very small object in a very large ocean which is known for swells and storms. So the Coast Guard and the Navy certainly have their work cut out for them.",

Keeping in mind that the bottom of the ocean where they are is about 12,500 feet, so it's quite a large distance. And there is a navy vessel that could possibly help. It's called the CURV-21. I think that's capable of descending about 30,000 feet. So that's certainly a possibility.Hopefully, though, if the ship is still intact, it is somewhere on the surface. I really never had a problem with the tourism aspect of this. A lot of people are hesitant to go down even if they could afford it. But it wasn't because of the safety issue. It was because of other issues, such as claustrophobia. And it's probably not the best way to find out that you're claustrophobic because you can't do anything about it until about 10 hours later when the vessel surfaces. So I really didn't have a problem in that regard. And we really haven't had a problem like this since they started taking people down about 20 years ago.",
