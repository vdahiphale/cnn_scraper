      "sentences": "Good evening, I'm Abby Philip in New York.Let's get right to what America is talking about. The countdown is on, with less than a month until Donald Trump takes office, and the then president-elect has laid out a number of things that he wants to do on day one, carrying out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, enacting 25 percent tariffs on U.S. trading partners, like Mexico and Canada, and banning all things diversity, equity, and inclusion within the federal government. But could this all just amount to more typical Trump hyperbole? Congressman Lawler, Trump tweeted about a month ago on January 20th, one of my many first executive orders, I will sign the necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada with a 25 percent tariff on all products coming into the United States. Is that a negotiation or are you expecting to see that? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY):  Look, I think it's a negotiation, but as he showed during his first term, he is willing to use tariffs to crack down on what he deems as unfair trade practices. And I think when you look at the United States, you look at, for instance, prescription drugs. Europe puts price controls in place on American drugs coming into Europe. It's part of the reason why we pay more here in the U.S. So, there's a lot that I think can be done from the standpoint of using tariffs as a negotiating tool to crack down on unfair practices. But I think that is but one part of what he is going to do. Obviously, he campaigned heavily on the economy, on the issue of affordability, on obviously extending many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and securing the border. And I think that's going to be job number one when he gets in.",

So, you had the American toy manufacturers today announcing that their perception is that even a 10 percent increase on tariffs with China will be almost an 80 percent increase in prices here in the United States, and here was their logic, that toys are designed in the United States, but they're manufactured in China. The majority of them that people are buying here are manufactured in China. So, that is almost an immediate price hit that Americans are going to face, while, yes, people want American strength, they want to see a president who is standing up to the foreign powers of the world, they also wanted to see prices go down. And some of these policies are going to hit home.SOLOMON JONES, AWARD-WINNING COLUMNIST, THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: When you talk about cracking down on other governments, I mean, really what tariffs do is crack down on the American people. We end up paying the price at the end. And our companies also pay the price because now you start a trade war where they put tariffs on our stuff and our companies have even a bigger problem doing business internationally.

Then you have the situation where you have criminal aliens committing violent crimes, just as we saw a woman being burned alive on a subway by a man who was previously deported and then came back into the United States illegally.The fact is that what Tom Homan is going to do is start the process of deporting criminal aliens out of the United States.

This idea that you're going to violate federal immigration law, that you're going to use taxpayer money to provide all of these free things, by the way, while Kathy Hochul in New York is charging New Yorkers $2,500 just for the privilege of driving to work in Midtown Manhattan.

And the fact here is that when Donald Trump was president, the economy was better, it was stronger. American corporations did bring back operations from overseas to the United States.I think, obviously, there's no question over the last few years we've seen corporate America get way too involved in politics. Everything became political. I hope they pull back from that and focus on what it is that their companies do best and focus on that. But the fact is that we need an American economy that is growing, that is vibrant, that is employing Americans. And the best way to get there is to have corporate America working with the president, working with Congress, to enact policies that actually are pro-growth, pro- American, pro-business, and pro-worker.",
