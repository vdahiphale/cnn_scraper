But there is a realization, they are five months into this fiscal year. It is time to try to put this behind them because the fact is the math is not going to change for Speaker Mike Johnson. He either makes the hard calls now or he makes them later, but delaying them may only create more frustration and angst for him on his right flank. And I think that's why you're seeing him make this choice now. A lot can change, though.

I'm told this is not something that would necessarily happen imminently, but it could happen in the late spring or early summer. A senior Biden ministration official telling me that they are operating under the assumption that this is something that Israel is going to do.A second administration official says that there is a growing number of officials in the Israeli government and military who wants to do this. Who see this as something that Israel needs to do. The Biden administration, or these officials that I've spoken with, warning that this could lead to what they call a major, major escalation that we don't even know the proportions of. So, warnings of a distinct possibility of an expansion of this conflict. Now, of course, since October 7th, Kate, so much of the focus has been on Gaza, on the war there between Israel and Hamas following those horrible attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7th. But at the same time, there has been this slightly lower level, but -- but significant conflict brewing between Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and with Israel. We've seen tens of thousands of Israelis and Lebanese displaced, increasing airstrikes by Israel into Lebanon leading to these fears of a growing -- of a growing conflict. The U.S. has dispatched a senior official named Amos Hochstein to try to come up with a diplomatic solution. And what that would look like is the creation of a buffer zone in southern Lebanon that would essentially push Hezbollah out and make it less possible for them to fire from those southern Lebanese positions into Israel. Now, if those diplomatic talks are not successful, and Israel is saying that they hope they are, Israeli officials have made clear that a military -- a military operation into southern Lebanon is very possible.

And so that's what they're holding out for.By the way, that's why Bibi Netanyahu wants to go in. He believes there are four to six battalions, militants remaining there. He believes Sinwar is there.
