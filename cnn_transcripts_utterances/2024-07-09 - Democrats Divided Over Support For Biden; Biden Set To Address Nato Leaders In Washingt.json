Tonight, we are expecting to hear from top HouseDemocrats at any moment after their meeting on whether they should keep supporting Joe Biden as the party's 2024 nominee. We'll of course, bring you that live. Meantime, the U.S. President is preparing to address NATO's allies at the opening of a summit where support for Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda. He needs to reassure them he can still lead. We are live in Washington D.C. and in Kyiv. Plus, we are just what? Lesson hour away from the first UEFA Euro semi- final where Spain will take on Le Blue. We'll show you the atmosphere in Munich a bit later. But first tonight, we begin with divisions, doubts and sadness in the Democratic Party over the future of President Joe Biden in the 2024 race. Any moment now, we are expected to hear from top Democrats following their closed-door meeting to discuss whether Mr. Biden should remain at the top of that ticket. The President has received both support and calls to step aside from members of his own party after his dismal debate performance. And you're looking at the podium to hear from those Democrats. Of course, when that happens, we'll bring it to you. So, we're keeping an eye on this podium, we're also expecting at the other side of the Pennsylvania Avenue, a White House briefing at any moment. We've got our eyes on both these press conference, when they get underway, we will bring that to you. The storm surrounding President Biden's campaign is clearly overshadowing a huge moment for Mr. Biden on the international stage as he hosts, as I said, the NATO Summit. Mr. Biden will need to reassure world leaders at this week's summit he is fit to lead, and that he can beat Donald Trump. NATO meantime is marking its 75th anniversary, this is a landmark summit. All eyes will be on President Biden today, but Ukraine, as you can expect, is topping the agenda. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy released this video to announce his arrival in Washington just short time ago. This as sources tell CNN a draft of NATO's joint communique describes Ukraine's path to alliance as irreversible. But Mr. Zelenskyy still faces a grim reality of the war at home. And his visit follows what can only be called the deadly wave of Russian strikes across Ukraine just in the last 24 hours that killed at least 43 people. Among the sites that were hit, this Kyiv children's hospital. The U.S. Secretary of State spoke a short time ago with his Ukrainian counterpart and he pledged support for Ukraine and spoke about the attack at that children's hospital. Have a listen.

Others, cancer patients, suffering other illnesses, being treated with this remarkable facility. And it's particularly despicable that we would see this attack. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Reading between the tea leaves of what people have been saying when they -- when they have been coming out of meetings and before meetings today. I would assess that the President has stabilized his position somewhat in the last few days. At the same time, there is still deep concern over his performance, the direction of his campaign, and a lot of dissatisfaction among Democrats about the person that will lead them into the election, a critical election, as you mentioned against Donald Trump. That is one reason why the President's performance at this NATO Summit, especially a solo press conference on Thursday will be watched so closely. Any sign that he's slipping again, that he appears confused, that he's not in complete command, that could undercut a lot of the political work that the President has been successful in doing, and shoring up his domestic political position in the last few days.",

SEAN CASTEN (D-IL): My take-away is great sadness that we are not having a conversation about the fact that we have two people running for president, one of them has a record that anybody would be proud to have, and the other one is an adjudicated rapist, a twice-impeached-convicted felon, who there is not a single American who would trust a baby sit their teenage daughter. That is the conversation we have to be having over the next three months. We need to make sure that we can run an effective campaign on the political side of this operation. But the stakes of this are not about elections. The stakes of this are about what is the future for our country in two different scenarios. And I think there's a lot of concern about will we be able to have that conversation in this media environment? That my God, that's the conversation we have to have. REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): The President has determined that he is the best candidate, and given the fact that he's won the nomination, I mean, he's got all the delegates -- only he can make that -- (CROSSTALK)",

He's won the primary, he's got the delegates, that's his right. The question going into today was, would there be a critical mass of Democrats on the Hill who want him to step down? And in that case, would there be willingness from present and past Democratic heavyweights to go to the White House to tell him that the game is up. So far today, neither of those questions seemed to be answered in a way that would push Biden out of the race.",

I think what you heard today was from the leaders that we must be unified around a cause. We must be unified around defeating not just Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, but Trump isn't -- that's on down the ballot. That includes the extreme policies that come along with Donald Trump baked in Trumpism, including Project 2025, that also includes protecting the thing that Democrats were able to accomplish when they were in the majority.

What you did not hear, and I wish you would have heard more from the leaders you heard from today is not only is the presidency on the ballot, but downstream. The opportunity to elect the first African-American speaker. That's on the ballot. The first African-American assistant speaker, that's on the ballot.

Members left the meeting with the same concerns that they had, and there's no clear consensus in the Democratic caucus about what the path forward is.

I think for us as Democrats, it is critical that people have some muscle memory about who Donald Trump was for four years, and there will be open debate about the two presidents' record because they both would have had equal time in office, but also some muscle mass to add on to the muscle memory about who Donald Trump will be going into the presidency if people do not vote in the country's best interest. That includes extremism, that includes Trumpism, that includes rolling back Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security as we know it. Rolling back climate changes that have been advocated for and passed into law. That includes democracy and freedom going away as we know it if Donald Trump is elected. It's so important that we articulate a clear vision about who we are as Democrats, what we're for, but also what the other side is for, what they've stood up to, and what they've stood against. It's a contrast, it's a binary contrast, that has to be the order of the day.",

Let's listen in. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY: --overnight and we expect another 1 million to have their power restored today. The federal government has also offered generators to help reduce the impact of the power outages. The president continues to take decisive action to help the people of Texas recover, and he looks forward to working with the state to get more critical resources to the people that need them. I also want to share one additional scheduling item with all of you as well at the top. In addition to many NATO meetings we announced yesterday, on Thursday afternoon, President Biden will meet with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to discuss our unwavering support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russian aggression. That meeting will be at 1:30 p.m. at the convention center, which, as you all know, is where the NATO sessions are being held, and it will take place just before the NATO-Ukraine Council meeting. This will be the third meeting between both presidents in recent weeks following their sit down in France and also a sit down at the G7 in Italy, and it will further demonstrate the strength and we can't wait to see the growth of the partnership between our countries. And finally, just a personal note here. I want to say a few words about Sam Michel here, who served as acting deputy press secretary for the part of -- a good part of this year. We are sad that today is indeed his last day. But we are so grateful for his service. And he has been an incredible colleague. He is -- we were lucky to have him on our team, on our press team. His sharpness, his ability to stay calm under pressure, and his strategic thinking has been a real asset to us all. Sam, you will be greatly missed. Thank you so much for being on the team and stepping in when we really needed you. OK. All right. Song Mei (ph).",
