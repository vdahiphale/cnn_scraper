Did you at that point know its velocity?

The NORAD NORTHCOM commander does not have the authority necessarily to take down an object if it's not posing a potential hostile intent or actions. However, given the fact that this aircraft was -- excuse me -- this object was operating at an altitude that posed a reasonable threat to civilian air traffic, after consultation with the secretary and the president and of course the president on our advice gave the order to take it down and we took it down.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I would think it's fair to say that there is a widespread effort to figure out where this came from and who owns it. Because as you said, you know, multiple officials saying today from the White House and the Pentagon, the U.S. doesn't know if this is state owned or this is privately owned. So, they're really trying to figure out who owns this and where it came from. Because they first detected it just yesterday when it came, you know, close and then into U.S. airspace.I do think that there's one significant thing to point out here, which is that with the Chinese spy balloon, there was a number of contacts between U.S. diplomats and Chinese diplomats before the Biden administration took the move to shoot it down off the coast of South Carolina. The fact that there hasn't been any back-and-forth with China -- according to the White House on this -- does indicate that perhaps they don't think it is Chinese owned. But of course, they aren't counting out anything right now. And what we'll be watching for is the contacts, particularly on the diplomatic front, to inform allies about what happened here and try and work with Five Eyes -- those are partners that we share intelligence with to figure out what those countries might know that could help us, in addition to what's going to be this effort on the ground. This obviously went down over -- this was over, you know, frozen water, so it's going to be a very different excavation effort. But that will probably be their best shot at figuring out the answers to many of these questions we don't know right now.",

Oren, the Pentagon -- also at the White House there -- very careful not to describe this balloon. In part General Ryder said simply because he does not know.

This is the second time in, what, ten days now that an object has been discovered in U.S. airspace. The first one a Chinese spy balloon shot down. Still so many questions about this one. What's your reaction to the breaking news that we just learned minutes ago, and now just two hours ago this thing was shot down?MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, Victor, it tells me that they have changed their protocol. And the fact that they're going to notify the administration or put the message out up front and quickly decide and engage these targets. And in a post-9/11 world that's really the only thing they can do. You know, that comment the Pentagon makes about, you know, we wanted to see the last spy balloon travel across the United States and get intelligence from it just frankly doesn't pass the red face test. So, I think this is a message that they're sending out to the world that we've got domain capability now to see this. It was at 40,000 feet, that was commercial airliners. But when the NORAD commander last week said, you know, the last balloon showed some, you know, domain weaknesses, that's a problem. We usually don't tell our enemies where those gaps are. So I think this is a message that was sent by the Pentagon. They changed their protocol. They're going to do this from now on.

It was about 40,000 feet. Non- maneuverable. And when people hear small car, don't think of the dense of the car, think of just the size of it.

The key thing that I focused on was that apparently this object did not have the kind of connective capability that the balloon did. So that becomes a very different issue. And you know, to what Major Lyons was saying, this -- there is a big difference from an intelligence collection perspective. It actually is OK in some cases to collect the information, see how it actually talks to other entities.In this particular case you have a bit of a different situation where it didn't talk to anything, but you don't know what kind of a threat it poses except for the fact that you know it is a threat to commercial aviation.",

And that tells you it may well not have been a spying operation. It may well have been something else, a weather balloon or something else. So, their rationale for taking it down is threat to the aircraft. I'm not sure the rationale is the same as the reason for taking it down. BLACKWELL: Well, let's talk about the rationale, I'll bring in Tom Foreman. And this was flying at 40,000 feet. I talked about the FAA temporary flight restriction.

There can be concern about that. Also, based on what we heard a short while ago, moving northeast would have been moving out of U.S. air space, possibly into Canadian or international airspace depending on exactly where it was, we don't know.We do know this, if they shot it down at the time they say that would have been around the time you really had early morning up in this area. Remember you're far up in the arctic there. You don't have terribly long days. But they would have been shooting it down around first light. That would give them five, six hours or so, maybe longer when you consider the sort of twilight light that you get when you're up in the area this time of year, to actually look for it on the ground there. And they say on the ice, on the Beaufort Sea, ice is the condition much of the year that goes out pretty far. So, assuming they have a good idea where it came down from that 40,000, they do have several hours to get out there and track it down.
