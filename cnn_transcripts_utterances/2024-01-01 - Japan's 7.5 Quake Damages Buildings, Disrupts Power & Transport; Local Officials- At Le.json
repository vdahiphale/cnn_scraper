Japan's west coast reeling after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused widespread damage. It cracked roads. Highways are shut down there. Collapsed homes with people possibly still trapped under the rubble. We're going to speak to famed theoretical physicist, Michio Kaku about the fallout from all of this ahead. Plus, \"remarkable resilience,\" that's how many experts characterize the U.S. economy in 2023 despite fears of a recession. So what should you be expecting in 2024? We're going to show you the optimistic signs and the challenges ahead in the New Year. Also, Chicago's mayor says that Texas governor, Greg Abbott, continues to sow seeds of chaos. Saying this after Abbott has sent hundreds of asylum seekers by plane to Illinois overnight. I'm going to speak to a Chicago lawmaker about this latest move coming up. We're following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. And it is the top of the hour, I am Brianna Keilar. Boris Sanchez is off. President Biden says he and the First Lady are praying for the people of Japan after an earthquake there that we are now learning has killed at least four people, according to local officials. A 7.5 magnitude quake what the USGS labels as very strong. It devastated the Western prefecture of Ishikawa and the surrounding areas. This is video showing the intense shaking in a neighboring region. Another video shows people huddling together at a supermarket after the quake hit at 4:10 pm local time there in Japan. Local outlets reporting that people are trapped, including 1,400 stranded on bullet trains. This quake crumbled buildings like this home. It cracked open roads. It left thousands in the dark without power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was shut down before the earthquake took place. So there's no danger of another Fukushima-type disaster there. Next, Tokyo - Tokyo is about 180 miles away from the western part of Japan, where the epicenter was and that means that Tokyo is spared. Now, that's great news, because, of course, Tokyo is one of the most densely populated areas on the planet and (inaudible) catastrophic.

What's interesting, though, is that a lot of the investors and economists I talk to, they're also pretty bullish on America right now, especially relative to a year ago when there was all that gloom and doom. And many people assumed that a recession was basically inevitable. Of course, they were wrong.Looking at 2024, there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic, first of all is inflation. A lot of people thought it would cool, but very few people thought inflation would cool this fast. One economist is praising it as a remarkable cool down of inflation. And because of that, the Fed is now preparing to cut interest rates maybe as soon as March. That means lower borrowing costs, mortgage rates, credit cards, car loans. All of this has fired up Wall Street. Blockbuster stock market returns in 2023. A lot of that is fueled by real optimism about the economy. And despite all these recession warnings, the jobs market is historically strong. Layoffs are very low. Hiring is robust. Lastly, paychecks are finally catching up to prices and that is very important. None of this, Brianna, is to say the economy is perfect. Even White House officials will concede there are real affordability challenges, especially around housing. Still, though, this economy is in a much better place than a year ago. In fact, a lot better place than a lot of people even thought was possible.",

As economist Justin Wolfers told me, basically a million things could go wrong. A few things on my radar list, you have to look at consumer debt. We know Americans have been shopping aggressively. But there's questions about how much of that is being fueled by credit cards and buy now, pay later.Another concern is when the Fed spikes rates, it tends to break things in the financial system. We saw that with the bank collapses a year ago. It's too soon to say whether or not there may be more cracks in the financial system. And then you have to look at the geopolitical situation. Obviously, everyone's watching the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, because that has the potential to undo some of the progress on inflation. And then lastly, there's the election itself. Of course, the economy is going to influence who wins the race for the White House. But it's also possible that the opposite is true. Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, he told me that he's concerned about a contested election that causes uncertainty or even social unrest that hurts the economy. But Brianna, it is amazing when you think about how many hits this economy has already taken, whether it's inflation or the Fed or the wars and it just keeps going. So really, anyone who's bet against the economy over the last year has lost money and it's just a - it's a losing bet at this point. So hopefully some of these optimistic factors play out in 2024.",

I was just looking at The Hill's decision desk 2024 polling and they're down in some of these battleground states like Pennsylvania, for example. And so they have to try to turn that around.

Now, inflation has been coming down, but that is a tax on Americans that they can feel. That's a very real inflationary tax that they're getting when they go to the grocery market, for example. But overall, I mean, I was just looking at the Bloomberg indicators and you've got the S&amp;P that was up 25 percent last year, and the Nasdaq up 45 percent last year. But six in - or four in 10 Americans, rather, aren't invested in the stock market. So the stock market, as Sen.

WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I'm seeing it totally in keeping with the policy that the United States enumerated. We said we would protect shipping. Now, in this case, instead of firing missiles or using drones to attack shipping, they went out with boats, four boats loaded with infantrymen, fighters intending to board a vessel.
