And white nationalists are racists. See, Senator Tuberville, really not that hard to say.I'm John Berman, and this is \"CNN Tonight\" or very nearly tomorrow, which is when we could learn what these two top prosecutors were doing at a federal courthouse in Washington, D.C. It is the courthouse where the grand jury has been hearing testimony in the special counsel's investigation into Donald Trump's actions surrounding January 6th. It has been a busy courthouse, which has heard from a long list of witnesses that you can see right there on the screen, including Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani. Now, seeing activity at the courthouse is not unusual. Seeing these two top lawyers from the Special Counsel Jack Smith's team there is. And it is a lot of speculation that maybe they are inching closer to a charging decision. Tonight, we are going to get the insider's guide of what to look for how to figure out if new indictments are coming. Of course, there already have been indictments in the other half of the special counsel's world, the Mar-a-Lago documents case. And now, Trump's team has told a federal judge when they think the trial should happen. Later, they say. Much later. And if they get their way, maybe never. Quote -- \"There is simply no question that any trial of this action during the pendency of a presidential election will impact both the outcome of the election and importantly, the ability of the defendants to get a fair trial.\" Pendency, by the way, for folks like me who have never seen the word, means it is coming. The election is coming. News you can use. Trump is asking to wait until after the election so too is his aide or body man as he is called sometimes, Walt Nauta. They write Mr. Nauta's job requires him to accompany President Trump during most campaign trips around the country. Requires? He needs to be there? As we sometimes ask our kids when they say they need ice cream, is that a need or a want? The judge will decide. Now, finally, the lawyers argue that there is no ongoing threat to national security nor any concern regarding continued criminal activity. A federal judge will have to decide if that is true about a guy who, after all, is being charged for the way he handled secrets. Now, whether you agree with the filing or not, all of this is likely good lawyering. A trial delayed is a trial that could die, as in never happen if Trump wins. First, though, to the action that we saw today and what it might mean for tomorrow, joining us with his legal decoder ring, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig.",

We don't know what is happening behind closed doors.But let me give you a couple reasons in my experience why we could be seeing these two senior lawyers. One, it could be that they've divided up the labor, that certain lawyers are handling certain witnesses. Typically, you are more sensitive when more difficult witnesses would be handled by your more senior attorneys. The other possibility is that when you get to the end of a presentation as a prosecutor and you are ready to ask the grand jury for an indictment, you have to present to them the draft indictment. You read them the charges and then you have to instruct them on the law. It is really important that get that just right because if you messed up, if you skipped an element, that charge is going to get thrown out way down the line.

The question is, if DOJ determines that those statements were made in the course of the official duties of being president, then DOJ will represent you, and they will get the case thrown out on basis of immunity. Donald Trump's DOJ under Bill Barr initially made the controversial decision, yes, Donald Trump's comments about E. Jean Carroll were a part of his job as president. And then the more surprising part is when Merrick Garland took in for the Biden administration. He agreed. He said, yes, that was part of his official job. But now, DOJ has reversed that and said, given some of the evidence that came out in the first trial and given some of Trump's subsequent statements, they actually have now reversed themselves and said not in the course of his duties, we won't represent him, and he is not going to be able to get rid of the case on --",

And she received an indeterminate life sentence. So, what that means is that she, according to due process, has -- she has a reasonable chance at achieving parole. And it's not easy to get parole grants in California. It has taken her five decades. But I understand why people, certainly the victims and family members of the victims, feel emotional about this and want retribution. But that's not the law. The law says she has the right to achieve parole if she meets the standard. And the standard is that she no longer poses a danger to society, to the public. She met that standard by working -- for five decades. She was in therapy for 40 years. She took what's called rehabilitative programming courses in prison, which focus on insight, they focus on responsibility, they focus on remorse. And she has -- she has achieved that to the satisfaction of the parole board. So, therefore, because she meets the standard approval, she's no longer dangerous.
