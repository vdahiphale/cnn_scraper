However, we should not discount the significance of this meeting between these two top diplomats, because it was just six months ago that relationships between the United States and China were quite frosty, especially after that spy balloon shoot down. But yet in recent weeks, we have seen Secretary of State AnthonyBlinken travel to Beijing as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. So as far as the specific meeting in Indonesia, the meeting between Blinken and the Chinese diplomat lasted about 90 minutes. It's being described as both candid and constructive. And while there were no breakthroughs -- breakthroughs continued on that theme, there were some important points discussed, including peace in the Taiwan Strait, fentanyl, the issue of fentanyl has been a big issue, as well as that recent email hack that was raised by Microsoft. No real specifics on how much detail went into that particular item. However, a senior State Department official did bring up the point that Secretary Blinken was able to basically continue the conversation right where things left off, making reference to some of the past conversations that Blinken, as well as Secretary Yellen, have had with their Chinese counterparts. The big question that still looms in the future of this relationship is when President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will actually meet face to face again. The last time that happened was last November on the sidelines of the G20. It is perhaps safe to say that the discussions that we are seeing now are going to pave the way for a future conversation between these two leaders. No date has been set, but I think it's very much safe to say there is hope from the State Department that by having these incremental meetings now, Kim, it will lead to a broader discussion with those two leaders.",

More now from CNN's Stephanie Busari in Lagos.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SR. EDITOR, AFRICA: A mass grave with at least 87 people was discovered in Sudan's West Darfur region, a United Nations agency said Thursday. The grave was discovered outside the region's capital in El Janinia, and the U.N. said some of the bodies were of ethnic Masulite people who are often targeted by Sudan's paramilitary rapid support forces, also known as RSF. The U.N. says it has credible information that the killings were carried out by the RSF who are fighting against the Sudanese National Army. The RSF have denied their involvement in the attacks. The RSF involved from the Janjawick militia, which were accused of genocide and war crimes in Darfur 20 years ago. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said he was quote, \"appalled by the callous and disrespectful way the dead along with their families and communities were treated.\" The U.N. has said crimes against humanity been committed in Darfur and that their fears that history could be about to repeat itself are 20 years after the genocide that killed more than 300,000 people and displaced millions. The gruesome discovery came as leaders from Sudan's six neighboring countries met in Cairo for more mediation talks. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi presented an initiative based on the ceasefire, opening of safe passages for aid, and comprehensive dialogue between the warring parties. Leaders at the summit also expressed their concern over the spillover effect Sudan's three-month conflict has had on their borders. The U.N. says nearly 2.8 million people have fled Sudan, many without passports, for some of these countries such as Ethiopia, Chad and Libya. Stephanie Busari, CNN, Lagos (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They arrive here, they're extremely tired, they're in a very poor condition, most of them have nothing. Yesterday, I was at the border and I saw an old woman being carried in a wheelbarrow, being pushed by other people.It's really difficult and we're extremely worried for the fate of children here because You know, they've been at war for almost two months back there at home in Darfur. And so when they come here, they're in a very difficult state. We have malnutrition that is spiking. And we are currently quite worried about, first of all, the health of the children, but also their well-being. And honestly, the children I've been speaking to have seen what no human being should ever see. BRUNHUBER: Yeah, absolutely.

There's no running water, there's no electricity, there's hardly any sewage system.And of course now, for example, in Adre, the city, which is literally on the border. This was a small city of maybe 15, 20,000 people. And now the number of refugees, we don't have an exact estimation. UNHCR is trying to count them, but they have counted 65,000 at this point, which is already like three or four times the local population. So now we have a double issue. We have the refugees streaming in. But we also have the local population who had very little in the beginning, and now they have to share the little they have with the refugees. For example, yesterday I was in one of those refugee camps and people, I mean they're not really camps, they're settlements. People sit wherever they can sit. They're going to be moved in proper, decent camps further in time. But for now, they're just sitting on people's fields. So what happens with the crops in September? There's going to be no crops. You can only share what you have with people coming to seek refuge in your house. But if you have nothing, then we have a double issue. And also the prices have spiked because this city here was getting all its supplies from Sudan and now nothing's coming. So the prices are doubled or tripled in the past month.",

You do need to keep hydrated if you can, as long -- as much as possible. And really you know avoid exposure to direct sun during the day, if you can. But again, you mentioned some cases just a few minutes ago, people are working outside on the streets. You know, some people just don't have the choice.

It's hoping to launch its spacecraft in just a few hours. And if the landing is successful, India will only be the fourth country to accomplish such a feat.All right. Joining me now is CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. So, Kristie, what's India trying to achieve with this lunar mission? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kim, this is India's latest attempt for a soft landing on the moon. The Chandrayaan-Three which means moon vehicle in Sanskrit is launching today at 2:35 p.m. local time. Less than three hours from now. And as the name suggests, this is India's third mission to the moon and it's part of the country's greater bid to become a space power. Now, during the last mission in 2019, the rover crashed after a hard landing. But with this mission, they are aiming to soft land the rover near some pretty challenging terrain. The unexplored south pole of the moon. And according to the Indian Space Agency or ISRO, we have a statement for you. They say this. \"The Chandrayaan-Three is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-Two to demonstrate end-to-end capability and safe landing and roving on the lunar surface.\" Now, space officials, they add that the lander is due to reach the moon on August 23. Now, after the landing, scientists, they plan to deploy the rover and to conduct scientific experiments including analyzing the chemistry of the soil of the moon, measuring the temperature on the lunar surface, and also scanning for moon quakes. Now, success here would be huge for India. So far, only three countries have managed to soft-land a craft on the moon. You got the U.S., the former Soviet Union, and China. India also has a reputation for low-cost space missions. Don't forget in 2014, it became the first Asian country to reach the Red Planet. The Mars Mission cost only $74 million, compare that to the one hundred million dollars budget for the movie \"Gravity.\" Back to you.",

China is also planning to have a manned mission within the decade. So, what India's trying to do in comparison is saying, look, we're going to focus on being a low-cost space power. We've heard from Prime Minister Modi. He has encouraged private investment into startups to launch more rockets into space. This is something that India is very good at. And analysts have said this low-cost angle and also the current geopolitical environment give India leverage as an emerging space power. Back to you, Kim. BRUNHUBER: Fascinating.
