      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.And a busy hour of news just ahead, the Biden White House preparing to welcome the Japanese prime minister, the president will hold a news conference shortly. He will likely be asked about the bombshell decision on abortion out of Arizona. We'll bring that to you as it happens. Also breaking this hour, the former financial chief at the Trump Organization who admitted to lying to prosecutors, he is getting jail time. We'll go out live to that as well. Plus, we're live in a Mississippi courtroom, where six former law enforcement officers members of a self-described Goon Squad will soon be sentenced for brutally torturing two men. And severe weather to tell you about flaring up across the Deep South, we have those pictures, we will go live to that in just a few moments as well. So, stay with us for that. But, first, the president and first lady are hosting an official arrival ceremony for Japan's prime minister and his wife. It comes ahead of the two leaders' bilateral meeting and joint press conference being held in the coming hours over at the White House. You can see the secretary of state, secretary of defense, the vice president, Kamala Harris, all standing by as the prime minister will be showing up on the south lawn of the White House at any moment at that news conference that I mentioned this afternoon. President Biden will almost certainly be asked about Arizona's controversial Supreme Court decision on abortion. He's already called the abortion ruling cruel and dangerous. CNN White House Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez joins us now. And, Priscilla, I mean, women across America this morning are waking up to reproductive rights being taken away and state after state, it seems. And this morning, it's Arizona. It's another flash point in this cultural war we've been seeing happening all across the country. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  And it's more fuel for the White House and for President Biden to tie these unpopular abortion bans that are happening across the country directly to former President Donald Trump. In fact, in the moments after we received this ruling yesterday, the White House released a statement. I'm going to read you some of that. This from President Biden, quote, millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest. It goes on to say, quote, this ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedoms. Now, of course, the Biden campaign has been seizing on this issue, seeing it as one that will galvanize voters, particularly in the very critical swing state of Arizona. And when I spoke to a Democratic strategist this morning, they said, look, this is another data point in what has already been the argument for Democrats in this election and framing it and continuing to frame it as going after freedoms, personal freedoms and health care. And the vice president also weighing in on this. She, of course, has been on a reproductive freedoms tour, kicking that off in January. And she said that we're essentially going back to a time when women couldn't vote, that is what this abortion ban stems from, and then also going on to tie it to former President Donald Trump. And she's going to take that message to Arizona on Friday.",

Meghan, I mean, we've seen the president put out a statement on abortion. Priscilla just referred to it a few moments ago. It's likely maybe it won't happen. Maybe it will happen, but he probably will be asked about abortion in Arizona. And I'm just wondering what's on your mind when you see what's happening in this country right now, women across America.

It's an issue we've spoken a lot about.

They're calling this an official visit of the Japanese prime minister, not a state visit because, technically, the state of Japan is run by an emperor, I guess, ceremonially. But they're calling this an official visit. But in a couple of hours from now, the president will also hold a news conference. We do think the president may make some remarks here in just a few moments. Typically, that's the case, right?

I mean, they're pretty safe there in California. I mean, unless, of course, the president loses in the fall, Donald Trump becomes president and you have a Republican Congress, then I suppose things are different. But what is your reaction to this ruling in Arizona, and what do you hope the president says if he's asked about it at this news conference coming up soon? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  I mean, first of all, it's obviously a horrific, horrific day and week for everyone in Arizona. And we're going to be impacted in California as well, obviously, as we will face women and folks that really need this service, these supports. I mean, abortion, we know is health care. We know that Donald Trump is directly responsible through his actions, through what he's done through the court, through his comments, through his pushing the Republican conference here in conference, here in Congress, for what's happening across the country, not just in Arizona, but just the denying of access of reproductive health care, the moving back just generations in these rights. And so we have a real choice here. Joe Biden is the person that's going to help restore national abortion rights. Vice President Harris is going to Arizona here, as we know. And the president will continue to be clear and loud that this is a choice between women and their doctors and that we need to stop Donald Trump from continuing this march of moving our rights backwards.",
