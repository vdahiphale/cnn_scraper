The former president tells the Supreme Court to keep him on the Colorado ballot, warning there'll be, quote, \"chaos and bedlam\" if he doesn't.Also, breaking tonight, Hunter Biden now says he'll talk to House Republicans who are looking to impeach his dad, and he'll do it their way behind closed doors. And later, keeping them honest, what a parent whose child was murdered at Robb Elementary School thinks the Justice Department's new report released today detailing all the ways authorities in Texas failed to do their jobs and tried to evade accountability. Good evening. Thanks for being with us. We begin tonight with the former president's Supreme Court filing late today in the case that could decide whether Colorado can bar him from the ballot under the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause. Tonight's brief comes just three weeks ahead of oral arguments in the case and about seven weeks before Colorado's March 5th primary. CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now with the latest. So what does this filing say about the implications of letting the Colorado Supreme Court ruling stand?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, Anderson, the former president's legal team, they're telling the Supreme Court here that Colorado got it wrong when it ruled to take Trump off the ballot. And they're really warning that if this isn't fixed, that if states continue to be allowed to take candidates off the ballot, they're saying it will unleash chaos.They said that in the first page of this 50-page filing. I'll read some of it for you. It says, \"The Court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot disqualification efforts, which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado's lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots.\" And they're saying this, Anderson, because, so far, two states have ruled to take Trump off the ballot -- Colorado and Maine. Both of those decisions, though, they're on hold until the Supreme Court eventually rules here. So that really means Trump's name will, in fact, appear on the primary ballot despite the court's ruling that they shouldn't be. The bigger question, though, is really what happens when we head toward the general election, you know, if Trump is the nominee. And that's why his team here is urging the Supreme Court to come down on their side and not let individual states take matters into their own hands in deciding who should and shouldn't be on the ballot here.",

It'll be heard on February 8th. You know, the Supreme Court, they already fast-tracked this case because it's hugely consequential. We have the general election less than 10 months away. Primary's already underway. And Trump's legal team, they're asking the court to really consider this issue very broadly. They're actually laying out all of their legal arguments in the brief tonight -- several arguments, Anderson. They're saying Trump did not engage in insurrection, which the lower courts here found that he did. And then they're saying that this section of the 14th Amendment, it doesn't apply to him anyway. And it really -- they're saying that it can't be used to deny Trump access to the ballot. So the nine justices will have a lot to consider when they hear these arguments. Who knows how many arguments they'll actually rule on, but there is a lot at stake. Like I said, just about 10 months until the general election.",

Jessica Schneider, thanks very much.With me here, CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former Federal Prosecutor Elie Honig, and joining us is Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. So, Madam Secretary, I wonder what you make of the filing by the former president's legal team, particularly, the argument that removing him from the ballot would unleash chaos and bedlam. JENA GRISWORLD (D), COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, I think it's really interesting they chose to use that language because it's just more of Donald Trump saying that if he's not in charge, the country is doomed. But the language itself on top of that, I hope, is not a threat to the stability of our country. Donald Trump has used his words to incite violence on January 6th with the insurrection, and violence to election workers, judges, anybody who stands up to him and stands up for our democratic institutions. I think it is just more of the same and it underlines how dangerous he is to the country.",

I do think Donald Trump makes -- his lawyers make some powerful legal and procedural arguments, for example. And Secretary Griswold mentioned the text of the 14th Amendment. Well, the 14th Amendment Section 5 says Congress, the US Congress, shall pass legislation to enforce this. It does not say Congress or the states if they so choose. If I can ask Secretary Griswold, I'm curious, what your view is, Madam Secretary, about that, the fact that Section 5 says Congress shall pass legislation. It doesn't say anything about the states.",

It has been used throughout American history without Congress first passing a law enabling it. So I do think that is an incorrect argument.",

About why in the minds of the families there's been so little accountability and so little communication.Well, today, the Justice Department released a nearly 600-page review about the response, the fullest accounting that we have to date. Joining us now is Shimon Prokupecz who's led our coverage since that day, broke in numerous stories about the botched police response, tried to hold people accountable. He joins us from Uvalde with details about what's in the report and what's missing. So, Shimon, a lot of what's in the report confirms all the remarkable and dogged reporting that you and your team have done on this. Is there anything in it you didn't know before?",

The acting police chief that day in Uvalde, Mariano Pargas, for his lack of leadership. And then the sheriff, who is still the sheriff of this county, he is actually running to be sheriff again. There's an election that's coming up. So you have the first two individuals I named, Pargas and Arredondo, they're gone. They're no longer police officials. But the sheriff is still the sheriff here in this town. And the Department of Justice went to great lengths to talk about how he lacked any kind of leadership and that he withheld information, critical information about who the shooter was from officials. And actually, Anderson, just a short time ago before we came on air here, we saw the sheriff because he's here behind me in this building because there's a forum, a political forum for the candidates that are running. And we actually asked him questions about the latest report. He was defiant and seemingly just not in touch with what people here are feeling. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
