Several hundreds more are still unaccounted for. Approximately 600 people were still missing yesterday afternoon just in Asheville, North Carolina. The community is reeling after the powerful storm washed out large parts of the city's infrastructure, making it even more difficult for crews to reach residents with vital supplies. Mules are now helping to deliver food, water, and diapers to those remote mountainous areas.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ESTHER MANHEIMER (D), ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA: As we watched these rivers recede, we are seeing just piles of people's houses that were destroyed, buildings that were destroyed, cars overturned, trash, and debris.

Look at the impacts over 500 miles away directly related to a hurricane. Now, how do you even compartmentalize coming back to a scene like this? I mean this is Chimney Rock, North Carolina.And it's also a reminder to people that in our new warmer world, we're experiencing these more frequent, heavy rain events. For every two degrees Fahrenheit of warming that our world goes through and undertakes, we have 8 percent more water vapor in the atmosphere. That means that we have the ability to hold more moisture, the ability to create these more frequent and more extreme heavy rain events, just like we saw. Now, there are still some tropical moisture residual moisture from Helene that is still in the atmosphere and the rivers there are still flooding and cresting across downstream South Carolina as that water makes its way towards the East Coast. You can almost follow the track of destruction with 1.5 million customers without power left in Helene's wake. Now, we need to focus on the Gulf of Mexico again. This is troubling news. But the latest computer models have simmered down on the potential development, but I do want to talk about this area here. Potentially over the next seven days, there is a 40 percent chance of development once again in the same area. Kasie.",

The governor, on Monday, says he got a call from the president the previous day. He missed the call, but then he called him right back. President Biden was asked about Trump's claims during a press briefing in the Oval Office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's lying. And the governor told him he was lying. The governor told him he's lying. I've spoken to the governor. I've spent time with him. And he told me he's lying. I don't know why he does this.

Again, the Tim Walz that we see on the campaign trail, as he's bouncing around and dancing and pointing to Kamala Harris and looking kind of goofy, is not the Tim Walz that shows up in debates.And, Kasie, I will tell you, I've watched more debate footage of Tim Walz than anyone should ever be forced to do. But here's the thing, he's been in office for two decades. J.D. Vance has been in official office for two years. But Tim Walz has been in office for two decades. He's good. He was in Congress. He's in his second term as governor of the state of Minnesota. When he shows up and hits that stage, he's disciplined, he's on point and he lies through his teeth. And that's the thing that most people who are tuning in tonight, or many of the people I should say, will not have watched Tim Walz bouncing around on the campaign stage. What they will see is tonight they'll see Tim Walz for the first time. And he will come across with very much an awe shucks Minnesota persona. But where he's going to have an issue is, how does he defend his record? How does he defend Kamala Harris' record? And to be honest, he has to defend Joe Biden's record as well.",

That's where I see - I think you'll start to see it come unraveling a little bit for Tim Walz.But on the debate stage, it's almost like a muscle memory. It's like getting back in the gym if you haven't been in, in a while. He knows exactly what to do on that stage. He's well programmed because this has been his life for the past two decades. And so with all due respect to my - my boss, trust me, when he gets to the debate stage, Tim Walz is going to be good. And J.D. Vance, I think, is going to do very well also.

I would say the advantage definitely goes to him since he's been doing this for song. Let me tell you where J.D. Vance, though, is going to excel. Where he's going to excel is when he's talking about his humble upbringings, as well as his military service. Also, nobody defends President Trump's record on building a great economy and securing our border better than J.D. Vance. That's where I think the matchup's going to be.",
