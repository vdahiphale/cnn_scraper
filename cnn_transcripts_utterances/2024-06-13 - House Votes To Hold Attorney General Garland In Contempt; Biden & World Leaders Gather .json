We know that transcript really made waves in Washington and around the country when Robert Hur essentially wrote that during his interview with Biden during the classified documents probe. You know, Biden was forgetful and acting like an elderly man essentially.So, Republicans have been pushing for the audio and Democrats and critics of Republicans say this is political. They essentially want to cut an ad and use the audio against Joe Biden for political purposes, but for awhile, it was unclear as to whether the Republican conference here would get on board. But we know that one Republican, Dave Joyce from Ohio, voted against this with Democrats. So interesting how those dynamics played out.",

S set the stage for us here in terms of these leaders meeting. \"Politico\" framed it this way, their Europe team. They said this is a meeting of six lame ducks and Georgia Meloni: Meet the G7 class of 2024. And then they write, quote: This week's gathering of G7 leaders in Italy looks more like the last supper than a display of Western power. Is that fair? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well -- I think the point they're making is that, you know, you got Biden going to election. You've got Sunak in the U.K. getting into snap election, Macron going into a snap election. So when they're saying the lame ducks, they might not be there, you know, by the end of the year. So any decisions they make now may not be binding, so G7 is all about power. The world's biggest economies, obviously not China there, but the -- in terms of the West and working with allies like Japan is immensely powerful. But when the individual leaders there are empowered to make decisions are lost, then it becomes less powerful. So that's why they're talking about the lame duck element. Also, when you talk about the Italian prime minister, you know, she's a reflection, isn't she, what were talking about earlier this week where you have this rise in right-wing support across Europe. She's a right-wing prime minister of a major country. And she really represents the change in Europe that people are feeling. And that Biden will experience when he gets here. I'm sure.",

And we were missing that a bit, at the moment in Europe with these lame ducks, for example. And they're quite congenial, a lot of the world leaders will see today. Then you got, you got Putin, you got, you know, the Hungarian prime minister. You got, you know, Xi, who are seen as these strong men. So I think that Trump really epitomize that. And, you know, his ideology is what really fired up the right wing here in Europe made it much more popular, his ideas about selling, the ideas of the right-wing to the mass public, which has been very successful in America, but there's also being successful here. So he may be back at the end of the year. These events I think it was really difficult frankly for other world leaders because when you're getting into these family photo moments, it's all about you as a man on the world stage, projected yourself to the people at home. And if you're being pushed aside by one of the world leaders, it doesn't really work for you.",

There'll be supporting their Labour party, for example. On the right, you've got Rishi Sunak's party and the reform party led by Nigel Farage. And what you are seeing is that there are young people still supporting the left, but lower (ph) young men of actually started supporting the ideas of, you know, Nigel Farage which isn't far right. But as far right as they pretty much go in this country and it's interesting because they're appealing -- the left and the right appealing to a similar thing. You know, the challenges of surviving in this world where there's so such big challenge on cost of living, they're just coming into it in different directions. So I would say that anecdotally, young men are being drawn to the right. Also to the left, but, you know, you're not seeing lots of women, young women being drawn to the right in the same way.",
