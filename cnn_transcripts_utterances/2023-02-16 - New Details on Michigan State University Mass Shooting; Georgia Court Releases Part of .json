We're going to start in Michigan where police are holding a news conference updating on the investigation of that deadly mass shooting in Michigan State University. Police confirmed this morning that a two-page note was found in the killer's backpack that contained a list of other targets.Meantime thousands gathered last night to remember the students killed with leaders from campus and the state issuing calls for action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. RENE GONZALEZ, MICHIGAN STATE POLICE:  Two pages of notes were found in his wallet and were found on his person as well, including the (INAUDIBLE) note that indicated where he was going to visit and also kind of gave an indication of why, maybe a motive but nothing that we can actually confirm just yet. For our investigation, we found that he had had contact with some of those places and a couple of the other places that it appears that he had some issues with employees there, where he was asked to leave. So it is looking like he possibly, a motive for that is that he felt slighted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let me get your reaction to some of what we've learned in this update from Michigan officials and they have been forthcoming with what they have learned from the investigation. And part of it is that Michigan State Police said that the note they have found and what they said, quote, \"gave an indication\" of maybe a motive and they are obviously still working through it. But nothing is firmly confirmed yet and, of course, the man is now dead. What are you taking that as meaning when the question is going to remain why?",

With regard to the investigation, it is the case that we want to understand more of why this individual attacked our campus and our students. And when I think about the information that we received this morning, the fact that this letter was there in this individual's backpack, what it makes me wonder is if there is a broader set of communication or behaviors that might have given the individuals in this person's atmosphere, his orbit, some indication that he was a ticking time bomb. Look, it is too early to know that. But those are legitimate questions as we often talk about with these things. We want to know if there is a point at which someone could have said or done something to prevent this from happening. And certainly when we see a note like this, there is an indication that there was something to that",

So we will certainly take a look at those things. But Michigan State University is 50,000 students from all around the world.

Now she is not bound by anything in the report and she has complete discretion to charge or not charge and add other people and take recommendations. It is up to her and this is a summary of the findings. She is going to be looking at the unredacted versions. And remember, these special purpose grand juries in Georgia are not the norm. There is no playbook or go-by or cheat sheet for the judge to follow or for the district attorney or the staff who prepared the report with the grand jury. So we are a little bit in unchartered waters but I think something here in great detail about the deliberations. And I expect that we will find great correlation between those who fought the subpoenas and the recommendation or the concerns that the grand jury had about people being less than forthcoming when they appeared before them.",

As they were saying, the judge has held a lot of this back, including recommendations and whether somebody should be charged with a crime.But the one section released is frankly a paragraph on the belief that witnesses lied before the grand jury and, in this paragraph, they recommended that the Fulton County defense attorney, Fani Willis, consider indicting some of the witnesses for perjury. \"The grand jury recommends that the district attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling.\" So this is a sense of the tone of the grand jury, the belief that there were witnesses who came before them, that lied under oath. Their suggestion to the district attorney, because ultimately it is up to her whether she is going to pursue indictments, that maybe there are indictments worth pursuing coming to the perjury question. Now again, we are not seeing what their broader recommendations were or the names of the witnesses they believe may have lied. But it is important. They also wrote in the report that they believe unanimously, that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election in Georgia that could have upended the results. And people around the former president and the former president himself has contended that there was fraud, despite the lack of evidence there. And they pointed out that they had heard from some witnesses who were still adamant that there was fraud in the 2020 election.",

Stick with me.Patricia, this question in this paragraph, in this limited amount here, it says that the majority of the grand jury believe that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses who came before it. And you were thinking this could be one of the most interesting parts here. No names; we are not getting any names here. PATRICIA MURPHY, \"ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\":  Well, first of all, we know the process is going forward. Fani Willis will take this very seriously. And that's an entire bucket of potential charges, above and beyond other recommendations made by the grand jury. But something that Michael Moore said is so true and important, there is no playbook for what we are seeing here. There has never been a president indicted on criminal charges before. And we have never had this kind of finding, that there was no widespread fraud, followed by these layers and layers and layers of actions by a former president and his associates. And when you are looking at the list of witnesses who went before this grand jury, the governor, the secretary of state, multiple state lawmakers, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, Cassidy Hutchinson, his own assistant up there in the White House. We get a glimpse of just how broad and serious this situation is. Some witnesses said that I don't think that anything happened and I don't believe that there was fraud and this is what else I know. Others were named targets in this investigation as well. And when Fani Willis asked that this report be kept mostly under wraps, which is what we are seeing today, she said that she wanted to protect the due process rights of future potential defendants. And I think that we are starting to see here that we will expect future defendants in this situation, more than likely.",

Now whether or not she decides to proceed on the perjury charges is an interesting way to go.And it may be tougher but it is striking me that she is really going to take the recommendations and the testimony that she has got and bolstered up the evidence she needed, that call that Trump made to the secretary of the state at the time, looking for those votes. And I think at that point now, she is going to be moving forward. I don't know how broad the net will be. But you know, we have key players, who she has subpoenaed. And I think you will have folks who both may have told half-truths and complete falsehoods when they testified and gave testimony before the General Assembly committees that were looking into this. And you may have people who have made false statements -- the grand jury believed made false statements to them. And so that compounds the investigation. And so, again, whether she looks at a few potential targets or the key players or she'll try to indict the quarterback. Or does she indict the whole team? I don't know how deep she is going to go. She has to be thinking though, that I need to be both able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the criminal standard. If I get a conviction, if a court lets me move forward and if I get a conviction, can I support the conviction on appeal in this state? And she is weighing those things out at the same time.

And if you are looking at the conclusion, the grand jury wants to point out if they fail to include any violations, they said they acknowledge the discretion of the district attorney to seek indictments where there is sufficient cause. Essentially they are saying, in the portions that we have not seen, we made recommendations of who, if anyone, should face criminal charges. Also if there is anything that we missed, we are not legal experts. But if in the statute, there is crime committed that evaded us during the investigation but where the district attorney believes there is enough evidence to pursue an indictment, we defer to her. She should go forward. So this is setting up the landscape. What will the district attorney do and how will it align to what the grand jury has recommended?",

And you point to the statement of history, Sara, you said -- I think that this is from the opening of the grand jury report -- where they lay out very clearly that the grand jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts and State of Georgia employees and officials as well as persons still claiming that such fraud took place. And we find by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in Georgia in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning the election.

We have looked at the evidence, heard from the witnesses and believe there is room for a case. So go get 'em.And it seems that they are giving complete deference to her in that decision. So this grand jury does not have the power to indict. She has to now present that to a criminal grand jury, who can take the summary of the report and consider the witness testimony, the statements that were made. They are not bound, either, by the special grand jury report but this is basically an affirmation that -- for the district attorney, that the investigation should move forward. Now again, she looks at it both from the facts and the law. She'll have the take into consideration the court she may be in and what the jury pool is going to look like and all of the things that go into her decision. And it does not mean that she does not enforce the law or move forward on matters brought forward. But she has to think about things, especially in a case of this magnitude, because we are in historical waters here.

Think about the number of motions and court challenges that are going on in cases about subpoenas for grand jury proceedings and other legal proceedings now involving Trump.So you can only begin to imagine the cases that will be filed and the motions that will be filed and there will be efforts to move the case, I'm sure, if there is an indictment, to the federal court. There will be motions to dismiss the indictment. We're just getting started on that and so the district attorney has to be thinking, my job is to move forward on cases. But it is also my job to look for the truth and to pursue a conviction if I can. So she is thinking about that. She is thinking about the jury pool and thinking this is politics. And even though you are in Fulton County that votes largely Democratic, there are parts of Fulton County that are not. And the jury comes from the whole county. What happens if the case were moved to the Northern District of Georgia? It's a broader case, a broader jury. What would that look like? So our appellate courts, frankly, there are very good judges and some very good friends of mine. But they are also controlled right now by Republican appointees. And so she has to be thinking about that, too, and how it would play out if she could secure a conviction. So her thought process cannot be limited to just, well, I heard this call from Trump to Raffensperger. I'm going to move forward. A good prosecutor -- and she is an experienced prosecutor -- will be thinking about supporting a conviction all the way through and what she can do and what evidence she has to support it.

And she has a spiraling Rico trial that she is trying right now, against rappers; just jury selection in that case is going to take an estimated three months.

So I think it is up to the DA to decide when she has this case ready and will go in front of a regular grand jury and pursue indictments. As the other folks have noted, there's a political reality that is playing in the background. The longer you wait, the closer to the reality of the 2024 presidential campaign, where Donald Trump has already said that he is a candidate. So she is likely going to face pressure, if she is bringing indictments, she is going to have to move speedily. She has said that she is not the person who bends to the will of public pressure.
