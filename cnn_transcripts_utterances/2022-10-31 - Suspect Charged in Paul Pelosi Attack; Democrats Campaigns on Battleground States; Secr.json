And if she lied, he was going to, quote, \"break her kneecaps.\" He went on to say that he was certain Nancy would not have told the truth. At one point, the suspect let Paul Pelosi into the bathroom where he managed to call 911 and ran to open the front door once police arrived. Police say Pelosi grabbed DePape's hammer right after opening the door. Police told them to drop the hammer and that's when DePape told the police Pelosi's husband would be, quote, \"taking the punishment instead,\" hitting him in the hit with the hammer so hard it knocked him out. DePape is now facing up to 50 years in prison if convicted on federal felony charges brought against him. State charges are also expected to be filed. Police have been reluctant to define the motivation in this case publicly but the complaint notes DePape's alleged intent to interfere with Speaker Pelosi's official duties as House Speaker. DePape explained to investigators he wanted to break Nancy's kneecaps because then she would have to be wheeled into Congress which would show other members of Congress there were consequences to actions.",

It became clear that the cause for this was the fact that this was the Speaker of the House of Representatives' home and that his motivation seemed to stem from that.

President Biden recently has participated more in sort of official events where he can talk about the Democratic agenda and their legislative accomplishments, and less so on sort of the political rallies alongside individual candidates. And Biden advisers in terms of just the closing message have been so consistent in saying it is all about contrast, contrast, contrast on issues ranging from the economy to abortion and reproductive rights, to gas prices.

It seems as though Democrats were feeling a lot more confident just a few months, just a few weeks ago. I wonder if they feel as though it was a misstep to dismiss Walker, to sort of characterize him as not a serious candidate because what we have seen is conservatives surround him and really support him through his many controversies. What I will say, though, is that despite the poll fluctuation, Senator Warnock remains a really disciplined candidate. He is not really weighing in on this. He's asked about this on the campaign trail, asked about Senator Schumer's hot mic moment casting doubt on winning -- being successful -- Democrats being successful here in the Senate contest in Georgia.

And despite intercepts 44 across the country, according to the government, groups of missiles getting through at least three according to this witness near Kyiv's a hydroelectric power plant. A missile flew over our house. I went to the balcony and saw the second missile and a drone, she says. Both were flying in the direction of the power plant. It's so scary when you see it. Three weeks of targeting Ukraine's electricity network is pushing the power grid towards a tipping point. No doubt more of this to come. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

First, they were asking repeated questions about why other rationales wouldn't be enough to create diversities at college campuses aside from affirmative action.And then they also ask the question, when is enough enough when it comes to affirmative action. In particular, Chief Justice John Roberts as well as justices, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, they asked if maybe there might be a time to sunset affirmative action. You know, Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, has been outspoken throughout his time at the Supreme Court against racial remedies in any scenarios. And today, he pointed the question about when it might be time to end affirmative action. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
