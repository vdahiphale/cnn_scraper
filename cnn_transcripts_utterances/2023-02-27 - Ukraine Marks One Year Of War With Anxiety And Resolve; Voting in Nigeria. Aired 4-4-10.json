Zelenskyy told his army they would be the ones to decide whether Ukraine will exist in the future or not. But one year after Russia`s invasion, few doubt that Ukraine`s fate hinges in no small part on the man who emerge as an effective war time leader. JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  The man has a spine. And obviously when you are truly David fighting Goliath, if you don`t have a spine, you lose. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  Twelve months later he is the hard bitten leader. I mean, he has been through a year of trial like no other leader.",

Nigeria with around 220 million people is the most populated country in Africa. And up next, we`re headed to Nigeria, the country is Africa`s largest democracy and its people are voting to elect their next president and vice president. The election comes at a time when two-thirds of the population are living in poverty and almost half of the young people are unemployed the value of the currency there is low while inflation is high and violence and terrorism have reshaped everyday life across the nation. We`ll hear now from CNN international correspondent Larry Madowo as Nigerians are making their voices heard in one of the country`s most competitive and unpredictable elections in quite some time.

What do you have back there is they hold up a ballot one by one, everybody watching has to agree that that`s the person that they voted for and so that will take a while -- which is why we can`t predict exactly when the results will be known. The independent National Electoral Commission says they will do it speedily it might be a couple of days until we know. There were a few reported instances of violence and parts of Lagos and other parts of the country. But these are isolated. It`s not a pattern that we can see at least apparently. There were also at least polling stations where voting didn`t take place because of insecurity and security has been a major issue for voters in this election. But the election is taking part in the backdrop of a major fuel and cash shortage. It`s led to some chaotic scenes at gas stations and at banks and now whoever becomes an expression of Nigeria has to deal with an economy on the verge of crumbling there are people running, but only three men have a realistic chance of becoming the next president of Africa`s most populous nation. During election is a massive logistical nightmare. Ninety-three million registered voters is more than the next 14 West African nations combined. So it`s sort of like organizing election for an entire subcontinent in just one day, and that`s why at this location for instance, two of the polling stations there were no votes happening and they don`t understand why but people we spoke to told us that we wait for as long as it takes because they want to make a statement in this election.
