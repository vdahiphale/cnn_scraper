      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN's special coverage of former President Trump's criminal hush money trial. Courts is now in recess for a little bit longer.Tabloid executive, David Pecker, will be back on the stand in minutes. But before the break -- they took a lunch break a little while ago -- prosecutors were trying to re-establish David Pecker's credibility after the defense exposed some small inconsistencies in Pecker's statements. I want to bring in jury consultant, the president the Decision Analysis, Richard Gabriel. Richard, thanks so much for joining us. There was a moment today where Trump attorney, Emil Bove, drilled down on David Pecker's 2018 interview with the FBI and some inconsistencies between notes from that interview and Pecker's current testimony emerged. How do inconsistencies like that weigh in a jury as they look at a case? RICHARD GABRIEL, JURY CONSULTANT &amp; PRESIDENT, DECISION ANALYSIS: Well, I think it's more about how the jury already has viewed the witness, whether they feel that he's been authentic and sincere and straightforward with them. If they feel that he's been kind of a little bit shady in some of his answers, even on the direct testimony, they don't particularly like him, then they can see those inconsistencies as really key to credibility problems. But a lot of times, we do focus on sort of minor points and whether that really does it. And sometimes, it's a forest for the trees-type of issue. The jury is really looking at, well, what does this really say? Is this really a bad conduct here? What does it really say about the witness? These small inconsistencies tend to not have that great an impact unless there's sort of a big blow to the witness' credibility. So I'm not sure it's going to have a tremendous effect at this point.",

The credibility is one thing, but I think one of the things they are trying to establish here is just, again, trying to normalize the behavior.So as opposed to saying he's not necessarily credible, they're saying, look, this is something, and it's one of the primary arguments that the Trump team I think is making in the case, which is this is just politics. This is not necessarily a criminal conduct. And I think he's hoping to reach some of the jurors on here. This is why jury selection can be so important. Because you've got two lawyers, two engineers, people in wealth management, and whether they're going to interpret this testimony to really say, OK, is this actually illegal versus just politics as usual.",

I mean, it -- what the defense always hopes is that they can take over the case at that point, because obviously the prosecutors control the evidence and the flow of the facts at that point.And so it is an opportunity for the defense attorneys to sort of try to take back control, try to reestablish some of their themes, try to impugn the credibility of the witness, try to score a few points. But ultimately, it's -- they have to make a judgment call in terms of how strongly do you then want to highlight the witness' testimony? Because the more time and energy you put into cross-examining that witness, also it can tend to highlight some of those things or the witness can do very well. And so it's a judgment call for a lot of attorneys, do I stand or do I get out and cut my losses?",

So jurors' attention is at its highest on the first witness.Opening statements are critical because they sort of established the story that both sides are trying to tell. And the first witness sort of -- it's kind of, OK, how is the evidence going to support either the prosecution's case or the defense's case. So they're tracking it very closely. You've got very smart people on this jury who clearly want to pay attention. So I think obviously they're very keen on trying to figure out, what does this witness mean? If this goes on for weeks and weeks and weeks, you may see some of their attention wain. And also, I think both sides have to be careful because sometimes redundancy can tire a jury out and they can kind of go like I kind of got the point here and they want to move on.

He probably is measuring that the fact that the jury, if they're following their instructions, are not becoming aware of Trump's out-of-court statements and attacks on witnesses and the jury itself. But rather, they want to -- judges want to move their cases along because juries do get tired. And so that's I think his main focus. I frankly thank he's going to have to say something very soon because he's giving Trump too much leash to just continue to violate without any sanction.",

Donie looks at how conspiracy theories and online misinformation are tearing some Americans apart and effecting potentially the upcoming presidential campaign. Let's discuss with Donie O'Sullivan. He's joining us right now. Donie, I know you spent a lot of time with the Trump faithful. What did you learn? O'SULLIVAN: Hey, Wolf. Yes, that clip we just played there for you is Derrick Evans. He is a -- he was convicted and served three months in prison for his role in January 6th, and he is now a primary -- a Republican primary candidates in West Virginia for the U.S. House. We actually spoke to him on the three-year anniversary of January 6th, back -- back just a few months ago. And it was at a church in Florida where he was speaking with the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene. And this is what we're kind of seeing across the country is the use of Christianity, specifically, what is now known as Christian Nationalism, and this melding of conspiracy theories, a kind of warped sense of what it means to be an American and just seeing -- seeing this all play out. So really what we're trying to show in the \"Misinformation\" documentary that's airing on Sunday really is just all the forces, the ideas that maybe we once thought were fringe. They are false. But they're no longer fringe. I mean, I think about a third of Americans, a third of all Americans don't believe that Joe Biden was legitimately elected president in 2020. And something like a quarter of Americans believe that -- falsely, that the FBI staged or had a hand in the January 6th attack. So really what we're trying to show here is that this stuff that is happening on the dark corners of the Internet and podcasts and everywhere else, it really is affecting the American political mainstream.",
