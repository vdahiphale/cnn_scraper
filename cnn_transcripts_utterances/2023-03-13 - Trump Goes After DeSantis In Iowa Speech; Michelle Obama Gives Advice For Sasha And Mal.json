And of those who poll, Ron DeSantis is the one that kind of keeps pace with Donald Trump the most. But I think it is interesting because Ron DeSantis is taking the opposite approach.

That didn't work out. Okay? So, I think DeSantis, who is kind of stalled in the polls recently, in New Hampshire, Trump is doing much better than he was earlier. So, Trump, even though he's got all of these problems and possibly going to be indicted on a couple of things, maybe even three things, he is still doing quite well in the polls. And he knows how to campaign. Now, DeSantis had a great win for reelection. He won by 19 points. But that is in Florida. I think -- I think you are right.

Both between the book tour and the legislative session -- and we are already seeing this in terms of -- over the weekend, he said that the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank was about, you know, woke ideology, which, you know, again, he will say that as many times as he can because that is part of his mantra.

And the assumption would be, in modern American history, that the running mate would be obviously the incumbent vice president of the United States. And yet we are seeing (INAUDIBLE) conversation that is wondering if that indeed was the case. And we have this brewing issue with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is speaking about Vice President Kamala Harris several months ago. And there was this conversation that she had on a radio. She was asked the question of whether Vice President Harris would in fact be the running mate or should be the running mate yet again. I will remind you what she said, causing a lot of bruhaha. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  I really want to defer to what makes Biden comfortable on his team. I have known Kamala for a long time. I like Kamala. I knew her back when she was attorney general and I was still teaching. We worked on the housing crisis together. So, we go way back. But they have to be a team. My sense is that they are.

People cannot give us a whole long list.That being said, I think you're right. It's untenable to replace her. I also think there's also extra attention on Vice President Harris because our president is up in age. And so, the possibility that he could get sick, he could fall like Mitch McConnell had a fall, anything could happen, and that she would need to step in is more of a reality than I think most vice presidents have had to face that real scrutiny of, do we want this person to run the nation?

There is 20 years of data on this.But the other thing I would say, couple of things. Elizabeth Warren should have known better. She has tried to call twice. She also knows that there are a lot of women in the party who are not happy that she did not have the answer ready to go in that question. Number two, what I would say is we always hear these stories about this time. We have it around Mike Pence, about Dick Cheney, about Al Gore, about Joe Biden when he was vice president. There's always this conversation about should so and so change up the ticket. I'm old enough to done polling in 2020 and saw that America actually likes them as a team.

That was after Texas Senate Bill 8 is passed. That bill is an effective ban on abortion after six weeks.So, here's a direct quote from this lawsuit in which he says, under the law of Texas, a person who assists a pregnant woman in obtaining a self-managed abortion has committed the crime of murder and can be sued for wrongful death. In addition to these three women that he's bringing this lawsuit against, this man says that he intends to file a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the abortion medication. And all these hinges on the details of Texas Senate Bill 8. Here's how this law is set up. Basically, what it does is make anybody liable who performs or induces an abortion in violation of this law, knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion, intends to engage in the conduct described by Senate Bill 8. And notably, the damages here could be significant because there's a floor for the damages. They have to be at least $10,000. This man is seeking damages of more than $1 million. And basically, what he's doing is looking at everybody along the timeline here from manufacturer to the women who helped -- he says helped his wife actually undergo this abortion. He says that they are all similarly liable here under the Texas law. This is certainly a case to watch because again, it will solidify under the Texas law, at least, how many people and the type of people, really, this web of liability, the type of people who would be civilly liable for an abortion in Texas, Laura.",

They're bringing in this notion of homicide or murder or, you know, fetal life or whatever it might be, which -- that's a broader legal strategy far beyond this one case.The other thing is that the attorney bringing the case is the former state, I believe, solicitor general, who helped craft the legal strategy behind it.

And as we've learned by the other case in Texas, those five women, horrendous stories. Women whose lives were in danger. This issue is not going away.

Again, we're talking about a friend being sued who said, if you need to come to my house to have a place to take the medication and I'll take care of you, now she's being sued and charged with homicide. That's what the conversation is going to be about and it's not going to play well nationally because we saw what happened in the midterms. We saw how abortion played out nationally.
