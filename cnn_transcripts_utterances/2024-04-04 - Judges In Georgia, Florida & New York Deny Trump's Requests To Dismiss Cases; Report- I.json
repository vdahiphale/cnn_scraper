      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextMajor losses for Trump tonight. A judge denying yet another attempt to get his Georgia election case tossed out, as the judge Trump appointed in Florida rejects his bid on paper. But is she actually handing Trump a big win? Plus, Biden gives Netanyahu an ultimatum. This as the parents of the American citizen killed in the IDF strikes speak to OUTFRONT. Why they believe their son was targeted, and the questions they have tonight. And standing up to Elon Musk. An Arizona election official taking down a conspiracy theory that Musk promoted about election fraud to 63 billion people. And he took it down point by point. He's my guest tonight to show why Musk is wrong. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a ruling against Trump. The judge in Trump's Georgia election interference case rejecting Trump's attempt to throw the entire case out, just completely dismiss it. Now, Trump had claimed that the case violated his right to free speech. Judge Scott McAfee having none of that writing, quote: The defense is not presented nor has the court been able to find any authority that the speech and conduct alleged is protected political speech. And so, that means Trump is on track to go to trial in Georgia as soon as August, if the district attorney there, Fani Willis, has her way. So that means two trials will be in progress or done by Election Day because, of course, just 24 hours ago, the judge in the hush money case in New York also rejected Trump's latest delay attempt keeping that trial on track for start next week. But the news tonight out of Florida on Trump's Mar-a-Lago documents case is a bit more complicated. When you look at the headline, it looks like a defeat for Trump because Judge Aileen Cannon also rejected one of Trumps request to have that case tossed. But that rejection is just the surface headline. Cannon actually handed Trump a victory by allowing him to continue you with an argument of defense that is not relevant. It's basically spurious to the case. But the former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb says that this ruling by Cannon would, quote, permit an acquittal where none is warranted. Ty will be with me in just a moment. This is all why Cannon's ruling though today could have been a very big victory for Trump. And once again, he saw it that way. He complimented her as he unleashed an attack on the special counsel Jack Smith. Trump today writing, quote, that Smiths should be sanctioned or censured for the way he is attacking a highly respected judge, Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over his fake documents hoax case in Florida. He's a lowlife, he's nasty, rude, and condescending and obviously trying to play the ref. There's a lot to cover tonight. I want to start with Paula Reid, though. Paula is OUTFRONT in Washington. And it appears that Trump has two big losses today, but that isn't really the case, is it?",

Look, we said in a moment times, their number one strategy right now is to delay all of these criminal cases as long as they can. If Trump's reelected, you know, the federal cases dismissed the state-level cases stalled.And each motion, each hearing helps to push these cases back. Let me tell you, Judge Cannon down in Florida, she still has eight motions to dismiss sitting on her desk, in addition to several other issues, including setting a trial date in Georgia and Florida. Yeah, they lost their motions to dismiss, but I will remind everyone, there's no firm date for either one of those cases on the calendar. Fani Willis would like to start in August, but after the efforts to disqualify her push at that case back, that seems really pretty optimistic. And in Florida, the judges also allowing Trump to possibly use this argument that he had the right to bring classified documents homes, there was personal documents as a defense in trial, something the special counsel has strenuously objected to. Now, Erin, in terms of this long game, I'm told, look, even if eventually there are trials, if there are convictions, there are also thinking about appeals. And the hope is that each one of these motions, each one of these hearings helps them build a record that they could eventually use to appeal and kill any convection in a death by 1,000 cuts.",

And that not only should Trump lose the motion to dismiss the Presidential Records Act considerations, and it should be completely withdrawn from the case. Instead, she issues -- instead of citing a single one of those cases where the authority is very compelling. She issues a two-and-a-half page ruling that doesn't include a single citation. And then she has the hubris to suggest that Jack Smith demanded these jury instructions. She's the one who demanded the jury instructions. That's what provoked Smith's response. He didn't demand anything. He just -- he asked as he was required to do that, she rule on this issue prior to trial, he's entitled to a ruling on this issue prior to trial. This ruling actually does give him a basis to mandamus her if he so chooses.

Hyping it because the shares have plunged, the company said it lost over $58 million last year. I mean, it's barely even been public.The stock today down another 5 percent, despite multiple rants from Trump, including in part, quote, all the competitors to Truth Social, especially those in the radical left Democrats Party who are failing at every level, like to use their vaunted disinformation machine try and convince people. And it's not easy to do that. Truth is not such a big deal. I think Truth is amazing. First of all, this is the crucial part, and it is very solid having over $200 million in cash and zero debt. OUTFRONT now, Dan Alexander Forbes, senior editor. And, Dan, a lot of people are looking at this closely. We're going to see where the story goes, because this isn't -- this isn't your normal company that suddenly goes -- goes public and goes through the rigor and scrutiny of the legal process prior to that. It was done a bit differently. So, let's just start with what Trump is saying here. He's saying it's solid $200 million in cash, zero debt and you say?",

So, now, they've apparently lost a lot of that because that SPAC incurred significant amounts of expenses and legal expenses to try to take this deal public.Secondly, Trump's company was also taking on major debt because it wasn't making any money. But the way that he was taking on debt was he was taking notes that would convert to equity at huge discounts. So, ultimately, what you're looking at for the retail shareholder is that you have less cash than you would've expected and you have more shareholders, diluting everybody else except for the insiders who got in early.",

This post suggests that more than 220,000 undocumented migrants could have registered to vote in the state of Arizona without a photo ID this year alone. This year alone. So, what, April 3rd, 4th, whatever it is today, let me check. April 4. Okay, 63 million people viewed this repost by Musk. And Musk, addition to the 220,000 claim was, quote, extremely concerning. Well, the most concerning thing about this whole thing is that 63 million people saw it and it is not true. This is according to the top Republican official and Arizona's largest county, who pushed back in a lengthy rebuttal point-by-point. Of course, on X, the platform where Musk posted this to begin with. Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer is OUTFRONT. And, Stephen, I'm glad to talk to you. So, it's your post that I saw going through a point-by-point because, of course, I saw Elon, 220,000 illegal migrants voting -- registering to vote in Arizona in the past three months in anybody's job will go to the floor. So let's go through it -- 220,000 is nearly four times the number, total number of voters who registered and all of Arizona this year, four times. So that number is totally off. Can you explain? STEPHEN RICHER (R), MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA RECORDER:  Yeah. So this isn't as complicated as the previous segment. There's no complex investment schemes here. There's just an allegation of 220,000 illegal immigrants registering to vote in the past three months, we only have 4 million registered voters in Arizona total. And for all of 2024, we've only had 60,000 new registries. And so, we keep track of all of these things, and this is just what are those instances in which I would ask people's spidey senses to be a little more alert and say, is that just pulling on my emotions, saying 220,000 illegal immigrants registered to vote in the last three months?

And you noted this, right? So obviously the Musk repost did not get to this level of nuance, but you did. You in your rebuttal, you said there about 30,000 registered voters in Arizona total, right? Not registered this year, but total, who wants something called a federal only list, which means that they have come to you and said they're U.S. citizens, but have not provided documents to prove it.
