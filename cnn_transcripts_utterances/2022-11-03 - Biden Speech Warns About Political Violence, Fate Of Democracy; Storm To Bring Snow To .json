That source says that the ICBM likely failed mid-flight with the failure occurring after it's successfully separated at the second stage before failing or -- excuse me -- falling into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. That means that this ICBM possibly failed in the third and final phase when it's supposed to reenter the atmosphere and strike its target. Now the South Korean government sources says that the ICBM tested was likely Hwasong-17. The country's most advanced weapon to date that was last tested this past March. Now, this most recent series of missiles fired by North Korea shouldn't come as a surprise after the country's foreign ministry warned of more powerful follow up measures earlier this week if the United States doesn't stop its, quote, \"war exercises around the Korean Peninsula,\" a request that has been ignored by the United States and South Korea. On Monday, Vigilant Storm, a joint large scale exercise involving hundreds of aircraft and thousands of service members from both the U.S. and South Korea got underway and was extended indefinitely as a result of the recent launches from North Korea, meaning that there could be an even stronger response from Pyongyang coming, Christine.
