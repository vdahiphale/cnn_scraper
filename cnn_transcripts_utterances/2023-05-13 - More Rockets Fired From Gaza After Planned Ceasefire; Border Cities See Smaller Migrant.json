I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin in the Middle East where a ceasefire between Israel and Islamic jihad was supposed to go in effect an hour ago but a CNN producer on the ground there says more rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza after the agreed upon time. The IDF also continued blaring sirens warning of incoming fire. For days now we have seen attacks like that one right there in that dramatic video. This is an Israeli airstrike on Gaza where at least 33 people have reportedly been killed over the past few days since Wednesday. Palestinian forces have fired over 1200 rockets toward Israel in response. And CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us now from Jerusalem. Ben, what more do we know about the ceasefire?",

People in the street celebrating the end of this current round, this last round of strike and counterstrike between Islamic jihad and Israel. Now, we understand that the ceasefire basically has three basic points, ceasing the fire, that seems to have gone into effect, stop the targeting of civilians and stop the targeting of civilian homes. And we've just got in a statement from the head of the Israeli National Security Council who said that as far as Israel is concerned, quiet will be met with quiet. This is oftentimes the formula that ends these rounds of strike encounters so it seems to be holding at the moment. Now, this is really in line of what we've seen, basically over the last three years, it has happened every year, this sort of round of violence, and it has come to an end, but there's no question that there will be another round, perhaps a few months, perhaps a year from now, but a pattern has been established and until there is a lasting peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, I think we can expect more to come, unfortunately, Jim.",

That's exactly what authorities had initially expected ahead of the expiration of Title 42 but instead a less chaotic situation than we've seen on the ground here for the last 48 hours. One official at a facility here that's offering shelter to some of these asylum seekers after they're released from federal custody or at least after being processed, using the word manageable to describe the situation here.But of course as you also point out a little while ago, there are a lot of different factors here. There are still many people on the Mexican side of the border, still weighing all of their options so if they choose to come across and that does have potential to increase their numbers as federal officials fear, but then there's also the other factor, the rate of release as federal authorities are deciding what happens to those close to 23,000 people still in CBP custody. Are they deported back south of the border or are they released and allowed to continue on their way? So that really goes to the point of this is certainly not over yet, in fact, far from it. The other concern is certainly for some of the American cities across the country here, cities that have been seeing an influx of asylum seekers after they're released from federal custody, allowed to settle into some of those communities and wait out their asylum process. The question, though, as you and I have discussed at length here for the city of New York, what happens to well over -- to 16,000 asylum seekers that have been processed through the homeless shelter system in the last year. Many of these people still lack the ability to work legally, so there's still many factors at play here but in terms of the now, I can tell you that at least here in El Paso not only federal officials but also those that are providing shelter for some of these asylum seekers temporary shelter saying that the number is manageable. But the projections coming from senior CBP officials is that instead of about 9,000 encounters that number could go up to 4,000 in the days or weeks ahead. We'll have to see if we reach that point.",

Polo Sandoval, thanks so much.My next guest is a member of Congress representing a long stretch of the Texas border with Mexico. Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales joins us now. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on this afternoon. We appreciate it. Let me get right to what Polo Sandoval was just reporting a few moments ago. At this point we just don't seem to be seeing this massive surge that many were expecting. Why is that? REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): I disagree. I represent 60 percent of El Paso County, 42 percent of the southern border. What I am seeing is folks that are in detention are beyond capacity and I've shared videos and other things. So I like that. What is happening on the ground, though, folks are very anxious, people along the border are very anxious, and American citizens are getting roped up in this. I'll give you an example. I was in El Paso yesterday and I visited the Pasa del Norte Bridge. This is a bridge that about two months ago about a thousand Venezuelans rushed and they had to close that bridge. But one of the things that's happening is Customs and Border Protection is getting prepared for this, if there's another type of rush. What I'm also hearing is the cartels who are the ones that are controlling these routes are trying to figure out what the next step is, so it's kind of this cat and mouse game, if you will that's happening. Meanwhile, more and more people are getting built up on the Mexican side of the border. I urge the Biden administration to work with myself and others to come up with a tangible solution on how we get out of this crisis.",

But what is happening is that is building up as they figure out what's the next route. This goes away when the administration works with Congress on two things, one, these repatriation flights, getting people back to their country of origin, and two, surging immigration judges to the border. This is America. People need to get their cases heard in days, not years, and then long term I'd like to have the administration acknowledge, you know, working with Congress to have an immigration reform system. I'm committed to doing that, but I'll tell you, Jim, it's very difficult to find partners that want to get out of this crisis, if you will.",

What I'm also seeing, though, too, is this crisis doesn't just end at the border. You're seeing what's happening in New York, in Chicago, Denver, other places.So I think now is an opportunity where we can sit down as adults, come together and have real tangible solutions. Enough with the finger pointing. It doesn't matter how we got here, how do we solve this? The reality is nine out of 10 people that are seeking asylum aren't going to qualify for asylum, so you're going to have a generation of people that are going to have to live in the shadows and in large cases, the Biden administration is making it harder for immigration reform.

I think the next step is how do we in a bipartisan manner visit it and, look, we just had -- just earlier this week there was a migrant child that died in HHS custody. This is only the second time in the history of our country where we had someone die in custody.We all should be outraged with this. Once again not about the finger- pointing but just how do we protect people regardless of their legal status. So I'm committed to doing that. I'm also working on legislation. I think work visas makes a lot of sense and you'll see kind of me build a coalition, if you will, of folks that want to tackle that. But I need the White House's help.

I'd like for us to get away from that. I mean, you know, these people that are coming over, they shouldn't be political pawns, if you will, but they need to get their day in court and if they do not qualify for asylum because many of them don't, they're here for economic purposes, they're not seeking asylum. I also think, what about the people that are fleeing political and religious persecution? Those folks that do have legal claims are getting roped up in this as well.

He's talked about doing payments. He hasn't started those. He's talked about video and content. None of those have materialized. So he has to get revenue in the door and advertising is the easiest way to do it. And she is a very strong candidate in that regard. And again, you don't -- if you're a big brand, this -- Twitter was never good for advertisers and now it has to be better than never very good and it's much worse. And that's the problem she faces.

We're poring through court documents, and what they are detailing here is a history of violence.Before her murder, Gabriella Gonzalez, she apparently told police that Thompson, Harold Thompson, beat her up multiple times. And, in fact, during the shooting, there was an active warrant against Thompson for family violent strangulation. This is due to a March incident where he told police then that Gonzalez was, in fact, pregnant with his child. Now, on Wednesday, Dallas police, they rushed to the scene of a parking lot, a gas station after receiving a 911 call of a shooting. And there on the ground, they found 26-year-old Gonzalez dead. They then looked through surveillance video and that is when they saw Thompson and Gonzalez walking together. And at one point, Thompson attempted to put Gonzalez into a chokehold. She shrugged it off. And in the surveillance video, police detail seeing him pull out a gun and shooting Gonzalez in the head. And when she fell to the ground, he then continued to shoot. The witnesses heard that shooting, including Gonzalez's own sister. Extremely disturbing there. Now, I want to show what a piece of the arrest warrant had to say, including, quote, \"Further investigation revealed that Gonzalez went to Colorado to get an abortion and returned the night before,\" before the shooting. It is believed that the suspect was the father of the child. The suspect did not want the complainant to get an abortion. Now, Texas is arguably one of the most aggressive abortion restrictions in the nation. Meanwhile, Colorado, one of the most permissive states when it comes to abortion access. In this case, Thompson has refused to give a statement to police. A judge has denied him bond for two offenses, including murder and assault of a familial and household member.
