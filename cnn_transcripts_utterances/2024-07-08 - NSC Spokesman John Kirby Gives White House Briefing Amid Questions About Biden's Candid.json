Was because all these strikes today came during daylight hours around about 10:00 a.m. The mayor of Kyiv said people would have been going to work. There we're 38 missiles. Some of the hypersonic high-speed missiles. There were cruise missiles. There were ballistic missiles. All of these, all of these are highly precise precision missile systems.
