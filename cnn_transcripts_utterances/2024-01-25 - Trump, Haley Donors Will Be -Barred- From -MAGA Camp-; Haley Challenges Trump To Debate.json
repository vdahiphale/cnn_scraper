      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, bring it Donald. That's Nikki Haley's message to the former president as she taught the obits certain Republican nominee and ignores calls to drop out. His behavior leaves little mystery in how much she is getting under his skin.Plus, Trump is back at a regular campaign stop. The courtroom as a jury weighs how much he needs to pay in damages after being found liable for defamation and sexual abuse. The question everyone is asking right now was will we take the stand? And still pushing Bidenomics. President Biden is hitting a key swing state today, trying to convince voters that the economy is strong and that his policies are the reason why. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, Donald Trump wants Nikki Haley out of the Republican race for president. She says, she's not going anywhere. So, Trump is using a familiar tactic, bullying. The former president is insulting his last rival standing, threatening to blacklist her donors that came right after Haley announced to her campaign raised more than a million dollars in less than 24 hours after her New Hampshire loss. And Trump's election night speech that was more grievance march then victory lap. Last night, Haley was back in her home state of South Carolina, which votes four weeks from now and she was defiant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum. He pitched to fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does. But I know that's what he does when he's insecure. I know that's what he does when he is threatened, and he should feel threatened. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, you know, Nikki Haley, they're saying that Donald Trump feels threatened. When I'm talking to a senior advisor, they don't know that threatened is the right word, annoyed, angry, as you said she's clearly underneath his skin. He is angry that she didn't drop out. And I'm told that he was angry that she had a victorious tone in her speech in New Hampshire after she lost Donald Trump by double digits.The facts are that in South Carolina, which is the next competition that they're going to face often, they do believe that Donald Trump has a significant lead. And just to kind of break down what we saw. When they were threatened by Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, they poured millions of dollars into television ads. They enact event after event after event. So far, we have seen no announcements for events for Donald Trump in South Carolina and $0 in spending. So, if it's a threat, it's definitely not the same reaction that they had when she was closing in on the polls in New Hampshire. However, he is angering -- he is angry, and he is lashing out. And what's almost kind of comical in some ways about this social media posts that says that anyone who donates to Nikki Haley will be blackballed from MAGA world. There's a very big difference between what they did with Ron DeSantis, saying if you work for Ron DeSantis, you can't come work for us. And when you're talking about donations and money, because the people who run Donald Trump's campaign and pay the bills on Donald Trump's campaign would like to see that money come in. So, the idea that some big dollar donors are, you know, blacklisted seems a little bit questionable. Particularly, we just heard Tim Scott yesterday saying, the quiet part out loud, that they hoped the donor money came in after South Carolina. They'd hoped it came in after Iowa, hoped it came in after New Hampshire, hopes to come in now. So clearly, that seems a little bit off in terms of you're going to really turn down that money if it comes.",

We've seen some of it. They believe just on the issues, immigration and social security and you're saying that there's more to come. I just want to read something that caught my eye from Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa. She didn't endorse but she was very vocal in her praise for Nikki Haley when she was out with her on the campaign trail. She was asked this is according to Igor Bobic who brough the HuffPost, about Trump making fun of the dress that Nikki Haley was wearing on that night, asked about Trump making comments about Haley's fancy dress last night in Iowa. This yesterday, Ernst said, I thought she looked great, which is a bit of a mic drop. And I think she said -- Joni Ernst said so much in that one sentence, telegraphing a lot of different things about the way that a lot of people on Capitol Hill are proposed, which we'll talk a little bit more about later by preparing for the whole Trump of it all once again.",

And you know, defense attorneys in this case want Willis and Wade and those around them to testify on the stand in this hearing that schedule for next month.

And that Willis benefited financially from that relationship and Wade's employment on her team. As you know, this investigation into Donald Trump and his co-defendants was unfolding over the course of two years. And look, this isn't an escalation. This is a setup of potential where -- as you know, these hearings are live streamed on camera. And the potential for Fani Willis is to have to take the stand and essentially defend herself against these allegations, which have not been substantiated with any sort of hard evidence yet but have really been a distraction in this case so far. Look Fani Willis is expected to fight this. She's already fighting a subpoena in Wade's divorce case that's separate from this.
