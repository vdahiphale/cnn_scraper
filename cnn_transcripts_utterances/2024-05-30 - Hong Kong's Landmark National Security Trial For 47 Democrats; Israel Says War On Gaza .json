We've watched hundreds of people show up to witness the proceedings, including diplomats from the United States as well as the European Union. And there was that moment in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. There were family members of the defendants who cried out openly in court. This has been a long and drawn out legal ordeal that dates back to more than three years, back it was January 2021 when 47 of these pro-democracy figures were arrested in a dawn raid. They were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, which is a very serious crime under the National Security Law here in Hong Kong. It's punishable by up to life in prison. They are accused of orchestrating and participating in an unofficial primary vote that authorities here had deemed illegal, not the National Security Law. It was imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020. And it was in response to the 2019 massive anti-government protests. And critics say that this law has effectively dismantled the opposition. It has crushed dissent. Supporters say it is restored long order with Chinese authorities pointing out it's a matter of national security. And they warned against any foreign interference. But when you talk to observers, they point out that this trial is significant because it is a test of Hong Kong's judicial independence, watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The whole thing is rigged.SCANNELL (voice-over): After nearly four hours of deliberations the jury sent in their first note asking for portions of testimony to be read back from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and former Trump fixer Michael Cohen about a meeting at Trump Tower. Prosecutors say there was a 2015 meeting there between the two men and Trump where Pecker allegedly agreed to be the eyes and ears for Trump's campaign and flag any negative stories to Cohen. There were several other meetings there that Pecker and Cohen testified about during the trial. The testimony will be read back to the jury at the start of deliberations on Thursday. The jury also had a second question before they were dismissed for the day about Judge Juan Merchan instructions. Earlier, he explained that to find Trump guilty, they must unanimously find that he falsified business records with the intent to violate New York State election law promoting or preventing the election of a candidate to public office by unlawful means. The jury does not need to be unanimous about what those unlawful means our. Prosecutors have put forward three theories about how Trump violated election law, a corporate donation or individual contribution exceeding $2,700, falsifying other business records such as Michael Cohen's bank records and tax law violations. As it did during his 17 hours of intense testimony and closing arguments, Michael Cohen and his credibility took center stage. Under our law, Michael Cohen is an accomplice, Judge Merchan said to the jury, even if you find the testimony of Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the defendant solely upon that testimony, unless you also find it's corroborated by other evidence. Cohen, the prosecution star witness and the only person called who could directly implicate Trump testified he spoke to Trump twice to get his sign off just before making payments to Stormy Daniels. He said Trump approved the repayment scheme. Trump's defense painted Cohen as a liar and a thief who could not be trusted out for revenge on his former boss. The judge left the jury to deliberate with these parting words. It is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here it is yours, Merchan said. You are the judges of the facts and you are responsible for deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But I do not think that this one created a very good feeling in Trump and his defense team today because what jurors are asking about is the theme of the prosecution's closing argument earlier this week, which is corroboration.They're saying, tell us about what David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer said to Donald Trump about the catch and kill campaign that was agreed upon to assist Donald Trump's pursuit of the presidency in a Trump Tower meeting, Pecker, Trump and Michael Cohen. And then they asked about several other Pecker contacts, including a direct call with Trump to implement that alleged conspiracy and if the National Enquirer was spending anything of value to benefit the Trump campaign, prosecutors allege they were and the testimony the jurors asked for supports that in the form of David Pecker, then that would constitute one of those unlawful election influence crimes by wrongful means. So, ominous for Trump and somewhat of a vindication of the prosecutors approach of saying, hey, go chronologically here starting with that August 2015 Trump Tower meeting. VAUSE: The other night for the jury was asked Judge Merchan to reread his instructions, which came earlier in the day. And that's where we had this very clear direction about Michael Cohen. The judge told the jury they cannot convict Trump on Michael Cohen's testimony alone, because he's an accomplice. But they can use his evidence if corroborated with other evidence. I also directed the juries to very basic mundane stuff like they must make -- must not make a decision rather based on biases or stereotypes. You know, for the most part, the directions from the judge seem sort of fairly mundane, if you like, there was nothing unexpected or unusual method. This is an unusual trial.

Even if Russian weapons are lower quality an old military adage says that quantity has a quality of its own.

For years, the U.S. relied on decades-old plans like this one in Scranton, Pennsylvania to make artillery rounds. A World War II era defense industrial base that suddenly fell far short.

Now he can communicate not just in one language, but in two, both English and his native Spanish. The team surgically implanted electrodes coupled with an artificial intelligence system on the patient's brain cortex. His neural activity was recorded and then translated into words on a screen. Dr. Edward Chang led this neural implant study, he's a neurosurgeon and co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering and Prosthesis. He joins me now from San Francisco. Congratulations on the outcome here and your achievement because this is another success on what's already been an incredibly successful team in developing these implants. So thank you for being with us. DR. EDWARD CHANG, CENTER FOR NEURAL ENGINEERING AND PROSTHESIS: Yes. Thank you for having me. It's great to be here.",

You develop them essentially, which had been able to translate neural activity into words on a screen. But they'd been limited to just English.So now we have one which is bilingual, so how did you do it? And how did the patient respond to all of this? Essentially in broad brushstrokes, what have you done here that is so significant? DR. CHANG: Yes, thanks. So the way that we did this was basically translating brain activity brainwaves from a series of about 128 sensors that were over the participant's brain covering the parts of the brain that normally are responsible for allowing us to speak. In his particular case, he had a severe stroke that left him unable to speak about 15 years ago. And he's actually had the implant for the last five years. We've been working with him closely for the last five years primarily working on decoding English from the implant whenever he's trying to think of English words. We've been able to make that work. This study is really a new step. We weren't sure that this was going to work initially. Thankfully it did where we were able to use artificial intelligence algorithms that basically translate those brain activity patterns into both English or Spanish words, depending what he was trying to say.",

      "sentences": "So the key here from what I've read and correct me if I'm wrong is it's very complicated and it's fascinating, but the key seems to be this combination of artificial intelligence and predictive modeling and its used by the English and the Spanish modules which are part of the system.And once they decided the most likely first word based on the thought pattern and the neural activity, then next day they try to -- they have a match -- the most likely match is the one which was used. And then \"Scientific America\" explains it like this. They each choose the second word based on not only the neural pattern match but also whether it is likely to follow the first one. So I am would get a higher probability score than I'm not. The final output produces two sentences, one in English, one in Spanish, but the display screen that Pancho, the stroke victim, faces shows only the version with the highest total probability score. So how accurate are these matches and how did that whole predictive model come to be? Who thought of it? DR. CHANG: Yes. Well, this is actually something that we all use. When you're texting on your phone for example, and you've got that auto correct. That's a kind of predictive coding and we built that into this from the very beginning. The trick with this, of course, is trying to make sure that the decoder is actually being sensitive to whether you're trying to speak English or Spanish. And if this was as easy as trying to pick up, you know, one part of the brain that's processing Spanish and the other part that's processing English. That would be relatively easy. In this particular case, in Pancho's case, what we found was the activity was completely overlapping. So essentially, the decoding algorithms A.I. that we used had to be fairly specific to those speech patterns for a given language.",

Well, I think the best way to think about this is the areas that we're tapping into is the part of the brain that's actually controlling the vocal track -- the lips, the jaw, the tongue, the larynx. These are the things that are moving in my mouth to actually give rise to words. And all languages use vocal track movements in order to create words. So were tapping into that. But individual languages actually have different patterns. And so what the A.I. is learning is a specific patterns that are so suited with one language or another when we speak. And its sensitive enough to do that in order to make this accurate.",

I wonder is the danger here in this whole debate that we overlook the developments and the benefits of A.I. out of fear of the downside? DR. CHANG: I think that's definitely a potential danger. I mean there's no question that the kind of things that we're now able to do with brain decoding, neural prosthetics in order to help people who are paralyzed. A lot of what we've shown in this paper actually could not have been done more than five years ago. Now, we're really using things that have only been developed in last couple of years.
