Now, immigration judges have come out saying that this is unconstitutional. The Republican author of the previous version of this bill has said that this is unconstitutional and there's all sorts of calls from immigration organizations, advocacy organizations, rights organizations calling on the governor not to move forward with this or for the federal government to take action to stop SB4, because as you know, the Supreme Court has upheld that immigration is a federal function, and this is the state of Texas taking it into its own hands.

But he is also facing criticism from the right. There are Republicans, particularly in the House, who do not want to give in to the hardline position that they took in passing a much tougher bill with much stricter immigration restrictions that passed their chamber earlier this year. So where does this all go? The - there's still a lot of questions about whether or not a deal can be reached. If it is reached, can it get the 60 votes out of the United States Senate? Can it get a majority of the narrowly divided House? All huge questions, but even if a deal were reached today between a handful of negotiators who are working on this issue, work through the weekend, getting it to - getting it actually drafted on the floor is still a major question.

It appears as though there was a guilty finding on what's called reckless assault. Well, what is that?There's a distinction between intentional assault, which means that it was your intent, it was your goal, it was your aim, it was your objective to assault versus reckless. Reckless is the conscious disregard. It means the jury didn't make a finding that was intentional, but it was sufficiently reckless, right, such that the jury made a finding as to that. The jury also made a finding as to harassment, which is not a crime. It's simply a violation. A violation of law means that it doesn't rise to the level of a criminal offense and just in terms of clarifying the parlance, a misdemeanor offense in New York State is an offense that is punishable by up to a year in jail, a violation punishable by up to 15 days. And so that's what the judge will have to do in sentencing, evaluate whether there's any time at all that is going to be imposed. But that would be certainly the parameters of any sentencing. Not there yet, but when we get there what he'll be facing.",

Now, not everybody at home may know who Jonathan Majors is, but he was on his way to becoming an A-list star had he not been on trial right now, he would likely be campaigning for an Oscar. Earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, he had a film debut called Magazine Dreams. It got rave reviews. He could have been on the Oscar campaign for that.Now, perhaps even more important, he was cast as basically the future star of Marvel's next phase. He was cast as the character called Kang, who is a villain. He had already made his debut in this character, but had not yet debuted in his own film. Marvel was anchoring two films around him. We know that these movies can each make upwards of $1 billion, even $2 billion for one of the most recent Avengers films. So now Disney has a big decision to make, do they keep him, do they not. With two guilty charges, that is going to be very difficult. And I have to tell you, prior to getting this verdict in, I spoke to my sources and people in the industry are saying no matter what the verdict was, this is hard for a company, particularly like Disney, which is family-friendly, to keep someone who has been accused and now found guilty of these charges.",

What's not clear is if they were actually being held at the time that they were shot by Israeli forces or if they had already escaped.But what we are being told by the Israel Defense Forces is that essentially as soldiers were approaching this area in the Shejaiya neighborhood, the three men walked out. They were apparently shirtless. They were waving a white cloth that turned out to be a bed sheet that was - had a very simple plea for help written in what is described as leftover food. It said in Hebrew, \"Three hostages, help.\" But from a distance, the Israeli soldiers apparently viewed these three shirtless men waving a white cloth as such a threat that they opened fire. Two of them were killed instantly. The third was wounded, ran back inside the house, then reemerged once again, waving that white cloth, asking for help, and he was shot and killed. Of course, this raises questions about the combat operations on the ground. If people who are shirtless, waving a white cloth are killed and they turn out to be Israeli hostages, have there been others? We know that the death toll in Gaza is now inching closer and closer to the horrific and staggering 20,000 mark. And yet, Israel says they are trying to target Hamas. It's a very complex situation. They've been uncovering this labyrinth of tunnels, hundreds of tunnels under the ground. One of them revealed to be two and a half miles long, wide enough for a large vehicle like a truck or even a makeshift railroad, tunnels that Israel says are being hidden underneath civilian homes. And they even had a video that they released claiming to be a child's bedroom with one of the tunnel entrances actually underneath a bed that a child was sleeping on. Now, of course, CNN cannot independently verify these videos from Israel, but they're trying to make the case here that they are fighting a war against a terrorist organization that would target the United States as well if they could. They're not fighting against Gaza civilians. They say that Gaza civilians, Boris, are being used by Hamas as human shields.",

This very high-intensity tempo phase, which we have seen, involves a very high density of airstrikes, a lot of raids, a lot of ground forces. Can it be shifted to a lower intensity phase, perhaps by January that would be more targeted and more precise and perhaps more intelligence-driven, going after more senior Hamas leaders. That is something that Secretary Austin really wanted to get a sense from Israeli Minister Yoav Gallant today, as well as the Israel war cabinet. And it's something that he alluded to during the press conference more than once, suggesting that the U.S. has good ideas that it's shared with Israel about how they can make that transition from the current phase to a more narrow and limited one.

They support Hezbollah, just to the north of Israel, and they support the Houthi rebels. And the Houthi rebels are exploiting their power, in effect, there to target shipping and that has enormous effects. It's basically closed down Israel's southern port, which is just on the Red Sea. But it also threatens other shipping going through the Red Sea and on through the Suez Canal, which affects loads of containers. So a lot of commerce going to Europe and elsewhere, but also a lot of oil, and that's the one that really seems to be having an impact right now. And you got U.S. ships there. They're shooting down most of the stuff, but they can't shoot down all of it.
