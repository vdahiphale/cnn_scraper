It is right now moving east across central Florida. The once-in-a-century storm made landfall near Siesta Key with winds north of 100 miles per hour. There have been tornado outbreaks, historic flash flooding, and life-threatening storm surge. You name it this storm has it. I mean, look at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. The wind has been so strong that the roof is now largely torn off. The ballpark was said to be a shelter, a shelter for first responders. Now, thankfully, a local affiliate reports that no one has been hurt. We've got a team of reporters, of meteorologists, all fanned out covering every part of this storm as we enter the midnight hour. I'll begin with you, Anderson, who is live in Bradenton where you have been in the thick of it. And right now we're watching you get thrown by the storm. How are things happening right now? Can you hear us?",

It is now really just pouring up.Take a look at this. This is a tree that has been uprooted. The roots are still -- the patch of ground it was in is still connected. There's actually like a water pipe that's I guess in part of the root system that is now still connected and pouring water out of the pipe but the trees almost completely knocked over. That's been knocked over by the wind. We just noticed this. I'm not sure when that happened. I think it happened pretty, just a short time ago. But I don't know, Phil, if you could pan over here, but look at this water. I mean this is like the ocean and this is the riverwalk in Bradenton. At 9:00 the waves started coming over here but we have not seen anything like this until now. It was up to my ankles about 15 minutes ago, I would say. It's now, I mean, with these waves it's up to my knees almost, just below my knees. And now this water is really, really coming on shore in bigger and bigger waves. So I don't know if this is a gust, and maybe it's good to check in with Chad Myers to see if this is just, you know, a band of the storm, but I'm really surprised to see the amount of water that is now coming ashore when it seemed like an hour ago that the winds have kind of died down but the water certainly has not died down -- Laura.",

And then what Anderson is seeing is the backside of the eye, which is supposed to start calming down, but it's certainly hasn't. What Anderson has experiencing, and you have to kind of follow the lines of the rain, when you follow the lines of the rain, Anderson is right there under the A in Palmetto.So the wind is blowing off the ocean all the way in a straight line and into that river walk. That's why we're getting that significant surge there. For all day long the wind has been blowing the water out of Tampa Bay. And now, because we're going to switch it because now the eye is that way, now the wind is going to blow the water back into Tampa Bay. We're not going to get six to nine feet, but we will get maybe two to four because now as the wind moves away, changes direction, we start to push that water up there. So St. Petersburg just had a wind gust to 82. So this is far from being done. Tampa just had a wind gust to 78. I think a big story here is how much rain has fallen. Everywhere that you see purple through here, that's 10 inches of rain or more. And we know St. Pete had 16 inches of which eight fell in two hours. Five hours, five inches in one hour, three inches the next hour, and then it kind of slowed down a little bit. But there is significant flooding going on here in Lakeland, especially farther inland because it doesn't have a chance to just wash back into the ocean. So it is going to be a flooded mess to the east of Tampa and probably as far east as Orlando, too. Right now, the latest advisory just came in. We're down to 100 but you can see what 100 just did to Tampa and what it did to Bradenton and Anderson Cooper standing right there.",

These folks that came out during the storm in the early initial phases of the storm trying to take selfies and that sort of thing. Officials have been warning about doing that kind of thing ever since the storm indicated, since forecasters prognosticated that the storm was headed in this direction. They were asking residents to shelter in place. They were asking folks that were in evacuation zones to get out. Fortunately, it appears that most of them especially along the barrier islands, Treasure Island where I was yesterday, most of them did, but there were still some folks that wanted to stay behind. One of them was a gentleman that was on a boat in Tampa Bay and he decided to ride out the storm there. I'm hoping we get good news about him -- Laura.",

You know, we often have these hurricanes and you see them coming, they go parallel to the coast. They hit south of us or they hit north of us, but, you know, this -- Sarasota was from the beginning slated to be hit and that has been the case in the past. And it's never really happened, and this is really quite shocking for all of us and it comes on the heels of Hurricane Helene, and so I think for a lot of our residents we're still shell-shocked from that and now this hitting us is quite serious and as your reporter said earlier we'll see a daybreak.

But I think as your previous reporter had said there are folks who would still go out and, you know, take this as a game and it's not a game. It's not a sport and it's something that we all need to take very, very seriously. As far as damage goes, for the moment we're not having any reports of anything serious that we know of. I know we've had, like I said, some flooding. We've had power outages. We've had very fierce winds that have taken down trees and power lines. But, you know, at the moment, you know, the city of Sarasota, at least our team, is ready to go. As soon as it's safe, we're going to send in our first in tactical team to assess the damage and make sure the streets are safe because folks are going to want to get back to their homes, those who evacuated. And we think a large portion of our city did evacuate. We're not sure, it's pretty anecdotal, but we want to caution our citizens to please wait until they get the sign from the city of Sarasota that it is actually safe to be on those roads.

There is a danger there. So, people need to be very, very vigilant, continually. Hurricane Milton has made landfall. It has triggered tornado outbreaks all across Florida. And this -- this large tornado crossing over I-95 on the Eastern side of the state was one of at least 17 tornadoes reported. More than 110 tornado warnings have been issued across the state. And sadly, we have now learned that multiple people have been killed. I want to bring in Sheriff Keith Pearson, sheriff from St. Lucie County in Florida. Sheriff, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of life in your county. What can you tell us about the victims there? What happened? SHERIFF KEITH PEARSON, ST. LUCIE COUNTY, FLORIDA (via phone): You know, the -- earlier today in the first wave of this storm, Milton, came through. Our area's not used to seeing any kind of tornado activity. We had one tornado pop up. It actually struck our sheriff's office, taking out a 10,000-square-foot red (ph) iron structure that was housing all of our emergency equipment in preparation for Hurricane Milton. Shortly after that, maybe 20 minutes later, all of our alarms have gone off. All the messages came out there. Our deputies reported at least -- visually seeing six tornados on the ground, ripping through our county in the Northern direction, leaving hundreds of homes devastated, completely totaled. And it, unfortunately, struck a retirement community that was mainly modular homes, where we did have loss of life. And we have crews on scene right now, working through the hurricane conditions that we're facing right now, to rescue anybody who's still inside there. I mean, these -- these trailers are just devastated. They're lifted off their foundation. You know, we're not going to get into how many, but I can tell you it's more than one person who's lost their life that we've already recovered. Again, we're focusing right now on getting all of our resources in there to rescue those -- those individuals that could be trapped inside these homes.",

We thought the worst was over as the back end of the storm closes past St. Pete. But it's still got some life. It's still got a lot of kinetic energy. And it's just spreading it all over Pinellas County right now. We got a little bit closer to the fallen crane here in St. Petersburg. There's one of four of them downtown. I think, according to the city, no injuries in this crane collapse. Thankfully. It fell off of this building, this high-rise that's under construction across the boulevard and into lofts on the other side of the street here. Whoa! It is still galing (ph). Spin it around, Carlos. Take a look over here. Let us marvel at the perennial fixture of hurricanes, the disaster tourists, out running around. Look, we're out here to provide information so people know what's happening in their towns and really to avoid this. You don't have to come out here and risk catching a street sign across the back of the head. But that's human nature. They haven't even been cooped up that long, so there's no excuse for that. But this is just one little sample of the physical damage I'm afraid we may be seeing at sunrise, Laura. Between the Tropicana roof getting ripped off. Those are at least the most visual, the most obvious to us right now. But a couple of years ago, the Tampa Bay newspaper did an investigation, \"Tampa Bay Times,\" and found that this county is the most vulnerable in the entire state to flooding. Something like 700 vital buildings are at risk of flooding in a Category 1 storm. Another 400 in a Category 2. This came ashore as a 3, as we know, and it's just a freakish sort of bizarro storm in the amount of water it's carrying and its timing, coming after Helene. So, a lot to go before we get to the bright dawn. Hopefully, clear skies, and people need to be able to assess what's really happened here -- Laura.",

The whole country was focused on that disaster for so long.But now these storms come. And we don't have time to absorb the last one. I mean, the poor -- poor folks in Asheville and all of the devastation of that storm. They need attention, too. They need help. They need linemen trying to get their power on. But now that this has compounded, one after another, it's really going to test resilience, their definition of disaster preparedness. These bigger storms, more frequent -- you know, one after another on an overheating planet, it's sadly sort of a reality now. But this is one of those things, as we heard from other guests tonight, if not for Helene, which had set storm surge records and really rocked people's worlds, you know, Floridians who had ridden out plenty of storms and thought, oh, they never hit here, they -- that probably saved some lives. They got out in this particular case. But in this storm, some people who evacuated the coast -- here you go. Be careful, for crying out loud! People who evacuated the coasts, you know, inland now, have these super cell tornado outbreaks which have already passed through. I think we better find a little bit of shelter.

And this large area of purple -- when we have a small area, yes, that can kind of drain off. But when you cover entire counties in ten inches of rain or more, you are going to get flash flooding. And it is still raining. That's part of the problem. It is still raining. It is still windy. Windy in Orlando. Windy still here in Tampa. Winds coming off the ocean into Palmetto, into St. Pete. We are seeing gusts still around 90 miles per hour. Look at Daytona Beach, 53. Just had a gust to 80 there. Orlando just had a gust to 47. So, the storm has not really given up everything of its energy. And we didn't think that it would. We knew it would likely move all the way across the entire peninsula of Florida and still remain a hurricane. And it is still, according to the hurricane center, a 100 mile-per- hour hurricane still at this hour. Here's the rain that's still going to come. Still, back up to the North of Orlando and all the way off the coast. At least another four to six inches of rain still to come up there. So, what else is going on? Well, we still have the wind onshore. Venice all the way down to Punta Gorda, down to Fort Myers. We do know that that's where the surge happened. Didn't happen in Tampa, because the wind was actually offshore here and onshore here. That's how surge happens. So, we still don't know exactly what happened down there. We likely won't even know until morning when we get some pictures, either some aerials or something on the ground, whether there or was that ten-to- 15-foot surge. It is likely. This storm was a Category 5 for a very long time, building up that surge. And I used this earlier, and my wife kind of told me I was corny. But if you take -- not the first time. But if you take a cup of coffee, you take a cup of coffee and you blow on the top, you're going to see little ripples on the top of your coffee. And they're going to blow to the other side of your coffee cup. And that's what storm surge is. You're just taking wind, and you're blowing little ripples of water, little ripples of water all the way to the coast. And then it hits the coast.
