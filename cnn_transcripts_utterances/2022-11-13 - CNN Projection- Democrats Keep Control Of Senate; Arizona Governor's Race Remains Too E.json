So while control of the U.S. Senate is sealed now, the fate of the House remains a question mark after falling short of expectations in the midterms. Kevin McCarthy's path to become House speaker has become more complicated and some Republican senators are also calling for a delay in the leadership vote before committing to Mitch McConnell as minority leader. For more let's bring in Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona. Melanie, good to see you again. So Mitch McConnell, you know, was hoping to become the majority leader after the midterms. Now he's facing new dissension within the ranks as he maneuvers to try to hold on to the minority leadership role.",

There is a small but vocal group of lawmakers who are pushing to delay the internal leadership elections this week. There's also at least one Republican, Josh Hawley who has publicly said he's going to oppose Mitch McConnell for GOP leader. And what's playing out behind the scenes so far is a blame game. You are seeing some try to point the blame at Mitch McConnell and the head of the GOP campaign arm. There's also attempts to blame Donald Trump because a number of his hand-picked candidates ultimately failed in some of these key Senate races that determined control of the Senate. And so we're going to expect all that to play out even more behind closed doors this week when they return to Washington.",

But if Republicans do win it's probably going to be with a very, very thin margin. And so in that case they do have power. So Kevin McCarthy is going to have to wheel and deal with these members and he's going to have to hope that there is enough of a margin to get him over the finish line. But it is going to be an uphill battle for him. And our Dana Bash asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she thinks McCarthy has it to get speakership. Here is what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

If you don't believe me ask former speaker Paul Ryan, former speaker John Boehner. But I think McCarthy at least is in the pole position because it's for someone else to unseat him. And then as Speaker Pelosi said, we don't even know yet if this is going to be an eventuality. Bigger picture down the road, I think Democrats are cheering this victory. If Democrats had experienced a red wave, you would have started to hear cries for President Biden to think about stepping aside in 2024. I think you'll still hear some of those cries. I think you'll still hear some of those cries but I think you won't hear them right away. I think you'll hear fewer of them.

And the only Republican who really was triumphant is former President Trump's number one rival, Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida. Here's the challenge though, if you are President Trump, why would you wait? Unless there's some chance you are not going to run at all, you may as well pull the shrink wrap off, get the ball rolling, declare your candidacy so that everyone else is challenging you. If you wait for someone like DeSantis to throw his hat in the ring first, now Trump, who is no longer in office, becomes the challenger.

On the other hand you could imagine a scenario where the Trump camp thinks if we go in, have a rally for Walker and then Walker loses, that compounds the problem we already came up with when we didn't get the desired red wave this past week on election day. That would make Trump sort of a two-time loser just in one cycle.So I would say the odds are that they will stay away unless there's a massive push from the Walker people to get him in there. What's different about this time versus the run-off that we had in 2020 is that this is a very compressed cycle, it's a four-week cycle. It's going to happen basically before the holidays. There's no time for either side to waste. It's razor thin and the question is will Republicans who supported Governor Kemp come back and support Herschel Walker or will Democrats knowing that they have a 50/50 split in the Senate and a tie-breaker with Vice President Harris' vote go for the gusto and try to get that 51st vote by re-electing Senator Warnock which would not only give them the slim majority that they had in the past congress but also give them a bigger margin on committees, a bigger advantage in terms of some of the Senate rules, the ability to discharge bills from committee to a floor vote.

Quickly, Fredricka, I should point out as well that Istanbul is no stranger to terrorist attacks, though in the last five years they've been pretty few and far between. 2016 is a year though that people in Turkey don't want to go back to. This is a year of the attempted coup inside the country and some notable terror attacks that took place at some pretty famous sites. One taking place just outside the famous Blue Mosque, for instance, at a nightclub on New Year's Eve. Another one at the airport.

As you noted, this will be the first face-to-face sit-down after five separate video calls and telephone calls over the course of the last two years.But that is something that is very critical to President Biden. His advisers have made clear he's been very frustrated by the fact that so many meetings have been virtual, not just with President Xi because of the pandemic. He believes face-to-face diplomacy is the most critical element of a president trying to operate in such a tense period of time geopolitically. The president making clear earlier today how he views the importance of this meeting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know Xi Jinping. I spent more time with him than any other world leader. I know him well. He knows me. There's no -- we have very little misunderstanding. We have to figure out where the red lines are and what we -- what's most important to each of us over the next two years. And his circumstance has changed, to state the obvious, at home. And so, we're going to have -- we're going to have, I think -- I've always had straightforward discussions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

First is the last one, the fact that it's going to be a straightforward, and according to officials, direct conversation. That is the way the president operates in these types of meetings. It's certainly the strategy they'll be taking into this.And that parlays to some degree into another element that he mentioned there during the statement which is there aren't a lot of misunderstandings between the two sides. That's not necessarily the case. The president pointing out that they need to identify red lines, that they need to sharpen the sense of each side's priorities, really gets at the fact that over the course of the last two years because of the pandemic, because of the direction, the relationship of the two countries, there is not a great sense inside the United States and inside President Biden's team of exactly just where red lines could be. That is such a crucial element of this, not some large reconciliation or some big diplomatic deliverable. But instead, a better understanding of where each side stands, where those red lines are, where, perhaps, their priorities overlap and they can actually work together. If they can achieve that, officials believe like it will be a good step forward. If not, obviously, there's no secret where this relationship stands at this moment -- Fred.",

Now, any one of these can be changed like this watch could go to a warning and could also be expanded later on in the day.

St. Louis, Chicago, all getting in on the snow. The problem is temperatures are not going to rebound. When you look at this map, and this is what's frightening. This goes through next Tuesday, Fredricka. Much below average. You have to get down into southern Florida. One exception, one state is well above average. And that is Alaska. So if you want to get a warm-up, temperatures are actually going to be warmer in Alaska than some of the lower 48.
