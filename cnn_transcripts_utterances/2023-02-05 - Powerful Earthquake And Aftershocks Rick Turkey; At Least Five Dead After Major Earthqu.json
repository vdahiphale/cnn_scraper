For the first three seconds, it was like a light shake. So I thought, yes, maybe it's just one of those light earthquakes that we see normally, we feel normally once every couple of months in Gaziantep. And then like after that, it became so shaky. I was thinking my parent's house, they woke up, they were asleep. They started to shout. I tried to shout to them and stay under the doors, stay under the doors. And I was trying to confer -- like to confront them, like, oh, sorry, I was trying to calm them down, telling them, please be calm. Stay under the door. And I was telling them, like, it's going to be over soon, it's going to be over soon, but it felt like it will never be over. [inaudible] I believe a lot of stuff got broken in my house like furniture, electronics. And then we -- when we get start [inaudible] we run out of the buildings, with all pajamas and slippers literally. And already, there was nearly five centimeters long snow, and we gathered on the ground and it was raining heavily. So stayed out of the building with the neighbors for about 30 minutes. And then I went back to the building got some coats, boots and went back out. Now, my family was staying in a car, in open areas, open space. Electricity is still working. We have water cuts in our neighborhoods, but I think that's not the priority now. And also like we have some difficulties in communication. It has been a little bit over the last hour. We felt -- I counted 11 aftershocks. The strongest one was like 20 minutes after the first earthquake, I believe.

And it's true, they're certainly no strangers to shaking, but of this magnitude, especially this part of Southern Turkey, this is like nothing that anyone alive has ever felt before.The -- you know, with CNN weather here, we're obviously covering earthquakes all over the world, you know, all the time. And when we see one of this magnitude, it certainly gets your attention. We start to look at some of the -- some of the statistics and how they sort of measure up. And, you know, 7.8 earthquake, you only get a handful of those every year anywhere on the planet. You know, most of them tend to occur very deep in the ground. And they're not felt by a lot of people. This one was very shallow, only 17 kilometers of depth, so that's going to be felt by a lot of people. You know, it's farther outside than just Turkey. We -- and we're seeing reports of people feeling this earthquake in Syria, in Israel, and probably even farther away than that, but very close to the epicenter. This would have been extremely intense shaking, the kind that, you know, as we saw in some of these pictures, very capable of bringing down buildings, even some fairly well made structures. But people in this area largely reside in structures that are very vulnerable to shaking, and we see that the USGS, which is where we look for the United States Geological Service, and their network of seismographs all over the world, bringing these measurements and looking back through their records. This would probably tie for the strongest earthquake anywhere in Turkey in the last 100 years or more of records with one back in 1939. So like I said, no one in this area has felt an earthquake like this in their entire life. [22:15:03] And we've already seen numerous major aftershocks, 6.7, 5.6. Those are massive earthquakes on their own, and they occurred just 10, 15, 20 minutes after the major shock. And those are going to continue. They're going to continue for hours. They'll continue for days, you know, following an earthquake, like a 7.8 magnitude. The other thing to mention, you know, this happened in the middle of the night, basically, around 4:00 A.M. local time. Now, we're starting to get a little later in the morning, you know, the sun will be coming up here before long. I think that's going to shine some light on some pretty massive devastation. But it also makes it even more dangerous when they happen in the middle of the night. People, you know, are often asleep, obviously, and cannot get to maybe some structures that are going to fare a little better. So I think, you know, obviously, you said when you let into me, there were obviously some already fatalities reported. And I'm afraid that numbers are likely going to go a lot higher, just based on, you know, historical earthquakes of this magnitude.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, you know, one thing they have to be on the lookout for is more earthquakes, more aftershocks. Generally with a 7.8, you're going to have at least one, maybe two or three earthquakes of 6.0 or greater. Like I said, we are already seeing one. I'm checking right now to see if there's been any more. There was a 5.2 here just within the last 30 minutes. You know, a 5.2 earthquake is a fairly significant earthquake on its own. That's going to wake you if you were asleep. Of course, no one in this area is asleep at this point. But that's how strong the 5.2 would be.When you have it occurring after a major 7.8, things are already shaken up, buildings are already, you know, more vulnerable to falling than they were previous. So each one can just, you know, get a structure that maybe hasn't fallen yet, but it's on the verge or, you know, a floor that's maybe still steady, you could see that fall. And so that's something that first responders have to be very wary of, you know, you hear someone in there, you want to go, you need to go get that person out. They may be trapped, but you have to be aware of your surroundings and know what could be coming at any second, another major aftershock. And they don't -- you know, they do tail off an intensity and frequency over time, but it's by no means linear. So you -- we can easily see another 6.5, you know, in a few hours and even in a few days. So you don't know that things are going to get better from an aftershock perspective. So that's certainly something that first responders they know. And, you know, that's a risk that, of course, you know, they will take to save those that are no doubt trapped in this rubble. HARRAK: And we have since heard from the governor and recording and missing that at least five people have died after this magnitude 7.8 earthquake. And he says that at least 34 buildings collapsed. This is just information just coming in that we're reporting on. And the Reuters is quoting a witness saying that the earthquake lasted about a minute. Wow. If an earthquake that lasts a minute can cause this much damage. I mean, it just goes to your point at, you know, how powerful it is.",

We are still waiting to hear more information about the extent of the damage, but it is not looking good right now, Laila, as we are starting to get more and more information coming from Turkish officials. The interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, a short time ago, speaking on state TV saying that this is their priority right now. The first task is search and rescue, he said. He's describing this as a level four alarm, which includes receiving help internationally.I mean, this is major, Laila. This is a country that has dealt with earthquakes over the years, but a 7.8 earthquake, as we have been reporting, as Brandon there was describing something that no one has felt in this country before, as he mentioned in our lifetime, at least. And we're starting to slowly get more and more information about the extent of the damage felt across 10 provinces in southeastern Turkey. We'll have to wait and see what impact it has had on different cities, different towns across the -- that part of the country. But as we're hearing from Turkish officials, they're describing this as a level four alarm, they are mobilizing their disaster management agencies. Search and rescue right now, obviously, their priority. But as we mentioned earlier, Laila, it is in the middle of the night, this happening at about four o'clock this morning, people asleep. And we are in the middle of this winter storm that has impacted much of Turkey. A lot of that impact as well in southern Turkey over the past few days. Snow -- the rain right now, the winds, this is going to be a very, very challenging search and rescue operation for Turkish authorities who are very experienced in dealing with this kind of situation.

We are hearing from people in Iraq, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in Syria, who have felt the impact of this massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake. So the concern right now, of course, I would assume that aid agencies are going to be right now mobilizing to assess what may have happened in northern Syria, of course, a lot of camps for displaced people in that part of the country in Aleppo Province and elsewhere, which have relied a lot on Turkish support as well. Turkish agencies provide support in there as well. But you would assume right now that they are going to be - when it comes to these Turkish aid agencies, they are going to be dealing with a lot at home. So right now, international aid agencies would have to be looking at the impact in Syria, on these camps as well, where you have people who have nothing really living in shelters like tents in the middle of this winter storm. We've seen video and pictures over the past few days of snow covered IDP camps in that area. And now you have this. So we'll have to wait and see what we hear from international aid agencies on the impact. And the extent of the damage in that part of the country. Of course, the priority is going to be trying to provide support for people across those 10 provinces here in Turkey, as we've heard from the Turkish interior minister, they are going to require international support, as well as assessing the damage and the situation across the border in Syria as well.

We are talking about major cities, but as well, there's going to be a lot of concern about remote villages and towns that have may have also been impacted. So we have to wait and see what Turkish authorities say about the situation.

But imagining this kind of weather that is impacting the country right now, making it very challenging for authorities to deal with what they say is their top priority. Now there's search and rescue as well as the population, the people who are now without shelter waiting outdoors.

And over the past five years, there's been an earthquake that has hit this country or more than one earthquake a year since I've been here, but nothing, nothing on this scale.Turkish authorities, their search and rescue, their disaster and emergency agency, AFAD, has always prepared for the worst and has dealt with some of the -- some major earthquakes over the years. But this appears to be really something that they probably haven't dealt with in decades. I mean, at least from what we are hearing right now. We're still going to have to wait and see what authorities say about the extent of the damage. But early reports that are coming into us, this information that we're starting to get, Laila, it is not looking good. We are talking about at least 10 provinces across southeastern Turkey that have felt this and we are slowly starting to get information emerging from each of these provinces about the damage, the devastation and the, unfortunately, the death toll that is beginning to rise. And this is, again, early hours right now. It is 6:30 in the morning here. It's been less than or just over two hours, around two hours since this earthquake has hit and we are starting to get the information and reports of the extent of damage left by this major earthquake.",

It is always ready to deal with this sort of an event. But again, this is something that -- no matter how prepared you are for something like this, it is going to be very challenging, and it could probably couldn't have happened at a worst time right in the middle of a winter storm that is impacting so many parts of the country. Snow in southeastern Turkey, in several provinces there over the past few days. Heavy snowfall, the rain, the -- you know, this is -- this is going to be very challenging for rescue workers as they begin this search and rescue operation with daybreak here shortly.

But other parts that we're talking about that seem to have been devastated are relatively lower income areas. And as always, this is -- this is a natural disaster, but part of the -- part of the tragedy comes from human error in terms of building construction. And actually, buildings where contractors do not really go with Turkey's building codes, because the truth is in -- after a devastating earthquake in 1999, Turkey had really changed its building laws and regulations and forcing contractors and architects to build earthquake-proof residential buildings, particularly in residential areas, and this was a big focus during Turkey's accession process with the E.U. But these things, you know, when there isn't enough focus, they tend to taper off. There isn't as much -- there hasn't been as much concentration on quality of materials and enforcing building codes over the last five, six years, Turkey is no longer really dead set on its E.U. track. And you also have a country that has a severe economic downturn, which means people are, you know, willing to be a bit less than perfect in construction business. So I think that is a huge part of the problem because you can see in your footage and some of the footage that is coming out, building -- one building standing still, and the next one is entirely gone. And that can only be, you know, a human error, which is why this is so sad. But this part of the country is not the richest part of Turkey. It's a mix. It's also a part of the country, while, you know, that's definitely a warmer climate, the northern parts of Istanbul has been experiencing a cold dry -- a cold front. They have snow in many parts of southern Turkey, in southeastern Turkey. People have to leave their buildings right now. They can't go in. And, you know, when you are -- I don't know if you've ever been in an earthquake, but when you do, you run out of the building, you stay out but you always want to go back in to get your phone or get your wallet or something or maybe some water or you left in a hurry and you're in your slippers or you need a coat et cetera. There are announcements being made, urging people not to go and not to go into pick up because you constantly have, you know, remnants -- smaller tremors continuing and they can be very deadly as well. When we say -- when I say tall -- too small, it's still been in the magnitude of six something over the past hour. So that is a pretty dire situation, even for the standards of -- even by standards of a country that is somewhat used to earthquakes.",

Now, both events occur in another fault, which would called as North Anatolian Fault, and those even pretty significant damage and casualties. So, of course, the size of the event is actually smaller than those two events, but they also occurred in a very popular region. So they don't even actually cause significant damages. I can give you another example, for example, other event with similar magnitudes occurred in [inaudible] in China. That's where I grew up. It's got the magnitude -- 7.9 is the magnitude. It's the Wenchuan earthquake. And I believe that event has up to about 80,000 casualty as well.
