All of this seems to be unfolding across the country with many markets being affected, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, New York, and more, with many people experiencing a loss of signal on their phones, particularly on AT&amp;T.Now, AT&amp;T says it is tracking this issue and working to resolve it. Verizon and T-Mobile say that their networks are operating normally. If you are a Verizon or T-Mobile customer and you're experiencing issues, it's likely because, at least according to these companies, that you're trying to call an AT&amp;T customer who is affected by this issue.

      "sentences": "Kate, sources tell me that White House officials are reviewing an authority in immigration law that essentially allows the president to decide who is eligible to enter the United States. In this context, what the president could do is limit who is able to claim asylum between the ports of entries. In other words, migrants crossing the border illegally could be restricted from claiming asylum.Now, as you mentioned there, this is a move that is reminiscent of the Trump era. In 2018, former President Donald Trump also used this authority to try to block off asylum entirely on the U.S./Mexico border. That was challenged in courts and eventually a federal appeals court blocked it. And now I'm told that lawyers are reviewing this possible executive action to see whether it could stand in the courts if it's different at all. We don't have all the details as to what it will look like, but an administration official tells me it's one of many options that's being considered at the White House and that no final decision has been made. A White House spokesperson also telling me the following, quote, \"no executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected. We continue to call on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border.\" Of course, what the White House is referring to there is that Senate border deal that was worked on by Senate negotiators and White House officials that in part would have given extraordinary powers to the Homeland Security secretary to shut down the border if certain triggers were met. And President Biden, over the course of those negotiations, embraced those tough measures, saying that he would shut down the border if given the authority. And he appears to be doing some of that now. Of course, this also comes during an election year. Former President Donald Trump is making immigration a key part of his campaign. This has been a political liability for President Biden. So, all of that colliding in this moment as the White House considers what would be an extraordinary move if it were to move forward, that would ultimately limit who can claim asylum if they cross illegally.

You know, he started his presidency saying that he was going to be different from Barack Obama and Donald Trump on immigration. He's actually pushed out more executive orders than Donald Trump on immigration because of Congress' failure -- failure to act.But this is a very challenging situation in part because, yes, he will - he will face some headwinds from progressives. But we have all seen how much Republicans are using immigration as a wedge issue in -- in elections. We saw that in New York 3 in the special election with Tom Suozzi.

He could have immediately declared a national emergency to expedite removal of migrants. He could end catch and release policies. He could re-institute Donald Trump's remain in Mexico policy. And the president hasn't done any of those things.Now, I, as a conservative, I'm glad he's finally considering some of these policies. But from a political perspective, John, I think for most Americans, they look at this and it does worry many of them. I think it ultimately leads to a significant level of disintegration culturally and structurally, in part because native Americans see resources being redirected from them to non-Americans. And I would argue my concern here is that that does cause a significant level of concern, anger, and perhaps even resentment towards migrants. And considering the level of tribalism and division in the country with native Americans, it's certainly something that I don't think the political class would want to deal with as well.

And so I think that's important to note because we - we are all immigrants in this country. And what I think the Biden administration is trying to do, and as a child of immigrants I would hope that he does, is stay away from so many of those images that we've seen over the past few years, those Haitian migrants being chased by men on horses with whips, the so-called Muslim ban, if you remember that, and the chaos at our airports for that period of time. It's trying to move away from those draconian measures that have -- that have really haunted so many of us.And I'm going to -- I'm going to, you know, make a concession here. I think whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, this issue could be fixed. This is largely a result of decades of not really tackling it head-on. And here we are today.

      "sentences": "Well, a lot of Republicans, like Comer, are trying to downplay how foundational this 1023 was to moving forward with their impeachment inquiry.But here's just a snapshot of what Republicans have been saying over the course of the last several months about the importance of this 1023. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): This is from the FBI's most trusted, most credible, one of their highest paid informants in the whole bureau. The evidence here is pretty overwhelming that Joe Biden did something for the CEO of Burisma. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: Even a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): The most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible, confidential human source according to U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, the question now is, where does this leave the Republicans impeachment inquiry, their probe, their investigation that has been going on for months. Yesterday, James Biden, the president's brother, sat for a closed door interview with the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees. And after he spoke to investigators. Democrats emerged from that meeting. Jamie Raskin saying it was time to fold up the tent, go home, that this impeachment inquiry was over at this point.Now, Republicans have not said whether or not they are going to move forward with impeaching Joe Biden on the floor of the House of Representatives, but it's really important to point out that there were a number of Republicans who voted to open the impeachment inquiry but said at the time they wanted to see more evidence before they would be comfortable moving forward with a vote to impeach Joe Biden in the House. It's really unclear right now what that evidence is given the fact that after that eight-hour closed door meeting with James Biden yesterday and the Hunter Biden testimony expected behind closed doors next week, there just isn't that direct connection between the president and his son and family's business dealings abroad.
