And I think that the history is, obviously, long, it's complicated, it's complex, and it's good for all of us to remind ourselves of how we got here. But it's also important to remember that we still believe in a two-state solution. And the United States, we still -- President Biden still supports this as a viable vision and a promise for both a Jewish democratic state and a free and independent Palestinian state. That is the way we believe that both sides can live in peace and security going forward. And even though we're in the middle of a conflict, Phil, the president hasn't given up on that.

She has a good instinct in terms of what works with the voters. I think Ron DeSantis has made a good message for, time for a generational change. Someone who can actually win in a general election.

That right now there are two - there are two additional Democrats running for Pennsylvania - excuse me, running for president right now. One - one is a congressman from Minnesota, the other one is the governor of California. They're both running for president, but only one had the guts to announce it. (END VIDEO CLIP) JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWSLETTER: I mean, it's too late to have an open contest for the Democratic nomination. The filing deadline has already passed in Nevada and New Hampshire. It's coming up in literally weeks in many states. I mean the only person who's stood up a campaign is Dean Phillips, as John Fetterman points out there, I mean except for, you know, the - if we count Marianne Williamson. And so the -- unless you're going to try to elect Dean Phillips as the Democratic nominee, which I - you know, Dean Phillips didn't even really seem to want to be here. He's basically been spending months trying to convince somebody else to run. And he's like, well, if nobody else is going to do it, I'll do it. But the problem is that, you know, this is a conversation in the Democratic Party, if it was going to have it, needed to have a year ago when there was a time for other people to stand up campaigns. Right now you literally can't get on the ballot in some of these states. If Biden withdrew tomorrow, I suppose Kamala Harris would become the frontrunner for the nomination. And with the exception of these \"New York Times\" polls that came out this week that everyone's so freaked out about, it's the only poll I can find this election cycle that has Kamala running better than Biden in a general election against Donald Trump. There have been dozens of polls showing that she's an even worse candidate than Joe Biden to face Donald Trump. So, basically, Democrats are, you know, this is where the party is stuck, and Biden needs to find a way to message his accomplishments better to reach voters who are lessen gauged. Biden's holding up pretty well with, for example, black and Hispanic voters who voted in the midterm elections. He hasn't had a lot of deterioration. The deterioration comes across all sorts of demographic groups, with younger voters and with voters who are less engaged, who did not turn out in the midterms. He's going to need some of those people to turn out in 2024. I mean one thing Reid Hoffman (ph) has is - has a research group for Democrats with some interesting research out this week.
