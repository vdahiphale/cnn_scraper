There are the officials who support the President, like the group of mayors who haveconfirmed that they will be at the White House today by President Biden, supporting him while he makes this announcement. That includes the Brownsville mayor. Brownsville is here in South Texas. That mayor issued a statement saying, in part, quote, \"President Joe Biden is expected to unveil an executive order that may notably impact migrants' ability to seek asylum along the U.S. southern border.\" Now, that mayor, like some of the other officials, are not commenting on camera yet because they want to know the specific details of the executive order before commenting. Now, there's another group of mayors who are upset about the President doing this. They say it's too little, too late or that this is not going to fix the issues on the U.S. southern border. And some of them are upset because they weren't invited to the White House event today. Well, that includes the El Cajon mayor, and that is in Southern California. That mayor issuing a statement saying, in part, quote, \"This is nothing but a sham and an insult to those of us dealing with the real consequences of his failed border policies.\" Now, the White House would argue that no executive action is going to fix all the ills on the U.S. southern border that Congress needs to act, that congressional action is required for comprehensive immigration reform to actually happen. Now, the timing of this is very interesting because we're not in December of 2023 when the U.S. southern border was experiencing a surge. There were about 250,000 migrant apprehensions at that point in time. The numbers at the border have plummeted. If we have the numbers for you, in April, about 128,000 migrant apprehensions occurred. I talked to a source yesterday who says that the numbers dropped even more last month. And everybody that I've talked to here on the U.S. southern border pointed that, to the fact that the numbers are so low right now, to say that this is a political move by the Biden administration. And I can tell you that the ACLU says they're going to be looking at those details carefully to figure out if they're going to file soon or not.",

So, those reports will be coming later this month. We are not able to independently verify these data points until we see those reports. However, it is common for their campaigns to share these numbers earlier. And we have done this in the past with their campaign, where we've published the numbers that they have given us. And, of course, we have to wait to confirm those. And I think you can understand why they wanted to get out ahead with these numbers so quickly in the immediate aftermath of the jury delivering this guilty verdict for Donald Trump. They announced that $53 million figure in the 24 hours after the conviction. And then they also later revised it to say, in the days since, he has raised roughly $70 million. These are numbers that they want to continue touting, because the more that they can show that they are raising, they anticipate more people will continue to contribute to that effort. And I think a key point about all of this is timing. Unlike last year, in the aftermath of his indictments, Donald Trump was still just a Republican candidate. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee. So, not only does he have all of his very fierce and loyal supporters, he also has a lot of other donors, and I should say wealthy donors, in his back pocket that potentially he didn't have in the past because they were giving or giving to other candidates at the time. And so, I think that changes the dynamic here, as well.",

In fact, the exit polls had the BJP and its coalition winning upwards of 400 seats out of 543. But come to today, and the BJP has fallen to around 240 seats, and it needs 272 seats to form a majority. So, as you mentioned, it's going to require a coalition partner to be able to form government. What we are seeing in India is that since Prime Minister Modi has come to power, he has really centralized power, not only within the country, but also within his own party. He has used state institutions against opposition leaders, against the media. And in many ways, what we were hearing from voters on the ground, even if they were saying so silently, is that certain red lines had been crossed. So, this is in some sense a wake- up call to a leader who is still very, very popular, but who many voters feel have crossed lines for what should otherwise be a very vibrant democracy.",

And so, that is going to be something where the BJP and Prime Minister Modi in particular puts significant focus. But I think in addition to that, he's going to have to make sure that he doesn't cross a certain red line, you know, the use of state institutions, the lack of comfort that voters feel with where things have gone in the country, the lack of freedom of press, so on and so forth.

Even much, much, much more difficult to know where we will be in over in a month from now. So, you know, at the moment, it's a moment of considerable uncertainty. Whether or not this deal goes through is going to be critical to determining whether or not we are headed for a potential ceasefire, one that could last at least six weeks, but very likely weeks and perhaps even months longer than that. Or if this deal falls apart, I think there's a very strong likelihood of the Israeli government ramping up its military activity in Gaza even further, bringing more military pressure to bear, trying to finish the job, as some Israeli officials have told me, in Rafah itself and continuing to try and achieve this very elusive goal that the Israeli prime minister and his allies have set of absolute victory over Hamas, something that even Israeli military officials say is going to be very challenging. There's also, of course, the consideration of President Biden. You know, he may not want to be seen to be sitting down with the Israeli prime minister at this moment, particularly as elections approach. The visit next week that seemed to originally be scheduled for Netanyahu was actually going to coincide with Biden being out of the country, which would have been quite convenient for the White House.

The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has said that influence operations are in full swing ahead of the November election, aiming to sow discord and amplify divisions within the U.S., whether it's social media campaigns or Chinese state media portraying the United States as this democracy that's falling apart. It's clear, some say, that Beijing's goal is to weaken America's standing on the global stage. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, guys, there's been a lot of focus on the use of psychedelics as medicine, and there's going tobe a lot of interest in this FDA Advisory Committee meeting. If things continue to move forward, that may usher in other psychedelics as medicines. If they stall, I think it's going to stall the whole process for some time. We're talking about MDMA here -- Methamphetamine is what that stands for, and potentially its use in treating post-traumatic stress, which is a huge unmet need. I mean, there hasn't really been a new therapy for post- traumatic stress in a quarter century. I've been reporting on this for over 20 years. Lycos Pharmaceuticals is sort of at the center of these trials, and they're presenting these Phase III blinded controlled studies. And let me just show you a little bit of what they found. These are not huge studies. These are early days still. But what they found was that in the group of people who received MDMA, about 87 percent of them had a reduction of their post- traumatic symptoms. If they got a placebo, it was closer to 69 percent. And I should point out that both groups got talk therapy, and that's in part why the placebo group was so high. The trial really consisted of three eight-hour sessions separated over time where people received a dose of the MDMA. And again, you can see what the results showed there. I think even more significant was how many people reported a complete resolution of their symptoms. They no longer met the criteria for post- traumatic stress. If you received MDMA, 71 percent of people said they no longer had those symptoms. And in the placebo group, it was closer to 48 percent. So, again, we'll see what this committee meeting really thinks about all this, what the advisors say. But there's going to be a lot of interest, I think, overall in psychedelics. I should point out that there are concerns with these types of medications. There are cardiac concerns. These medications can raise your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. There could be liver concerns. But I think more broadly, when studying these types of medications, it's very hard to do a true blinded trial. Think about it. You get a psychedelic, you get a placebo, people generally know what they've received. And as a result, it may be hard to call these trials truly blinded. In fact, when you look at those numbers and you ask, what did you get? In the group of people who received MDMA, 94 percent of them knew that they received it. In the group that got the placebo, most of them realized that they did not receive it, as well. That is something that's certainly to come up. We've been talking about this for a long time. I've been reporting on the possibility of using psychedelics like MDMA for a long time. Over 10 years ago, I talked about this woman named Rachel, who as a child had been abused and raped and suffered from post-traumatic stress most of her adult life. She had tried everything. Nothing had really worked for her. It's a really sad situation. And then she enrolled in a trial. Again, this is over 10 years ago. And I want you to watch a short clip of what happened to her.",
