Last week, Boris, if you remember it was Steve Scalise who actually bested Jim Jordan in a closed door conference vote to become the next speaker. And then it became very clear because of a number of Jordan allies that Steve Scalise was not going to be able to clinch the required 217 votes to get there. So Steve Scalise actually bowed out.Now on the floor of the House of Representatives, Scalise voted for Jim Jordan. But you know, there has been talk that if Jim Jordan could not get support on the first ballot to win this race, there becomes a question of how long are people going to be backing him and how hard are people who supported Steve Scalise or Kevin McCarthy going to be fighting for Jim Jordan? Now he is meeting right now behind closed doors with members on the floor just right below where I'm standing right now, and the question remains, you know, is he going to be able to pick up more support in a subsequent vote on the floor of the House? And I think that that remains to be seen right now. Jim Jordan is someone who you either love or you may not like very much in the House of Representatives. And I think you saw that on the floor with a number of House appropriators actually voting against him. These are the people who time after time, saw Jim Jordan vote against a series of spending bills over this last decade or so in Congress. And you saw Kay Granger the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, voting against Jim Jordan. That was quite a moment. So the question right now is, Jim Jordan is expected to get another vote on the floor. That is the current plan, according to his spokesman. But the question becomes once he gets to the floor, is he able to pick up support or does he start to hemorrhage support? Because  that is the risk you take if you go back onto the floor, you have to show that you are actually picking up support. Right now, I think that is the question of the day -- Boris.",

We are very much aware of the presence of civilians and we are all too aware of the cynical manipulation that Hamas seeks to do by using civilians exactly for these purposes.

The reports that came out was of an Israeli strike, which is the knee jerk response around the world. But then he reported that he saw with his own eyes a strike that landed a rocket that misfired and landed in northern Gaza. I think it was Jabalia, and caused casualties and the death of the Palestinian family. So this is not unprecedented. It has happened many times in the past. It is documented. And for those willing to listen and not to automatically blame Israel for it, there is ample proof of the fact that this has happened many times before.
