This morning, these are the penalty options Donald Trump could be facing as the judge overseeing his criminal trial is holding a hearing about the gag order that he put in place.Donald Trump has been, at minimum, testing the limits of that gag order. And now, for the first time since this trial began, the judge is going to hear arguments and decide if Trump went further than that, possibly trampling all over that gag order. The D.A. says they have ten examples of violations already. If the judge agrees, he then needs to decide what punishment Donald Trump should face. After that, the jury and the first witness, David Pecker, will be called back in. Pecker is a key player in the alleged hush money scheme at the crux of Donald Trump's 34 criminal charges here. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside court for us once again. Brynn, can you first walk us through this gag order hearing? What, what is expected could be happening?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. Let's first remind the viewers what is that gag order, right? It was put in place at the end of March, essentially says that Donald Trump, as a defendant in this trial, cannot talk ill about any of the witnesses in this case, any of the jurors, family members of the prosecution, and also family members of the judge.We have an idea of what will be argued in this hearing, which gets underway at 9:30 this morning court filings from the prosecution, and they have argued in court, like you said, that Trump has violated this gag order by verbally but also social media ten times. Now, they're asking the judge to penalize Trump 1,000 for he's just fined for each time he violated that gag order. But they go a step further, essentially saying that, you know, also, he could face some jail time. So, we'll see what actually wins in court. One other thing, prosecution wants the judge to remind Donald Trump, hey, you're the criminal defendant in this case. And that means, as a criminal defendant, you're subject to court supervision, again, possibly that jail time. Will we see that? We don't know. But this is certainly something that is going to come up the very start of court. Trump and his defense team essentially said, you know, I have witnesses coming after me. I have no way to defend myself. One of those witnesses, well, not surprisingly, that feud has continued with his former fixer Michael Cohen. Just yesterday, Trump was saying stuff about Michael Cohen after court ended. Michael Cohen responded in a tweet essentially saying that he, you know, had desperation attacks with his words. So, we'll see if that even plays into today's hearing. But that is what the gag order will sort of be covered and see how much, if any, Donald Trump has violated it, according to the judge.",

So, their FBI is investigating the collection and keeping of documents at Mar-a- Lago after the Trump presidency.And they sit down with a witness who, according to these records that we received last night through the court, they're heavily redacted, the person who was speaking to the FBI is just called Person 16 in this record. And it's a record of that person's interview. In the interview, they're talking about what they witnessed in the Trump White House. This person worked there, and then had a little bit of interaction with Trump afterwards about the records and says at one point to the FBI investigators, and it's in this court record now, that Walt Nauta, who became a co defendant of Trump and is a very close political aide of his, that he was told by the former president's people that this investigation was not going anywhere, that it was politically motivated, and, quote, much ado about nothing. Walt Nauta was also told that even if he gets charged with lying to the FBI, the former president will pardon him in court in 2024. We don't know what investigators did after that, how much investigation they may have done into this particular point that this witness spoke about and recalled to them. And we haven't gotten any explanation or comment from Nauta's attorney at this time. We're still working to see exactly what this means or even if it could come up in trial. But these new details coming out in court, this is the sort of stuff that we could continue to learn about as records from the Mar-a-Lago investigation become more public, both through the court system, and then maybe even at a trial. Another detail out there yesterday from these court records is that that investigation by the FBI was called Plasmic Echo. Sara?",

We've got live pictures for you, looking live pictures right here outside of Trump Tower where you're going to be getting familiar of seeing this every day, because right now, we're waiting for Donald Trump to depart his apartment once again to head to lower Manhattan to head back into the courtroom.The question today is, did the former president repeatedly violate the gag order put in place by the judge? That's the question before they can even pick back up with the first witness in this criminal trial. We're going to be bringing you all of these live moments. We're also watching this right now. The city of Baltimore is suing the owner and manager of the cargo ship that crashed into the Key Bridge last month. Monday, the city filed the lawsuit accusing them of negligence, alleging the ship was unseaworthy when it left port, and was staffed with a, quote, incompetent crew. Six people died in that catastrophe. CNN's Gabe Cohen is in Washington following the very latest for us. Gabe, what is this city trying to do, wanting to get out of this lawsuit, and what do they say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it's going to be a lot of money. We don't know the exact amount at this point, but you can expect it is going to be many millions, if not billions of dollars.And in this lawsuit that we're talking about here, the city of Baltimore is claiming that the owners and operators of the Dali ship were grossly, if not criminally negligent here. Remember, the ship experienced some sort of issue that caused it to lose power and steering just before hitting the bridge the morning of March 26th. Federal investigators still trying to figure out exactly why it lost power, focusing in on the power system right now. But at this point, the city is pointing to reports that the ship experienced a power issue even before it left the port of Baltimore, saying in this lawsuit that the power supply problem, whatever it was, was either not investigated or not fixed, and that the companies didn't properly maintain the engine, the vessels engine, its propulsion system, its steering and that the ship was not suitable for use. As you mentioned, they also allege that the crew on board was incompetent, that the crew was inattentive to its duties, improperly trained, and that it failed to comply with navigation customs as it was making its way through the channel. But bottom line here, Kate, the city is saying that these companies that own and operate the vessel were negligent and they have to pay up. And that is because there has been this massive economic impact to the Baltimore area. As they put it in this lawsuit, they say the economic engine of the region would grind to a halt on March 26th, 2024. We're talking about $70 billion in economic value, more than 20,000 jobs that are impacted here, according to the city, and they're going to be feeling it for weeks, if not many months more until they can clear and reopen the channel to cargo ship traffic. And many officials, including the head of the port, Kate, have warned that consumers are going to start to feel this the longer that the port is basically shut down.",
