The U.S. economy is by all accounts doing really well.But in one of the latest surveys, just one quarter of registered voters in seven key swing states say that the economy has improved in the past two years.

But, you know, COVID was raging. The unemployment rate was sky high. People weren't sure that they could get toilet paper or baby formula. And now 15.2 million jobs have been created since the president came into office.Again, there's historic low levels of unemployment. We're seeing industry grow. I did not set up that construction noise. But construction is one area in which we saw tremendous growth over this last month. That's not by accident. That's because this president has said, we're going to invest in America. We're going to create jobs in America. And that is changing. And at the same time, you know, we're seeing prices steadily go down. And so, I think that consumer sentiment is also changing. But, you know, we also take it as a sign that we have more work to do. And we'll continue to do it until every American feels that sense of security that the President talks about. We want a good job not just to be a good, you know, paycheck, but also to provide some breathing room.",
