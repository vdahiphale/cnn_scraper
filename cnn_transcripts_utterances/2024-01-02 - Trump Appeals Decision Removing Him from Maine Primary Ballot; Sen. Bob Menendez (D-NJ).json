The secretary of state who made the decision to ban Trump joins us with her reaction this hour.Also breaking, another federal indictment of Senator Bob Menendez accusing the Democrat of accepting bribes from a second foreign country. Standby for details on the new charges tied to an alleged corruption scheme that prosecutors say lasted for years. Plus, there's new audio of air traffic controllers giving instructions shortly before the fiery crash at a Tokyo airport. What the recording reveals as the investigation gets underway. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news. Donald Trump formally challenging the decision to remove him from the primary ballot in Maine based on the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban. We'll speak live with Maine's secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, in just a few moments. First, let's go to CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what is Trump's team arguing and what happens next?",

She is a Democrat. And under Maine's rules, she is the first stop for questions of ballot eligibility. And here, she opted to remove Trump from the ballot. But if you don't like what the secretary of state says about your ballot eligibility, you can appeal that to the court system, which is what they've done here, asking them to overturn her decision.Trump's team arguing, quote, the secretary was a biased decision-maker who should have recused herself and had no legal authority, making multiple errors of law and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Now, her decision was based on Section 3 of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which bars insurrectionists from holding public office. But this section of the Constitution has now been litigated by multiple states across the country with varying outcomes. Maine and Colorado have opted to remove Trump from the ballot under this section but other states actually have been reluctant to really get into the merits here, instead relying on procedural arguments and opting to keep him on the ballot. But, Wolf, that also leaves the door open to continue to litigate this issue in the general election unless the Supreme Court steps in. And we still expect that former President Trump will eventually appeal that Colorado decision to the Supreme Court.",

Madam Secretary, thank you so much for joining us. Trump's appeal claims you lack the authority to remove Trump from the ballot and accuses you of political bias. Let me quote from this 11- page document that was just released. The secretary should have recused herself due to her bias against President Trump, as demonstrated by a documented history of prior statements prejudging the issue presented. Madam Secretary, how do you respond to that? SEC. OF STATE SHENNA BELLOWS (D-ME): First, thank you for having me. I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. Those were my sole considerations in this hearing and in my decision. And it's really important to recognize that this is a process in Maine. I qualified Trump for the ballot based on his signatures. And then five registered Maine voters, including two former Republican state senators, brought a challenge. I was required by law to hold a hearing within five days and then issue a decision within a week. Now, it's part of the process. The courts will take it from here. That being said, I voluntarily suspended the effect of my decisions pending appeal. This is how the rule of law should work.",

It's not an option, it's a requirement, just as the other qualifications for president, like age or citizenship, or not allowing someone like Barack Obama or George W.

It was just based on her assessment of the facts, as are in really the public record. Different than the Colorado case where there was a trial. It was short, it was limited, but there was some sort of judicial proceeding. I think, in some ways, one of the issues the Supreme Court may need to look at when these cases all eventually get up there, is what factual record under Section 3 of the 14th amendment of the Constitution is required to determine that someone who might be determined ineligible under that provision actually engaged in insurrection.",

I don't think any of those indicators undermine her decision.

What's your reaction to that?MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL: Well, on the January 6th committee, we argued that he was an officer elected official whose job was to execute the laws that he'd been elected to represent. I think it's interesting that we're seeing arguments about officer and legal interpretation when the best argument would be that he wasn't involved with trying to prevent the lawful transfer of power, right? That's the argument that if he would led with, we wouldn't even be in this situation. But instead, we're seeing procedural arguments.

And that's why the Supreme Court really is going to have to settle that officer question.When we just think about it in lay terms, we think, well, of course, the president is an officer of the United States, but there is actually sort of an extensive constitutional debate over that, and that's Supreme Court territory.",

Now, prosecutors alleged that he had sent an encrypted text message to the developer telling him he was issuing this press release with these public statements and encouraging him to send it to the Qataris.

Now, prosecutors say, months later, this multimillion dollar investment deal was signed. And in exchange, authorities say that Menendez received a gold bar from the real estate developer. He also received tickets to the Formula One Grand Prix race in Miami, Florida, for two years in a row, and that there is also a suggestion in the indictment that Menendez was offered luxury watches, some valued at as much as $24,000.

Now, in terms of the Democratic Party, the party has its own challenges.

What does that signal to you?",

Harvard University president Claudine Gay's tenure, just six months long, was mired in controversy. The weight of multiple allegations of plagiarism following a poor performance in a Capitol Hill hearing about anti-Semitism resulting in her resignation today. In a letter to the Harvard community this afternoon, Gay wrote that her exit came with a heavy heart. It has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual. Harvard announced late today that Alan M. Garber, who currently serves as provost at the university, will step in as interim president, while acknowledging Gay's commitment to the school. It is with that overarching consideration in mind that we have accepted Gay's resignation, the Harvard leadership wrote, adding, we do so with sorrow. Conservative media had been unearthing multiple examples of plagiarism in Gay's past works, including an entire paragraph being lifted almost verbatim in her 1997 PhD dissertation without citation after she, along with the presidents of UPenn and MIT, gave an answer that was widely considered too legal in a December 5th Congressional hearing about anti-Semitism on campus. REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): So, the answer is, yes, that calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard code of conduct? Correct?",

We are talking about the number two of Hamas's political bureau, someone who's considered one of the founding members of Hamas's military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, and, of course, he has been a huge point of focus and concern in the national communities, as well as we know back in 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department designated him as a global terrorist, offering some US$5 million in reward for any information about him.Now, of course, we have been getting more details just as they come in, this is a developing situation. We're having authorities around here. They have cleared out just now, but the military and other officials were present on the ground, looking through the debris. You might be able to see, it's a bit dark now, but just behind me, the destruction is very clear. But it was clear this was a very precise explosion, a precise strike. Now, the Lebanese national news agency has described this as an aerial strike. They say using three missiles. We've been speaking to people on the ground, one shop owner just three doors down saying that they heard three loud booms when the incident, when the explosion took place. And of course, we have no heard from the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh. He has described this as a cowardly assassination carried out in his words by Israel. Now, of course, we have reached out to the Israeli military. They declined to comment. We heard a little earlier today from a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev, he spoke to MSNBC a little earlier this evening, saying that Israel does not claim responsibility, but that whoever carried out this attack was clearly targeting Hamas specifically, not targeting the Lebanese state, not, crucially, targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah. Now, of course, there is concern that this could trigger an escalation. This comes off the back of weeks of skirmishes on the southern Lebanese border, where we have seen Israel carrying out strikes on Lebanese villages and border, but also, of course, Hezbollah, in turn, targeting Israeli targets across the border.",
