Turkey, keen to put that on the agenda and before heading to Washington, where he has been invited, of course, as a NATO member, President Erdogan said, and I quote here, we will bring to the agenda, the ongoing massacres against the Palestinian people in Gaza, where our shared values are being tested for sincerity.

Why because they are the most powerful Muslim majority nation within NATO. And that was a significant role they play. So Erdogan does have a voice within NATO, a voice that will get listened to. But like every politician there and let's talk for a second about Keir Starmer New British Prime Minister talking about 2.5 percent GDP contribution to NATO 2.5 percent contribution on defense spending, that's his commitment to NATO. Back home, the question is when's that money going to come? When you actually going to make that commitment? When's it going to start? So politicians like President Erdogan have to deal with home constituencies and a vital a piece of news that's happening around the world that's triggering real emotions and concern and consternation in Turkey. Is something that President Erdogan feels that he needs to talk about, and that is what's happening to the Palestinians? Of course, you know, we heard from Jens Stoltenberg earlier today saying, look, we're going to be having these other partners here at NATO, we're going to be having New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Japan. Why because they are important partners. Why because from their region of the world, Russia, and its war in Ukraine gets enabled. So you know, the idea there for Erdogan, that there are things happening in other parts of the world that NATO isn't dealing with is an important one, but it's not. And this is I guess the bottom line here for Erdogan and others is that they don't constitute such a greater part of a real threat to NATO countries, at the moment, perhaps to him more so.",

But according to the president, his advisors, that's a settled case that is closed. He is remaining in this race.

You've seen President Biden behind the scenes of working the phones, calling the Congressional Black Caucus. Those lawmakers have been among the most fervent support the President Biden has heard in recent days. He's also placed individual phone calls to lawmakers, including a key progressive voice.

He'll be meeting with the AFL CIO, this morning hosting about 60 union chiefs from around the country to try to make his case.

It's also trying to distance him from the money that was found in his now wife's home. There was a half a million dollars in cash, multiple gold bars worth several hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a Mercedes Benz convertible. That's all what prosecutors say were the bribes that Menendez and his wife allegedly received in exchange for him taking steps to help three New Jersey businessman and the Government of Egypt. As you said while he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but his lawyers trying to distance him saying that this was his wife school that Menendez was unaware of the gold until the FBI searched her home, also trying to say that he spent most of his time in Washington D.C., and then he wasn't in the home in New Jersey where the search was conducted. So trying to distance him and putting a lot of the blame there on his wife and his wife has also been charged in this case, but she will go on trial.

Now Menendez team is expected to continue their closing arguments very shortly, his -- city could go for another hour to two hours, then the two co-defendants in the case will present their closing arguments, the government will have one more chance to address the jury.
