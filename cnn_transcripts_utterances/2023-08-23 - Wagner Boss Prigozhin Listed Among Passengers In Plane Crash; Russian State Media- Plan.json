      "sentences": "\"And now it would seem, to this.\"I also just received a reaction moments ago from the Estonian prime minister. Estonia sits right on the border with Russia and has many interactions with the Kremlin, including hostile ones. It says, \"If true, it shows Putin will eliminate opponents and that scares anyone who is thinking of expressing opinion different than his.\" Julia Ioffe has covered Russia for a number of years, written extensively about the Putin regime. Julia, you know, as well as anyone, that Putin has a history of taking out, of killing opponents, dissidents, critics on Russian territory and outside Russian territory. What is your reaction to what we're seeing so far? JULIA IOFFE, FOUNDING PARTNER &amp; WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, my first reaction, Jim, is that we know and we have known for a while exactly how Vladimir Putin thinks about specifically traitors. Because Prigozhin was not an opponent and he was not a dissident but he was a traitor. And that's the worst kind of enemy. They meet the worst kind of fate. And Putin has spoken about this extensively that he has said traitors will end up dead in a ditch. This is one way to get to a ditch. The second thing is, Jim, you and I were in Aspen last month where CIA Director Bill Burns said, if he was Prigozhin, he would not fire his food taster because Putin believes is a dish best served cold. And that Putin is, quote, \"the ultimate apostle of payback.\" Everybody who knows Putin, and Bill Burns certain does, he's a well- known Russia specialist, in addition to running the Central Intelligence Agency, that this is how Putin views traitors and he will not stop. Just because Prigozhin had a couple months to walk around and recruit troops to go to Africa, there was always this sword over his head.",

It seemed like, in the meantime, Putin cleared up the people who were directly in his chain of command.So with the military, we still haven't seen Surovikin, we haven't heard from him. Sources in the U.S. government are telling me he's likely in detention, under detention. And yesterday, we finally got confirmation that he was, in fact, fired from his post. It seemed he knew about the mutiny beforehand. Others, other lower- ranking officers were cleared out afterwards. But Prigozhin was walking around like a free man. He was seen, photographed with various African leaders at the African summit that was held in Russia. He just posted a video earlier this week looking like he was in Africa saying he was recruiting fighters, quote, unquote, \"strong men\" to go to Africa with him. It was like, why is he still walking around? Is Putin going to let him get out scott free? Today, I just want to point out, today is two months to the day that Prigozhin announced his march of fairness on Moscow on June 23rd. Putin loves anniversaries and he hates traders.",

Certainly, all of these Russian casualties -- and, listen, we have to be clear, there is a lot of internal Russian support for the war.But there are also a lot of dead Russians and a lot of families who have paid the toll internally the greatest toll. And there are a lot of people with questions as well inside of Russia. How do you see Vladimir Putin's position right now? And what this says about his desire to try to shore up his support internally as he's trying to play this out here for the next year as he's helping to get maybe a little more favorable outcome in the election in the U.S.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, Brianna, I think most of us, when we saw that Prigozhin wasn't immediately hauled off to jail or, you know, suffered an accident or was killed by Putin, we thought, well, it may be because he needs Prigozhin to do something for him.It may also be that he's really afraid of the nationalist and the Russian people's reaction. Because Prigozhin, remember, said a lot of things about how badly the war was going and how the military wasn't providing him with enough ammunition, how the Russian men fighting in the trenches in Ukraine were being let down by their government. That resonated with the Russian people. So I think, regardless of all the other motives, Putin may have been thinking I have to bide my time and take this guy down when I have assessed I have all the control, I have all the other elites behind me. I have maybe some way to address the Russian population that won't make me further weaker. I don't know whether the Russian people will take this, you know, in stride. Because there are all indications that Putin is looking to actually do another mobilization. He's raised the military age for men who are qualified to be called up in a draft to fight in Ukraine and he's clamping down on people who want to leave. So this may end up backfiring on him or he may have assessed that he has enough control, he's gotten rid of the generals who would cause problems and other elites who might do so as well and he can proceed.",

So if you were able to get credible investigators there, you could then figure out what brought it down. Whether it's a missile or not. It could be an explosion on board.

      "sentences": "Yes. That would make sense if Vladimir Putin had questions about Prigozhin and those close to him. He would have as well.You know, Fred's mentioning there the presence of Wagner in Belarus, not sustainable. So much of what happened right after that coup was not sustainable, including the sort of state of the Kumbaya relations with Yevgeny Prigozhin. So for those of us joining us here, according to Russian state media, a plane matching the description of Yevgeny Prigozhin's, which is a jet, an Embraer jet has crashed northwest of Moscow. And this is video that's coming from the Tver region where you can see this plane just falling out of the sky. And according to observations, it does appear to be missing a wing. I want to bring in retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, a 26-year career in the Air Force, including much of that as an intelligence officer, what questions are raised for you as you are looking at what are pretty extraordinary pictures that we are getting in here and these details that we are learning? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Brianna, I think one of the key things was, what kind of explosion was this? Was it something caused by a missile, like when M.H.-17, or was it something that happened with an onboard explosion, something that could have been created by a bomb placed onboard the aircraft. So that's something that is not quite clear yet based on what we've seen so far. If it's true that a wing was missing as the plane came down, obviously, the plane is not airworthy in that situation. And when it comes down like that, it's not something that can fly in a normal pattern. And that would explain the trajectory of the plane as it was, you know, moving rapidly toward the ground. So those are key things. Then from a more broader perspective, looking at this power struggle that we're clearly seeing between Putin, Prigozhin, the Wagner elements, all of those things become a key element in what we have to analyze here, why this happened. And then also, if, in fact, Prigozhin is on board this aircraft and if his second in command is on board, then you get into a situation where it's the decimation of the Wagner Group. Which is clearly going forward in this case. I think we're seeing the results of that effort by Putin to get rid of any opposition from at least that sector.",

It can detect the burn as the missile is launched.It's how they determined that a M.H.-17 was brought down by a Russian missile in 2014. They can detect the burn of the missile, where it came from, which was Russian territory, what kind of missile it was. So presumably. they're looking at that right now. The Defense Intelligence Agency has the capability to look to see if there was something that went up before that plane went down or also to detect an explosion on board. And they've used those capabilities to investigate things like this in the past. I was in the room when they determined that M.H.-17 was brought down by a Russian missile. Anyway, many more questions to ask. That's certainly an interesting one, Cedric. I wonder what you think about that.",

      "sentences": "Brianna, a moment ago, Giuliani and his Georgia-based legal team just exited the door behind me. They left the Fulton County courthouse where they were meeting with the district attorney to negotiate a bond agreement for Giuliani and establish the terms of his release.Now, we just got his bond agreement and it is for $150,000. He will have to post a percentage of that. He has certain restrictions about who he can and cannot discuss the case with. Now, according to the terms of his release, he cannot discuss the case with any of his co-defendants. So former President Trump is, of course, one of his co-defendants. We know the former president will host a fundraiser for him in a few weeks. Rudy Giuliani and others have been in touch with Trump about getting more money to help Rudy Giuliani pay his legal bills. So unclear if he'll be able to walk that line between continuing the relationship and not discussing the Fulton County case at all. He's also prohibited from threatening anyone involved in this case. Now, he's also prevented from communicating about this case with anyone who could be called as a witness. This is interesting, Brianna, because Bernie Kerik is an unindicted co-conspirator. It is possible he could be called as a witness. And he's been with Rudy Giuliani. We believe he even traveled to Georgia. They're longtime friends. And Kerik has been helping him try to find the right counsel to handle this case and walk him through this whole process, even though Kerik is not an attorney, but a former New York commissioner. Again, if Kerik is helping him through this process but he can't talk to anyone who could be a witness in this case about the case, that could prove a little tricky. The next stop for Rudy Giuliani, who did not come for this meeting, he will head to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office to surrender. Brianna, that process is expected to include fingerprints and a mugshot. Truly remarkable, the idea of Rudy Giuliani, formerly one of the top law enforcement officials in the United States when he was U.S. attorney in New York, now a criminal defendant, and soon to have a publicly released mugshot as he is now a criminal defendant here in Fulton County.",

Just because you are a law enforcement official in no way insulate you from being charged with a crime if a prosecutor believes there is evidence to charge you. But it will be up to the jury here in Fulton County or, potentially, at the federal level, because Giuliani has said he will try to get it to the federal court.
