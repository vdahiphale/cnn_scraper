The Kremlin spokesperson says there are, quote, certain contacts on the matter but we do not want them to be made public. Gershkovich was arrested in March and was accused of espionage, which he denies. Another U.S. citizen Paul Whelan was arrested in Russia back in 2018. Kylie Atwood explains.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Russian officials won't even comment at all on conversations to secure their release. Because they say they need to go through the entire trial system. So it's noteworthy however, you know, it does sort of also reflect what our reporting is, that U.S. officials have really been looking around the globe to try to see what options they can gin up to try to offer to the Russians to secure Evan Gershkovich's release and of course Paul Whelan as well.

And so, we're not seeing a lot of movement at the moment. What we are learning this morning, what we are seeing new is that the Russians are accusing Ukrainians of attacking some border regions in Kursk and Belgorod.

      "sentences": "A battle between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg and no, it's not in the ring, at least not yet. This time, Meta is taking on Twitter by launching Threads. It's an app that has more than a passing resemblance to Twitter. From the interface with Threads of messages to the functionality with options on the messages much like Twitter's, like reply, repost and share buttons.Multiple social media apps have been launched in competition to Twitter, True Social and more recently Blue Sky. But a major difference is Threads can lean on Instagrams huge existing user base. It has more than 2 billion monthly active users. Plus, the timing could work in its favor. Twitter under Elon Musk is undergoing a major transformation. And not everyone thinks it's going all that well. Whether it was the removal of blue verification ticks for those who refuse to pay, or the reappearance of users who had been previously banned from the platform for hate speech and misinformation. Or even operationally their outages over the weekend. And now Twitter has temporarily limited how many tweets users can see. The fact is some of Twitter's users could be ripe for the picking. So, in this fight, perhaps the odds are looking favorable in Mark Zuckerberg corner. But judging by this tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to question the sanity of Meta's leadership team, he's not tapping out. Meanwhile, the actual fight that the two have said they're ready for, no news on that yet. But from Thursday, we can look to both Twitter and Threads for any updates from Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
