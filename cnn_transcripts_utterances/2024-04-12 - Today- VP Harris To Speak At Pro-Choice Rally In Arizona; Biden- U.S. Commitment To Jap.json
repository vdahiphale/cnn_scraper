Democrats will be linking Donald Trump to that ruling by highlighting his role in overturning Roe versus Wade.

She obviously has had a tricky time in some ways in the vice presidency, especially early on. But this is becoming the place that she is carved out for herself. What do we expect?

And now, she's going around saying, you know, no, we want Democrats inthe House and the governors mansion and the legislature to fix this. Very fascinating thing about that too, is that when this campaign cycle began, Republicans behind the scenes were telling their candidates do not say, you're pro-life, you know, you should start talking about exceptions and how you support them. So the message has really, really changed after the 2022 midterms.",

But when you talk about immigration, you see the border difference in Arizona. You have a lot of folks looking for a moderate middle ground solution, someone who they want to see the right laws passed so that people can come in legally and do work and maybe go back over if they want to be able to come here and do the labor that is needed.But they're also tired of that constant flux of people that were seeing on CNN all the time. And so I think that there's more of a moderate, you know, centrist position in Arizona, but then you have a lot of Republicans, you know, kind of shutting down, deals like the one they had in the Senate, which is earlier this year. And I think that a lot of people over the border are getting frustrated with things like that when they see no action being taken.",

Someone who was willing to break the mold. Obviously, his brand of Republican politics has really gone by the wayside in the years since he passed away. He obviously saw a Trump come to power, but its snowball has continued to build.Kari Lake, the Senate candidate there, had previously told McCain Republicans to quite literally get out of her events. She kind of went to war with the McCain family. She seems to be trying to reinvent herself around that as well. I mean, do you see that as something that has the possibility to be successful and voters going to buy the idea that she potentially is capable of, quote/unquote, big tent Republican Party or not?

Israel, a key ally and saying that basically would step in to defend Israel if it was attacked doing the same for these two countries in Asia, of course, a completely different region and completely different threats.So, it does speak to China and seeing that as a threat because when you're talking about attacks on this, on these areas of sea and these islands, it can only be China that he's, of course, referring to. And arguably, it's a more exist -- existential question than the one in the Middle East right now, because when we were talking about what's happening in the Middle East, he was really trying to prevent that conflict escalating in the Middle East. When we're talking about in the Indo-Pacific area is potentially the U.S. coming up against China, which is what everyone fears more than anything.

I mean, this is the same storm I was chasing tornadoes with yesterday in Louisiana and Mississippi, now moving along the East Coast, and it's bringing heavy rainfall to the western suburbs of Pittsburgh. This is Oakdale, check this out. This is just some of the footage that were finding overnight. There were swift water emergencies and rescue is taking place overnight in this western suburb of Pittsburgh, where, by the way, they broke a daily record of rainfall, 2.77 inches of rain yesterday. In fact, that was the 25th wettest day in Pittsburgh's history. And that is going back 100 years. So that's really saying something. And you can see that swath of heavier rainfall over western sections of Pennsylvania. Right now, the flash flood warnings have been lifted it did, but they're still flood warnings in place across this area. So we do have swollen rivers from the recent rainfall. This is the storm system again that's got a large cold front that extends all the way to the south and east that brought the tornadoes to Florida and into Mississippi and Alabama yesterday. Now, look at the excessive rainfall today. This time were focusing our attention across ports -- parts of New Hampshire and into Maine. Upstate New York could see some snowfall out of the system as well into the mountainous regions, Adirondacks for instance. But a widespread one to two inches of precipitation is still coming across the northern sections of New England. And then I want to focus our attention on Monday. This is a serious concern. We're several days out, but we're giving you as much of a heads-up as possible. The planes specifically throughout central Oklahoma extending into Texas there is already a 30 percent risk of severe weather that doesn't happen that often this far in advance. So, we're going to keep a very close side of this weather pattern heading into the weekend. And then Monday, that's the big day if you're in Oklahoma City, you want to be prepared.",
