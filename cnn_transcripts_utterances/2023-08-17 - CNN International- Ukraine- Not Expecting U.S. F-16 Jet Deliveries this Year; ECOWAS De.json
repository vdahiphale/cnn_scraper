We'll have a report from the village recently liberated. Then regional West African bloc ECOWAS says it's opens to a peaceful solution in Niger.But warns the country's constitutional order must be restored by all means necessary. And a source tells CNN that Rudy Giuliani makes a desperate appeal to former U.S. President Donald Trump to pay his legal fees. We'll have the latest on Giuliani's trouble finances. Ukraine says despite having big hopes, American made warplanes won't be protecting its skies this year. The country's Air Force spokesman says progress is being made towards training pilots. But Kyiv is not expecting F-16 deliveries anytime soon. Ukraine has persistently lobbied its Western allies for these fighter jets. Meanwhile, the grinding battle on the ground continues. A regional official says one woman was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling near Kupiansk in the Northeast. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins me now live from Dnipro, Ukraine. Nick, what are you seeing on the ground?",

Ukrainians to fly F-16 jets for which they need to create an entire repair and maintenance infrastructure most likely here in Ukraine to get that functioning.The fact that they're not going to have a booth to the air defenses is of course hard news to hear. We've seen ourselves that its Russian air superiority, their ability to drop half metric ton bombs at will on advancing Ukraine positions that's causing significant -- as indeed is slowing Ukraine's offensive border point out. No NATO military would even remotely think about trying a counter offensive like this without controlling the skies first. But still, there are moments of Ukrainian success where that grind and slow bid to move forward sees some victories. We were just on the outskirts of Urozhaine, probably the first key village that Ukraine has claimed has fallen back into its hands been liberated for the last two or three weeks. And a sign that despite criticism from some Western analysts of how slow this is going, they are indeed seeing constant progress. Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice over): There may be ruin around them but that direction is forwards. We're with the 35th Ukrainian Marines. The first report is to get to the outskirts of Urozhaine. Yet another village announced liberated Wednesday. The victories may be small. But a constant so just down here Urozhaine yet another town taken as the counter offensive does move forward. We were just seeing the neighboring village taken last week, but they keep moving.",

Now at this hour, West African Defense Ministers are discussing the crisis in Niger. Ahead of that meeting, a commissioner for ECOWAS said constitutional order will be restored in Niger by all means necessary.Last week, the regional bloc decided to activate a standby force in response to last month's military coup in Niger. Defense Chiefs at the two day meeting in Accra, Ghana will consider whether to use that force to reinstate constitutional rule. Stephanie Busari joins us now live from Lagos with the latest on the situation. Stephanie, is there a sense within ECOWAS that a peaceful resolution to this is truly possible? And how far will the result depend on the popular sentiment in Niger towards the coup leaders?",

These are the people in one of the world's poorest countries.And the people telling me that the mood there is calm, but they're apprehensive that their country already ravaged by insurgency, poverty, and all some other ills will face military action. And we've seen protests we've seen some mass protests in favor of the coup leaders. We don't know how stage those are. But at the heart of this are resources. This is one of the top 10 producers of uranium. But people ask why do we still live in poverty, and so many are hopeful that this military regime will bring a new kind of life fought for the people of Niger. But life has become tougher since the coup happened on July 26. Sanctions have been placed, and many of them are living in darkness right now. But as you say that military chiefs are in Accra, debating whether to deploy these standby forces or when they will be deployed. And they really want to make sure that dialogue is the last. This military action is the last resort and dialogue is taken to the very last minute, but will the concept label, will they listen? Will they acquiesce to the requests of the ECOWAS? They seem quite entrenched in their position with President Bazoum democratically elected President charged with high treason? So it's a real waiting game right now as these military chiefs in Accra debate, the next step forward, Bianca.",

Across the border in Chad, our evidence shows men, women and children were shot as they fled. At the MSF hospital in Chad, survivors arrived with gunshot wounds in the back legs and buttocks. The lead doctor told CNN all injuries consistent with being shot from the back. Over 850 people flooded the hospital in Adre between June 15th and 17th according to MSF. More than any other period since fighting began in April. Body collectors say according to their count, around 1000 people were killed on the day of June 15, buried in dozens of mass graves. Survivors say the RSF is replicating these same tactics across the region. Even as they're supposed to celebrate in the aftermath of mass killings and the sweep of escalating ethnically targeted attacks.",
