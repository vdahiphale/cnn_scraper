And I think we are hearing them talk more about that and certainly push. I was concerned at one point with Congresswoman Omar's point about this ceasefire, because when we started talking about ceasefire and Hamas was on the line, there was a lot of -- she sort of referenced that, well, you know, ceasefire doesn't happen automatically. People have to sort come to the table. But that's not what you hear when you're in a protest, when people say, the president should say ceasefire now, and that would sort in -- that will kind of end the thing. So, I feel like we have make sure that everybody's being held to this same standard here and we need all the parties to have ceasefire because we do need to Israel to be secure and we also need to have these children and women in Gaza to not be dying and for them to secure.

What a day, Congressman, because we were watching for hours waiting to see what he would say about that report. A really key moment, he said that he did not exonerate Biden, Congressman, but he did decline to bring any charges because he didn't believe he could actually secure a conviction based on what he saw. He couldn't prove the intent, not just because it was age or his memory, but you took issue with that. Why? REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Well, I think what the special counsel said was that he willfully retained classified information and then disclosed classified information to people who weren't allowed to get it. And, I mean, this is a guy who's been in office for close to 50 years, five decades, chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When he was vice president, he gets a daily intelligence brief. This is a guy who knows the law and knows the rules, and yet he violated those. And so for me, the key question, I raised this in my question, is why would he do that? What would motivate a guy to do that? And Robert Hur told us that. He said he had strong motivations to ignore, and this is Robert Hur's words, not mine, to ignore the procedures around classified documents because he was writing a book. And he wanted that information readily available to give to the ghostwriter who wasn't clear to get it. And why would he want to do all that? $8 million dollars, 8 million reasons he had. So, that's the point I think was the most telling, because I always want to know what's the motive for someone who knows the rules to then violate the rules, which is exactly what President Biden did.

Why should the American people credit one versus the other if both make similar mistakes that have been played in that actual hearing?",

And so, you know, there would have been exactly the same thing, right? Joe Biden sat for five hours of interviews when President Trump was under investigation by the Mueller investigation, he had a take home test and -- and responded in written form.

However, politically speaking, I'm not certain that this moves the needle. But what it does do it and you heard the Congressman talk about this at the very end of your discussion.
