Don't sleep on the Mar-a-Lago trial. Sure, the Supreme Court has been getting all the attention with arguments on Trump's claims of presidential immunity set to come before them the week of April 22nd, but there is some big news tonight out of Florida. Looks like Jack Smith wants to get the classified documents case moving as soon as possible. And he's asking for a new trial date, this time in the month of July. So, while you're on summer vacation, Donald Trump could actually be in court. Smith is saying in court filings tonight that he believes Trump and his two co-defendants, body man Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira, should go to trial on July 8th, now coincidentally or maybe not coincidentally, one week before Trump is all but certain to become the nominee at the republican convention. Funny how this works, right? Meanwhile, his attorneys, who with this he cannot have a fair trial before the election, are now saying, well, how about August 12th? So, what happens if this case goes to trial before millions of Americans go to the polls on election day? Joining me now to discuss, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. So glad that you're here with me tonight. I mean, look, this is like an Energizer bunny of things. He is going to keep going forward so the Supreme Court be damned. He wants these cases done. What do you make of this idea of July 8th? Why would he want to do that?",

But it's possible that Judge Cannon will say to the parties, well, now that I know the Supreme Court is going to weigh in on presidential immunity, I may just stay the Mar-a-Lago case until we get a resolution on that Supreme Court matter before she has to decide the immunity issue in her own case.",

Tonight, we're taking you inside our own virtual courtroom where our court of public opinion will hear legal arguments on that very question. You're going to hear from two top lawyers who do some role playing tonight and lay out the arguments on both sides. We have national security attorney Bradley Moss, who will argue against immunity, and CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics czar who will argue in favor of immunity. Then our jurors will weigh in. This is a diverse group of everyday Americans meeting tonight for the very first time to share their opinions with each other and, of course, you. Now, you know, this is not an actual court of law. Our jurors are not rendering a verdict, but they will tell us what they think of these arguments that they have heard tonight. So, let's begin with Norm Eisen. Norm, make the argument for us. Why should a president have absolute immunity for acts that were committed while in office? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL:  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, a president is already absolutely immune for acts that were committed in office with respect to civil cases, to damages suit. That is the law of the United States under the case of Nixon v. Fitzgerald, which says that a former president of the United States is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on official acts. If that's the law for money, how much more important is it when your liberty is at stake as president that we afford that protection? Why? Why is that so necessary? A president has to make the most agonizing decisions when they are in the Oval Office. I know, having had the honor of advising a president, how difficult those choices are. They protect all of us with those choices. How can they function if they think their choices will be second guessed? Don't pay attention to who the president is in this specific example. When the Supreme Court decides, they decide for all presidents for all time. Imagine President Obama. He ordered a drone strike in order to protect Americans. And not just a federal D.A., but wherever he is in the country, when he orders that drone strike, the D.A. can create open season all over the land. People can be prosecuting former presidents. You'll hear from my distinguished opponent outlandish hypotheticals about presidential assassinations of political opponents. That's not an official act. That is not covered here. That is not what we're talking about. Presidents need the freedom to protect all of us. And only absolute immunity from criminal prosecution can give them that freedom. Thank you.",

Is the office of the presidency created over two centuries ago imbued with the same monarchical privileges, authorities and immunities of the very same monarch we threw off over -- back in the 18th century? The answer is no.But to address what my distinguished colleague here had brought up, the president is immune so long as it's within the outer reach, the outer perimeters of his official authority. That is what the case law with respect to the civil litigation has said. [23:30:02] What is at issue in this indictment, what Mr. Trump has been charged with, are alleged criminal acts that do not come even within the outer perimeters of his official authority. To be clear, the alleged criminal acts involves things such as having coordinating with state officials, trying to have them submit false slates of electors. Neither the Constitution nor any part of federal statutory law gives the president any authority to intervene there. It gives the president no authority to intervene with respect to having states change how they tabulate votes. There is no role for the executive branch of the U.S. government to be involved in that. Similarly, when it comes to how Vice President Pence was going to handle January 6th, there is no role for the president, for the office of the president, to be involved in that day. The 12th Amendment gives power to the vice president. The Electoral Count Act gives the rest of the power to Congress. The presidency is excluded. So, even if there could be some narrow carve out for immunity for certain official acts for a president when it came to criminal charges, the facts in this case do not apply to that. What Mr. Trump is alleged to have done in this indictment does not fall within the outer perimeters of his authority and, therefore, immunity should not apply.",

If they don't have immunity, no president is going to act. You're going to have guys that just sit in office and are afraid to do anything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, I think that -- that's why I agree with that.And there were three things to that point and to -- as juror four has stated, juror two, and I do agree with juror three in the sense that we are an emotional -- that we are an emotional country. However, I do think in that, we have to recognize that one taking a step like this to give absolute immunity would be both a dangerous and illogical -- it would set an illogical and dangerous precedent for future presidents who could possibly hire or send out a call for the murder of their political opponents. And this is not far-fetched. Right? We've seen this globally. We've seen this happen. And I don't think we should think of ourselves as a nation that is above something like that happening. So that is why I would say it's illogical and a dangerous precedent. Secondly, I think it is a danger to our domestic and international security because if we have a president who is or in a Supreme Court, which is a third point, but if we have a president that is above the law, which we are stating, no one is above the law, if we have that, what does that do for everyday citizens who say, well, the president got away with this, so why can't I?",

We're friends away from the court of public opinion, too. I agree with my friend, Brad. The founding idea of America is that we are all equal. Our country was built to get rid of a king who had a special set of rules. So, it seems to me that it's important both for accountability, but also the awesome power that a president has, the danger that that power can be abused, and because what Donald Trump is accused of doing, he's innocent until proven guilty, but what he's accused of doing is something that no president has ever done before in our history, try to overturn our democracy from inside the Oval Office.",

Arguably, they had to be dealt with first while you separately still looked into this weighty constitutional issue we're all debating now of, do you bring charges against a former president? The idea that, oh, they should have rushed, it would have been totally ripe for political criticism and it may have raised all sorts of different pre-trial motions from Donald Trump about them rushing to judgment on it. I don't think you can blame Merrick Garland. Justice does not move very fast. It's always slow in the end. The courts have actually moved very quick on this, given how slowly they generally move.
