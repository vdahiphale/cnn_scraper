The National Archives is the repository for these presidential materials.At the same time that he is stonewalling the National Archives, he is showing off to a group -- actually Mark Meadows ghost writer, his former chief of staff, he's showing off to them a battle plan for attacking Iran. Now why is he doing that? Because he wants to prove to them, hey, General Milley, chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, he's going around and saying that I'm crazy, that I want to attack Iran. Well, let me show you, he's the crazy one. He is the one that put together a battle plan, and I've got it and it's highly secret and by the way, I could have declassified it but I can't anymore. This was caught on tape. This is part of the indictment. So we know that Donald Trump first of all knew that he had classified material.

They're very bad like they'll make a lot of jobs much more efficient by getting chatbots to do it instead of people.There'll be huge increase in productivity, and the big worry is that huge increase in productivity, it should be good for us. It will cause the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer, and that's going to be very bad for society. Then these things like battle robots where obviously defense departments would like to have robots that replace soldiers. That's going to make it politically much easier to start wars.

And then there is the problem of, if these things get smarter than us, which I believe they will, in many areas and I'm beginning to believe they will and not too long, like in, you know, not in a hundred years. So I wish we had a simple solution. Like with climate change, there's a simple solution. You stop burning carbon and it will take a while but you'll end up OK. And it's politically unpalatable for the oil companies but if you stop burning carbon, you'd solve the problem. Here there isn't anything like that that I know of. The best people can come up with, I think, is that you try and give these things strong ethics. The one advantage we have is that they didn't evolve. We made them. We evolved and we evolved in small warring tribes of hominins. We wiped out 21 other different species of hominid because we're very competitive and aggressive, and these things don't have to be like that. We're creating them.

It's much better to start with ethical principles and say, you'll always going to follow these principles.But it's going to be hard because, for example, defense departments want robots that will kill people. So that seems to conflict a bit with putting ethical principles. There is one piece of good news, which is with nuclear weapons they were an existential threat and so even during the Cold War, Russia and the United States could cooperate on trying to prevent a nuclear war because it was clearly bad for both of them. And with this existential threat, not with the other threats, but with the existential threat, if you take the U.S. and China, and Europe and Japan and so on, they should all be able to agree we don't want them to wipe us out.

Clearly government money, philanthropy, MDB money, people like the bank, we cannot add up to those numbers, although there is an exercise underway in the bank as part of the evolution agenda to see what we can do with our current balance sheet to literally extract more from it, and then there is a lot of interest in governments and philanthropies to act to that coffers over time. But I think that still doesn't do it. We're talking tens of billions,not trillions in this effort. So the only way, Fareed, is to find a way to get the private sector to believe that this is part of their future. The truth is that renewable electricity today is actually cheaper per unit than fossil fuel electricity, thanks to what's happened in the last three, four years on technology both of generation, but also of storage. And that's only going to keep improving. So there is a pathway. But that pathway it seems to lead to the developed world currently because of the kinds of risks that people perceive in some of the emerging markets. But I think we have to do is to sit with people who invest in this, understand what holds them back, and find ways in the MDB system to think of a different playbook to take on the risks that they cannot take on. They must make the return for their shareholder. They have to understand the risks they're taking on, and that's kind of the thing we can do with informed risk-taking. That itself is what I'm looking at.",

I think therefore that's a real challenge for them to work on. The problem is, if what we go through is the same energy, intensive energy, emissions intensive growth model that we've had, I think the world does not have a hope of getting to the right place by 2050.So we have to find a way to create a transition plan for what we want to get to, and I think there is a number of countries participating in that idea. You know, it's in Indonesia, it's in Vietnam, it's in south Africa, it's in India. There is opportunities here to consider a transition from coal to natural gas to renewable electricity.",
