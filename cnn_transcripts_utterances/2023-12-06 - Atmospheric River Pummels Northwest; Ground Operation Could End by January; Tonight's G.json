I was surprised reading this headline that came late yesterday from CNN's reporting. That - I mean that's weeks away, right, if we're talking about January, that it would dramatically change, this house to house fighting would change and it would be, according to our reporting, a lower intensity, hyper localized strategy that targets Hamas militants and leaders. Speak to that. And also, why wouldn't they be doing that now given all the concern about civilian casualties? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Poppy, I'm going to give you some military realities from a soldier's perspectives. Three things are always important. Number one, you can't pronounce the names of the town you're fighting in, number two, you never have enough maps to know where you're going, and, number three, there's always telling you - there's always someone telling you that operations are going to end quicker they were. I'm skeptical. At the end of a - beginning of January, I don't think so. If the end of operations means Israel has reached their strategic objective of destroying Hamas, there's no way that that's going to happen by the end of this month. And I'm skeptical of anyone who says that it will happen by then. In 2014, as we've talked about before, in the operation in Gaza, Israel took about three months to complete their mission and then get out. We're at the end of that, and this is a much larger operation and it has a much larger, strategic objective.",

Israel is still having to go underneath to destroy and find tunnels, shafts and - and make sure the enemy is not in there. But you're also seeing, you know, a displacement of Hamas soldiers from the north to the center to Darbali (ph) and also Khan Younis. And the urban combat going on in that area are both below ground in the tunnels but also above ground in high- rise complexes. You know, when U.S. soldiers fought in either Iraq or Afghanistan, themost they had to clear in terms of buildings were one or two-story buildings. You're talking about high-rise complex that have, as you showed in the film a minute ago, a lot of munitions caches, a lot of enemy terrorists and the fact that there's so many - so many civilians on the battlefield in both of these areas that I think Israel is taking it a little bit slower, they're trying to corner off different areas and at the same time they're using more precision and smaller precision weapons to strike the kind of targets they've been striking from the very beginning.",

It's now the start of the holiday season. This one might be a little bit difficult to actually find on the television dial tonight. So, I don't know that it's really going to matter. And the issue for Nikki Haley is, I can see her securing the second position, particularly in New Hampshire, but can she ever get to number one? And the only way she gets - or any of them get to number one is if Donald Trump comes down to couple of notches and here to for only Chris Christie has been willing to take him on.

But it will take a number of factors to occur.I mean consider the fact that the president just said, President Biden, that he wouldn't be running if Donald Trump wasn't running.
