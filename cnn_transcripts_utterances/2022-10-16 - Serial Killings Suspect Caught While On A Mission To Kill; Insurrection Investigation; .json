So how did they narrow in their search and then make an arrest?CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT; Hey, Fred. Yes, they were watching him. According to police, two things contributed to this arrest. The first one being all the tips, the help from the community, because everyone was watching the surveillance video that police had put out and calling police trying to help them in any way they could. And then the other aspect of it was just old-fashioned police work. So once they got the tips and narrowed down one possible suspect, they started watching him, following him, trying to figure out if he had any patterns. And indeed they found those patters. He was going out late at night or early in the morning to dark places to parks. According to the police chief, he would stop, look around, and then continue moving. That's exactly what happened Saturday morning at around 2:00 in the morning. They say police officers were following him and as you heard the police chief there, he specifically used the words \"hunting\" and saying that this man was on a mission to kill. So instead they decided to arrest him. Now local authorities are, of course, thanking the public for all of their work. Here is how the San Joaquin district attorney is describing it.

First, your question, what do you get from those things you've got? Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer talking to their senate counterparts, they're on the phone with governors desperately trying to get the National Guard. An interesting feature that was not really brought up in the January 6th hearings was that the chief of the Capitol Police has testified that he asked on January 4th, two days before, to have the National Guard in place at the Capitol. He ran that through the sergeant at arms of the Senate and the sergeant at arms of the House who both report to the speakers of those two bodies, and according to his testimony, they came back with answers saying, they ran it up the chain and they don't like the optics of it.

There's been talk that the Secret Service had all of this information, and it wasn't shared.That's not the Secret Service's job. The Secret Service's job is a consumer of intelligence. The sharing with all the other agencies falls to two places -- the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. So on the FBI end they had a command post, they had daily meetings until the days immediately before where they had meetings every two hours, and they pushed out the intelligence to all of the agencies who were in those briefings. D.C. Metro PD, Capitol Police, Secret Service, DHS. So the intelligence, there wasn't an intelligence collection failure. They were getting the intel. There wasn't an intelligence distribution failure. It was going out. What we saw was an operational failure and that is because they simply did not have enough police on hand that day to confront that mob. Now, there's always the one wild card, nothing in the intel and no one predicted that the president of the United States at the time was going to hold a rally and tell the crowd to march down the street to the capitol and give them hell.

Why did they not, with all of the intel that was coming in, put out a joint threat assessment for January 6th when even the Capitol police's assessment, which was dead on, said violent members of militia groups, white supremacists carrying weapons with Congress as the target, will be coming in large numbers.That seemed like the kind of thing that a joint assessment put together by Homeland Security and the FBI with both of their seals on it that went to everybody would have given a common operational picture.

And while CNN is not able to independently verify what caused the fire, some details have emerged from pro-reform organizations. And footage obtained by activist group 1500 (INAUDIBLE), gunfire and alarms can be heard in the background as flames engulfed the prison complex. Meanwhile pro-reform news outlet Iran Wire reported on Saturday that a source within the prison said a revolt had taken place in part of the facility and that a fire had subsequently ensued. Now government authorities on Saturday were quick to assert that situation had been brought under control, with the security official telling state media that the fire had started after a group of thugs set fire to a clothing warehouse in the complex, adding that the so- called rioters responsible had been separated from other detainees. Of course, while the Iranian regime claims the fire is not connected to the protest movement sweeping the country, it is impossible to ignore the context here. The incident comes at a time when the regime is facing one of its toughest challenges in years, with protests not only gaining momentum, but also morphing into a much broader call for regime change. On Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed his solidarity with the Iranian people, drawing criticism from Iran's foreign ministry spokesman who said Sunday that Iran remains unfazed by the intervention of foreign politicians and would not give in to the U.S. government's, quote, cruel sanctions and absurd threats.

They're using it everywhere across the country from Pennsylvania to Georgia to Arizona. And then when it comes to abortion, they're kind of, you know, wobbling on this issue a little bit. Is it 15 weeks, is it a total ban? I think in this case, with Katie Hobbs, she hasn't really defined where she stands on the issue either. She's kind of saying leave it to the doctors. In a sense she's saying there should be no ban on abortion. And she's turning this abortion into a single issue for her on the campaign trail, and some Democrats are saying, I mean, that perhaps they should have a -- I guess a broader approach to the issues and not just run single issue campaigns on abortion. It might not be enough for the people of Arizona who want to talk about the economy, crime, and immigration as well. So, you know, we'll see what happens if these single issue campaigns really drive out voters. I sense that enthusiasm by women from the Dobbs debate has sort of subsided in some ways since the decision in June. I could be wrong. But it's -- the difference between -- I think without Dobbs we wouldn't see so many split races, though. We wouldn't see so many tight races across America and Democrats winning special elections they weren't supposed to win. I think on election night it's going to be a nail biter and that's why you're seeing split tickets and just -- and candidates that are just points away from each other.",

You couldn't just go to sort of (INAUDIBLE).

So, when you go to an OTC model, it opens up the market completely. Newcomers can come into the market, understand the segments of the market. You know, An 80-year-old who is home bound is not currently served by the present market. So, how do you reach these segments of the population? Likewise, someone for me, I'm 46 years old. I don't have hearing loss, but I could benefit too. How do you segment the market?
