If we walk over here, you can see some of the Folks with different reproductive rights organizations that are starting to gather. They're going to be holding a program and a couple protests starting here in the next hour or so.They'll -- it will really get going around 10:00 a.m. as arguments are being heard inside that building. Beyond these barricades, if you look at those speakers, those are the anti-abortion groups that are going to be holding their own dueling rally, really, at the same time as all of this is unfolding. It will be interesting to see, Kate, how big of a crowd gathers here. Of course, we're almost two years to the day since the Dobbs decision leaked that night. I was outside this building. I remember outside the Supreme Court, there was a feeling that everything was about to change. As you note, this is one of the first major abortion cases to now reach the Supreme Court since then. And so, we expect in the next hour or so, there's going to be what's called a die (ph) in here. They're going to have 15 people laying on the ground, representing pregnant women in those 15 states that have these very restrictive abortion laws, including Idaho, which is at this -- at the center of this case, Kate. We'll bring updates to you throughout the morning on how large this protest is as it really gets underway.",

So, you know, you go back, young voters, Biden versus Trump margin, you look at the final 2020 polls, you saw Biden won these voters by 29 points. You look at the last month, 2024 polls, you see, they're only favoring Biden by about five percentage points.You go, my goodness gracious, 29 to five, that's a huge shift. Gaza and Israel has made a major impact on the election. Here's the thing, young voters were beginning to turn on Joe Biden before any of this conflict, of the recent conflict in the Middle East, started anyway. So, the pre-Israel-Hamas war numbers, if you look at the 2024 polls, Biden was only favored by 11 points. So, we already saw an 18-point shift away from him. Yes, there has been a little bit of a degradation in his numbers, but the fact of the matter is most of the shift away from Biden was already happening before the recent war started on October 7th.",

We had a tie, which of course is a worse position than Joe Biden was four years ago when he won the election by four and a half points, but it was already a tie. Look at the recent 2024 polls. It was also a tie. So, the fact is we have not seen that type of shift that we would be expecting. And Sara, I will just note, you know, we're talking about these student voters, the share of the adult citizen population, university or college students make up, it's only six to eight percent, Sara.

On the other hand, you have Joe Biden saying, hey, let's talk about not only presidential accountability, but the abrogation, the restrictions of your rights. That's why he's in Florida. That's why he's been in Pennsylvania.And all of these issues that are being pushed to the state is just a reminder that Donald Trump and the Republicans have said, yes, let's push everything to the state. But what do you get when you when you -- when that happens? You get these very draconian laws. So, you know, reproductive rights is very important and we know that it's important because Republicans had taken it down from their website. They're not talking about it anymore and it's shifted to other areas. So, it's still a mobilizing issue.

And somehow, they have not laid worms in the brains of Democrats. It's just politics.But every time the Republican Party gets together and does something that is an alignment with supporting President Trump, then somehow all of a sudden it becomes cult like behavior. We just have to have a real conversation about the fact that, to Basil's point, yes, reproductive rights are going to be important, but most people who are pro-life in this country do not want women before the week -- six weeks being prevented from having abortion. Most people who are pro-choice do not want people after five months having abortions. That is a real conversation. It does not use women as a pinata and weaponize the womb. So, these are the real issues, the border that we're not talking about, the economy that's not working for people on Main Street, the fact that we just sent billions to Ukraine while we've got people in New York City in public housing. $80 billion behind on critical repairs.

Nine in 10 of those complaints were over refunds because the issue is so many passengers got an airline credit or miles instead of cash. This new rule formalizes that if your flight is delayed, you get your money back. Bags arrived super late, money back. Wi-Fi doesn't work, you also get the money back.These are the conditions in which a flight has to be delayed or cancelled to get your money back. If the flight's cancelled, you get the cash. Also, if there's a three-hour delay for a domestic flight, a six-hour delay for an international flight, one, the cause of the delay was the airline's fault. So, that excludes things like weather. For bags, if your bags arrive more than 12 hours late on a domestic flight, 15 to 30 hours on an international flight, you get your check bag fee back. This happens without a request, automatically, under this new rule. You would get that money back within 20 days, and it would be cash and not credits. Now, the Department of Transportation says that these refund rules go into effect in October. So, not in time for summer travel but in time for holiday travel, when there's so many cancellations and delays. Also today, the Department of Transportation is announcing new rules that make it so that airlines will say up front the total cost of your trip. That includes bag fees and change fees, John. A lot of pressure from the Biden administration here on airlines.",

Regardless, another black eye for Boeing as more whistleblowers come forward about problems on the 787. There was a new allegation just last week.
