But we've seen historically that things that happen outside of the United States foreign policy issues, other than 9/11, don't really affect a domestic presidential campaign.However, I do think that, you know, while President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are not looking at this through the lens of politics versus Donald Trump, I'm just trying to politicize and weaponize everything, they are 150 percent focused on trying to get this deal, right? And Netanyahu is in, I think, a world of hurt in Israel, in his home turf, and I do think extrapolating on the political, if there is a deal, I do think that helps Kamala Harris moving forward.",

This is not an Israeli -- this is not an Israel problem anymore, this is an American citizen who died at the hands of terrorists. Hamas, the group is terrorists. They're nothing more than terrorists. And nothing's going to change until they're stopped, until they're eradicated.Just listen to -- you know, you had the ambassador on before talking about it. It is impossible to negotiate peace with somebody who is -- you know, who keeps chanting from the river to the sea. How are you going to negotiate with somebody who wants to deny your existence? It's very, very difficult. And so, the Biden administration, I wish they'd let the Israelis go into Rafah, right and go in and get these folks. That's where they were killed, obviously, inside the territory there. And the notion somehow that we're going to -- that the Israelis are going to be able to negotiate a peace with someone who wants to eradicate them just for being who they are, just for being Jewish, just for being Zionists, it's mind blowing to me. So, I agree with Maria that it probably will not have a large impact on our domestic political race here in America, whether, you know, one side wins or another, but it is just -- it's -- this is awful. This is a crime against humanity that this is allowed to continue on and this terrorist group is allowed to remain in power.",

But I do think there are some really good things in this poll that I think indicate the momentum, and that's what you kind of see in the trends in the poll, right?

So, I like to look at those, you know, longitudinally, but interestingly, this poll, let me just point out some things that it didn't change. On the issues voters still have greatest concern about, they have the greatest trust for Trump to handle economy, Trump's up by eight points. On inflation, Trump's up by eight points. On immigration, Trump's up by nine points. And on the issue, we were just talking about, who's best to deal with the Israel war with Hamas, Trump's up by seven points.So, those numbers haven't changed from their last poll that ABC did and those numbers remain strong for Trump. And those are the issues that Americans care most about. We're told time and time again, if you look at every poll, what are the issues that Americans care most about? Those are the top issues. And Trump still continues to dominate on those top issues. So, I'm not overly concerned, but Maria is correct again, this is going to be -- this is a game of inches.
