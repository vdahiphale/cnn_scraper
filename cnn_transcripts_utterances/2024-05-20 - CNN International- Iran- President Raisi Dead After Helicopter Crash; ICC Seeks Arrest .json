Iranian officials say the helicopter went down in heavy fog on Sunday as it was flying over Iran's East Azerbaijan province. Now, the President and other officials were returning from an inauguration ceremony for a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Well, the chair that Raisi usually sits in was vacant and draped with a black sash in his memory, in a photo shared by state media. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed the First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber to take over as acting President. Elections are supposed to be held within 50 days.Well, CNN's Ben Wedeman is tracking the developments, and joins us now from Rome. Ben it was Sunday afternoon when reports started circulating that this helicopter had experienced what was described as a hard landing. It was only in the sort of daylight hours Monday morning that the news came that no one had survived this crash. What do we know about the circumstances and the investigation at this point?",

But, we also know that the weather wasn't very good that it was very foggy, that the helicopter went down about around 61 kilometers from the border with Azerbaijan in a very mountainous forested area, which explains why it took so long for rescuers to get to the site.Now, as far as the actual cause of the crash of this helicopter, Iranian media is describing it as the result of a so-called technical failure. The details, however, have not become clear. However, there are suggestions that one of the reasons for the crash is perhaps Western sanctions, which have denied for many years Iran's ability to go on the international market and buy things like spare parts. But, we are at the very earliest stages of the investigation. So, we'll just have to see what the Iranian authorities actually come up with as far as the cause of the crash is concerned. Becky.",

Thank you, Ben.Well, Lebanon has announced three days of mourning over the death of President Raisi. Now, the international reaction also pouring in, the European Union, UAE, Qatar, Pakistan, among countries expressing their condolences to the government and people of Iran. Russia's President Vladimir Putin expressed his sadness, Syria's President Bashar al- Assad commended Raisi's dedication to his work, And Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon, called the Iranian President a big brother and a strong supporter of its issues. Hezbollah also extremely close to the Foreign Minister who perished in this crash. Let's bring in CNN's Kylie Atwood, who joins us now from Washington, D.C. And I've just listed a number of countries that have expressed their condolences. What has been the reaction from American administration officials so far, Kylie? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: It's been pretty quiet so far, Becky. Yesterday, we heard from the White House only to say that President Biden had been briefed on the situation, on the helicopter crash, that was obviously expected to have President Raisi on board. We heard from the State Department saying only that they were closely monitoring the reports of that downed helicopter. But, beyond that, we haven't actually gotten a response from the administration, since it has been confirmed that President Raisi is now dead. So, we're waiting for that, Becky. It's important to note, as you and Ben were discussing just previously there, the question now is, who is likely to be the successor for the supreme leader of Iran? I've talked to U.S. officials who truly believe that Raisi was the most likely to step in and fill that role. So now, there are questions about, who that might be? Perhaps, the supreme leader's son. U.S. officials really don't know exactly where that is headed. And as you know extremely well, there are not formal diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Iran, which, of course, complicates this, not to mention the fact that the region is, of course, in a very unsteady state right now. So, U.S. officials are obviously to watching to see what the response will be inside Iran to this news. But, we'll just have to watch and see what they say in the coming hours here is only confirmed from the Iranian government just hours ago that Raisi did in fact die in that crash.",

So far as Washington is concerned, where do we stand with regard, one, the nuclear file, certainly, there were indirect talks between the deputy Foreign Minister, who is now the acting Foreign Minister, and the U.S. in Oman recently, and importantly, the complex and very complicated conflict going on at present in Gaza, and how that has played out between Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and of course, Tehran, Kiley?",

Thank you very much indeed. I'll have more, much more detail on the death of Iran's President, its significance and consequence coming later this hour, including a look, a closer look at who might take power next inside Iran. The Israeli Defense Minister says his country has a moral obligation to destroy Hamas. Yoav Gallant made the comment to visiting U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. It comes as the Israeli military says its forces are fighting and carrying out strikes across Gaza. Hospital officials in the central part of the enclave say an Israeli airstrike in Nuseirat killed 35 people on Sunday. The IDF, meanwhile, says two senior Hamas operatives were killed in airstrikes over Gaza over the weekend. Well, I want to turn you to this breaking news now. And in an exclusive interview with our Christiane Amanpour, the International Criminal Court's top prosecutor says that the ICC, the International Criminal Court, is seeking arrest warrants in relation to the October 7 in Israel and the Gaza war. Karim Khan says that the arrest warrants are being sought for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Al-Masri, who is not pictured here. In addition, Khan is seeking arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Let's get straight to Christiane Amanpour who broke this story, joining us now live from The Hague. Christiane, what more did the chief prosecutor tell you in what was this exclusive interview?",

He said, we are fighting human animals and we are going to fight back. So, you also have U.S. and other officials confirming the pockets of starvation, the pockets of famine, and all sorts of other aid officials. So, that is where the bulk of the evidence is, and that is why -- and this is the first time starvation, if it gets to an actual trial, will be prosecuted at the ICC as a war crime. Now, in terms of Israel being a democracy, and why shouldn't its ownjudiciary and law enforcement be tasked with this issue, he said, well, of course, they can and should, and of course they're capable of doing so. But, I've been warning, these are his words, Karim Khan, for months, publicly and in my conversations with the government, that if you do not pay proper attention to civilians while you are fighting the enemy and the terrorist organization, then don't complain if my office does something about it.

So far, we have nothing in terms of response directly back from them. It's also important to point out that Israel is not a member of the International -- of the ICC, but the Palestinian territories have been signed on to the ICC's jurisdiction since 2015.Now, late last month, Becky, you'll remember that there was some reporting in Israeli media suggesting that the International Criminal Court was mulling the possibility of also charging Israeli leaders. And in response to that, we heard a lot from the Israeli Prime Minister. He said it would be an outrage of historic proportions, an indelible stain on the concept of international justice and law. He said that Israel already has its own legal system that investigates violations of the law. He said that Israel would never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its right to self-defense, and said that this would set a dangerous precedent that would threaten officials from all democracies from fighting terrorism. It's also interesting to note, Christiane mentioned this briefly as well, that Benny Gantz, an opposition figure, a member of the war cabinet, in the midst of a very public spat with the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had nothing but defense of the Prime Minister in his statement, saying in part that drawing parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a bloodthirsty terror organization is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy. The prosecutor's position to apply for arrest warrants is in itself a crime of historic proportion. Another opposition leader in Israel, Yair Lapid, called this a complete moral failure. The National Security Minister, a member of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, called the court and the prosecutor Karim Khan \"antisemitic\". And we've also heard from the hostage families who applauded the decision to charge these leaders of Hamas, but said that they were uncomfortable withdrawing the equivalence between Hamas leaders and Israeli ones. We've also reached out to Hamas for comment, none thus far. But again, those hostage families went to The Hague back in February to file their own charges or to make their own complaints against Hamas. And at that time, a member of the Hamas political bureau had told CNN that going to the ICC was wrong and that the quickest way to get the hostages back was through negotiation. Becky. ANDERSON: It's good to have you, Scott. Thank you very much indeed, Scott reporting on reaction to the news that we've had in the past less than hour that the ICC is seeking arrest warrants against Yahya Sinwar of Hamas and a number of other operatives in the Hamas organization and Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister for war crimes over the October 7 attack and Gaza war.

The defense basically tore that apart and said he was completely lying about that. So, we'll see how jurors took that. And of course, after they aredone, then the prosecution has the chance to redirect with Michael Cohen. So, we fully expect to take -- for them to take some of that time to sort of really reel in their case because he is expected to be their last witness before they rest likely today. We fully expect that to happen today. And then, what's up next? Well, you just said, Omar, we don't know if the defense is going to call any more witnesses. We are hearing it's possible they might call a campaign finance expert. And last week, they didn't rule out the possibility that the former President would take the stand, though, experts would say that's very unlikely, but we shall see. In the end, the judge has asked both sides to be ready for closing arguments set for tomorrow. So, they may happen tomorrow. They may not happen tomorrow. But certainly, they are going to be prepared for that. And then it goes to the jurors and we'll see if it goes to them before Memorial Day weekend. It's a short week of courts.

If the hearing today had not gone his way, he could have faced imminent extradition to the United States where he faces life in prison, very likely. He is facing 18 counts, most of them under the Espionage Act. So, on the one hand, this is a big victory. The judges found that the U.S. assurances that were provided about his treatment were not sufficient.But, on the other hand, Julian Assange will remain in Belmarsh high security prison in London. And this sort of kicks the can, he remains in that legal limbo. Having said that, it does feel like things are accelerating. His legal team has been given just to the end of this week, until Friday, to submit what's called a draft order on this new appeal. So, that's pretty quick, based on past precedent of the sort of gaps between the legal dates when it comes to Julian Assange. And this is also a moment politically. There is a lot of talk here about comments that we saw from Joe Biden back in April, saying that he was considering a request from Australia to drop the case entirely. We saw a lot of flags outside the court saying, let him go, Joe. That seems to be the slogan for the day. And obviously, Australia has been vocal. The Prime Minister saying last month that he really thinks that enough is enough. So, on the other hand, his wife has come out and said, look, we are relieved, but this has taken an enormous toll on him, and how long can this go on.

Iranian media report the aircraft went down in heavy fog in a remote mountainous area of East Azerbaijan province. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has declared five days of mourning. Raisi was widely considered to be a prime candidate to eventually succeed Khamenei as supreme leader.Let's get some perspective now from Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour, who is a Senior Fellow at the think tank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Let's start with the details, as we understand them, of what happened, Karim. This is the President, the Foreign Minister, and a delegation reportedly killed in a helicopter crash, in an aircraft, which is decades-old. You make the point, posting on X this morning, that it's sort of ironic that these are men who control so much and yet are flying around in equipment which is so old, it seems, unable to protect them. KARIM SADJADPOUR, SR. FELLOW, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Its true, Becky. The identity of the Islamic Republic of Iran can be sealed in its slogans. It says \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\". But it never says \"Long Live Iran\". It has spent far more, billions and billions, on sophisticated weapons to counter Iran's adversaries, but hadn't spent that amount to prioritize things like internal safety and certainly the well-being of the Iranian people.",

What Raisi's will most impact and it's highly consequential here is the future of the regime, because as you alluded to earlier, Raisi was thought to be one of only two serious contenders to succeed the 85- year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who is one of the longest serving dictators in the world, and the other person who has been in the conversation to replace Khamenei is Khamenei's son Mojtaba Khamenei.

But, ultimately, as you alluded to, Ebrahim Raisi had almost a negligible impact on Iran's regional conduct and nuclear ambitions.And we're now in a -- a friend of mine, who is a professor at Tehran University, used to say that at the beginning of the revolution in 1979, the regime was 80 percent ideologues and 20 percent charlatans, meaning only 20 percent really didn't believe in the ideology but they went along with it. Now, it's the opposite. He argues it's 80 percent charlatans and 20 percent ideologues. It's a regime like the Soviet Union, and that it's ideologically bankrupt. So, very few members of its society believe in this \"Death to America\" revolutionary ideology anymore. And they're running out of individuals who both believe in the ideology and are competent. So, I would argue it's a regime that isn't really sustainable. And I think what Raisi's death could do is hasten one of two possibilities. One is a transition to more of a military government, and the second is, frankly, the implosion of the regime, as we saw with ideological regimes like the Soviet Union that proved totally incapable of reforming.",

The judge is back on the bench and has addressed Donald Trump. Then we expect star witness Michael Cohen to return to the stand in about 45 minutes or so for more tough cross- examination. It seems possible that Cohen will be the last person called by the prosecution. It is unclear, though, how many witnesses Trump's lawyers will call in his defense. Maybe none. The judge has told, I should say, both sides to be ready to begin reading their closing arguments, which could begin as early as Tuesday.Let's take a deeper dive as the trial enters its final moments of the trial here. Joining me now is Amy Lee Copeland, a criminal defense and appellate attorney. So, thank you for taking the time. Now, I want to start with one of the big moments last week, because that was when Michael Cohen appeared to contradict himself under cross-examination, essentially over an account of a call he previously said under oath was to talk about the hush money payment, but based on texts that were produced, it appeared the call, at least to begin with, was about something else entirely. The defense has clearly been trying to attack his credibility throughout this. Did you see that as enough to sink the credibility of Cohen in the eyes of the jury here? AMY LEE COPELAND, CRIMINAL DEFENSE AND APPELLATE ATTORNEY, &amp; FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Good morning, Omar. Apparently, it was a really big moment. All the courtroom observers say that that really caught the jury's attention. Omar, he testified -- Cohen testified previously that this 96-second call was about the Stormy Daniels hush money payment, that Cohen made the call to Trump's bodyguard, that the bodyguard relayed the message to Trump or put Trump on speakerphone. But, on cross-examination, the defense introduced all of these text messages that Cohen wanted to speak with the bodyguard about pranks that a 14-year-old kid had been making and wanted to get some Secret Service protection. The judge is going to instruct the jury that if you disbelieve a witness on one thing, if he lies about one thing, then you can disbelieve all of his testimony, kind of like you act in real life. If someone lies about a crucial point, you're always going to view them with some suspicion. We'll see what happens. The prosecution is going to try to rehabilitate Mr. Cohen on redirect. They're going to take the jury through. They're going to show the many times that the documents supported what Cohen had to say. But, unfortunately, Cohen is the link to the former President in this case.",

But, there certainly has been very compelling evidence that that was the reason for these discussions. That was the reason for the hush money payment. You look at the timing of the Access Hollywood tape. You look at all the scrambling about after that, and what happened. You have a boss, Mr. Trump, who is very penny pinching, who apparently, if Cohen is to be believed, approves a massive payment to Mr. Cohen and says it's legal services.So, you've got David Pecker's testimony. He certainly came across as a very straightforward guy that admitted when things went wrong and admitted the warts in the case. So, we'll see what the jury does.
