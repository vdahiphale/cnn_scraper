What we have learned is that President Biden has privately acknowledged that the next structure days are going to be critical to whether he can save his reelection campaign that he understands what would prompt him to accept, quote, it's just not working.That is, according to an ally of the presidents who spoke with the president directly. Yesterday, this person saying, he sees the moment with his clear eye. And then importantly, the president knows that there is a potential series of events that could unfold in the coming days and weeks, that would make him acknowledge that this simply can't be fixed. And this person said, what that looks like is the polls are plummeting. The fundraising is drying up and the interviews are going badly. He's not oblivious. This person said. They also described the president in this conversation as having been chastened, blaming himself, not his staff, or his terrible debate performance last week. And that this person -- the president said to this person, quote, I have done way too much foreign policy. He said, the trips that he made to France and Italy right before the debate had been a terrible idea that jetlag and the exhaustion that was prompted by those trips was not a good idea heading into this very important debate. And what is clear? If it wasn't clear already, based on this reporting, Dana, is that every single thing now that the president says, the president does in any of his public appearances in the coming days, whether it is at ABC News interview, whether it is that press conference that he is set to have with reporters next week, or the meetings that he is going to have, the conversations with elected officials, including a group of Democratic governors here at the White House leader today. All of that is going to be so important for him to seize, and to show that he can turn his campaign around. And I think implied in all of this, Dana, of course, is that there is a potential scenario where the president says, I actually can't fix my campaign.",

He was on CNN in the last hour. Here's what he -- his response was, I should say, to this new reporting.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUENTIN FULKS, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: There are a number of rumors floating out there. The president is in this race to win it. He is the Democratic nominee. And from our perspective, we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure that we're building a campaign apparatus to reach voters. The president in his own words acknowledged a poor debate performance. But at the same time, I think what we're sensing from people is a sense of urgency and fear from Donald Trump. And I think that the conversations that the president has been having with Democrats across the country is wanting to reassure them, that he is in this race, that he knows -- that he needs to reassure the American people and that our campaign is going to continue to build and scale to win in November.

Thank you all for being here. I know you all have notebooks and notes files in your -- in your phones full of conversations that you've all been having, as have I with sources.Jeff, I want to start with you. And just put into context what MJ is reporting. And that context is that the debate was Thursday. Friday, the scramble started for the Biden campaign in the White House to try to tamp down the concern among donors, among allies. What didn't happen between them, and as far as we know, pretty much till yesterday. Was the president himself getting on the phone? Yeah, he talked to donors when he was at these fundraisers over the weekend last weekend. But that's not the same as the reach out. And throughout -- through that move and that change, we have learned that despite the allies on TV over the weekend, it doesn't seem fully out of the question that the president -- if he believes it is best to beat Donald Trump with somebody else on the ticket, he's open to it. [12:05:00] JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And that is what is such a remarkable difference from just a couple days ago and you laid it out there very well. This is the president, former vice president, former senator who loved the telephone. He worked the telephone in so many ways through legislation, talking to foreign leaders. Now as he knows the power of the telephone, calling out on Friday, on Saturday. He did not talk to Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic Leader, or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer until late yesterday, we're told. And his aide said, well, he was busy on the road. He was in their states. He was in New York. This was not a President Biden, who was robustly trying to keep criticism at bay, working the phones all weekend, trying to sort of get things on track. This was a president we are told who was very insulated by his family and just a handful -- fewer than a handful of advisors. And he was not hearing necessarily the real anger and anxiety from Democrats out in the country, which is why we saw some of that play out on television. We heard at the very beginning on Sunday, give him a little bit of time, we're giving him a bit of space. When it didn't happen when he wasn't sort of reaching out, some of his allies sent messages through the television, like Nancy Pelosi, for example. She said, is this -- you know, is this an episode or condition? Wow, what a sentence is that. For someone who deeply respects and likes him. So, now where we are today? We are at the point where a decision over the possibility of stepping out is not out of the question. I'm told to distill a data driven decision. He is waiting for more data from swing states to show A, are more states now in play. Is Minnesota in play? Is Virginia in plays? New Mexico in play? Is the Democratic ticket imperiled if he stays in the race or not? But boy, at 12:30 today, that lunch with the Vice President Kamala Harris, and him just steps up the Oval. What a consequential meeting that is.",

You know, what will the president hear from some of the state governors that also are so pivotal to this decision making too. I mean, right now, I've -- I think you're right in terms of data and sort of what polling says, you know, that forthcoming polling, specifically on battleground states will be pivotal here. I've been talking to major prominent democratic donors that have been saying, that are expressing anxiety. That are calling one another after the debate and after some statements recently by Democrats. And are concerned about the way forward throughout this campaign and are saying that, you know, what may determine. How much they ratchet up their pressure on the White House for a change could be what polling says, and if it indicates a major drop, particularly in battleground states. The big question after the debate, of course, was this a one off? Or have there been more frequent sort of lapses by President Biden in the weeks leading up to the debate.

He increasingly appeared confused or listless or would lose the thread of conversations. People in the room with him more recently said that the lapses seemed to be growing more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome. The uncomfortable occurrences were not predictable, but seemed more likely when he was in a large crowd or tired after a particularly bruising schedule.KANNO-YOUNGS: That's right. That's right. And look, we don't know our reporting doesn't seek to sort of diagnose -- put a diagnosis on these events. We don't know if it was to the extent of what we saw during the 90 minutes through the debate. But talking to advisers, current and former of the president as well as foreign leaders as well, and European officials, people have noticed a decline thus far in the weeks leading up to this moment. When we say lapses, we mean that could be stumbling over words and remarks. Getting wrong sort of the description of a certain batch of Ukraine aid, stumbling over the name of your own cabinet secretary. It's interesting that the president recently also blamed sort of that circus of travel that he had leading up to the debate. Because we talked to officials that, you know, said that privately European officials that were talking to him were making remarks about noticing his decline, even crowding around him when he would come into a room.

This tempo of carefully curated mostly scripted appearances is par for the course for Biden's operation.

Anything, just speaking more broadly, anything that reemphasizes a weakness in a campaign is hurtful to that campaign. We've seen it across the board on a bunch of different issues over the years, but this one in particular, the Biden campaign never really figured out. Aside from telling people it's not a problem, how to deal with the fact that he's old. And how to explain the fact that -- like that he is -- you know, explain away some of the stumbles, et cetera.

Should the president decided to make a decision to step aside.Most Democrats believed that he would hand things over to her or the keys over to her. And there was a campaign in waiting and apparatus in waiting. And indeed, the campaign war chests are waiting. Now some of the money has been raised through the DNC. That would remain available to whoever else, if there would be a contest here. But look, time is of the essence. From Friday, it's four months till the election day. But that's not the timeframe here to get access to state ballots, it is much, much, much sooner. And the Democratic convention is only a month and a half away. So, we're talking just a period of a few weeks here for not only her, but also should this happen. Who would her running mate be? So, there's some thinking I'm told inside the Democratic Party, where the open contest, if you will, would be for that position.

After the roe decision, you could see her kind of come into her own issues very comfortable with the subject matter. And as a prosecutor, she's been prosecuting the case against Trump and on the campaign trail for a long time. One thing -- one sort of unusual part about this week, the silence you hear from the Trump side and the Republican side is really uncanny. I mean, be careful what you wish for in terms of that. But look, we do not know again, if it would be a smooth process. Lloyd Doggett was on our air this morning, telling John Berman that he believes it should be an open process.
