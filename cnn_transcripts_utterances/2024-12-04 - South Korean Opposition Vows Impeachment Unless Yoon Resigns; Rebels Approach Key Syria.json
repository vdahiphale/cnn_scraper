Here are some of the top stories we're following today.South Korea's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing calls to resign and the threat of impeachment after attempting and failing to impose martial law. The main opposition party says it plans to file treason charges against Yoon as well as his defense and interior ministers. The search for two Americans and a Canadian climber who went missing while trying to summit New Zealand's highest mountain has been postponed due to severe weather. The climbers were last seen on Saturday when they flew by helicopter to a camp on Mount Cook. Rescuers hope to resume the search on Thursday once conditions improve. And a small asteroid lit up the sky in eastern Russia overnight producing a spectacular fireball. Astronomers with the European Space Agency spotted the space rocket about 12 hours before it hit Earth's atmosphere. They estimate it was a little over two feet wide.",

And unlike, for instance, 2015, when they were also very much on the defensive, that's when the Russians came to their defense.Hezbollah was in Syria in large numbers helping the Bashar al-Assad regime. The Iranians were there. Now we know that Hezbollah has been gutted by the war with Israel. The Russians are distracted by the war in Ukraine. The Iranians have seen multiple senior leaders in Syria killed by the Israelis and also by the opposition as well. So they find themselves really in a very precarious situation where they're losing ground, their army is riddled with corruption, morale is very low among the ordinary troops, and their serious traditional allies don't seem to be able to come to the defense of the regime as they did before. So they are in a very precarious position today -- Max.",

      "sentences": "That's right. Since the day after the ceasefire was declared. Last week, we began to see Israeli forces shelling villages in the south. We have seen repeated airstrikes, of course, in parts of southern Lebanon as well.And, of course, in response to that, we've seen Hezbollah now targeting Israeli-occupied territory as well, firing two projectiles and no injuries reported. But this is raising concern over the fragility and, of course, the longevity of this truce agreement that has been established. And as you heard that warning from the Israeli defense minister, it's quite staggering, really. The differentiation between Hezbollah and the Lebanese state, of course, has been crucial. Israel has repeatedly maintained that it is targeting Hezbollah targets within Lebanon, that it is focused on militants and their infrastructure across the country. But this has raised concern over the security and even territorial integrity of the Lebanese state. We've previously heard, of course, over the course of these hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah from the Lebanese state, who have repeatedly said that they do not want to be dragged into an all- out war. We have seen Hezbollah's military capabilities significantly diminish. And what we've been hearing from the Israeli defense minister is that there will be no differentiation, essentially. So, talking about Beirut in particular, while we had seen airstrikes, for example, focused more specifically on the southern suburbs of Beirut, particularly in the Dahiya area, which is considered a Hezbollah stronghold, this warning suggests that Israel may target any areas of Beirut. And we've previously heard such warnings from more far-right members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet who have said they can copy and paste what is happening in Gaza, in Lebanon. A staggering and troubling statement there. But, of course, this comes with a huge amount of concern. We've seen at least, according to a U.N. peacekeeping source, 100 violations of the ceasefire by the Israeli authorities. We've heard from the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who told Israeli media that both the U.S. and France have expressed concern over Israel's potential violations. But, again, questions as to whether this will lead to a complete collapse of the ceasefire remain. There's certainly that international pressure still. And, of course, important to underscore that we are still in that initial 60-day phase. So it is very much a process. We are expecting to see Israeli forces gradually withdrawing. And, of course, the hope is that after this 60- day transitionary process, we will see a lasting ceasefire. But at this stage, the repeated violations now on both sides are raising concerns that that may not be the case.",
