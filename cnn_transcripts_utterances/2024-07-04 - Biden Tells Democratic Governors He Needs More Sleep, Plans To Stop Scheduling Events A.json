Because he -- it's only a few months until the election, last time until people actually start casting ballots. There's a lot of time for polls to move, but there isn't actually that much time for Biden to make a decision.",

      "sentences": "Right. So when Donald Trump said, \"I could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose any support,\" he wasn't really only talking about himself. He was talking about the modern era of American politics.It really isn't possible anymore for the floor to fall out under a candidate. We're too polarized. We're too dug in. Negative partisanship locks in too many people. There are too many people who don't want Donald Trump to be president but the floor to completely fall out under Joe Biden. But as I said, going into this debate, he was the one who was trailing. If you look at the Electoral College, the two southeast swing states of North Carolina and Georgia look almost completely out of reach. The two southwest swing states of Arizona and Nevada, not quite as bad, but close to being that bad for Biden. And I think most Democrats understand that the only realistic path at this point for him to get to 270 again would be to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, three of the states that we're in what I call the Blue Wall. And I have seen post-debate polling in all three of those states that have Biden down six to seven points. States that, in all likelihood, Brianna, he has to sweep. Now, you could say, OK, well, that is kind of an inflated number because we're still in the immediate blast radius of the debate. But even if some of that rolls back, we're still talking about deficits of three, four and five points. With the question of, where does he go to get those extra votes, given the numbers I mentioned to you before, among people voting for third parties or people who haven't voted in 2020. And 85 percent of them are saying he's too old for the job, 70 percent or so are saying they disapprove of his job performance, his policies have left the country worse off. It may be a raw deal for Biden, but among political professionals in the Democratic Party, there is enormous skepticism that this is something that can be recovered from. A lot of doubt about Harris, whether she would be better, but at least that would be shaking up the deck, in the view of many of them, rather than sticking with what looks like now, a hand that has almost no chance of winning.",

And it's coming on the heels of an updated response from Hamas to an Israeli proposal. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza and that includes Americans. And right now, it's unclear how many are still alive. CNN international correspondent, Jeremy Diamond, is in Jerusalem for us on this. Jeremy, is this deal getting any closer?",

      "sentences": "This latest accuser is alleging sex trafficking, being forced into prostitution. It's really, really bad. And as you point out, this is the ninth lawsuit since November.Let me read a little bit from her suit, which encapsulates what Adria English is alleging that Diddy did. She says, \"The plaintiff agreed to\" -- what the suit says. \"The plaintiff agree to what she believed to be legitimate employment with defendant Combs and BBE as entertainment at the 'White Parties' in The Hamptons, New York, and Miami, Florida, from 2004 to 2009. \"Plaintiff did not agree to a lifetime of aftermath of being used as a sexual pawn for the pleasure and financial benefit of others.\" So what she's alleging here is that Diddy was using her to have sex with influential people. And one of the reasons why people are so interested in this particular suit is because those \"white parties\" that didn't use to throw, from 1990 to 2009, we're a huge deal. I mean, the most coveted invitation you could get. And it include people -- included people from the entertainment industry, from the financial world. I mean, huge names, who's who in entertainment, pop culture, Wall Street. And so people are really wondering, if this goes to court, who we might see as potential witnesses. Naturally, Diddy's people are pushing back. We have the statement from the attorney, who says that, \"We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone.\" And unfortunately, Boris, with so many lawsuits, you know, being piled up against him and our own reporting, where we broke the video of him assaulting Cassie Ventura, and she was the first lawsuit, his former girlfriend. People are not thinking that they can really trust anything that comes out of Diddy's camp.",
