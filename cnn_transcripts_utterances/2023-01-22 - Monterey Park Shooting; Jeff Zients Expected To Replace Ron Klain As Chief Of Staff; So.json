At least 10 people were killed and another ten hospitalized after a mass shooting Saturday night in Monterey Park. The Los Angeles County sheriff describing the assailant as an Asian male who fled the scene and remains at large. The shooting happened inside a dance studio seen in these images here shortly after 10:00 p.m. local time during a Lunar New Year holiday celebration. President Biden and Vice President Harris have both been briefs on the attack and earlier today law enforcement officials shared some details on the investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF ROBERT G. LUNA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT: Everything is on the table. We don't know if this is specifically a hate crime defined by law. but who walks into a dance hall and guns down 20 people? There were multiple rounds fired at the first location where we have all the victims and survivors. We don't know how many rounds were fired. Different weapons have been described. In regards to the specific weapon, we don't believe it was an assault rifle at this time, but again that is part of the investigation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they're telling us that they're looking into this second incident as possibly connected.Now this shooting happened at 10:22 p.m. local time. That is when police were called. The second incident we're talking about is in Alhambra, which is north of where we are standing here. And that was also at a dance hall that was about 20 to 30 minutes after this shooting. And they said that at that second location, a person came in with a gun, also described as an Asian man suspect. And people wrestled with him, tackled him and took the weapon away from him. Police confirmed that they do have the weapon recovered from that scene. And while it is possible that that may be the weapon used here, they are still working and investigating on whether these two things are related. Now, let's show you a little bit of what is behind me here. We're on a street that as of yesterday was filled with more than 100,000 people celebrating a Lunar New Year festival. Now there is an FBI mobile unit there. The shooting took place at a business just around the corner there. We also spoke with Congress member Judy Chu. She was at the festival during the day yesterday. And she reflected on just the senseless tragedy that then followed at this private business at night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): It was a horrific crime regardless. And the availability of guns that can do this kind of mass damage is so horrific. It just shows that there is just too great of an availability of these kind of weapons that can do so much damage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And in Alhambra they tried to shoot at them but thankfully they were able to wrestle the weapon away. But we will know more details about who the shooter is and have a description of the shooter.

He was a former Secret Service agent under President Obama and a corporate security consultant. Jonathan, so good to see you. So that press conference earlier was interesting. There was a vague description of the suspect, who is at large, an Asian man, between the age of 30 and 50. There was a description -- a vague description of a white van. And then we heard investigators say that there was another event that they want to see if there is a correlation. A man went to a nearby dance studio. People there wrestled the weapon away, that person got away. What is the approach of this investigation in your view, based on what we heard from that press conference?",

What law enforcement is probably doing right now is either they do not have enough information to make affirmative attribution between those two incidents. Or and this is what I believe that they're leading to, is that they have a lot more information, items of evidentiary value from that second site that is actually leading them into, you know, knowing who the suspect potentially is and trying to focus their attention that way. Again, if it is the latter, law enforcement may not want to be telegraphing the information that they have so that they don't tip their hand to this potential suspect. What are the tools that are likely being used to zero in on the suspect?",

We have, you know, more than ten others at the primary site that had been wounded. So the crime scene processing is going to take a lot of time.They have to set the boundaries of exactly what defines the crime scene and they have to start and do multiple searches for items of evidentiary value and that includes ballistic evident, you know, the rounds that were used, the casings that were used. All of that are tools that are at the disposal of investigators to try to make attribution to who this individual is. They also want to get witness statements, you know, from witnesses and as well as victims. Now, the challenge with that is what we heard from Sheriff Luna is that there is a discrepancy with, you know, some of the statements that they've been receiving thus far. I want to just stress that that is not uncommon. It is actually very common when you have individuals that were put through such traumatic stressors is that they may not remember all of the details. And that is why law enforcement doesn't rely on those witness statements, you know, solely. They have all of these other tools. Let's look at the mention of the white van, right. We've seen in very notable criminal investigations lately, that video analytics and, you know, reviewing all available video can lead to the identification of a suspect vehicle. In this case, law enforcement is really focusing in on a white van. There are thousands of public and private camera systems throughout Los Angeles that will aid investigators in tracing down, you know, that van and again will that lead us to a suspect and I think that is why law enforcement may be hesitant to, you know, divulge some of this information as they are trying to quickly progress through this investigation so that they can get the suspect as quickly as possible without incident.",

They are facing the special counsel investigation over the handling of classified documents after Biden's time in the Obama White House. They are also facing expected battles with Republicans up on Capitol Hill as they're facing this divided congress for the very first time. And also as Republicans in the House have been promising investigations into the Biden administration, as well as are expected to put up road blocks to much of the president's domestic agenda. Of course, also happening at the same time, is President Biden is inching closer to the possibility of launching a bid for re-election in 2024. Those are all challenges and circumstances that this incoming chief of staff will be facing. Now while Ron Klain, the departing White House chief of staff, has been deeply entrenched in government and Democratic politics in Biden world for decades now, Zients comes to the job with a bit of a different background. He has more experience in the private sector though he did first begin working in government back during the Obama administration. And then he really became close to the Biden team during the 2020 campaign. You know, he hasn't been part of that long-time decades-long inner circle of advisers for the president. But he has grown quite close to the team as he worked with them during the transition period and also on that coronavirus response in the White House. Now, the White House still has not formally commented on this announcement but it is expected that Jeff Zients will be replacing Ron Klain when he departs as chief of staff. And I would note, there has been very little turnover among senior staff for President Biden since he's taken office. This is quite a big development.",

And we have this information from our colleague Josh Campbell where this standoff that you're looking at is believed to be associated with the investigation into this shooting that happened just a couple of blocks behind me. And that is from a law enforcement source telling our Josh Campbell. So this may be related and what you're seeing there are a lot of law enforcement vehicles surrounding what looks to be a white cargo van. Now, why that is important, we did hear earlier, a couple of hours ago from law enforcement here in Monterey Park, that they were looking for a vehicle fitting that description. And to remind folks of the suspect information that we were given -- very little. All the police have told us so far is that the suspect is an Asian male between the ages of 30 and 50. And as we were mentioning a little bit earlier in the show, they were looking at the possibility of two connecting incidents. They're investigating both the shooting that happened here in Monterey Park, as well as an incident in Alhambra to the north of us where an Asian man was described as coming into a dance hall there, where people wrestled him and took a weapon from him and that weapon was recovered by law enforcement. So now you're looking at hours later we're talking about, just checking our time here, it is more than 12 hours after this initial shooting, you have this ongoing police activity in Torrance. Now Torrance is, as I mentioned, about 30 miles southwest of us. It is closer to the coast. And so this is definitely an ongoing situation that we're watching very carefully and waiting for more police developments, Fred.",

So is that just somebody that just is waiting inside and waiting for, you know, some sort of police action. Again, this is unfolding extremely quickly. But I do want to highlight the fact that, you know, this was quick action by law enforcement. As Josh Campbell had indicated, these bear cat vehicles are up-armored vehicles utilized by S.W.A.T. teams throughout the country. But they're not patrol vehicles so they're not readily driving around, you know, Los Angeles or Los Angeles County. Los Angeles County So there is a high potential that this vehicle was being surveilled by law enforcement until it got to this location and then they were able to bring these right assets in to make this vehicle stop, hit it from the front and from the back with the armored vehicle. Again, this is a tactic by police to ensure the safety of the public. Again, trying to contain this threat into a smaller area while they clear the area of the general public.

County sheriff's office has just released on Twitter, including three pictures, three images of the person they are calling a homicide suspect as it relates to this Monterey Park shooting last night. And it has the three images there with a hat on, and a description, wild they're attempting to identify, they're describing this person as 5'10\", roughly 180 pounds or so.And so, Jonathan, it is -- is there anything to the timing of the release of this image while it is believed police have surrounded a vehicle that fits the description of a -- of the white van that the suspect may have been driving. And releasing this on Twitter while they also are either trying to communicate with the individual or individuals that may be in the van, at the very least, keep that van from going anywhere.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And I mean, there could be. But I think that the pace of the investigation is faster than what is coming out from the public information officers, right? Right now, we know that we have a potential suspect in a white van. That is contained by police in that -- in that parking lot. Not going anywhere. As Josh said, the position of advantage now shifts to law enforcement.So, the release of this photograph, again, could, you know, really be reaching out to the public to see, does somebody know who this individual is. Family members, friends. To garner any type of additional information that could potentially be used to, again, bring this situation and resolve it without incident, right? They don't want -- they're out in the public in a parking lot with police and what they don't want is to have a gun fight. They're prepared for it with the armor and their positioning. But they don't want that. They want this to come to a -- a final peaceful resolution and get that suspect into custody without incident. So, releasing these pictures, could be very beneficial. Again, it is another investigative tool. People would say that that is a relative or a friend, and give more information about who they are. Do they have behavioral issues or suffering from a physical ailment. That's going to lead into the motive. Like why did this tragic event happen by this individual. So this is all critically important for investigators. All of these pieces are coming in very quickly, though. We're watching this investigation occur real time.",

But also in Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., there are major lunar New Year celebrations happening here in the city today as we speak.This is supposed to be one of the happiest times for this community. It's supposed to be a celebration, a time of love, a time to be spent with family. This community instead today is mourning. I want to put up the statement from the NYPD who told us today that they are deploying those additional resources. I do want to stress there is no credible threat to this city at this Time that the NYPD has identified. But because this is of this incident in California and out an abundance of caution, the NYPD told us they are deploying additional counter-terrorism and patrol resources and will have adequate security presence at these lunar New Year events, many of them, as I said, happening right now in the Chinatown area of Lower Manhattan, as well as in other parts of the city. The mayor of New York, Eric Adams, taking to social media just a short while ago to express his condolences and support for the community saying that his prayers are with the families of loved ones of everyone involved. And over in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia police department also saying that they are deploying additional resources to effected communities in the area, increasing patrols as well. And we also just did hear from metropolitan police out in D.C., that is also doing the same. So, Fred, these communities across the entire country right now are celebrating what is a major holiday, it is a 15-day festival that extends for several days and what is, as I said, supposed to be a time of joy now stained by this horrible violent act.",

Seeing a much more relaxed posture of police that were standing behind the open doors in the squad cars. Our Josh Campbell is with us now. So, Josh, this vehicle fit it is description of what police say witnesses saw the suspect from last night's shooting in Monterey Park may have been in a white van.

      "sentences": "That's right. Law enforcement source told me that this van, the standoff on the screen, is believed to be associated with the manhunt in Monterey Park. You know, the police said, described the white van now in this city of Torrance, which is about 30 miles southwest of Monterey Park. We see police now hemmed this vehicle in with these BearCats, up-armored SWAT vehicles.And it's important to note that this is being shown on a delay as it is still a dynamic situation, just for the purposes of officer safety, just because we know sometimes, you know, bad guys watch the news. We are not showing real time images for officer safety reasons. But they don't believe that there is any reason to rush that vehicle. Now, obviously, that vehicle has been immobilized by the tactical unites. Before the break we saw situations end in different ways. And, you know, as I was mentioning earlier before the break, we've seen situations end in different ways. Sometimes whenever a suspect is confronted by law enforcement, we've seen them actually take their own life. There's no indication that happened here but that is a possibility. Of course, authorities are still trying to gather additional information. But because we seem backed away still, particularly as the images as the helicopter was showing the officers still behind their squad car doors, they weren't -- they didn't have their guns pointed at the vehicle. They were in a ready position, but shows -- tells us that at least based on the posture they don't believe that there's an imminent threat right now being posed by that vehicle. But there's still very much in the information gathering stage. And I think one thing we're going to see one of two things there. At some point, if authorities aren't able to open up a line of communication with whoever is inside that vehicle, we'll likely see either a robot come in. We have seen that where they make entry to gather information equipped with cameras to gather real time information about what might be happening inside that van, or you could see officers stack up with shields to actually go and then at least gather information, a visual, a light of sight about what's happening. But no rush by police right now, but obviously a dynamic situation waiting to see what happens with this van.",
