But on Tuesday morning, he does something new. He faces a judge for an indictment and an arraignment in a felony case here in New York City for an old hush money case involving Stormy Daniels. Of course, this was litigated during his first presidential run back in 2016. But now the Manhattan district attorney has brought this up again and a grand jury last week indicted the former president. So, this will all come to a head really the first time in an historic moment where a former American president faces in arraignment in a criminal court. Now I'm told that the former president was huddling with his advisors as -- after he arrived here in New York City, after flying up for Mar- a-Lago on Monday. Meeting with his lawyers and his political team as well. He is not expected to speak on Tuesday here in New York. He's going to save his remarks I'm told for on Tuesday evening at Mar-a-Lago when he plans to deliver a full-throated defense of this case as well as other cases before him. But now this legal case is front and center in the 2024 presidential race. It is essentially brought these early stages of the campaign to a halt. He's raised some $7 million in the last few days alone with his supporters coming to his defense. Even his rivals have been standing on the sidelines, essentially defending him and watching this case unfold. But there is no doubt on Tuesday morning when the former President arrives at the district attorney's office and later goes into a courtroom. He is facing an uncharted territory, something he has never done before in his long years of entertainment and political life here. He's standing in front of a courtroom in which she has very little control of. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, New York.",

Including a look at some of the other criminal probes plaguing the former U.S. president. Russian state media is reporting that a hearing is expected in the coming hours for the woman detained in connection with the blast that killed a prominent pro-Russia military blogger. Authorities in Russia are now calling it a terrorist act and suggest it was planned and organized in Ukraine. CNN's Matthew Chance is following developments and has more now from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): These are the extraordinary last moments of one of Russia's most controversial military bloggers at a pro-war event in a St. Petersburg Cafe receiving an unexpected gift. It's a small figurine painted gold wearing a combat helmet in his likeness. Investigators believe it may have been the bomb that killed him just seconds later. This was the devastation caused by the explosion in which more than 30 other people were also injured. Security cameras caught the powerful blast tearing through the building in central St. Petersburg. Russia's calling it terrorism, accusing Ukraine of orchestrating the attack. Something Kyiv denies. This is Vladlen Tatarsky. The outspoken military blogger targeted and killed. With more than half a million subscribers to his telegram channel, he was notorious for extremist views in his support of the war. And for criticism of how it was being fought. This is him at the Kremlin last year celebrating Russia's annexation of Ukrainian land with trademark vitriol. We will defeat everyone, he declared. We'll kill everyone and rob what we need. For him, Russia was not being hard enough in its campaign. Already Russian police have arrested a suspect. A woman who Russian investigators named as Daria Trepova spotted arriving at the cafe carrying a large box shortly before the explosion. Investigators say the same woman was recorded inside the cafe after Tatarsky received the figurine. Interacting with the blogger moments before the blast. She's also on camera outside the cafe as the injured evacuated the bomb site. Russian officials say Trepova was once arrested at an anti-war protest last year. And they say she's an active supporter of the poison and jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny whose organization, the Russian authorities also accused of involvement in the bomb attack. Navalny supporters deny having anything to do with it. But this is not the first time Russia has been shaken by the killing of a war advocate. This was the Moscow car bomb that killed Darya Dugina last August. The outspoken daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist. The Kremlin accused Ukrainian saboteurs of this too which Kyiv denied. But now a second killing. This time in Putin's home city of St. Petersburg shows how Russia's special military operation in Ukraine is reverberating at home. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow.",

President Erdogan has accused the Swedish government of harboring terrorist actors, including the PKK, the Kherson Workers Party, which the Turkish government designates as a terrorist organization. These are accusations, the Swedish government denies but at this stage, those talks between the two parties are still ongoing. But we heard from Stoltenberg yesterday saying that he is optimistic that Sweden will at some point join the NATO alliance.

Now, the U.S. government is saying that they were able to take steps to mitigate the kind of intelligence that the Chinese were able to gather.But at the same time, we are told that the Chinese government was able to remotely erase the data on that spy balloon, making it possible that the U.S. government will not ever know for sure what the Chinese government was able to glean from that balloon. In other words, the Chinese government may have been able to wipe all of the data on that device before the U.S. government was able to get its hands on it. So, the U.S. government does have some idea here of what the Chinese were able to gather, because they were able to determine that there were some pictures, as well as some signs that there were some signals intelligence gathered by this balloon. But at this point, the U.S. is saying that they do not believe that any of this intelligence that the Chinese gathered anyway, was more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to gather as they orbit above the country on a daily basis. Now, it remains unclear how much longer the FBI is going to be investigating this balloon. They have had it of course now for well over -- for about two months now. And they have gleaned some important new information about the algorithms that power the balloon software, for example, and how it is actually able to be maneuvered across its targets. So, what we're waiting for now, of course, is a fuller picture by the U.S. government about what the balloons capabilities actually are.

I mean, Laila, this indictment resurfaces all of the issues that cause so many swing voters and independent voters to pull away from Trump over the course of his presidency. Even if they liked some of the policies that he was pursuing the chaos, the vitriol, the unpredictability, the scandal. CNN poll out today, 60 percent of Americans say the indictment is justified. And those who the favor of view of him have fallen to only 34 percent. It is in some ways, the most difficult possible situation where the Republicans skeptical of Trump.

This is an article about promoting says Marlene Schiappa, women's rights and gay rights and attracting attention to those causes.Marlene Schiappa, rose to prominence when Emmanuel Macron was first elected and made a quality minister had been known as a feminist author before that. That is part of the questioning that's come around her decision to grant the interview and to appear on the cover, as has the forthcoming question of the reshuffle that we expect here in France on the back of the social protests that we've seen over pension reform, with many on her own site taking the opportunity to lay into her decision. It is a time of great political uncertainty here in France, but also people point out an ill-timed decision in terms of how it looks in the context of those ongoing protests over pension reform. It is on Thursday, that the unions will be back on the street for another day of mass strike action and protest. Melissa Bell, CNN Paris.",
