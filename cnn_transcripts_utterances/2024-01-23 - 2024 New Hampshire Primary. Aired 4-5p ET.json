There are anecdotal reports of high turnout. We will see how the next few hours remain here.But, Wolf. there's no doubt Donald Trump is trying to do what no modern-day candidate has done, win the Iowa caucuses in a landslide and deliver a knockout victory in New Hampshire, we will see if he accomplishes that this evening. Of course, this is now a two-person race, something that Nikki Haley has long wanted, long hope for. Now, she has it. The question is, how long will this remain a two-person race. She though was saying she's going to go on. She's scheduled a rally tomorrow evening in South Carolina. But for now, her campaign is focusing on those undeclared voters here in New Hampshire. The voters that makes so much of the difference, they make up 40 percent of the electorate. So, they walked into polling places today, you can choose a Republican ballot or Democratic ballot. Many of them have chosen Republican ballots. Of course, they are running essentially against a registered Republicans who were more likely to support the former president. So, Wolf, you can feel the tension here, this could either begin along chapter of the race going forward, or it could perhaps make this the one of the fastest primary races in history. There's not been a general election start in the 2004 campaign. It basically started in March 3rd. If he delivers a big win tonight, it could effectively start tonight here with rematch with Joe Biden. But Nikki Haley, her supporters believed that she will do very well here. And she said she does not have to win, she just needs to do stronger than Iowa. The question is, what exactly that margin will be? But for now at least, the polls open for at least three more hours in most of the state, even longer in some other parts of the state here. So the voting is still underway, Wolf.",

This is going to make, of course, the Haley campaign very happy, but you've got to look at the numbers in the end, right? You've got to look at everything in totality. The other thing that they do here, that its really quite cool is at this gymnasium, at a school here, every time there is a voter who registers the vote and who votes for the first time, they ring a cowbell.

It's not competing in that state. There are no delegates up for safe.But again, we're seeing the campaign focus from this issue of reproductive rights, which they very much expect and hope they say will be hugely mobilizing issue heading into November 2024. You know, there's no question that the Biden campaign though, even though they are focused here, would this event in Virginia, they are watching the Republican race for Republican primary, New Hampshire, very, very closely, as you said, at the Biden campaign, knows that this could end up being the night that sort of unofficially begins the general election. It obviously depends largely on whether Nikki Haley ends up having a very strong showing. Now, Biden campaign officials and allies are other Democrats out. We have spoken to. They have -- many of them said that they're sort of eager, they're impatient. They're antsy for the general election to sort of get going already. They believe that that is going to sort of jolt the borders that are not paying attention yet to the realization and the reality. And I should make clear this is the reality based on the Biden campaign's thinking that this is going to be a race that comes down to Biden and a Trump when it comes to November. So this is something that they're watching very closely. But for now, all eyes are on this event. And the issue of reproductive rights that again, they believe will be central to the 2024 election.

So you can see there are all kinds of voters.Actually right now, the table is empty, but I am reliably told the rush hour is about to begin five to seven. They could see the biggest rush. This pile of slips you see right here on the table, right there, when voters arrive, if they want to vote in the Democratic primary, they grab a blue slip right there. If they want to vote in the Republican primary, they grab a red slip right here than they go get a ballot. Remember undeclared voters, independents largely, they can choose which primary devoted and they make up a really large voting bloc here in New Hampshire. They will not tell me right now until the polls close how many Republican ballot requests they had, or how many Democratic ballot requests they had. Now, I'm going to walk backwards. We're trying not to fall and I'm going to go to the tabulation machine and I'm going to give you a real live count of how many ballots have been cast in this ward so far. We can't shoot the ballots just yet. But after these two women put their ballots in, I will shoot the vote count total. So you can see a live look. Let's push into the number right now so as of about 4:43 p.m., 2,310 votes have been cast here. 2,310. In 2016, which was the highest turnout, 3,700 votes were here. So they're about 1,400 votes short of that right now. Could they get record Republican turnout? That's still possible. Remember, there may not be that many Democrats voting because Joe Biden didn't compete here. Although we have spoken to a few people who did write him his name. We can talk to a voter right now.
