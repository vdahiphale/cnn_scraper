You can turn the setting off. But it's still one of the -- seen as one of the most aggressive safety moves yet by this social media giant.Brian Fung is looking into this forest. He joins us now.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. There are two key provisions here we need to talk about. One is this you know 60-minute time limit that you can actually bypass by entering in a code -- a passcode. And then the second, being suggested limit of one hundred minutes. If you exceed your usage of the app for a hundred minutes, the Apple suggests, hey, maybe you should think about setting a daily limit for yourself.And now, as you suggested, both of these things could be very easily bypassed by users. But you know, that kind of highlights the overall intent here, which is for TikTok to just kind of slow users down and pump the brakes a little bit, just say, you know, hey, you may want to think twice about how much you've been using this app. It's not really a hard restriction so much as a soft limit that gets you to reflect a little bit on how you've been using the app. The big question here is whether all of this actually works. And TikTok is upfront about the fact that you know, there's no scientific consensus about how much screen time is too much. And so, some of this is a little bit of an experiment here. And it just highlights the intense scrutiny that you know the Biden administration and civil society groups and activist groups have brought against TikTok and other social media companies for the potential impact that this technology may have on young people and mental health, Kate.",

I raised questions about how we need to fix our democracy, that if we were to actually default on our debt, for instance, that that is giving China the upper hand in terms to be able to show that this narrative that democracy is not working in America.

We're at the southern end of Patagonia here near Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world. It's right around the corner. You can see the airport there.And that is where we're about to board a ship and go around these mountains, that island with gorgeous national park there and sail five days to Antarctica to hang out with some whale scientists. But while we're here, we got this news out of the National Snow and Ice Center in Colorado that for the second year in a row, the South Pole, Antarctica, this sort of frozen other world, the ice around it is shrinking in the most dramatic ways. They're the lowest levels since we put satellites into the sky in the 70s right now. And it broke last year's record which was already studying enough. And for perspective, you got to understand that for a lot of years, science didn't know what to make of the South Pole, even as the North Pole, which is a frozen ocean surrounded by continents was shrinking and melting rapidly. The south pole which is a continent surrounded by oceans seems to be growing. And sea ice in 2014 got to 7 million square miles but now less than a decade later, it's just under 700,000. So, that's a 90 percent drop just in that swing. It has been yo-yo-ing. And science still doesn't know definitively what to make of this because so little is understood. But all the signs are showing to increasing vulnerability of sea level rise. If that inland freshwater sea ice on Antarctica, if that's released, if the weights glaciers goes like a -- like a dam failure, that would forcibly rearrange every coastal city from Miami in New Orleans to Shanghai and, of course, here in South America and Buena Aires and Lima. And so, it is of huge concern, it should be, to infrastructure planners, to leaders on the coast. The bracing was kind of built into the system. The only way to stop it, of course, the science tells us is to get off of fossil fuels, stop using fuels that burn. It's fastly and as equitably as possible and probably pull tons -- Giga tons of carbon out of the sea and sky that's already there to try to stabilize this. Because all of its connected and you're seeing both the megadroughts and the crazy weather patterns in North America were all connected on this little blue marble. And here's another warning sign that both the top and the bottom of our world are in trouble, Kate.",
