The bodies that are being brought out, one just behind me before, literally as you were speaking, Don, brought from the wreckage.There are moments when rescue workers run in desperately hoping that the noises or that the body they have seep may emerge indeed alive, but I have to tell you so far today, because of that hour you were talking about fast diminishing, that is less and less the case. And indeed, the devastation is startling. These streets of apartment blocks, some standing unscathed, perhaps with cracks, others tilted at an angle, others completely destroyed. In fact, we went to one street where bizarrely it seemed that every building in that had lost its bottom three floors, but indeed sunk down and was still standing. In one of those buildings, there was a gain, a rush of medical workers, a moment of elation with people thinking possibly within that building they may have found somebody alive in some of the cavernous spaces that occasionally get caused when rubble collapses in a certain way. But sadly, minutes later, they pulled out an eight-year-old girl who had indeed perished. Her mother there to put her on to the ambulance, move her away. But these bodies over here as they stand have some of them marked with owner identified, others are simply are going to join the large numbers here of people whose relatives may also have perished as well. But a city of this size, Antakya, often heavily populated with Syrian refugees, has been hit incredibly hard. And the scale at which we see streets leveled is startling. The anger against the government palpable, too. Many angry at how fast the government didn't get here on the first day. Others angry at the culture of getting rich by construction which led to some of the shoddy practices which clearly led to some of these buildings coming down. But the numbers, Don, just growing fast, and it is desperately heartbreaking to see endless bodies brought out on blankets from the rubble here. Don?",

His office releasing a statement saying, \"Toward the end of the Senate Democratic retreat,\" which was happening in Washington, D.C., \"Senator John Fetterman began feeling lightheaded. He then left and called his staff who picked him up and drove him to the George Washington University hospital. Initial tests did not show evidence of a new stroke, but doctors are running more tests, and John is remaining overnight for observation.\" And Poppy, as you mentioned, of course, he did suffer that stroke back in May. That's when he was running for the primary. He actually won that primary in the hospital. He was in the hospital for nine, 10 days, and then of course had to recover. And we heard him. He would talk about slurring his words, missing his words on the campaign trail. And as you mentioned, I have seen him up here since then. He seemed to be going about business as usual.

Later this morning senators will have their turn to get their classified briefing with officials from the Biden administration.This all comes as we are getting new details about what U.S. officials knew weeks ago about the suspected balloon after the Defense Department sent out an internal report that is known as a tipper through classified channels. The memo made clear that a flying object was headed towards U.S. territory, but it wasn't flagged as urgent at this time. Now this has, of course, become a political flashpoint with Republicans who are criticizing the way the White House responded to all of this. CNN's Natasha Bertrand has this reporting.

The Defense Intelligence Agency did send what's known as a tipper, essentially a report that flags foreign objects to government channels. This was disseminated across government channels, classified channels. And essentially anyone who wanted to read it had access to it.But because it was not flagged as urgent, it was not really briefed to the highest level. And it was not flagged as urgent because the U.S. has seen balloons like this before, right. We have learned a lot in the last several days about what the U.S. actually knows about this fleet of balloons and the surveillance program that they are apparently a part of. And they believed at the time that even though it was probably headed towards Alaska, it was not an urgent threat. It did not pose a military or a physical threat to the United States and, therefore, it seemed like the best course of action would just be to monitor it and potentially even collect intelligence about it. But when it did enter Alaskan airspace on January 28th, officials started noticing something odd, which is that it took a sharp downward turn over Canada and then into Montana.

She just said it shouldn't be Joe Biden. So, the Biden people, many of them are banking on the fact that Trump will be the nominee, and that the age thing will not be an issue.If the Republicans nominate somebody else, maybe it does become an issue. And why are we talking about it? We should talk about it in the case of Joe Biden, we should talk about it in the case of Donald Trump, or anyone else who runs because it's something we've never done before.
