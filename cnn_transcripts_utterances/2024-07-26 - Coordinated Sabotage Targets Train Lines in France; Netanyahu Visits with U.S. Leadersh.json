It is Friday, July the 25th, 9 a.m. here in London, 10 a.m. in Paris, with the countdown to the Olympic opening ceremony is on. The world's top athletes are gearing up for an international competition like no other, of course.But we begin with developing news out of the area around Paris, really. France's state railway company says there were several coordinated malicious attacks, including arson that targeted high- speed train lines overnight. They say the sabotage has disrupted travel and damaged several facilities. 800,000 travelers would be affected. Officials say the massive attack was aimed at paralyzing the high-speed line network and the train lines will be disrupted through the weekend now. Of course, all this coming as the Olympic torch relay nears the end of its long journey across France and just hours before the start of tonight's opening ceremony. CNN's Amanda Davies joins us now from Paris. It's, you know, where you are, a very tight security operation, but it's pretty clear there are several ways to cause disruption, and this is an example of that.",

There's going to be 100 boats, dancers on the bridges with the teams all parading down the river on open-top boats past some of the most iconic Paris landmarks.So, of course, there's so much secrecy, as there is always around these moments, about what we should be expecting. There's huge rumors that Lady Gaga and Celine Dion are going to be taking part. We haven't been able to confirm those. I haven't seen either of them here in Paris, but they are rumored to be here. They've had a few photos with fans. But the sports ministry have said the party will go on. We will just have to sing in the rain. The question is who will be doing the singing. We just don't know.

I hope it goes smoothly.Now, with a big day now here, the mayor of Paris is reflecting on why her city applied to host the Games in the first place. Anne Hidalgo says it was an act of defiance against a series of horrific terrorist attacks in 2015 which left 130 people dead, almost 500 wounded. She told CNN's Melissa Bell the city needed to show that terrorists won't win. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR (through translator): In a very strange way, it was because there had been attacks in Paris in 2015 that I really decided to engage Paris in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. We had just been attacked in January. We were attacked again in November 2015 because terrorists hate our freedom, our ways of living, women's freedom, freedom in general. They hate democracy. They attacked us. From there, we had a reaction from the Parisian and French population which was exceptional and an incredible capacity to say, you will not prevent us from living as we want to live. That was the reaction of the population of Paris, of the people of Paris, and I said to myself, we have to put a moment, an event, something that gives us air, that allows us to be together and to show this creativity, this resilience, this taste for freedom and democracy.",

And just take a look at the picture here, right. Kamala stepping up to speak on her own without Biden, without Netanyahu.There is a serious message in that. And that might be you're about to approach a tougher administration. And you have to remember this isn't just coming from Kamala herself. There is division within the Democratic Party. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu's speech. There is a sense that maybe when people go to the polls in November, that might be a key issue.

So you're not going to see a much softer tone in Mar-a-Lago, probably. And then he also has problems back home. Hostages families saying he's dragging his feet on this ceasefire. Why is he even there? Why is this taking so long? There is a deal on the table. It's been there for months. U.S. negotiators say they are nearing the finish line.

I was just on the Seine walking around, and music was playing, and it looked like people were testing systems. So I think they're all systems go with the opening ceremonies. But you are going to have two problems. One is, of course, lots of people can't get into the city who may have tickets. And then the priority for the Olympic Committee has got to get athletes moving. Athletes often stay outside of Olympic villages, basically for comfort levels.
