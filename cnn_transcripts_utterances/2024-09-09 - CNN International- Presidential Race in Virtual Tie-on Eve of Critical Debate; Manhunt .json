It's 09:00 a.m. there in Washington, it's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching, \"Connect the World\" and you are most welcome. The great debate is now just a day away. What both candidates have to overcome to win the head-to-head matchup? The search for a man suspected of shooting an interstate on an interstate in Kentucky stretches into its third day. We have the latest details on that investigation. And a wildfire continues to rage in California, threatening thousands of structures, forcing evacuations and prompting a state of emergency. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. It looks like a positive start according to the futures, at least of the week after Friday's losses. Tech stocks in focus today, especially Apple, which is about to unveil its iPhone 16 more on those markets as they open at the bottom of the hour. Well, exactly 36 hours from right now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will face off in what is arguably the most consequential moment in a presidential race full of unprecedented twists and turns. Their debate on Tuesday night will be their first ever face-to-face encounter, happening just days before early voting starts in some states. Just how critical is it? Well, a new CNN Poll of Polls shows the Democratic Presidential Candidates locked in a statistical tie. And the debate is being held in Philadelphia, which is the largest city in Pennsylvania, a battleground state that some analysts believe will ultimately decide the presidential winner in November. You see here Pennsylvania, deadlocked in that latest polling. As we count down the hours the candidate's activities leading into the debate offer a telling view into their drastically different campaign styles. Harris has been spending the past few days in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's second largest city, campaigning and practicing with her staff. Trump, meanwhile, is still airing grievances over his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, and threatening on his Truth Social website to imprison any election officials who, in his words, cheat in counting this year's results. Well, there's a lot to discuss here. Elaine Kamarck is a CNN Contributor and Senior Fellow at Brookings. Rina Shah is a Republican Strategist. Welcome to both of you. First of all, let's hear from the candidates themselves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're run by stupid people. Stupid, stupid people. And we found that out at the debate with Joe. How did that work out? And we're going to find it out again on Tuesday night. Is anybody going to be watching?",

And so far, what we've seen from him as we approach this really consequentialdebate is his desire to come across angrier and more unbuttoned, because he realizes that's what gets him the adoration that he long has loved, and he thrives off of that. So going into such again, a time and a night that is going to determine the future of this race. He knows he has to really try everything, and the everything means going back to his old ways while also peppering with something new. So, I'm not at all surprised to see his behavior recently, but I do know that he's going to have to inject a great deal more policy than he ever has before in order to come across as looking far more presidential than he did in his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic back in the approach to 2020's election.",

And if he's going to bring something completely out of the blue, his behavior on the campaign trail is completely unhinged from time to time. He talks about things that you have no idea why he's talking about them or even what he's referring to. So, I think Kamala Harris has two jobs. One is to present herself as capable of leading, and the second is to make sure that people understand that Donald Trump's head isn't exactly screwed on straight.",

So, he's got to take that into consideration. But he again continues to double down with that rhetoric that he thinks resonates with folks who are frustrated by what they believe is a Washington that doesn't reflect them. What they believe is a deep state that exists to get rid of folks like Trump, and so he's speaking to them more than anything. But what I'm most concerned about, and I think most average Americans need to wake up to, is that Trump and his people for years have been working the legal system, and they've been also working at the local grassroots level. In Georgia, for example, there are his loyalists embedded in commissions to do his bidding. And so, I think if this race is close, this is something I've been saying privately for a long time to friends, if this race is close, my worry is that this gets kicked to the court, and it gets determined in Trump's favor because of the many years that Trump has had to have his loyalists drilled down into the system.

But this one just underscores what a knife's edge this race is on. But if you look at this specific number, 28 percent of voters say they need more information on Harris, only 9 percent say they need more information on Trump. So, to the point that Rina was making earlier, and the fact that this is the sort of comments that we've been hearing from Donald Trump.

And it's never been easy, because it's almost as if we're working with a moving target here. And I realize that sounds bizarre to some folks, but you know, there was a sense in political circles in Washington for the longest time that this man has to be defeated simply on his face alone, he's not unappealing. But what we've realized, and what we ought to be clear about here is how much this election is about a feeling, a feeling of where the country is going. And so, though you have great folks coming out and doing that brave act of saying, I worked for this man, he's a danger to the future of our republic, it is helpful, but it's not enough. It has to be part of a multi-pronged strategy. So, I do commend the Harris campaign for trying it on for size and promulgating this message. It's important. But look, at the end of the day we know she's running a very condensed campaign here. Our timeline is so short, so she's got to try it all. But I will make this last point here, and I think it's been said before, but it bears repeating. There's a reason J.D. Vance is with Trump on this ticket, and Mike Pence is not. Mike Pence would not run again with this man. And that should tell everybody everything they need to know about Donald J. Trump.",
