The stakes could not be higher for all Americans, not just for lawmakers and for President Biden. Failing to raise the debt ceiling, for example, would delay payments to federal workers, Social Security checks. It would have a major effect on the benefits that veterans receive as well. If the government defaults on its debt, it could spike borrowing costs for consumers and cause turmoil in financial markets. It could through the economy into a recession when we're already on the verge of one potentially. It would also likely stifle job growth. CNN's M.J. Lee is live at the White House where this meeting is expected to happen this afternoon. But I think the big question that most people want to know is just do we actually expect any kind of breakthroughs or really substantial progress to come out of this meeting? What are you hearing from the White House, M.J.? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It's a good question, Kaitlan. This is the first time that the two men are meeting face to face in this new Congress. But it's hard to say whether we can really call this meeting a negotiation because the White House has been very emphatic and consistent in saying all along that when it comes to raising the debt ceiling there is going to be no negotiation. There aren't going to be any concessions, whereas Speaker McCarthy very much wants to negotiate. He has been taking input from his colleagues. There are obviously members of his caucus who are really pressing him to get deep spending cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling. So this is all to say the two sides go into the meeting today very far apart, and I think we can expect that this afternoon is only going to be the opening salvo. And needless to say the expectations are pretty low. And I think the problem, if you can call it that, is that they know that the deadline is June, and as you know very well in Washington, a couple of months is actually a really long time for all sides to really drag their feet.",

And then there is a moment where he turns to Chuck Schumer and says to the New York senator, you know, Chuck, I can't imagine you making one of those commitments.So, in other words, the president sort of signaling to McCarthy, yes, I know you are speaker, but I also happen to know that you are a very compromised one at that.

And Secretary Blinken said very, very clearly, that is no substitute for direct Israeli-Palestinian efforts to improve their -- to improve their dialogue.And it's far from clear at the moment that Saudi Arabia would actually join Netanyahu's circle of peace. Why? Because they see themselves as this hugely important, the most powerful, pivotal Muslim nation in the world, and they don't want to -- they don't want to give up that position to make a deal with Israel if the Israeli leader at the time, Netanyahu right now, cannot deliver what they want.

You know, last season, we went through, he retired, he thought about it, he came back, and you guys just kind of discussed it. It was not the season I imagined he was coming back for. The Bucs struggled, you know, much of the way through, didn't even have a winning record.And you kind of hit it there, Don, you know, Brady didn't really look like himself this year. He kind of looked like he didn't want to get hit anymore. Yes, we weren't used to seeing the -- you know, him losing so many games. He lost more games this year than he had lost in a -- since I think it was high school or something like that. So, you know, but it's definitely a day -- a sad day for football fans, guys, because Tom Brady gave us so many incredible moments over the years. All of the Super Bowl appearances and all of the comebacks. You know, I like to say, there's never going to be an athlete like Tom Brady because he started off as the biggest underdog there is. A sixth-round pick, you know, pick 199, a guy that was expected to do nothing, and then he turned into the greatest champion in NFL history. And one of the greatest champions, you know, we've ever witnessed in sports winning seven Super Bowls, something that is likely never going to be done again.

And, you know, whenever he was on, you know, in a game, and he was down, guys, you never wanted to turn it off, because you knew he could bring the team back. And we even saw it this year in a couple of games. You know, even that Saints game, I think it was on Monday Night Football, they had no business winning, they were down two scores with like a minute and a half left.
