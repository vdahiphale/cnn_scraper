      "sentences": "Well we have much ahead from both campaigns but let's begin with Kristen Holmes who's been following the Trump campaign in New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump spoke to a packed house at Madison Square Garden in New York giving what was his traditional campaign speech filled with quite a few falsehoods particularly when it came to immigration. Just to go over a few of the things that he said. He talked about the fact that criminal migrants were pouring in across the border from prisons and insane asylums -- just to be clear that's something CNN has fact-checked on a number of occasions and found that even the campaign couldn't give any examples of that happening. He talked about how Venezuelan gangs were taking over all of America and in particular Aurora, Colorado. I will say as somebody who was with him in that rally in Aurora, Colorado there was an incident at an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado. We have spoken to a number of state and local officials who have said that it was completely blown out of proportion. Actually the rhetoric around it was creating more problems for the community. He also talked about immigration in general in Springfield, Illinois saying that a load of illegal immigrants were dropped into Springfield, Ohio. One thing we can say that we know is that most of the people who are on the ground in Springfield are here legally through a specific program, the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to that he talked about the hurricane response to Helene something that he's talked about a lot. Saying that there were no federal officials on the ground that no one could be seen, nobody was helping. That we know not to be true for both Republicans and Democrats on the ground who have described it as a helpful response, particularly the federal response. He also said that FEMA didn't have enough money to help with disaster response. They do because they had moved all of their money to help with migrant housing. That is not true. FEMA has multiple pots of money. One of them is for disaster relief, another is for migrant housing. But it's a congressional allotment, meaning that money from migrant housing cannot be taken and used for disaster relief and vice versa. The other thing that he talked about was foreign policy. He said without any evidence or proof that neither Russia would have invaded Ukraine was he in office, or the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel. They said that both of those things would have never happened if he was in office. But all in all, it was his traditional campaign speech. And I will say that despite using this dark, fear-based rhetoric on immigration, the crowd here, a full house at Madison Square Garden, was incredibly receptive to this rhetoric. It's unsurprising that we learned that Donald Trump, who believes that this kind of rhetoric helped propel him to the White House in 2016, is also of the belief that it could help him again in 2024. And if you base it just on this crowd tonight, he might have a point. People were standing up, they were using applause lines for several of these various points, particularly the darkest points when it came to immigration. Now one thing I do just want to quickly point out is what happened before the rally, because as somebody who has attended dozens of these Trump rallies, the pre-show rhetoric before Donald Trump took the stage was some of the darkest rhetoric I've ever heard at one of these rallies. They were name-calling. I just want to point out some of the things that we heard from these speakers ahead of time. One person called Kamala Harris the anti-Christ and the devil. Another person referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage, something that has received massive backlash from both Democrats and Republicans. Another person referred to illegal immigrants as effing illegals. Someone else said Hillary Clinton was a, quote, sick bastard. And that is just the actual specifics. We also heard a lot of nativist rhetoric talking about how America is for Americans only and that type of thing. It is clear that this is the tone that Donald Trump's team, Donald Trump's campaign, is setting. Just keep in mind what this event was. This was the kickoff of the final week of the campaign before voters head to the polls on November 5th. Kristen Holmes, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's great to be with you. I absolutely agree. It was just insulting comment after racist comment after disparaging comment. And that darkness is very symptomatic of MAGA having as its leader an individual who regularly traffics in these kinds of remarks. You know, it's not new. Trump's talked about immigrants from insert expletive countries and called many Mexican immigrants racist. He's regularly used dehumanizing language. He once called Baltimore a rat and rodent infested mess. This is very much in line with the remarks that were here last night.

Latinos are also not single issue voters when it comes to immigration. But I really think that in states like Arizona, in states like Texas even, where there are some down ballot races that are competitive, insulting Latinos, insulting immigrants generally, is just a horrible strategy.

And the data are really striking. A recent New York Times/Siena poll was even more discouraging, I think, for Harris than the CBS poll.It found that 78 percent of Black voters support Harris. That's down significantly from about 85 percent who voted Biden in 2020. And when you break the divides down by gender, it's even starker. 20 percent of Black men want Trump elected compared to about 12 percent of Black women. I think it is hard to know exactly what's driving Harris' shortfalls with this demographic. I think part of the issue is just perceptions of the economy. Trump claimed correctly that he had the lowest Black unemployment rate and the lowest Black poverty rate during his administration. Both of those numbers improved even more during the Biden administration. But still, the polling shows that about 75 percent of Black Americans now rate the economy as either fair or poor. I think that's likely due to cost-of-living increases that have eroded wages in real terms. That affects Americans generally, but I think it's disproportionately affected the Black community.",

I think he was at Madison Square Garden because it gives him a platform to depict New York City as kind of a microcosm of the broader problems that he says afflict America. Skyrocketing cost of living, rampant inflation, overregulation, high crime, etc. But I think when we get into this last week, it is going to be all about barnstorming these swing states.
