      "sentences": "Yes, John. So, two sources briefed on the matter to my colleagues, Evan Perez and Kylie Atwood. that the FBI has said significantly narrowed the pool of potential suspects here in this investigation. They have been conducting interviews over the last several days, and they believe that they are getting a lot closer to finding this leaker, primarily because the alleged leader left a forensic trail that investigators have been able to really home in on.So, really significant here, especially as we're learning more about the suspected leaker from \"The Washington Post\", which says that it found a member of the original group where these classified documents were posted who knew the leaker, who knew the suspect's identity, as well as where he allegedly worked. Now, it is not clear whether that is the same individual that the FBI is homing in on. But we are told that even before this story came out by \"The Washington Post\", the FBI had generated a number of leads based again on this forensic trail that this person has left. John.",

Here, we're talking about a Republican lawmaker, now exiled lawmaker Liz Harris. Before she was elected in November, she was known within the state as a well-known peddler of election lies. The kind of election lies that really bridged on the outlandish.Well, once she was elected in February, this is just a few months ago, she invited a conspiracy theorist to speak at a hearing. She was the expert witness, if you will say. The conspiracy theorist then said some outlandish things, one of the things that this conspiracy theorist testified to is that the Arizona governor, Democrat Katie Hobbs, was being paid by the Mexican cartels. Well, that blew up on right wing media. And so, then the Republican House -- as Republican Majority House gathered to discuss whether or not Harris should go. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX KOLODIN (R), ARIZONA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  They will perceive that they don't have a true voice in this body, because when they elect somebody to rock the boat, and she does it, about a -- in the wrong way, a way that should have been better considered that that member will be expelled. LUPE DIAZ (R), ARIZONA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  We need to keep the bar and not lower the bar. And it is -- it's a tough decision to make. I did read through the, you know, I did read through the committee's report, and because of that I really feel that, you know, this is -- this -- the vote is justified. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Millions of people on Hokkaido received the order urging them to take shelter. And then this led to widespread confusion then once the order was lifted. Local officials say, the alert was sent in error as the missile fell into the waters off the Korean Peninsula.And right now, tropical cyclone Ilsa is swirling off Australia's west coast and is expected to make landfall with winds up to 150 miles an hour. Forecasters warn it could be one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in more than a decade. It's expected to make landfall within the next few hours. We'll be tracking that one closely for you. Brazil's President, Lula, is in China this week to meet with Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.

We're going to ask you first, Nic, what you can tell us about this breach that's being investigated at this -- at the moment.NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:   Yes, official and sensitive as well, the document said it was handed into the British broadcaster, the BBC. Literally just around the corner from the hotel where the president was staying while he was in Belfast. But it was found on the ground, not far from the hotel. It's not clear yet to the police in Northern Ireland how it got there. Who was responsible for leaving it. But was it stolen? Was it dropped? Was it just, you know, was it just a mistake or perhaps somebody put it there intentionally? Not clear. It was dated the 10th of April, the document. And, of course, the president arriving on the 11th and leaving on the 12th. So, it was very, very -- it had details, a very, very pertinent to his visited didn't have specific details about the president or anyone in his entourage. But it did have details, personal details of some of the senior police officers involved in the operation there. CNN hasn't been able to verify the document, there were five pages in the document. And the police say that they are investigating it. They're working with U.S. counterparts as well to investigate it. They say they take the visit of dignitaries and officials and the people of the city very seriously. It's not the first time there's been a breach like this in Northern Ireland, but of course, very embarrassing for the police that it should happen while the president was there and be -- and have details about his visit.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look -- and I think this is a really important point here as we talk about the trip, and we talk about the visits to pubs or the visits to long lost family members or distantly related cousins, that there is a very significant and substantive bilateral portion of this trip. And that the long and -- the deep and longstanding ties between the U.S. and Ireland are certainly ones that the president will use this opportunity to look back on and to highlight.But much of this speech, much of these remarks will be talking about the way forward here. And I think the relationship as -- I think, almost grown in importance in the two plus years the president has been in office, not to minimize what's happened in the past. But I think when you look at the geopolitical strife that the president has had to confront, that the, really, the west and the western alliances have had to deal with over the course over the last two years, speaking, most notably about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Ireland has always been a critical component of that, particularly on the humanitarian side of things. Their willingness to welcome Ukrainian immigrants. Their willingness to help in humanitarian aid. I think that is something the president is certainly going to highlight and underscore the necessity of the durability of that support going forward. Also, keep in mind where the president was just yesterday before he started making his pub visits and greeting thousands here in the streets in Dublin and around Ireland, he was in Northern Ireland. And the discussions that he had with the five political leaders there. The reality of a situation that is far more stable and far more driven by peace than it ever probably was thought to be possible before the Good Friday Agreement 25 years ago still has a very significant layer of political complexity. Still does not have a power sharing government that is actually working at this moment in time. And relating what he heard, what he saw, and what he sees as the path forward on that front is critical as well. So yes, certainly pay attention to the ancestral heritage. Pay attention to the Blewitts and the Finnegans and pay attention to where the president stops and what he sees. But I think the bilateral component here, as shown by the meetings with the president, and the (INAUDIBLE) earlier and as will be shown by the president's remarks here in front of parliament are very critical component of this trip, John.",
