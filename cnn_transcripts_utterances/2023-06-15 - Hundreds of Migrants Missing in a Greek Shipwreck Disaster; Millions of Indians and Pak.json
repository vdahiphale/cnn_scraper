And the U.S. Secretary of State heads to Beijing this weekend for a long-delayed visit aimed at cooling tensions between the US and China. We'll have a live preview of his trip. Well, Greece has declared three-days of national mourning for hundreds of migrants who have feared drowned after their boat sank early Wednesday off the Greek coast. It's one of the country's worst maritime tragedies in years, with at least 78 people confirmed dead so far. Just over 100 have been rescued. The boat is believed to have left Libya and was trying to reach Italy. The first distress call went out Tuesday and the last known contact was shortly after midnight on Wednesday morning.

Most of them are at this warehouse right behind me. We're at the port of Kalamata where ambulances are coming in and out, as well as volunteers and other forms of assistance.We've been talking to the Red Cross and others who are here, who are telling us that the people inside are in great need of psychological help right now. And many of them don't actually know what has happened. They were on board this ship with others that they can no longer find. In the early morning hours, a number of body bags were carried to the port and now have been taken further in order to be identified properly. We understand that relatives of people are also coming in looking for loved ones. This is certainly one of the biggest tragedies of this kind that we've had in Greece. And Greece is no stranger to having migrant wrecks in the last years. It's been the country that's been at the very front of a refugee and migrant crisis since 2015 when over a million people crossed into Europe via Greece. However, in the last years, it seems to be the case that this Libya to Italy route has become increasingly popular. And on this wreck, we understand that from the rescued people that we have now, and we have the first indications of nationalities on board. We understand that there were many Egyptians, some Syrians, and some Pakistanis at least. Also we understand that there were women and children on board as well. This is from what those who have been rescued have said, but so far none of them are among the survivors. Now, what is really crucial here is that this incident took place at one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean. And it seems to be the case that once the ship capsized, we do not know exactly why that happened. [03:05:00] Yet authorities here have been saying that the shift in weight is what led to its capsizing, but it's not clear if this is because of some sort of panic, because of mechanical damage or some other reason, but it seems to be the case that a lot of people were on lower decks at the time. So having sank in such great depth, it's very difficult for any kind of operations to take place there, Anna.",

Thanks for the update.According to a new report from \"The Washington Post,\" Donald Trump had the chance to try to negotiate a settlement in the classified documents case that might have kept him from being charged. Three sources briefed on the matter tell the newspaper that one of the former U.S. president's lawyers pushed for that possible exit ramp last year. However, CNN spoke to sources close to Trump's legal team, who are casting doubt on whether there was any real opportunity to cut a deal, since what was listed in the indictment predates when that lawyer joined Trump's team last August. Trump has now been hit with 37 felony counts, to which he pleaded not guilty in federal court on Tuesday. Well, meanwhile, the Trump team has been fundraising off the indictment. His campaign says it's raised $7 million since last week. CNN's Evan Perez explains the next steps in the case. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: The federal case against former President Donald Trump now moves to the trial phase in front of Judge Eileen Cannon, a judge that the former president appointed to the bench. Walt Nauta, his co-defendant, faces arraignment in another two weeks. And then the former president will start getting some of the discovery. His lawyers will need to see some of the evidence that prosecutors say they have against him to prove their case. These documents, of course, have national security importance. And so that's one of the first things that prosecutors will need to do is to help get security clearances for the former president's legal team. Of course, he's still looking for lawyers to represent him in this case here in the Southern District of Florida. Judge Cannon is new to the bench. She was appointed by the former president near the end of his term. And according to the \"New York Times\"        in a search of Bloomberg Law databases, she's had 224 cases assigned to her; only four of those cases have gone to trial for a total of 14 days. We know the prosecutors are looking to present their case in about a month. So that is a lot more days of trial than the judge has ever had to face. Evan Perez, CNN, Miami. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Almost 150 people were rescued and police say they will be reunited with their families. CNN's Stephanie Busari has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN AFRICA SR. EDITOR: Scenes of celebration turned to tragedy as more than 100 people died in a boating accident in the early hours of Monday after a wedding party in north-central Nigeria. Police say 106 of around 250 passengers drowned when their boat capsized on the River Niger, West Africa's largest river. 144 passengers were rescued and are receiving treatment, authorities said. A local chief, Abdul Gana Lukpada, told CNN that the wedding guests were stranded after heavy rains flooded the roads and guests were forced to board the overcrowded vessel. It is common for boats in these parts to carry large numbers of passengers beyond their usual capacity and life jackets are rarely worn. The accident happened between 3am and 4am on Monday when visibility would have been poor and hit a tree trunk, the chief told CNN. He described it as, quote, \"a big tragedy\" and added he had lost four of his neighbors. It is unclear whether the bride and groom were among the passengers on the boat. Nigeria is at the height of the rainy season, and the country's meteorological agency has warned of heavy rains that could trigger floods, and these floods are devastating to remote communities. Boat accidents are also common in this part of the country, and last month, at least 15 people died after a boat capsized in northwestern Sokoto State. Stephanie Busari, CNN, Lagos. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Fed deciding unanimously to keep interest rates steady, that is a significant shift after 10 straight meetings where they raised interest rates.And yet, the Fed is making clear that they're not ready to declare victory over inflation, at least not yet. Fed officials are penciling in another two quarter point interest rate hikes this year. During a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he called out the fact that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, he says that has not cooled off enough. And he opened the door to another rate hike at next month's meeting, calling the July meeting a quote, \"live meeting.\" So what does all of this mean? Well, for consumers, it is certainly good news that the Fed is taking a breather here with rate hikes because we've seen borrowing costs spike for mortgages and credit cards and car loans. And so, there is some relief there, at least for now. The pause also means that the Fed thinks that their inflation-fighting medicine is working, that the economy doesn't need these monster interest rate hikes every single meeting just to get inflation back down. One very important point that Powell stressed again and again during the press conference is that these rate hikes, they hit the economy not immediately, but with a lag. It's kind of like have you take antibiotics. You might not feel the impact right away, but it doesn't mean the medicine's not working. It's just taking some time. And so all along the risk here was that the Fed was moving interest rates so fast, so much higher, that they were going to overdo it and actually cause a recession. So that is why Powell says that they are moving slower now to look around and see what the impact is in the economy. So again, that doesn't mean that the Fed is done raising interest rates. It doesn't mean that the war on inflation is over. It's just moving in a more deliberate phase. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So we know that a couple of the smaller regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank, most famously, toppled.And the question was whether that would cause a broader credit tightening that we might see in the economy. And so this was a case of a rate rise delayed rather than the rate rise foregone. And, you know, on the one hand, they didn't raise today. On the other, it wasn't a promise they're going to do so, but it was a really pregnant hint that it's coming soon.",

But Chairman Powell sounded pretty confident, pretty happy today, pretty chipper that there's a lot of good news in the works on inflation.One of the really big parts of that is we know a lot about what's going on with the housing market and house prices and rents are not rising at all and they're a big part of the cost of living and so a big part of the inflation story.",

But legacy is important to Jerome Powell. This is a man who comes from the private equity industry. He's worth in excess of $100 million. Inflation is the issue that will define his reign.

And what the Fed is saying has been saying for a while is this tightening cycles not over yet.What happened was Wall Street got awfully carried away with its own recession talk. The economy kept chugging along no matter what Wall Street kept saying. As Wall Street economists saw recession coming, they thought the Fed would have to respond by cutting rates. And so time and again, Powell has said, no, we mean it. We're going to keep rates high to try and quash inflation. But I do want to come back to what you said, I don't think that Powell thinks of his legacy as solely being about inflation. This is a guy who I think has took us through the pandemic and was really willing to take some risks to make sure that people stayed in work.
