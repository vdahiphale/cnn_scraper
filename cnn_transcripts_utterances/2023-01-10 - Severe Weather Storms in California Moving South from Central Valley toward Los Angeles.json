More capable surface-to-air missile systems and surface to surface missile systems, artillery systems that are more accurate and have greater ranges. That's the collection of things we've seen recently. Let's look at Bradley fighting vehicles in particular, because these are going now. It's an armored personnel carrier, carries troops into battle, but it also crucially has a tow missile, this is an antitank missile attached to it. You've heard the reluctance throughout this war of the U.S. and its partners to send tanks. This is not a tank, but it does have the ability to attack and destroy Russian tanks.

During that period, he went to as prosecutors told the judge in court yesterday, he went to a Home Depot where he wore surgical gloves, had on a COVID mask, and paid cash for $450 worth of cleaning supplies. That fact really got investigators' attention.
