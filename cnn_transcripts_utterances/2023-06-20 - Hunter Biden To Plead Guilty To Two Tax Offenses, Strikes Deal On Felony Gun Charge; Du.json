But nevertheless, the speaker is not happy about this. I did try to ask him about the fact that this was a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney that was held over into the Biden administration and questioned about the role of the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, and why the -- whether or not that made any difference and how he viewed this case.

If you are the president's leading political opponent, DOJ tries to literally put you in jail and give you prison time. If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal. Now, this does nothing to our investigation. And it actually should enhance our investigations because the DOJ should not be able to withhold any information now saying that because of pending investigation, they should be able to provide Chairman Comer with any information that he requires.

What McCarthy indicating there is that he expects a U.S. Attorney from Delaware and the U.S. Justice Department to provide the committee in the House with the relevant information they are seeking.The question that they're going to have is why they didn't pursue other charges and other questions related to Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and the like. Something that Republicans are pushing on, perhaps there wasn't evidence to bring the charges there but nevertheless, Republicans are still planning to press ahead.

He paid those taxes later. But really, when you look at the Hunter Biden story, this is an individual who was addicted to drugs, who was engaged in all kinds of behavior that would be embarrassing to a lot of people, whether they are a politician or not. And that's been a part of Joe Biden's political life since the last presidential election when he ran.I mean, those -- that part of the story is not actually new. And what you've seen Biden doing is basically saying, look, my son has made mistakes, but he is my son. And when you put that in the context of Joe Biden's life, I mean, this is a president who lost his wife, lost a child, then lost another child, Hunter Biden's brother to cancer, Joe Biden has made it very clear that all of this swirling around Hunter Biden doesn't change the way that he feels about his son and he's willing to take the political hits that come from that. And I think the question now will be for the American public after two presidential cycles, will this still matter? Will this way on how they view President Biden? And I think we don't really know the answer to that question. At least the last time around, it appears that they didn't because Biden did win that last election in spite of all the allegations around Hunter Biden.",

But other than that, silence so far from top Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries yet to weigh in on this topic. Chuck Schumer and Jeffries also taking a similar approach to the Trump case -- in the Trump indictment and the Trump case. They have weighed in but only saying that they let the process play out and not try to cast judgment one way or the other. So, expect that as well from Democrats trying to say that look, let's let the process play itself out. Let's have faith in the system here.

And it was really critical of the FBI. And it raised some of the same issues that we've seen raised in an inspector general report previously.But today is the first time that Democrats and Republicans are going to sit in the same room as Durham and have a chance to sort of hash out some of the issues that were raised in the report and ask questions of the former special counsel about his investigation. Now, Democrats and Republicans have voiced different priorities when it comes to what they want to talk to Durham about today. Republicans, you know, who viewed their -- his report, really, as a referendum and as a very damning you know reflection on the FBI and the Justice Department. They want to get some of that and get more emphasis on that point from Durham himself today. Where Democrats, they say, the report is really just a rehash of problems that the FBI said today and pointed out again, that they've already addressed. So, two very competing sorts of priority lists for Republicans and Democrats. And of course, this closed-door meeting coming one day before Durham will testify publicly before the House Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Jim Jordan.
