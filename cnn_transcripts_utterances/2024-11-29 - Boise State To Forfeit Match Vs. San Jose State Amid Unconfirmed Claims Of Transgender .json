      "sentences": "For example, the Swimming Federation, World Aquatics and track and field, World Athletics, both have said if -- if an athlete has gone through male puberty, they cannot compete in the women's category in women's sports.So that's there. Then you've got the NCAA, as you have alluded to saying that you go with whatever the federation wants. And this is USA Volleyball, which does allow participation for trans women, so here we are. The difference, and I think a lot of people are looking at this and saying, we've -- we've heard some of these stories over the years. And of course, these are personal stories. These are human beings. These are our, you know, our daughters, the girls next door playing sports. We want that. We love that. That's Title IX. The difference here is how politicized this got. This entire story has been set against the backdrop, basically, of this presidential election and the culture wars and the Trump campaign and its anti-transgender policies and its commercials. Because in April was when this athlete, who we are not going to name, but that's when a conservative website, Omar, outed this athlete, and that was in April. She had already played two years for San Jose State before then and one year prior to that at another school. So there had been apparently no issues at all until this became politicized, which, of course is definitely part, sadly part of this story.",

I mean, the player doesn't seem to lead the conference in any statistical category either. But that still hasn't stopped these teams from forfeiting their matches.Four other teams have forfeited matches against San Jose State this season. I guess my point is, where do you see this going? Because from a competitive standpoint, you can't just have teams forfeiting matches into perpetuity. I mean, at what point does the NCAA step in? BRENNAN: Well, and you're -- you're an athlete, of course, played for our alma mater at Northwestern. And you, you know, we all understand. I -- I played, you know, club sports in what -- in high school, of course. And -- and you love your sports. And yes, six of the 12 conference matches that San Jose State has won have been by forfeit, six out of 12. And of course, you feel for the Boise State players who are in many ways political pawns themselves, because, of course, the governor of Idaho, among other western states have said that they agree with the forfeits. So where does it go? Well, I think we're in for quite a few months and years because what we saw during the last Trump campaign, in the last Trump presidency was something where the intersection of politics and sports, which we know is -- is always, it's omnipresent, it then becomes like a 12-lane superhighway where you have so many issues that then-Donald Trump, president back then wanted to enter in terms of SOBs for the players who were when he called them SOBs for the kneeling players, et cetera. So we're going to see more of this, sadly. What we don't want to see is these athletes become political pawns.",

And the kind of performance that's exciting because she's not playing someone with a, you know, a terminal illness or, you know, like you get to see Angelina Jolie do Maria Callas this month. But like, Amy Adams is just playing kind of the -- the dirty truth of motherhood in a way that, you know, she's kind of imagining she's transforming into this almost like werewolf, like character. It's really a creative movie and a terrific performance. You know, this is, again, a time of year when those -- those movies that are going to be competing for Oscar are going to be showing up in movie theaters. So just this past weekend, \"The Seed of the Sacred Fig,\" which is an Iranian film, which for me is at the very tippy top of my best of the year list, you know, it's a film kind of made under impossible circumstances by a director who's been jailed for making kind of dissident statements against -- against the government.
