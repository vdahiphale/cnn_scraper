According to Moody's Analytics the higher prices are forcing families to spend $709 more each month compared to two years ago. CNN's Matt Egan is joining us to break all of this down. Matt, that adds up to more than $8,500 a year. That is a huge increase to a family's budget.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's massive, and it really explains why some families are having trouble getting by right now. It's so interesting though, is that inflation has cooled off considerably. We've gotten two big inflation reports in the last two days, and both of them make that obvious. We're nowhere near those nightmare inflation levels of last summer.And yet inflation can be cumulative. There is a snowballing effect here of two years of price spikes. And so Americans are spending a lot more in a lot of different areas including, of course, housing. And anyone who's been out there trying to buy or rent right now knows that. People are spending more at the grocery store, on recreation, things like streaming, or concert tickets, and also on cars. Buying cars, maintaining them and insuring them. But Brianna, you know, both things can be true. Inflation has cooled off and it's also done a lot of damage over the last two years.",

And that's the basis why the judge revoked his bail and has remanded him into custody. That visual you're seeing on the screen is Bankman-Fried arriving for this court hearing today. And that will be the last time he will be walking as a free man.He is expected to go to trial on October 2nd, so we are about seven weeks out from this trial. But the judge revoking bail and prosecutors have asking for this because one of the issues, the tipping point really seemed to be that Bankman-Fried spoke with \"The New York Times\" about a person in this case. This is Caroline Ellison. She was a top executive at FTX and its sister hedge fund. And he had talked to \"The Times\" about her. Prosecutors saying that that was an attempt to tamper with witnesses, potentially intimidate her from testifying against him at trial. She has pleaded guilty to numerous serious crimes and is going to be one of the government's star witnesses. So Bankman-Fried been out on $250 million bond, staying at his parents' home in Palo Alto, California. The judge revoking that today. And interesting to note, his parents were in the court today -- according to my colleague Lauren del Valle. They have not come to a number of these court appearances. So definitely a sign they were prepared for this to happen. Now they'll likely not see their son until the trial date. So Bankman-Fried attorneys have asked the judge to allow him stay out so they could appeal this ruling. But the judge said no, he didn't know what kind of mischief Bankman-Fried could get into during that time -- Alex.",

      "sentences": "I think there are some legitimate questions about this whole situation. First of all, I do think it's fair to question why would U.S. Attorney Weiss be appointed to special counsel? Usually a special counsel comes as an outside attorney. It has happened before. Durham came from inside. And the Attorney General has the right to do that, but it is odd.Second of all, this was a -- this plea deal was picked apart by the judge, so one could ask why would you stick with the U.S. attorney if he -- you know, this was a failure, a colossal failure. The two sides had not even agreed upon what was in that plea deal. And then I think there are questions about whether or not it was harsh enough, this plea deal. Whether or not it was strong enough. Beyond that there are some other questions I have which include the U.S. Attorney Weiss -- he's now a special counsel. So one of the reasons to make him a special counsel supposedly is so he has to ability to charge in other venues outside Delaware. But I believe he had previously argued publicly that he had the right to do whatever he wanted. And then the whistleblower said, well, behind the scenes Weiss was complaining he couldn't do that. He wasn't able to do that, and the Justice Department and Weiss denied what the whistleblowers were saying. But this move makes it seem as though, well, maybe the whistleblowers were right. Maybe what they were alleging is true, and he didn't have the ability to charge whatever he wanted to charge, and now he does. So I do have a lot of questions about that. And I do think some of the political questions being raised by Republicans have merit.",

Also today, a teenager pleaded not guilty to stabbing and killing a gay man who had been dancing to Beyonce at a gas station in Brooklyn. The 17-year-old suspect, whose name is Dmitriy Popov, was arraigned this morning on a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime. Prosecutors allege that Popov stabbed 28-year-old professional dancer O'Shae Sibley who they say was defending his friends from homophobic and anti-Black slurs. And a total of five Republican presidential candidates have qualified for the upcoming primary debate after signing onto the required loyalty pledge from the RNC. The pledge declares that candidates will support the party's eventual nominee and forego a third party bid of their own.

Phil Mickelson one of the most popular and successful golfers in the history of the sport, a six-time major winner. Though the did cause controversy I will say last year when he joined the Saudi-backed LIV Golf series.Now these allegations, according to a book that's going to be released later this month by a professional gambler Billie Walters. He says he was in what he described as a gambling partnership with Mickelson for five years. Walters alleges Mickelson's total gambling losses likely much closer to 100 million and that he's wagered more than $1 billion over the last 30 years. Now citing his own betting records and additional records provided by his unnamed sources, Walters alleges that between 2010 and 2014 Mickelson made over 7,000 wagers on football, on basketball and baseball. An excerpt from the book published by Fire Pit Collective and Golf Digest, saying that Mickelson in 2011 alone he made 3,154 bets, an average of nearly nine per day. I will say CNN has not been able to independently verify these claims. Walters himself was convicted of insider trading back in 2017 and sentenced to five years in federal prison. President Trump commuted his sentence in 2021. And I want to get to this because this is one of the more stunning allegations that Walters makes. Is that Mickelson asked him to bet $400,000, Brianna, on the U.S. team to beat team Europe. This is in the Ryder Cup back in 2012. Mickelson was all that American team that lost on that final day and what became known as the miracle of Medinah, just outside of Chicago. Walters wrote, he doesn't know if Mickelson ever placed that bet. Mickelson denies gambling on that year's Ryder Cup. Meantime, I do want to get this from the four-time Major winner Rory McIlroy, the northern Irishman reacting to the book's allegations and take a listen, not holding back in any way.
