In fact, there is a lot of flying debris that we are experiencing around us.This is a fan blade that came down just a short time ago from a fan that was above us on a porch. And then if I walk over here, you can see what's happening. This fence belongs to the house that we are next to. This fence came down just a short time ago with the force of the winds. We're told that we've had 74 mile an hour gust here in the last hour. And then this was just some sort of tarp that they had up. You could see some power lines are down, so we don't have any power here. We lost power, so we are not especially concerned about those power lines, but they could whip up in these strong winds. But this is what were concerned about, things like flying debris, things that are airborne as a result of these strong winds. We've also seen those transformers blow that you were talking about that sort of greenish-blue light that comes in the sky very suddenly, but it's really -- it's the winds and were getting the warnings to shelter-in- place on our phones. Really, it's good news. I will tell you that most of the people in this neighborhood have evacuated, Anderson. The home next door that was here where the fence came down is all boarded up. Many of the homes are the same way. So, that is the good news, so hopefully, Anderson, when the storm gets --",

It's the last time I was able to see TV because the TVs are out here. There are a lot of waves crashing behind you. How are things now? BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we moved. Those waves got too scary, to be honest. The St. Petersburg Pier is where we were next to the Municipal Yacht Basin. We watch these things just get bigger and bigger by the minute. So we decamped down here to sort of the central business district of St. Petersburg. Hotels, it is easier to find shelter, but it still gives you a sense of how things look because thankfully, we still have the power here, that's not expected to hold. We had an 89-mile an hour gusts not too long ago. And so, I don't know that we're going to keep this power through the night. But lot of evacuees in the hotel where we're staying, a lot of folks with families, dogs, elderly folks, hoping for the best by heeding the very good advice to get out of the way of this storm. But as we peek around the corner, come on over, Carlos, we'll duck out here, we can brave it just you can get a sense of what an abandoned St. Petersburg looks like. As these gales just really start to kick up, we can peek around the corner here. It's so dramatic in these lights, once the wind speed, Anderson, gets over 50 miles an hour, Manatee County, Pinellas County, they stop responding to 911 calls and so, certainly at this point people are where they are and hopefully, they made the right decisions on where to be. You can see some pooling, the flooding here, for anybody who's been through this especially the folks in the Carolinas who just went through Helene realize that when the sun comes out, the problems just begin when you have all the mud and the water and you have to worry about the drywall molding and the kids can't go back to school and already, Helene has ravaged the west coast of Florida, 10 days before this one now and a lot of people's belongings were in big piles in front of their houses. The worry is, is that the surge is going to blend that up in the most violent way. So I don't know if you can get a sense of it here, Anderson, but it is really coming down, really blowing hard here in St. Pete.",

So, that's where the reset all happens.And where Randi Kaye is, that barrier island to her west is going to be over washed. She is going to get significant surge there. That's why they pulled back. Where you are, you are up here in the eyewall itself. You are not going to get the eye. You're not going to get real calm winds. You're going to get the backside of this. Where our Bill Weir is up here in St. Pete, he's just going to be in wind, heavy rain, hundred mile per hour winds basically for the next four hours. The problem is we've had so much rainfall in so many places and we've had the wind, the high wind warning, treat it like a small tornado is on the ground. We had a bunch of tornadoes on the east side of Florida earlier. At least that weather has moved off shore. We had a lot of sunshine earlier in the day, that heated the ground. That heat and the hot weather there just made those tornadoes even stronger than they should have been. And we're probably thinking some of them were EF-3s. That typically doesn't happen in a hurricane, but it certainly did. There is the eye, almost ready to come on shore, but the winds are going to be 115 in many spots for many, many hours. And the surge is still going to be another three to four hours before it gets to its highest spot. So just because you look out and say, the storm is here, there's no surge. It's still coming. I promise you. It is still coming, nine to 10 to 12 feet in some spots and we're still going to get the wind all the way across to the eastern part of the state. We're going to have power outages in Orlando, we're going to have power outages in Daytona because this is still going to be a hurricane as it exits the East Coast. And to the north of the eye, this is typically the other way around. But because there's a front up here, to the north of the eye path, there's going to be 10 to 15 more inches of rainfall that could be flooding from Orlando northward, possibly The Villages, but certainly as far east as Daytona, Cocoa Beach, lots and lots of rainfall with this.

Earlier in the day, there were people outside on Tampa Bay, taking pictures. This is as very strong winds and very punishing rain were coming down.

I am parallel to the Caloosahatchee River and it's about one or two feet from, at this point, just breaching this sea wall to my left. What you're looking at here is the wind and the storm surge associated with this hurricane, that is right now pushing its way inland.This is the concern that officials had with this storm, especially as that forecasted path still took that hurricane to the north of us here. We are looking at a -- the forecast for the storm surge overnight and into tomorrow, at this point, is probably closer to six to eight, perhaps even nine feet. The initial forecast was calling for between eight to 12 feet of flooding. That number though, looks like it is going to come in a little bit under. To the south of me, out on Fort Myers Beach and down in Collier County and in Naples, that part of Southwest Florida is, right now, seeing about four to five feet of storm surge. And that's because, again, as that storm moved through, what ends up happening is that all of this water is being pushed in from the Gulf of Mexico. And when it comes to the Caloosahatchee River, the rainfall that is falling across parts of Lake Okeechobee and even Central Florida, that water is also starting to come down. And so what happens here is, you have the Gulf coming in on one side of the river, you've got the rain and the flooding coming in from the other part of the river, and when it comes here, it has nowhere else to go. And so, this is why what's happening here behind me is kind of taking place. There's some greenery behind me, this kind of landscape yard here. This will be underwater in a matter of hours. Anderson, I was out here, during Hurricane Ian, and this is something similar that we saw. And so, this part is just getting ready for what's going to be a really long and difficult couple of hours going into tonight and into tomorrow morning. Anderson?",

I mean, you look at it on a map and being on the ground, it just -- it's so interesting how quickly things shift. Just in the last two minutes before we came back from break, suddenly the Manatee River is now churning. We had seen some white caps on some water, but I mean, these are now, really, these are now waves churning on the Manatee River, and the water is really starting to come over.
