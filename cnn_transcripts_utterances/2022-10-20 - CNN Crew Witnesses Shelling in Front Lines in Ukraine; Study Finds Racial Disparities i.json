Ukrainians say they've come under such fire several times a day from a lot of the artillery that literally just and update a couple of minutes ago, Victor, that the Ukrainian military command said the Russians are still trying to take that town. There have been several air strikes today.It's definitely a key focal point for them and the Ukrainians say they're going to do everything to hold it. But you know, with all these reports that we keep getting out of Ukraine, the Ukrainians making headway in the south of the country. In some places of the east of the country, it is very difficult for them and I can tell you from having been here on the ground, it's an extremely tough and extremely brutal fight with losses on both sides.",

Now according to the findings, white patients are twice as likely as black patients to receive mechanical heart pumps or heart transplants. CNN's health reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us now. Jacqueline, it feels like every day we've got a story about how black people are underserved by the medical community or there's another disparity. Tell us about this study.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's so true, and this study just adds to our understanding of those inequities when it comes to medical care. And for this particular research, researchers looked at 377 heart failure patients. They were around the same age, had similar conditions, and among those patients when it came to the advanced therapies that they received, 11 percent of black patients received advanced therapies like heart pumps or heart transplants, but that's in comparison with 22 percent of the white patients. So, you see there the white patients were twice as likely to get these advanced therapies.And cardiologists I talk to, especially black cardiologists said that they're not surprised. They've seen these inequities before and they are not surprised by them. The researchers the these inequities do not have to do with the type of care patients asked for or the care they preferred. Instead, the researcher said this. Quote: The residual inequity may be a consequence of structural racism and discrimination or provider bias, impacting decision-making. So just to translate, it was the provider's decision when it came to giving advanced therapies and the researchers say it's provider bias that might drive some of these inequities that we see here with heart failure patients and we've seen before with maternity care, with pain management. Like you said, Victor, we tend to see these inequities arise when it comes to medical care, and researchers are trying to raise awareness around this.",

OPEC's cut of production of oil is going to be about a million barrels a day or so. So, 15 million barrels to offset last, what, two weeks. What's the longer term strategy you think that this administration should employ? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Victor, you're right. I mean, it's a short-term solution, but we need to be far tougher on the Saudis and demand that they reconsider their decision. We've supply them with all their weapons. They are basically being ungrateful and slapping American consumers on the face. Second, we need to ban and export foreign gas gasoline other than to our European allies.",

The Saudi's are responsible for the brutal war in Yemen. They absolutely can't go to China and Russia and anyone who knows national security knows it would take them ten years to get that, and all the folks on the national security really understand the issue and know that it's U.S. technicians that are responsible basically for flying the Saudi planes. So, this is calling for strategic pause. It would do nothing in terms of having a tough relationship on Iran and, you know, frankly people like Ambassador Jordan have been responsible for the failed policy to the Saudis over the last decade.",

He said we have to be talking about pocketbook issues, gas, the cost of groceries and he obviously had two smashing victories and won many red states.
