I am Kasie Hunt.Mystery surrounds the planned meeting between North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Russian state media say Kim's private train is in Russia right now. But exactly where and when he could meet with Putin to talk about weapons for Russia's Ukraine invasion is unknown at this point. No mystery though about where Putin stands on former President Trump and the four criminal indictments that he is facing in the United States. Russia's strongman making those revelations in a speech just a short time ago. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us from London. Clare, this is breaking overnight/early in the morning here in the U.S. what is Putin saying about Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, good morning, Kasie. This did not really come as a surprise to anyone like myself. Part of the Kremlin messaging is always to try to reassure that the Russian people that U.S. is not this sort of shining city on a Hill.And Putin didn't shy away from this today. He said that the prosecution of Donald Trump, as he put it, is good for us, he said, in today's condition because it shows, and I quote, the rottenness of the American system which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy. He goes on to say that what this is essentially is the persecution of a political rival for political reasons, presumably accusing the Biden administration of doing that. So I think, look, what this does show is that Putin is watching the U.S. political process very closely, and presumably in particular at the moment for any signs of how the election could impact U.S. support for Ukraine. But meanwhile, of course, President Putin making those comments in the far eastern port city of Vladivostok, we are at the same time monitoring a train purportedly carrying North Korean president Kim Jong Un. And it has, according to Russian state media, crossed into Russia now. It apparently stopped according to state media as a border station and \"Reuters\" citing that Kim got out and greeted Russian officials. Now it appears to be heading north again. And South Korea's news agency, Yonhap, says that it may be heading not to Vladivostok, where Putin is now, but to somewhere else in Russia's far east. That is what we know at the moment. Obviously, there's a lot at stake. The U.S. is very concerned about a potential arms deal that could prolong the conflict in Ukraine and on the flip side of what North Korea could get in return, specifically potentially technology for its nuclear program.",

Josh, thank you so much for joining me on this -- first day of my outings here on EARLY START. There's no one that I'd rather talk to about what is going on here. And let's start with -- your book is about Donald Trump, we know that his relationships during his presidency with Kim Jong Un, with Vladimir Putin, obviously very closely watched. We're heading in to a political season where he seems to be the almost inevitable Republican nominee. He may, of course, in that instance end up back in the White House. What do you make of Putin's comments and how this all plays -- plays out?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, thanks for having me on your inaugural show and congrats, Kasie.I think in one sense, it's very consistent. Vladimir Putin supported Donald Trump in 2016. He supported Donald Trump in 2020. And it's very likely he's going to support Donald Trump in 2024 in a number of secret and public ways. And, you know, there is no doubt that it is in Vladimir Putin's interests for Donald Trump to become president again because Donald Trump has promised to withdraw U.S. support from Ukraine and makes -- solve the crisis in 24 hours which is can only be done by caving to Putin's demands. On the other hand, there is a bigger point to be made here, which is sort of that in the world opinion, the prosecution of Donald Trump should be seen as a restoration and upholding of democracy, when we have rule of law and accountability, that is the strength of our system after a president or anyone else allegedly tries to undermine a free and fair election. But in the dictator's playbook, any prosecution or any accountability, is against what they believe is their right to ultimate power. So he is not just speaking up against Donald Trump's rivals but against democracy and claiming to do the opposite. And that's basically also par for the course with Vladimir Putin.",

      "sentences": "Right. On the one hand, you could see this as a positive sign because if Vladimir Putin is traveling all the way to the eastern city of Vladivostok to meet the most evil and sort of reclusive dictator in the world, Kim Jong Un, that means that he is desperate, that means that he needs the weapons that North Korea has, millions and millions of mostly artillery shells and missiles, a lot of which the Russians sold them in the first place in the '70s, '80s and '90s and he needs them back to kills Ukrainians.And so, that's in a way a good sign that Putin is getting low on munitions. On the other hand, it's really a bad sign because what he's going to have to do to get those is probably give Kim Jong Un advanced weapons, missile technology, maybe mobile launching technology, God forbid nuclear technology that Kim Jong Un will use to bolster his position and threaten the entire region of Asia. So that's kind of like a good news/bad news situation. I think the bottom line is that these guys are working together. They are on the dictator team.

There are good reasons to want more the accountability of funding in Ukraine. I'm not saying that it is not a lot of money. But to link it to domestic political issues is not the way to fight a war or win a war. And bottom line is that Ukrainians are fighting for their freedom and their lives and their families but also to defend against aggression writ large.

Many of these villages, many of the hardest hit areas across Morocco are in these remote, high up, mountainous areas and that has proven to be a real challenge for rescue teams. Now, just yesterday, we were in another village further up -- further south. And this is a village that has proven hugely difficult to reach. We spoke to people there who have been impacted by the earthquake. They told us that the international rescue teams had only just made it to the village yesterday. They had been spending days digging through the rubble of their collapsed homes with their bare hands and they have only just begun to receive that humanitarian aid, have only just begun to see doctors and medical personnel on the ground there. Of course, it has been difficult to reach some of these areas. The roads have been blocked in some places because of the debris, because of damage to the roads. But, of course, there is still a real sense of frustration among these residents in these remote villages around the delayed response.
