Already, delegates and surrogates are starting to arrive here as they are still reeling from the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world.We're continuing to follow the breaking news today as we are learning more information about that stunning assassination attempt that left Donald Trump bloodied at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last night. This hour, we are expecting to hear from President Biden live from the White House after he was briefed by top national security officials on the investigation in the attack. We will bring that to you live when it happens. It's expected to happen in just a few moments from now. But this also comes as we're learning troubling new details about the gunman who was killed by the Secret Service moments after they opened fire on the former president. Law enforcement sources are telling CNN the shooter had explosive material inside his car and his residence. Authorities have identified him as 20 year old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who lived in nearby Bethel Park, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area. Donald Trump confirmed in a post last night, he said a bullet ripped through the upper part of his right ear while he was on stage. We know, of course, that one person attending that rally was killed in the attack. Two others are in critical condition. And today, the Secret Service is now facing serious questions about the moment that this attack happened and how.

It's a statement in a press conference from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. And, really, what he offered for the first time on camera since this attempted assassination was a plea to take the temperature down on all sides and to rise above the hateful rhetoric that exists and search for a better, brighter future.Like I said, this is the first time that we've heard from the governor on camera since last night's attack. And he did not actually take questions in this very recent press conference on the investigation and some of the concerns about security that we've been talking about, of course, 24 hours or so, but he did give us more information about one of the victims. Kaitlan, I'll remind you that one of the rally goers was killed by the gunfire and we learned from the governor today that his name was Corey Comperatore. He was a husband, a father of two and take a listen to how he describes how his wife described this man after he was killed yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Corey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. And most especially, Corey loved his family. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community. Corey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally. Corey was the very best of us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Evan, I know the FBI director was just in the Situation Room with President Biden as they are trying to learn more about the investigation into the shooting itself and how someone was able to get this close to the former president of the United States to be able to be in his line of sight at this rally.

      "sentences": "That's right, Kaitlan. Look, I'm in the -- there's two pieces of this investigation. One is being handled by the FBI, which is focusing on trying to figure out this gunman, his story, what brought him to that rally, how long has he been planning this, all of those questions are still now the focus of hundreds of FBI agents from both in Pittsburgh and also from Quantico that have been brought up there to the scene.Now, what we know is that one of the reasons why you, we took a little while last night, you and I were texting last night as to why is it taking so long to even know the identity of the gunman who was by that point dead for hours was he wasn't carrying any identification, but the investigators were able to trace the firearm, the rifle, the AR- 15-style rifle that was found there with him that he allegedly used to fire at the former president, that that gun was traced back to his father. And so that's how the police work began over the next few hours overnight. We know that investigators also found explosive materials both in his vehicle and also at his home. We also know that the law enforcement had encountered him outside of the venue, outside of the perimeter. You know that the Secret Service uses magnetometers to screen everyone who was going into the rally. He did not enter, but they had an eye on him and they were concerned enough about him that they did alert Secret Service. We don't know exactly what happened after that. We do know. That there are witnesses who say that they spotted him and acting suspiciously and also saw him later on closer to the time before the president took the stage, when he was up on that roof where he took those shots. Now, as you pointed out, important questions, the other part of this investigation is going to be an internal one for the Secret Service and the Homeland Security Department to determine what happened here, what went wrong. The protocols, as you know, Kaitlan, from attending so many of these rallies, is that the Secret Service is in charge of the perimeter that is for the venue, where the former president was going to be speaking. Outside of that, you have local and state law enforcement who handled the outer perimeter. We know from some of our reporting from John Miller and others that there were at least four tactical groups. These are like countersniper groups, that were at the scene, two from Secret Service and two from state and local law enforcement. We know, of course, that Secret Service countersnipers were the ones that took him out. The question is was anyone supposed to be guarding or making sure that the access to that roof, which has a clear line of about 500 feet to where the former president was speaking, whether anyone was supposed to be in charge of securing that area. Those are the important questions, of course, for the Secret Service and for the State Police of Pennsylvania.",

Obviously, some of the biggest questions are for them.And you saw that at the press conference last night, the FBI and the state police were having to take questions that are really more directed at the Secret Service. So, no, we have not heard from them and we already are seeing some very tough questions being asked by members of Congress who want more answers as to what could have gone wrong here. We know that the Secret Service obviously has a lot of on their hands 'cause they're now trying to secure the Republican National Convention, where you are, Kaitlan. But, yes, I mean, the fact that they were not at the press conference last night, we know they were present. We know they were right there.

The former president and potentially future president of the United States was nearly assassinated. I mean, the gravity of this, you don't want our democracy to come down to luck, right, that he had moved another inch. And so the Secret Service with state and local law enforcement is going to have to determine who decided in terms of their security perimeter planning that it would end essentially at a sort of a metal detector on the ground.Why if they were worried about snipers, they clearly were because they had people ready to take them out, as we saw, were those buildings essentially left pretty vulnerable, seems like he just was able to walk in. And then where was that gap in communication or situational awareness between lots of people looking at this guy and thinking this is not right, and either following him or detaining him, which you can certainly do, and then apprehending him before he could get on the roof.",

Of course, this is one classmate of his at their school. What does what does that information do for the FBI? How are they using that as part of their investigation right now?",

And so he does not have that demographic. He does not have that background.So, chances are he was, in fact, acting alone. The Lost Boys, as we would call them, are 20-something-year-old men. They have access to guns, generally white, who find a cause, and it could be a bunch of different things that they then view as sort of an existential moment for them and that they will use violence to defend themselves. He does not look like he was very politically active. There's a little random pieces of information about him. He's not someone who's showing up at a lot of places, it appears. And so that sort of that designation of him, as someone who was isolated, bullied, without a community, would suggest that he got radicalized or made -- became more violent, possibly without more likely than not, without an outside network. That's what that's where the FBI would look at this given his background. And the fact that, honestly, he had the gun from his father, he had explosives, those are things that that generally -- that one can do by themselves. And so, I mean, this isn't good. A single person wanting to take out the past and potentially future president United States is bad. And that's the violence part of this that we have to discuss, which is, honestly, Kaitlan is not about a security perimeter. It's about our democracy. It's about violence.",

You probably have to walk through here just to get to where you are now.But the Secret Service is running the operation here. You see these barriers here, there's magnetometers. We in the press have to go through this. We have to get our cases, anything that we bring in, we have to get searched. So, this is the main entrance into where the former president is going to be speaking. This is the Pfizer forum. This is the arena where everything is happening. Outside of this, there are other perimeters that right now are not set up, but come tomorrow, it's going to be a much different situation. And, obviously, a lot has changed here in terms of how law enforcement is feeling about the week. There is certainly more anxiety. There are certainly a lot more preparation now. We spoke to the mayor's office this morning. Right now, they're saying on the perimeter, the outside, not the interior here, they're not making a lot of changes. They're waiting for the Secret Service to tell them if there are any changes that need to be made. The key thing for outside this perimeter are the protests that are planned here for tomorrow, and, really, just perhaps any counterprotests that may happen. And so that's what the local police department, they brought in resources from other states. We've seen state police here from Michigan this morning. We've seen police officers from Fresno. So, you really have a surge of law enforcement officials that are already coming into this area. But you could certainly -- Kaitlan, I came here yesterday, you can see and you can feel things are already different here. There's just a certain level of anxiety in the air here. Secret Service, we are seeing a lot of them out here, and the feeling is that, at least in the coming days, we're going to see a lot more of them increase their visibility. And then, of course, it's the security around the former president, how that's going to change. We are unlikely to see much of him out in the streets or in person. He's going to be closely guarded. There are areas for him to go in to the arena where he doesn't have to have exposure to the public. And, certainly, I think security around him is going to be much different.

Before we get back, though, to what is happening here on the ground in Milwaukee, I do want to note that we do now have a photo of Corey Comperatore.

Corey had just turned 50 years old, according to the Post Gazette, and the governor said he was a girl dad, he was a firefighter, that he went to church every Sunday and noted that he lost his life protecting his family. Obviously, may his memory be a blessing. And we're thinking of his wife and his two daughters in this moment. Joining me now here on set, CNN's Senior Political Analyst Mark Preston.

This happened shortly after the shooting yesterday in Pennsylvania.And as you said, it is important to highlight that this is all out of an abundance of caution, that there are no known threats to the building or to any of these other locations. But just as a protective measure, the NYPD has increased its presence. Now, the scene here is pretty calm so far. There are a handful of Trump supporters that have gathered in front of the building. They have been waving Trump flags. They're all wearing Trump shirts and hats and they have been gathered there for a while. There are also a lot of passersby and curious onlookers who are just taking a look around. This building always was a tourist destination, but, of course, it has taken so much added significance since the presidency of Donald Trump.
