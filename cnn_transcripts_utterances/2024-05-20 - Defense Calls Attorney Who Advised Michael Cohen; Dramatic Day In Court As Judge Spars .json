      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And the prosecution has rested its case and now it's Donald Trump's turn. His defense team has called a witness, Robert Costello, an attorney, who at one point advised Michael Cohen. Costello has claimed that Cohen's lied about him under oath during this trial. This comes after a shocking revelation on the stand earlier today, threatened to rock the prosecution's entire case under intense questioning by the defense. Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, the star witness for the prosecution, admitted that he stole from the Trump Organization and we're not talking lunch money or funds taken from some transaction that has nothing to do with the charges against Trump. We're talking we had $60,000, technically larceny, that was part of the $420,000 payment made to Cohen that was allegedly falsified to reimbursement for hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. That payment or those payments that make up the $420,000, that's the crime at the center of this trial, whether they were falsified. Even though the prosecution had technically raised the issue of this $60,000 theft earlier in the trial, they didn't really spell it out clearly to the jury. They certainly didn't explain that this was a crime. In fact, CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig points out that larceny over $50,000 in New York is actually a class C felony, which is more serious than the charges Trump is on trial for right now, being either a misdemeanor are the most a class E felony. Prosecutors have to prove that Trump himself falsified or directed the falsification of the business records. But with Cohen's testimony, introducing theft into this alleged hush money cover-up deal, the defense could now try to use this to raise reasonable doubt over whether Donald Trump truly knew the details of what but he was paying here. Lets go straight to CNN's Paula Reid who's outside the courthouse in Manhattan. And, Paula, we'll talk about Costello in a second. He's on the -- he's on the stand right now making his displeasure known with some of the rulings. But explained to us exactly how Cohen's stole this money from the Trump Organization. He admitted doing this and why it could impact the prosecutions case?",

      "sentences": "Well, he stole this money by lying to Allen Weisselberg about what he should be reimbursed for.There's a tech company called Red Finch. And he said that he had paid them $50,000. So, when we saw that critical piece of evidence with Allen Weisselberg and Cohen was sat down to sort of hash out how much he should be reimbursed, $130,000 he paid Stormy Daniels, plus this money for Red Finch, what Cohen revealed on the stand is that he actually skimmed 60 percent of that. Let's take a look at how Todd Blanche elicited this from Cohen on the stand. Here, Blanche asked him, he said, so the $50,000 that you got back from red finch, you only actually paid the red finch owner $20,000, right? Cohen said, yes, sir. So you stole from the Trump Organization? Cohen said, yes, sir. You didn't just steal the $30,000 because it was grossed up, it was $60,000. Cohen said, yes, sir. A stunning moment because when he was originally questioned on direct examination by prosecutors, he did concede that he's skimmed some money off, but prosecutors failed to ask him Jake just how much he skimmed off. You might assume as a few grand. But here getting him to confess that it was actually 60 percent of this and then when they had an opportunity to try to rehabilitate him on redirect. His defense was basically -- well, I felt that I was oh, this because I had been wronged in other ways. And the biggest problem for prosecutors is that the actual criminal charge here is falsifying business records. They're alleging that Trump directed these business records to be falsified to cover up the hush money payment, a problem is now you have a big percentage of the money Cohen received from documents that he even said he falsified this invoices for also based on lies that he told the all the other person in this conspiracy. So this testimony, this was another punch that Todd Blanche managed to land on Michael Cohen, unclear what the jury will make of it though.",

Do not put Costello on the stand.He overrode them because he loved Costello's performance in Congress last week where he attacked not only Bob Costello, but also this case, and the judge. So the fact that Costello would conduct himself in a trial like this potentially jeopardize a case like this.

But again, I've dealt with him for a decade. I am pretty shocked that this is the way that he behaving on the stand. Look, he has animus towards Michael Cohen, no doubt.

I will not pester you if you do not want to talk. You know how to reach Jeff and myself, Bove says. This is what's Costello wrote to Cohen, Costello said what he meant was he wouldn't hear from me again unless he contacted me. Phone records are being displayed on the screen to the jury. There are screened means all over that courtroom in each juror has his or her own screen. The next call after the email was Cohen calling Costello, and the prosecution then objects. Susan Hoffinger, the judge says, I'm going to allow it. Yes. Costello asks a judge before proceeding. Sounds polite, but then Costello begins talking about the email and Hoffinger once your objects again and the judge sustained this time. Costello said the call from Cohen was one hour, 36 minutes, and 15 seconds over Memorial Day weekend. Sounds like a lovely way to spend Memorial Day weekend. Costello shakes his head slightly with an open palm gesture at the ruling. Merchan doesn't say anything about the gesture, but they asked Costello to keep his answers narrow, asking whether he gave Cohen legal advice on the 96 minute call without getting into details? Yes, Costello says. Bove shows the jury an email from June 7 and phone records. The call -- the call lasted 46 minutes. The email from Costello says that after you called me back, I left a message for Rudy Costello testifies after reading the email that Cohen him to call Giuliani on his behalf, Mr. Cohen making constant object a complaints about Rudy Giuliani and what he was saying to the press, Costello said. As he began to say, Cohen was also complaining about his lawyers not being paid by Trump at this point in 2018. Merchan sustained an objection from Hoffinger, another prosecution objection.

No. Did you care about President Trump's interests while speaking to Cohen, Bove asks. No, Costello says. My obligation was to Michael Cohen.

We're going to bring you any comments Mr. Trump makes once he leaves court.Quite a day. We just saw the courtroom be cleared and then reopened after a confrontation between the judge and a defense witness. Also, Michael Cohen, the prosecution's key witness today, admitting he stole $60,000 from Mr. Trump. Our panel is back in just to give some updates on what's been going on right now. The prosecution is a grilling the defense witness, Bob Costello. Bob Costello was very disdainfully expressing his disagreement, shall we say, with judge's sustaining of the prosecution's objections to the point that the judge felt it necessary to clear the room and to reprimand the defense witness who seemed rather, at least by accounts inside the courtroom, hostile to the judge. We know that bob Costello is frustrated with this entire prosecution and doesn't think that the district attorney was interested in the facts of the case during the grand jury proceeding, according to our friend Tim Parlatore over here, who knows Costello. So Hoffinger is asking, the prosecutor is asking Costello questions, or talking about she's basically pushing the idea that you wanted to represent Michael Cohen. He says, no, I wasn't. I didn't know him from a hole in the wall. Costello says he met with Cohen because Jeff Citron, that's Michael Cohen's previous attorney, made an arrangement with Michael Cohen and he asked me to come along because Citron was primarily a real estate lawyer. This is why but you call high-profile case for you, Hoffinger asks. Probably yes, Costello says. Hoffinger pushes Costello to say that Cohen would be a big get for him and his firm at the time. Remember, Costello used to be head of the criminal division and the southern district of New York U.S. attorneys office. He's new to the defense attorney game as it were. Costello after pauses, I would say no, I didn't want them as a client. Hoffinger is trying to get Costello to acknowledge taking on Michael Cohen as a client would put them into the same orbit as Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Costello's resisting. Hoffinger challenging Costello. He would have been happy to announce going as this client. Email records on April 20th, Costello sent this message to his son: I will be on the team. It will be an honor to have you part of my team. I will be eternally grateful for the help and guidance you've already given me, Michael Cohen, personally, attorney for President Donald Trump says. This is not public yet. Costello says to his son, so do not say anything to anyone about this. I don't know. Were going to make an announcement, but I've been authorized to contact Rudy Giuliani's counsel. President Trump told me I will be representing Michael Cohen. Costello son responding to the email congratulating him. What's the point here? She's trying to say that Bob Costello is a lawyer and he has sour grapes.",

There's no evidence zero, that anyone was thinking about a campaign finance charge in 2016 when this payment was made to Ms. Daniels. Blanche now says, how is keeping a false story from the voters criminal? Referencing the other story with the fake story about the kid that Trump had that wasn't -- it's not a true story. He said that's not a catch and kill, your honor, and certainly not criminal catch and kill. So, anyway that's still going on there. I don't know anybody who thinks Judge Merchan is going to just dismiss -- dismiss the charges. But Blanche is saying there's no the way that the court should let this case go to the jury, relying on Mr. Cohen's testimony, and without Mr. Cohen, there is no case. Well, what do you make of that?

They are saying that the prosecution didn't connect all of the dots that get them to Trump, and it is reasonable for the judge to seriously consider this.

And let me bring in Kara Scannell, who is in the courtroom today. So, Kara, you know, we are at a disadvantage out here in the real- world. If you can call a cable news set, the real-world, because we're taking in this information from brilliant reporters like you, trying to absorb it, and trying to imagine what it is like in there. And we have no idea what it actually is like in there. When Michael Cohen was revealed to have committed larceny of $60,000 within the documents that are the split alleged smoking guns, according to the prosecution and Michael Cohen fans, was that as big a bombshell in the courtroom to the jurors as it felt out here?",

They let on very little about their reactions to testimony as its coming out, even last week when Todd Blanche, Trump's lawyer, kind of cornered Michael Cohen about that phone call in October of 2016. They didn't really rack -- they didn't react much today either, even in that moment where Michael Cohen was asked by Todd Blanche if he had stolen $60,000 from the Trump Organization, Cohen's answer, throughout this whole testimony was again, measured, just agreeing that yes, he did steal from them.And Blanche followed up. You haven't been charged with grand larceny. The prosecutors know that you stole this Monday and Cohen said, no, he hasn't. So it didn't have the same kind of moment as last this weeks of testimony when Blanche cross Cohen on that phone call, but it certainly was admission something that was not exactly shaped that way by the prostate when they brought this out on their direct examination of Cohen. Cohen had said that he did take the money and he said that he thought he was owed it, but it has a little bit more of the drama today because the outright blanche outright asks Cohen if he's stolen. Cohen agreed that he did, but it didn't have that same kind of reverberations through the courtroom as we felt last week.",

So, right now, just to bring you inside the courtroom according to the tidbits we're getting, the prosecution, Mr. Colangelo, is now arguing that several documents corroborate Cohen's testimony, namely the records brought in through Jeff McConney's the -- both though, the Weisselberg memo and the one that his right-hand man Jeff McConney wrote memorializing the reimbursement plan. Colangelo says that at a minimum, a reasonable juror can conclude the invoices, the ledger entries, the sign checks with check stubs, all contain false information, meaning falsification of business records. Colangelo now says that there is also an overwhelming record of concealment that supports and intent to defraud on Trump's part what do you make of it? What do you think?",
