Both sides have come into these meetings with a goal of improving their deeply strained relationship but are playing down expectations of a major breakthrough.

In fact, that is the big question that's been looming over this entire visit.Now, Blinken is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit China in five years, and we do have a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout of today's meeting. And according to this readout, let's bring it up for you. This is what Wang Yi said. He said this, quote, \"We need to reverse the downward spiral of Sino-U.S. relations, promote a return to a healthy and stable track, and jointly find the right way for China and the U.S. to co- exist in the new era,\" unquote. Now, Wang also asked the U.S. to lift unilateral sanctions against China and halt its tech crackdown. Wang Yi also reiterated that Taiwan is one of China's core interests. Now, on Sunday, Blinken met with the Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang. That was a meeting that was friendlier, definitely less combative in tone compared to the one that happened just now. And they met for these candid talks that spanned for some seven and a half hours, and they agreed to maintain high-level ties. And Qin also accepted invitation to visit the U.S. and he called for stable relations, which is important. And China also made clear through that meeting on Sunday that Taiwan is the core issue. I'll just quickly paraphrase what we heard from a MOFA readout of that meeting on Sunday, saying that Taiwan is the most consequential issue, the most pronounced risk in the China-U.S. relationship. Now, going into this high-stakes visit, expectations were set rather low. U.S. officials, who briefed reporters, said that they saw little chance of any sort of a diplomatic breakthrough, given just the so many points of division between these two superpowers, including Taiwan, including trade, including technology, even the flow of the precursor chemicals that make fentanyl. These chemicals stem from China. Now, senior U.S. officials, they say that Blinken's core goal here during this visit is to reestablish the channel of communication between these two superpowers, especially direct military-to-military communications. Also on the table, global issues where both nations have a stake in, have shared interests in, and could cooperate in, like climate change, like public health and economic stability.

Alexei Navalny is expected to attend this new criminal case, this new court hearing via video link.You'll remember of course that he's already serving a nine and a half year prison sentence for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court, although it's important to remember that he and his team and human rights groups maintain that these are politically-motivated, that his imprisonment is politically-motivated. As for the charges he's facing today, there are multiple charges including creating an extremist network and financing extremist activity. As you mentioned this could extend his prison sentence by up to 30 more years. You'll remember he is, of course, the most prominent face of the opposition against President Putin. He was poisoned by Russian intelligence in 2020 with the Novichok nerve agent, that's according to him, his team, human rights groups and German authorities. It was Germany that treated him after that poisoning. He returned to Russia in 2021 but was imprisoned upon landing in Russia and his time in prison has caused his health to deteriorate. And according to his family, he is unable to access enough nutrition. He's lost many, many pounds. He looks more sickly, according, again, to his family. So seeing him via video link today is going to be important for his family, his supporters, to see the state of his well-being. And I also want to note, Rosemary, this is not the only case coming up against Alexei Navalny. There's another case, one of terrorism charges that his team also says is being prepared by Russia's judiciary. That one could carry another 35 years in prison. In a reminder that just a few days ago, one of his aides was sentenced to an additional seven and a half years in prison on extremism charges that, of course, doesn't bode well. But all of this happening in the context of what human rights groups are warning is an increasing and intensifying crackdown by President Putin on any critics in an attempt to silence opposition against him and against the war in Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARIAN DE VOGUE, CNN U.S. SUPREME COURT REPORTER: All eyes are on this conservative Supreme Court to see just how fast and how far the conservatives want to go to move the court to the right. One big case they're considering concerns affirmative action and ask the question whether colleges and universities can continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions plans, has to do with plans out of Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The schools say that they want to be able to consider race in order to make sure that their campuses are diverse. They say that the campuses are often a pipeline to society and it's a better academic environment to have a diverse academic experience. On the other hand, challengers say that it violates equal protection. They say it mounts to racial discrimination and it shouldn't be allowed. The Supreme Court in this case will consider whether to overturn decades-old precedent. There's another case having to do with President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. The plan was put in place to give relief to millions of borrowers in the wake of COVID. Some of them would get up to $20,000 of relief. But here, Republican-led states said that the Biden administration didn't have the authority basically to erase billions of dollars of debt. They said in that case it would have to be Congress that stepped in. And in oral arguments, the conservative justices seemed very skeptical of the Biden administration's position in the case. Finally, there's a really important case that's important to the LGBTQ community. It involves a website designer. She wants to expand her business to make websites that celebrate weddings, but she does not want to create them for same-sex marriages. And here, the LGBTQ community comes in and says that if she wins, then businesses would have a license to discriminate. But on the other side, she says, the website designer she looks at this, through a lens of free speech.

He was calling me, telling me, my daughter, you are being left behind. And when the ark is closed, it will be too late. So I decided to go. When the COVID pandemic hit, she says many saw it as evidence that the prophecies were real. Mackenzie charged her family $80 for a piece of land in Galilee. There were seven other biblically named settlements in Shakahola with more than a thousand followers, she says. Still, cult members made regular trips to a nearby village for food and water. In December, those trips suddenly stopped, says this village elder. The starvation had begun. He says they alerted authorities, but they did nothing, even after hungry children started escaping to the village. What's been called the Shakahola Massacre has shocked this nation. Pastor Mackenzie and his closest followers are being held under terror laws. (on-camera): What happened in the forest with your followers?",

That's just two days after he was released from the Gemelli Hospital in Rome.The pontiff, 86 years old, underwent surgery on June 7th, a three-hour procedure, and was convalescing in the hospital ever since. He was not strong enough to give his angelus on Sunday from the hospital, but he looked good this Sunday, looked strong. Now, the Vatican has canceled his Wednesday audience and will keep his schedule light. However, he is scheduled to meet the leaders of Cuba and Brazil in private audiences during the week. Normally, the pontiff does not hold Wednesday audiences in July, so he will be keeping a lighter schedule. All of this ahead of two very important trips he has coming up. The first week of August, he's expected to go to Portugal for World Youth Day, and the end of August, he has an apostolic voyage to Mongolia. Barbie Lazzie Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's right, seconds here. The 21-year-old now holds the Guinness World Record for fastest time ever solving the cube. The champion's father spoke about his son's achievements. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCHWAN PARK, SON BROKE WORLD RECORD FOR SOLVING RUBIK'S CUBE: I don't think he sort of really -- is impressed with sort of the pageantry and the fame that comes with it. I think he's just so much more focused on the actual times and beating the times and his goals. It's funny because I think maybe part of his autism just prevents him from really understanding the fame or the adulation. I think he intellectually understands it, but I don't think he feels it.
