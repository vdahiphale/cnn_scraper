FOSTERairspace in the past week starting with that suspected Chinese spy balloon last weekend. CNN's Kylie Atwood has more details now on Sunday's incident and the many unanswered questions surrounding it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The Pentagon now confirms at that 2:42 p.m. on Sunday at the direction of President Biden, U.S. military F-16s shot down an object over Lake Huron. That is according to Pentagon press officer Caesar Santiago. This object according to the Pentagon was traveling at about 20,000 feet aboveground. That elevation meant that it posed a threat to civilian aviation. And there was also a flight restriction by the FAA that went into place on Saturday in Montana. And the Pentagon is saying that there's reason to believe that this object is what actually triggered that flight restriction to go into place. Based on the direction that it was headed in. And this object was shot down because of the potential threat to flight aviation and also because of its potential surveillance capabilities. With the Pentagon saying that they are now working to recover this object after it was being shot down. Still many questions. We don't know who or what was responsible for this object or what its motivation or its objective of being in the air over U.S. airspace actually was. Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.

I think that that that is the business of DOJ and needs to be put on the bench for. And instead, the office of director of national intelligence should to get into it. And they should do an administrative classified documents spillage investigation. They should provide to all former residents of the White House. They should provide them all amnesty.

Here's our winter weather advisories that includes Portland. You can also see that there's winter storm warnings surrounding that winter storm warnings, for Flagstaff, Arizona, for instance, north of Phoenix. We have storm watches for Billings, Montana, and just south of Denver. All in all, a very unsettled weather pattern over the Western U.S., this is going to initiate some changes across the entire country which we'll get to in just a moment. But look at all of the wind associated with this. We have high wind alerts across much of the Great Basin. And here's just a broad look at the snowfall totals across the higher elevations. We'll be measuring this in feet for many locations. And we could potentially get some snowfall across the front range into the eastern portions of Colorado. Also, plenty of precipitation you can see for the eastern half of the country that, of course, will fall in the form of rain. And now the potential for some stronger thunderstorms as this system kind of ejects in a low pressure and associated cold front out of the Rockies. Then we still have our redundant snow behind it that's kind of sticking around across the Colorado Rockies. So, here's a look at your chance of severe weather. We're taking you into Wednesday and Thursday so kind of looking ahead here. But this is a good outlook because we want to get just an idea of what's to come. Little Rock to Shreveport, once again Dallas, you have potential for severe weather. We're also going to keep an eye on the sky from the Gulf Coast, all the way to the Ohio River Valley on Thursday. Again, as this low pressure system starts to traverse this region. Now behind it an arctic blast. So, cold air will settle and across the Great Lakes and eventually across the Northeast by the weekend.
