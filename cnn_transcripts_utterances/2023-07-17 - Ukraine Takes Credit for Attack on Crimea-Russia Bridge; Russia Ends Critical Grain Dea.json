This morning, Ukraine is admitting the strike was part of a joint operation.The Kerch Bridge, 12 miles long, it's the only link between the peninsula and Russia, a vital logistical crossing for Moscow to support its troops as they fight in Ukraine. It's also a critical artery for supplying Crimea with civilian goods. Russian officials say there is severe damage to the roadway. You can see it here partially collapsed. Railroad tracks running parallel to the road, however, are still intact. I want to bring in CNN's Senior National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt. He is in Odessa, Ukraine, right there on the sea. That was a critical target for Russia. What might this mean going forward for their ability to perform in that area?",

That railway that you mentioned now, they can do it via land because of the land bridge that they occupied early in the war. But, Sara, no doubt this is an extraordinary attack by Ukraine, not just because of the logistical implications but also what it represents in terms of symbolism. Right after Putin annexed Crimea back in 2014, he ordered that this bridge be built. And when it finally opened four years later, he personally drove across it himself in a truck.So, this really is a blow, not just to Russia because of how it is supplying the Crimean Peninsula and its military, but also because of what it represents. Significant damage to the roadway, there are two lanes of roads we have seen both in video and in photos on social media damage to that roadway. The trails appear to still be running, but we were told earlier that they're running on a delayed schedule. Ukraine claiming responsibility, saying it was that joint operation between both the Navy and the security services. A rare claim of responsibility by Ukraine, we should note, which often is simply coy after these kinds of brazen attacks. Russia much more direct, calling this a terrorist attack, saying that it happened around 3:00 in the morning that Ukraine used sea or surface drones. This comes just nine months after a very similar attack on that same bridge, which took months to repair. So, we wait to see what the Russian response is. Of course, it could be significant. After that last attack, we saw the biggest missile strikes across Ukraine since the war began in February of 2022. Sara?",

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly. And this wasn't entirely unexpected. There have been plenty of signs over the last few days and weeks that this was not going in a good direction. In fact, one Ukrainian diplomat said last month that she was 99 percent certain that the Russians were not going to renew this deal. And, obviously, that has turned out to be true.Still, you mentioned the White House reaction. There's plenty of reaction to this from the western world, the E.U. calling it cynical, the Dutch foreign minister Sir calling it utterly immoral. But from the Russian point of view, John, they think that, look, the U.N. was not living up to its end of the bargain. So, in exchange for allowing Ukrainian grain to go through the Black Sea to market, it was supposed to get help from the United Nations in getting its own grain, its own fertilizer to market. Of course, there are no sanctions on Russian grain or on fertilizer, but, of course, there are plenty of sanctions on Russian banks. And so that has complicated the payment part of this. And so one of the key demands that the Russians had was access to those international payment mechanisms. What the U.N. had offered was access for the Russian Agricultural Bank. Obviously, that's been rejected. The U.N. says that it will continue to work to try to find a deal. They also acknowledge, though, according to one official, that the Russian position is pretty final. The Russians say that they will, though, go back to this deal if their conditions are actually met. And whether or not this has anything to do with the Kerch Bridge explosion, John, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, was asked about this earlier today, and he said this, and I quote, these are absolutely unrelated events. Even before this terrorist attack, the position was declared by President Putin. And I repeat again, as soon as the part of the Black Sea agreements concerning Russia is fulfilled, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal. We may also see some efforts by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to reach out to President Putin. He suggested that he may call. And, of course, given that Ukraine is responsible for perhaps 10 percent of the world's grain markets, this is important and it affects millions of people around the world, John?",

It costs an estimated $4 billion. And there actually have movies been made, propaganda movies, like romance, I forget the name of it, but it was basically a romcom about coupled, you know, crossing the bridge.So, this is kind of part of the folklore.

I'm not sure if you can actually tell from the shop but this is a very small room, and it is very quiet right now, so we don't want to be rude.But as you noted, Donald Trump will not be here today. The reason this is notable, it's because he wasn't invited, and he's been invited in years past. And this is also significant given the fact that he did not turn up to another large evangelical event in Iowa on Friday, one he was invited to, but his advisers said there was a scheduling conflict. However, I was told by people close to Trump, because Trump doesn't want to do these large scale events. Now, as you noted, the evangelical community is a community that has been a cornerstone of Republican politics. It is a group that is much sought after and, as you noted, really helps propel candidates to be the nominee and eventually win the White House. It's also a group that, when you're talking to some of these campaign strategists that are not Donald Trump, they believe that they can actually make inroads with this community. They believe that there is a big group of evangelicals who is looking for an alternative to Donald Trump. And that's what we're likely to hear today, people making the pitch for them to be the alternative to Donald Trump. Now, Kate, the thing I do want to point out here is that he is still widely popular among evangelicals. And as you know, he is still the party frontrunner right now for that nomination. But this is an opening for these candidates to try and make their case to appeal to such a critical group. And it comes again at a time in which it seems Trump himself snubbed them on Friday. And that's what we heard from some of those evangelicals who are at that event and something we heard from those candidates saying that that's what Trump was doing. So, something important here happening. But, obviously, we'll be keeping our ear to the ground to see what exactly the voters are saying and the candidates.",

You've got elected officials like the Republican Governors Association, the elected leadership in the Senate under Mitch McConnell, then you've got interest groups like the Federalist Society or some of these evangelical groups and they're all sort of contending for power.Trump has never really sort of been aligned with the evangelical faction, although they certainly have supported him. And he takes great credit for naming the Supreme Court justices who gave them their big win in the Dobbs decision. But other than that, it's politics. You've got to sort of tussle a little bit.
