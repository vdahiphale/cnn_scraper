Of course, the police have said there was no justification -- so far they've found no justification for why they even stopped Tyre Nichols, not that it matters. But this investigation of course, continues. You can see there were several other officers on scene.

Davis, who has been given a lot of credit for terminating the officers so quickly, moving to have this investigation move at a rapid pace, and of course the indictment by the district attorney, and then of course the release of this video last night.However, I think the councilman is absolutely right, because we've not heard from the police chief for 20 days. Yesterday was the first time, you know, our colleague Don Lemon, spoke to her, and it was the first time that she took questions from the press. She's not taken any press conferences. There really were no answers for days while the investigation was ongoing. I, myself, sent several questions to the Memphis Police Department, wanting to know some basic questions days ago. Police Department I asked them, were these officers part of the Scorpion Unit because I had some information that they were, and they wouldn't answer even that question to me. They basically said everything is under investigation. So yes, I agree with the council member that there are other questions that need to be answered. And also think about this, Jim. The police chief here told Don Lemon that she was notified about this about eight hours after it happened, on January 7th, this happens around 8:00 -- 8:30 at night. She doesn't get notified until 4:00 in the morning. And there are some other questions about what the family was told in the initial stages of what happened here and the delay in that and some of the excuses, according to the family, that the officers were giving to the family about what happened here. So certainly, there are still a lot of questions, and while you can give the police chief credit for moving so quickly and taking action in firing these officers, there's still a lot of other questions that need to be answered and they just can't continue hiding behind the fact that there's this ongoing investigation. Because now there's a Department of Justice investigation. That's going to take some time. And you know, the other part of this is that the Department of Justice could come in here. They can make a decision here that they want to come in here and look at the patterns and practices of this police department. That is something that could happen. So the police chief probably has to make a decision at some point of whether or not she's going to address some of these questions, some of the actions of the Scorpion Unit in previous situations. So I certainly think, Jim, you raise a good point and that council member is certainly raising a good point as well.",

I've been calling for the resignation, firing of this police chief as well because yes, she did come out and fire the five officers who are on this videotape, but there's so many unanswered questions about this unit.One of the things that was so glaring to me was the lack of supervision. No one seemed to be in control that night. There seemed to be no senior officer there to pull back these more junior officers, to step in, to protect the constitutional rights that Mr. Nichols had and that's a flaw that she is responsible for. So you can't talk about what these police officers did without doing a thorough investigation of this entire police department. And I do believe that the Justice Department, in addition to looking at criminal civil rights charges against the five officers, and potentially more officers who were on the scene, that they are going to do an investigation of this entire police department because there are citizens who have come forward and said that this unit has acted in this same aggressive manner that we saw in this tape. And where do these officers get off, Jim, with the language that they use? I felt like we were watching a gang initiation, not professional police officers or public safety officers doing their job.

If an officer shoots someone or injures someone, they don't get to, you know, just do nothing and stand there idle. They have an obligation to try to preserve that individual's life.That is their job, to render aid and to provide some kind of care for that individual. They go, as we saw on that videotape, were standing around trying to create some alibi, some story that was so ridiculous. One guy was limping and one guy is saying, oh, he grabbed for my gun, did you see him when he got off the car and he swung at me. All of these ridiculous statements that were contradicted by what we saw with our very eyes. And I presume those were the lies that they went into the police station and told their superiors. And I was thinking all along, what possibly are they going to say that would justify the kind of injuries that we saw Mr. Nichols, those injuries that he sustained. What lie would they tell that would be convincing to anyone that this man, Mr. Nichols, deserved the kind of injuries that he suffered at the hands of those police officers. There wouldn't be a lie that would protect them from criminal prosecution. But yet, we heard one of the lawyers say one of the ex- officers was surprised. Really? Are they that dumb? Are they that tone-deaf? I don't even know if they should be on the police force, if they somehow thought that that man could lie in a bed with those injuries and they not face criminal charges.",

The community has a lot more questions and a lot more demands. We have gotten emails from many citizens in our community, they're all concerned. They're expressing exactly what they see and what they want to see in our police department.

There's that piece where he tried to change the election result numbers there. There's other things. He is a weakened president who is not in stadiums at this moment. When he started out, he was going to stadiums. The MAGA-ness was mega. OK? There was so many people there. This is an illegal president who is trying desperately to get attention. He's talking about how angry he was. He's talking about how he wanted to fix things before now. He's just as angry as before. But, Jim, here is the different piece to this. You have people who have the ideology that he really spread across this nation, who are now in governorships in spaces like Florida and spaces like Arkansas -- can you say Sarah Huckabee Sanders? In Texas, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, other places that are espousing his ideology. And right now, the man who carried that flag is now weakened. And there are others who, if you will, are more credible, who people are paying more attention to right now than Donald Trump. And his party is fractured because of those ideologies.",

That was the issue when Donald Trump didn't want to push for reform. And then-President Barack Obama came into 21st century policing, body cameras and the film, et cetera. And now we're in a space where this president, Joe Biden, is working hard to renew the efforts to bring back the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. And I just talked to Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader of the House, on King holiday, and he said it's going to have to be a Democratic-led Senate that's going to lead this effort. And remember, Tim Scott, Republican Senator Tim Scott, a black man of South Carolina, is the one who put the kibosh on the effort for the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. He was going along with what Donald Trump said. And even at that time, they were even using some of what President Trump had put forward and Tim Scott even kiboshed it then. Now it's back to the Senate. And it's going to have to be the Senate that revitalizes or reignites this effort and then it goes to the House and we'll see.",
