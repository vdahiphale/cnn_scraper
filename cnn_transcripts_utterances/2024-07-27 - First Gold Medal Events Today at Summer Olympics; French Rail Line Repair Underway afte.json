France did their best to put on an Olympics opening ceremony for the ages.The bells of Notre Dame rang for the first time since the cathedral was gutted by fire, water cannons blasting along the River Seine. There were odes to the French Revolution, a theatrical display with a bunch of beheaded Marie Antoinettes. Lady Gaga kicked things off French cabaret style. At one point, 80 artists from Moulin Rouge performing the iconic dance that dates back to the 1820s. It was part music festival, part fashion show, a diverse and inclusive display that had something for everyone. May seem over the top at times but not for Paris. As for the athletes, 85 boats floated with nearly 7,000 athletes from more than 200 delegations, many of their uniforms were covered with a bunch of plastic ponchos. But they were still dancing and celebrating in the rain. This was the first ever opening ceremony outside of a stadium. Then one of the most iconic moments of any Olympics, the torch making its way around the country here to Paris, with sporting legends from all over the world getting to touch it. Rafa Nadal, Serena Williams, Nadia Comaneci, Tony Parker; finally made its way to two French Olympians, Teddy Riner and Marie-Jose Perec. The Olympic flame was ignited and the cauldron lifted up, floated up into the air, marking the start of the 2024 Summer Games in Paris. And after all that, about four hours in, legendary singer Celine Dion, who has been battling a rare neurological condition, performed for the fans and athletes from the Eiffel Tower. With that, the 2024 Paris Olympics are officially underway. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

BELL (voice-over):  It wasn't just speculators affected, with one official telling reporters that only two of the four trains carrying athletes were able to run. As repairs get underway, the national railway company's regional director said it could take a day or more before lines start functioning again. The latest drama likely to dampen the spirits of the French, many of them heading off from family holidays, even as Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo believed that enthusiasm for the Games had finally gripped the country. HIDALGO (through translator):  I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris and there were people everywhere -- children, elderly people, all social classes. Everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the games working.

Here at International SOS, our goal is to provide reliable information to our client organizations who were also directly affected.From a logistics perspective by these acts what appears to be sabotage and that terrorism is due by the authorities. In addition to that, from passing down reliable information to our organizations, it's a goal of ours to also provide actionable advice. And so we wanted to make sure that our clients were able to reconfirm their journeys and also just make them aware that the disruption was expected to last throughout the weekend, given the volume of people affected.

However, there's some candidates on that list as we -- as I talked about a minute ago, who don't necessarily come from the Midwest, right? And don't come from that blue wall region but instead come from the Sun Belt. Someone like Mark Kelly. And I think I think strength of his, that he comes from a border state, is able to talk about that issue and just give additional credibility to the ticket when talking about that issue. And Roy Cooper, an example, another governor, governor of North Carolina, a state that Democrats truly feel is winnable for them right now, Joe Biden was not able to win that state four years ago. Instead, he won our home state, home state of Georgia. But Democrats really think they have a shot there and so I do think that that's a big part of the calculus for the vice president in thinking through, what state does this potential running mate bring to the table? And I think someone like Andy Beshear, who a lot of Democrats like, is from a state, the state of Kentucky. Most Democrats don't think Kentucky's necessarily in play.

The vice president has never been the border czar.

That's not that dissimilar from an issue that Joe Biden had in his portfolio when he was vice president. And I think it's important again that the Democrats come out and remind the country which party, which candidate tanked the bipartisan border bill that those in the Congress had come to an agreement on. And that was Donald Trump. Members the Republican Party in Congress we're ready to come to the table and to advocate for that bill. Donald Trump killed it at the last minute. And so I think it's going to be vitally important for the Harris campaign to continuously be doing, which is to set the record straight there. And to uplift the accomplishments on that issue, which is that the president took strong executive action. The president has taken action to support those who are in this country as DACA recipients. The president has -- and the vice president together have also enacted strong steps that have helped reduce illegal border crossings as well.

And she has the opportunity here to build on her incredible record and to build on the many firsts that she's accomplished in her career and become the first woman, the first Black woman, the first woman of color to ever serve as President of the United States.

In 1988, they again lost to the Soviet Union. And that would be the last time the U.S. used amateur players. Because in 1992, we had the Dream Team with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.

The U.S. dominance continued until 2004 but that team, despite having a young LeBron James and Dwayne Wade and Hall of Famers Allen Iverson and Tim Duncan just didn't mesh. They lost three games in Athens. The most ever by a men's Olympic squad. The U.S. finishing a disappointing third place watching Manu Ginobli and Argentina capture the goal. After that loss, the U.S. reevaluated how they built the Olympic roster stressing team chemistry as they vowed to not have another poor performance at the Games. In 2008, Kobe Bryant led the Redeem Team to an undefeated run to reclaim U.S. dominance. And ever since, it's been nothing but gold for Team USA at the Games.
