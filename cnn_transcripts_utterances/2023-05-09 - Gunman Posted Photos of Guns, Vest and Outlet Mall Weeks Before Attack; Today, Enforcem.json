These communities across the U.S./Mexico border, like the one I'm in here in Brownsville, have already seen an uptick in migration traffic. And it was a week-and-a-half ago that those numbers really started to tick up here. Last month, in fact, they were already starting to see more and more migrants come across into the Rio Grande Valley, leading the city of Brownsville to declare a state of emergency.We checked in with Team Brownsville. They are a non-profit here that helped migrants after they cross into the United States. They say they have about 1,000 migrants currently in their shelter. And they're at capacity, so much so that we're starting to see people sleeping on the streets here outside of these ports of entry, like the one I'm standing in front of. It is really making a lot of people anxious here along the U.S./Mexico border about what's to come. You show in that video Texas Governor Greg Abbott announcing a security operation overnight, saying that he's wired shut a point of entry that is used to cross illegally by migrants. He's saying he's going to do more of that across the U.S./Mexico border in places like El Paso, which just like the Rio Grande Valley, is a historically -- it's an area that -- a lot of illegal immigration happens across that ports of entry. Meanwhile, the Biden administration saying that they have 1,500 active duty troops that they're sending to the border, they'll join 2,500 National Guard members to contribute in an administrative role. We haven't seen them from our vantage point, but that could be because they're working in an administrative role, not in a law enforcement role. They're trying to free up those DHS resources who are preparing and bracing for what they're calling a surge of migrants coming across the border. Meanwhile, we're also seeing a lot of politicking going on. You mentioned that targeted enforcement operation announced overnight by the Biden administration drawing criticism here from the border patrol union, saying the administration giving a heads up to people that they're trying to capture.

There's nothing else for him to say. And they also said that Carroll's story or elements of it were completely unbelievable and saying to the jury that they called -- Carroll's team called two friends who corroborated her story.

They say more women are overweight now, as are all Americans, than when Opill was first approved 50 years ago as a prescription drug, pointing out that 60 percent of people of reproductive age in the U.S. are overweight or obese. The degree to which efficacy of Opill diminished in individuals who are overweight or obese remains unknown, the FDA scientists wrote.They also say that studies conducted by Opill's manufacturer indicate in a non-prescription setting consumers may not correctly follow use directions.
