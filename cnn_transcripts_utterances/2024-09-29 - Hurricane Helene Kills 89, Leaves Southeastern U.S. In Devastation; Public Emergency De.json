Thirty of those deaths coming in Buncombe County, North Carolina, where Asheville is located. We're told whole towns are underwater. Rescue efforts are underway. About 2.5 million people are still without power across five different states as downed trees, landslides and communication issues persist. CNN's Ivan Rodriguez has more on Helene's widespread destruction. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN RODRIGUEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Communities in the southeast are grappling with widespread devastation after Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Thursday.

But the first priority is still search and rescue.So I think this is -- you got to put this in context that while there are people moving to those more immediate needs, a lot of effort is still on searching and trying to locate people, particularly those that may be trapped. And then as you start getting into these water missions and dealing with feeding, a lot of this will be determined by how long does it take to get water systems back up? And as you've heard and seen from reports, some of these systems have been destroyed or heavily damaged. So you're talking days to weeks just to get those systems up. So this will not be. a short response on the water emission and others. This is probably going to be going on for weeks in some of these areas that are hard hit.",

People are having a very hard time communicating, much less, just to tell people they're okay, much less to have all of the officials and people trying to get to them and rescue them being able to communicate with one another. What is your best recommendation if somebody out there is trying to hear from a loved one and can't get them? What do you recommend they do and what kind of challenge does that present? FUGATEsomebody doesn't necessarily mean the worst has happened. So, first thing I tell people is, although we know we have lost lives, we generally see more people that are missing or unaccounted for because of communications. I don't want people to lose hope. The second thing is, as those services come up, you'll start getting better communication, but for the people in the area, probably their best source of information is still gonna be radio. Radio stations that are broadcasting to get information in the areas. Each state has different ways to get into their systems and say, hey, I got family missing, identify that. So I would recommend looking at those state emergency management websites on how you can get information in there that you're missing somebody and see if there's any information on them. But it's hard to say patience, but I also will tell you that in many of these disasters, it is the lack of communications that leads people to worry that in many cases, people are okay, they're just cut off. And so I just want people to, you know, you hear these big numbers about people being missing and you can't make contact, don't assume the worst. In many cases, as communication comes up, we'll be reuniting families.",

And they said that's part of the sophistication of this mission, is you time it right to the minute, to the second even, to try to reduce the possibility of civilian casualties on the ground. They say you cannot always mitigate against that, but they take precautions they told me, you know, if they see civilians there or if they see for example shipping close by to where they're targeting.

As you mentioned there, the vice president has a lead on her Republican rival, Donald Trump, among that electorate, a growing electorate, but when you break it down, she has an advantage with women, Hispanic women, but it's pretty even with Hispanic men, and taken in totality, it still lags behind other Democratic nominees. So, this is an area of focus for the Harris campaign to try to gain some ground with these Latino voters, including with her stop here in the critical swing state of Nevada. Now, of course, this is going to conclude her West Coast swing. Earlier, on Friday, she was in Arizona where she talked about border security, and then she has spent the weekend in California where she has participated in two fundraisers. She is currently at one now before she comes down here for this rally. Now, the rest of the week is going to look like a focus on the blue wall, and she will be returning to Pennsylvania as well because as the campaign has looked at multiple pathways to hit those 270 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is always key to that strategy. So, the campaign clearly ramping up their travel and getting more aggressive ahead of Election Day and the vice president concluding her West Coast swing for now with this rally tonight here in Las Vegas.",
