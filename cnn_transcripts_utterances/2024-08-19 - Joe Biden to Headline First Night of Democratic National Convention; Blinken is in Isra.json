Well the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off in the coming hours, just one month after Vice President Kamala Harris launched her bid for the White House, setting off a wave of enthusiasm among Democratic voters. Harris is now in Chicago, where she is preparing for the high stakes week ahead and hoping to build on the momentum that's followed her dramatic rise to the top of the ticket. Delegates from across the country have gathered in the city for the four-day event.Later today, U.S. President Joe Biden will deliver a keynote address at the convention as he passes the torch to Harris, who's expected to be in attendance. And in a symbolic moment, the DNC roll call on Tuesday is set to begin with Mr. Biden's home state of Delaware and end with California and Minnesota, the home states of Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. The two spent Sunday on the campaign trail, working to get their message out to voters in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We all here, we love our country. And we know our country is going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And to fight for what we stand for. You know, when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Being an old football coach, there's an old saying, you don't hope you're going to win. You prepare to win. And you give it the best you've got. And you know when that game's over, you want to know you left it all on the field. And that's all we're asking. Let's leave it all on the field. Let's get this thing done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But certainly the pressure on both parties and certainly from the part of the United States on Israel has perhaps never been greater to do a deal. And there are several reasons for that. First and foremost is to try to forestall an attack by Iran and or its proxy Hezbollah to avenge the assassinations of Hezbollah's top military commander and the head of Hamas's political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Then, of course, you've got the death toll, as you mentioned,breaching 40,000, figures that don't distinguish between combatants and civilians, and the humanitarian situation deteriorating to the extent that you've now had the first known outbreak of polio in the Gaza Strip in some 25 years. And then, of course, the 115 or so Israeli hostages, around a third of whom are believed to be dead and who have been in captivity now for 10 months since being kidnapped in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks. Now, for all of those reasons, you saw Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying effectively that it's now or never to try to get a deal done. President Biden on Friday said, in his words, that we were closer than we've ever been. Just after disembarking Air Force One on Sunday, he sounded slightly less optimistic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say that introduces new conditions regarding the swap of Palestinian prisoners, the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages. And as you say, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of effectively trying to sabotage this deal for his own political ends. Israel, for its part, is saying, well, Prime Minister Netanyahu putting out two statements over the weekend, one saying there are certain things they can be flexible on and certain areas where they will not budge. And the two areas that he mentioned that Israel will not budge on is, first of all, that it won't agree to an end to the war before signing up to this three-phase ceasefire plan. And the other is Israel insisting that it remain in control of the so- called Philadelphia Corridor that runs between the southern Gaza city of Rafah and the Egyptian border in order to prevent, in Prime Minister Netanyahu's words, terrorist elements from rearming. Now -- So as a result of all of that, the two sides are still, you know, far apart.

The fact that Michigan voters would want to support her in the November election, but we can't do that right now while our family members, our friends, our loved ones are being killed with U.S.-funded bonds. I told her that we need a policy shift that will save lives in Gaza. My community is telling me that they're losing tens and hundreds of their family members. And she said it's horrific. She's been incredibly empathetic. I do have to say that more. We have seen more empathy and compassion from Vice President Harris, but that is not enough. Palestinian children can't eat words.

They're going to be in the convention most of this week, working the room. Of course, there's expected to be thousands, potentially tens of thousands, of demonstrators outside the convention. for the pro-Palestinian cause. And look, a question these activists get a lot is could this uncommitted movement, this saying we will not vote for Harris unless she changes policies on Gaza, could that potentially help Trump win the election? Those activists that we spoke to said that's not their problem, that is for the Harris campaign. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is not an operation that intended or at least has developed into something that was sort of an in-and-out designed to send a message. They are now really based on the communications we're getting from them trying to, in Zelenskyy's words, reinforce their positions, trying to create this sort of buffer zone over the border inside Russia to prevent those Russian attacks coming back across the border into Ukraine, and in his words, to destroy as much Russian war potential as possible. So in that sense, Ukraine continues to reinforce the point that this is a defensive operation.In that vein, the Ukrainian armed forces put out this video on Sunday of what they say at the Sivalka flamethrower systems, these are thermobaric missiles the kind of missiles at that sort of put out a cloud aerosol, cloud of gas all chemicals around them and can be extremely deadly. They say that this was aimed at enemy manpower and military equipment and the Russians suffered considerable losses. Obviously, we don't have any way of verifying that's but some from pretty dramatic video of Ukraine's ongoing operation on the Kursk region. And of course blowing up bridges which they now claim to have blown up two of them on this river the same river that runs east to west across the Kursk region about 50 or so kilometers north of Sudzha, this video showing what purports to be the second explosion on a bridge on Sunday. That is of course part of the same picture trying to stop Russia resupplying forces or bringing more forces into the area where Ukraine now has a foothold. But of course as they're doing this as you say Russia is making gains in the east and that is really sort of the opposite of what Ukraine wants here. They are trying to pull Russian troops away from the more vulnerable areas of the front and we see Russia inching forward, Ukraine speeding up evacuations in these most vulnerable areas of the eastern front, the small town of Toretsk and of course the bigger defensive stronghold of Pokrovsk. I think the big question now is Russia clearly defending still in the Kursk region at what points do they managed to bring in enough reinforcements to launch an actual counterattack to try to push Ukraine out. As you say, right now, President Putin clearly trying to play down the significance of this attack, continuing with a sort of diplomatic blitz, his visit to Azerbaijan, his second big international meeting since this operation in Kursk started.
