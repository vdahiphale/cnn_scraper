U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris hits the presidential campaign trail, she'll speak in the next few minutes, and she's just been endorsed by two of the most powerful people in the Democratic Party. Also happening this hour, President Joe Biden returning to the White House after his COVID isolation. Tomorrow, he says he'll deliver a speech about his decision to drop out of the race. All of this coming this hour. And again, we are following a number of major developments in the United States. In minutes, we are expected to hear from Vice President Harris, who will kick off her presidential bid with an event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. You are looking at live video there as those supporters await her speech. Meantime, Democrats have been lining up at breakneck speed behind Kamala Harris, the party's new presumptive presidential nominee. A short time ago, Harris received the endorsement of the top two Democrats on Capitol Hill, House Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  President Biden's selfless decision has given the Democratic Party the opportunity to unite behind a new nominee, and boy, oh boy, are we enthusiastic. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):  Kamala Harris and her candidacy has excited and energized the House Democratic Caucus, the Democratic Party, and the nation. Vice President Harris has earned the nomination.

But it comes of course, after that historic decision by President Biden to withdraw from the race and endorsed his Vice President, who in a matter of just two days has really racked up the trifecta from endorsements within the party to really incredible fundraising numbers, especially at the grassroots level to the delegates for the Democratic Party lining up behind her. She's effectively secured the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination, even though that process will officially go forward in the days to come, culminating with a selection of her by August 7, according to the Democratic National Committee. Now, this all comes as we await word from President Biden on what exactly he says led him to step down after three weeks of a crisis of confidence within the Democratic Party, and his own confidence that he could stay in the race, and he could defeat former President Donald Trump. For months, he had said that he was the only Democrat who could beat Donald Trump. But of course, that mindset began to shift in the wake of the CNN debate last month. And the calls from party leaders and critical backers of the party for the President to step aside in favor of a new generation. Now, Harris has very quickly taken up the mantle of the candidacy. She has essentially rebranded the Wilmington headquarters for what was the Biden- Harris campaign, and now is the Harris for President campaign before she names a running mate, which itself will be a truncated and fast-track process, given how little time there is before the convention in just a few weeks. But as for President Biden, he now begins a six-month stretch of his presidency where he is trying to button up his remaining to-do list and try to shape a legacy of more than five decades in public service. That's what I expect to hear from the President tomorrow night, and that's what I expect his aides will be discussing in the months to come, Paula.",

Because again, she likely does not want to look too bridle. She will be expecting these kinds of criticisms and really, despite strong speeches, will have to show people in that crucial middle that she has enough going forward in order to actually get something done on, not just the economy, but also those border issues.",

But also, her supporters tell me that she doesn't need to respond to them. That she can really lean on the strength of her election arguments alone.

For now though, I want to bring in Democratic campaign consultant, Tim Hogan and former Republican congressman for Illinois, Joe Walsh. Thank you to you both. Tim, first to you. Look, it's obvious, right? The Dems are basking in this re-energized campaign. But I have to ask you what now, how to face the challenges in battleground states like Wisconsin? TIM HOGAN, U.S. DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT:  Yes, you're starting to see the campaign mobilized. You saw the Vice President go speak at the campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware yesterday. I think previewing a message of what this campaign is going to look like. It's a prosecutor versus a felon, it's someone who defends reproductive rights versus someone who cheers that he was able to overturn Roe v. Wade. Someone who cares about the middle-class versus someone who only cares about himself and his billionaire donors. And this is a key moment for the campaign because like you noted, Republicans are going to throw the kitchen sink at the Vice President. But as of right now, I don't think they know what is going to stick. And based on the momentum that we have, $100 million raised, 1.1 million donors, 62 percent of those donors are new donors. There's a ton of momentum that's about taking advantage of that moment.",

We have -- we have a new ticket, 15 weeks out. It's almost more like a European-style election in the sense that we have to move quickly. But what she's doing today is why as you get out to the battleground states, you don't just do one rally, you do two rallies, and off the record, you go to a local business.

And Cheatle acknowledges that in the letter that she sent to Secret Service staff today, announcing her resignation, she said that she didn't want calls for her resignation to be a distraction from the great work the service was doing on a day-to-day basis. And look, it's clear that her -- the calls for her resignation had become a distraction, but mostly because we now have bipartisan consensus from House lawmakers after the hearing yesterday that she needed to step down. Now, she's going to be replaced on an acting basis by a career official who will take over the reins, and there's going to be no shortage of scrutiny going forward.

But in the meantime, we tell you that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is on a long-awaited visit to Washington, but the timing less than ideal. His trip as we've been speaking here, likely overshadowed by the massive upheaval in U.S. politics after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Mr. Netanyahu will address both Houses of Congress on Wednesday, the same day Mr. Biden speaks to the nation about the decision to pass the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris. But Mr. Netanyahu and President Biden are now scheduled to meet on Thursday. Donald Trump may be trying to upstage that visit. He just announced on social media that he will meet with Mr. Netanyahu on Friday at Mar-a-Lago. We want to bring in our Kylie Atwood live at the State Department. A lot of moving parts here to be clear. And one thing is that President Biden, if he's able to get this ceasefire deal done in the coming weeks, that would be one of the big boost, right? For the Kamala Harris campaign already. What are you hearing from the Biden administration as we get closer to this visit? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, listen, the Biden administration, U.S. officials have repeatedly said in recent days that they're feeling somewhat optimistic here. There are still a lot of work underway, talks to continue on this effort later this week. But while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is here in Washington, the reality is that even though there's some optimism in the air, there's still no deal in hand, and there are many family members of Israelis and Americans who are still held hostage by Hamas, who have come to Washington this week to make their voices heard, to make sure that they are clearly stating to members of Congress who are going to be seeing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. To members of President Biden's cabinet, who are also going to be in those meetings, that they believe that Netanyahu needs to strike a deal now. They believe there is a deal to be had, and they really want them to move as swiftly as they can to make sure their loved ones come home. Now, we're watching --",

As I was saying this is important for Joe Biden to show that he has strength and to show that he is still consequential, especially when it comes to the Middle East negotiations.

And, you know, it's a really unique moment here in Washington this week because wehave been focused for weeks now on the fact that the Israeli prime minister was coming here. He was planning and still will deliver that address tomorrow to a joint meeting of Congress. We'll have to watch and see if there are any members of Congress who don't show up to it and protest the fact that he is coming here and hasn't actually achieved a deal yet or protesting the Biden administration's policy towards Israel. But then, the other parts of his visit here have really just come together in the last 24 hours or so, as recently as that Former President Trump, who is the Republican nominee for president, is going to be meeting with Netanyahu on Friday. We found out finally that President Biden will meet with Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday. That meeting was a little bit up in the air because President Biden was returning here to Washington after having COVID, after, of course, making that major announcement that he is no longer going to be the Democratic nominee for president. That appears to be in the hands of Vice President Kamala Harris at this point. So, there's a lot of moving parts that have been injected into the conversation here in Washington this week. And even though, of course, the visit of the prime minister is one of the focal points, it is not the only focal point here in Washington. We'll have to watch and see what he chooses to focus in on during his address to Congress tomorrow. And of course, if there are any accomplishments, any developments in terms of these ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas that Netanyahu and President Biden are able to announce after their meeting on Thursday.",

But, of course, the prime minister's address has been on the books for a while now, too. So, it's very safe to assume that that previous engagement was planned, knowing that Netanyahu was going to be in town. And we'll watch and see how that dynamic plays out between Vice President Harris and Prime Minister Netanyahu. As you said, there is an expectation that they're going to have their own meeting this week. That's still not on the calendar yet. But what we really don't know is what the dynamic between those two leaders will look like. And that is a huge question mark. It's a pivotal question.",

A lot of what we heard was not just taking it to Donald Trump, but also saying that, look, this campaign is more -- is not just about what they don't want in the United States, but what they have to fight for, and highlighted a lot of the themes that she had highlighted before. The fact that they're going to double down on things like gun control, certainly women's reproductive rights, and talking a little bit about the middle class. And protecting Social Security and Medicare. I want to bring in again, Tim Hogan, Democratic campaign consultant. Tim, obviously a spirited speech. I mean, the split screen between her and president Biden could not be more stark. I'm wondering though, what you think of the messages is very close to what she said certainly in Delaware on Sunday, but again, what are we thinking when we hear those words from her and the kind of campaign, the character of the campaign that she's now trying to get underway? TIM HOGAN, U.S. DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON, HILLARY CLINTON'S 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  A stunningly good speech. And I think what you heard in that room, that's going to be the reaction to the Harris candidacy hopefully for the next 15 weeks. There is an energy that she brought to that messaging, that speech that I think Democrats have been hungry for for a very, very long time, and you're almost hearing a pent up release of happiness from Democrats and from that crowd. And she hit all of the notes. She talked about her personal biography, how this campaign is about a prosecutor versus a felon, how there is a democratic agenda that is popular, that we know polls extremely well, whether it's child care, health care, paid family leave, reducing gun violence, all of that made that into the speech. I think she did it extremely well.",
