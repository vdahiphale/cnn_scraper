But we'll explain how thawing frost could bog down Russia's progress. Authorities say a shooting in the West Bank today is the latest in a string of terror incidents. We'll explain what both the Israelis and the Palestinians are doing to try and lower the temperature there. And the British Prime Minister and the European Commissioner President take a victory lap here in the U.K., claiming they finally cracked Brexit. But first, Russia is starting the week with deadly air attacks on Ukraine, firing 14 Iranian-made drones in what Ukrainian officials describe as two waves of attacks. In a city southwest of Kyiv, two rescue workers were killed trying to help those injured in the first wave. This targeting of civilians is one reason why the U.N. says Russia's invasion has triggered the most massive violations of human rights that are occurring in the world today. Meanwhile, fighting in eastern Ukraine continues at fever pitch. Alex Marquardt is there for us. And Alex, good to see you. That western front is where we're really seeing some of the fiercest fighting, particular, Bakhmut. What is your sense, Alex, on the ground of as to how the Ukrainian forces are faring. Do they believe they can hold it and absorb the pressure?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Russians are pushing forward at several points along the eastern and partof the southern front as part of the beginning of this offensive, which is underway according to Ukrainian officials, but Isa, there is no doubt that the most ferocious fighting with the heaviest casualties on both sides is taking place in and around the city of Bakhmut. Remember Ukrainian forces are facing primarily mercenaries and convicts from the -- from the Wagner Group. Those are being backed up by regular Russian forces. The Russians do appear to be making some progress. They have claimed that they have taken several villages to the north of Bakhmut. Ukrainian officials say that they are holding on, but it is clear that the Russian forces are trying to encircle the city, they are trying to press forward with absolutely everything that they have, using all of the weapons and ammunition and men that they have. Ukrainian side says that the Russians are suffering significant casualties. Remember, the White House just a week and a half ago says that the Wagner had already lost some 9,000 men, but it is clear that it is taking a major toll on both sides. Isa, this was a fight that over the past few months has gotten closer and closer quarters. This is now a fight that is street to street, block to block. They're using rifles, they're using artillery, if they're outside the city, they're fighting in the trenches.   So, this is the focal point certainly for the Russian side when it comes to this eastern front. But when you zoom out, big picture, if the Russians were to take this, yes, it would be a symbolic victory for Russia, it would be a symbolic victory for Vladimir Putin, it would likely not change the battlefield all that much. Ukrainians would be expected to dig in just to the west of Bakhmut, but of course, it would be a significant symbolic defeat for them. But we are not there yet, Ukrainians say that they are hanging on, one thing that is complicating the fighting is the fact that it is getting relatively warmer, and that is leading to muddy roads, flooding. That is one thing that Ukrainians hope will slow down the Russians, but it also makes everything all that more complicated. So when it comes to the fighting on the eastern front, Bakhmut is what we are watching the most closely, Isa.",

We'll stay on top of that story for you. Now, to Israeli, because Israeli forces are reporting a new attack in the West Bank after a weekend of deadly violence. They say an Israeli man was shot on a highway near Jericho, he was taken to hospital, and later died of his injuries. Tensions were already high after armed settlers went on a rampage against Palestinians in Huwara on Sunday, following the fatal shooting of two Israelis. The settlers torched cars and homes with families inside. One Palestinian man was shot and killed. Other people were injured with stones or metal bars. Residents are recounting moments of sheer terror. A girl describes what happened when settlers smashed the windows of her home. Have a listen.

Women,children and an infant among at least 63 people have died following a shipwreck in the rough seas off southern Italy. Dozens of migrants are still missing. Our Ben Wedeman has more now from Rome. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The tide brings in wreckage of a boat, the wreckage of more lives lost in the Mediterranean. Among the dead to wash up on this lonely Calabrian Beach, an 8-month-old infant. The 20-meter long wooden boat reportedly took to sea from Turkey, Thursday, with perhaps as many as 250 people on board. Coming from, among other places, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran and Syria. Fisherman Luchano Vichenso(ph) was one of the first on the scene before dawn. \"When we arrived, we found ten dead\", he said. \"And as dawn broke, we found more and more.\" Only around 80 people survived the shipwreck. The rest, perhaps well over a 100, either dead or missing. \"This type of tragedy should have been avoided\", said the Governor of Calabria, Roberto Occhiuto. Sunday, Pope Francis told the faithful in Saint Peter's Square, \"I pray for each of them. For the missing, and for the other migrants who survived.\" But thoughts and prayers won't save lives. Since 2014, more than 20,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean. Escaping war, famine, repression, chaos and hopelessness. Increasingly, Europe, including Italy, has taken a hard line on those from the global south fleeing their native lands. In a statement, Italy's right- wing Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, expressed what she called her profound pain in the disaster. But Meloni rode to power on an anti-immigrant platform, and last week, the Italian parliament approved new laws, making it ever more difficult for volunteer groups to carry out rescues at sea. What Europe can do for those in need has been made vividly clear by its embrace of millions of Ukrainian refugees. An embrace that doesn't extend to those braving deadly voyages such as these to reach Europe's shores. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think that we already havediscussed that at the E.U. level, I believe that he also needs to step up to finance the production of ammunition and sending that. And, of course, this is also about tanks, about air defense systems, about long range artillery systems. I wouldn't exclude also sending jets, but I understand that the current major issue and major priority is sending more ammunition and sending more tanks and the weapon systems. But if you speak about Latvia, we have already reached and actually passed one percent of GDP mark in the military assistance. I very much hope that many other NATO and Ukraine allies would follow Latvia's example on this.",

And I think that in that case, we need to look into economic restrictive measures, or sometimes called sanctions, all other instruments at our disposal and here, U.S., so-called G7, And the E.U., needs to stand together. But I do hope that China understands all the consequences and also what it would mean for the international law and order, and that I do hope that China will not supply Russia with lethal or non-lethal military agreement.

This is over a newlyupdated classified intelligence report from the U.S. Department of Energy that concluded the pandemic was likely caused by a Chinese laboratory leak. Beijing says a lab leak was highly unlikely and accused Washington of smearing China. I want to go now to our National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand, who joins me now.

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa. So what we're learning is that the intelligence community provided Congress with anupdate into its investigation of the origins of COVID-19. And as part of that update, which was provided pretty recently, it included a section noting that the Department of Energy had shifted its position, essentially from not having a formed opinion on the conclusion, to now believing that it did likely originate from a lab leak. And that is the product we're told of some new intelligence that the Department of Energy gleaned. But we don't know exactly what that intelligence is at that -- at this moment. And we should note that this was an assessment that was made with low competence. So, essentially, what the Energy Department is saying here is that they believe that, while this is the most likely explanation for how the pandemic originated based on the wide array of theories as to how this could have started, it is still not -- they're still not able to say that this was -- decisively begun in a laboratory, because they don't have enough intelligence to decisively conclude that. The sources that they do have perhaps were not solid enough. Essentially, they didn't have a full enough picture to present this analysis with either moderate or high competence, for example. So the Department of Energy does join the FBI in assessing that the most likely origin of the pandemic did stem -- was from a laboratory leak. But we're told that the rest of the intelligence community, including the four kind of prominent ones, including the CIA, they really have not come to a definitive conclusion one way or the other. And that is primarily because it has been really difficult to glean accurate, reliable information about the origins of the pandemic without China's full cooperation here. And that is something that the 2021 report released by the intelligence community made very clear, which was that without that help from Beijing, with that on the grounds analysis, ultimately, the U.S. and the world may never actually know how this pandemic began, Isa.",
