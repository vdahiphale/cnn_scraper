The endgame, reducing inflation. But amid those big players, Britain seems, in particular, troubled, as the international monetary fund warns it will be the only major economy to shrink this year. Even Russia, crippled by western sanctions, is expected to see more growth. It poses an extraordinary challenge for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, 100 days since he took office. Indeed, here in Britain, the pain and anger has poured into the streets with the country seeing its biggest strike in a decade, as many as half a million workers walking out from transport to teachers' unions. And little light at the end of the tunnel, with the cost of living crisis that's forcing about 4 million children into poverty. Correspondent Nada Bashir was there on Walkout Wednesday.

So, part of this -- the IMF forecast and the comparison with other countries is a little bit of an accident of timing. And I can certainly say, as an economist, the IMF is often wrong. I would not put a lot in store by this particular numbers. But the bigger picture which you have been speaking about is definitely true. That Britain came out of COVID and is now going into this or has been through this cost of living, energy price rise crisis with some of the worst characteristics of the U.S. and the worst characteristics of Europe. You know, it has big energy price rise which the U.S. hasn't had but it's also got a very hot labor market, which the U.S. has. And then it's thrown in some of its own program problems. A rather tired government and already struggling with growth, economy, struggling with Brexit economy.

Businesses aren't, sort of, this entity over here, they are made up of people. And businesses, especially the SME's of all -- the small and medium sized enterprises of our membership, they want to pay their people well. They want their people to be happy and to thrive. So, they are juggling this, you know, trying to pay their people with their huge spiraling energy bills and all the other input costs. I mean, we estimate there's probably input of about 20 to 25 percent for businesses, and obviously, output at 10 percent. It means they are absorbing a huge amount into the margin and the cash can only last for so long. So, they are finding other ways of ensuring that their people are looked after.

What was it like grappling with that complicated legacy? PRINCE-BYTHEWOOD:  It was so important for us, for this film, to be able to dispel so much of the historically inaccurate information out there about this kingdom, about these women. So, for us, yes, if you go on Wikipedia and you read about this, there are some horrible things written about it. But what we do, certainly as filmmakers, you do a deep dive in the research. And we pulled in researchers and academics, ancestors of these women. People from Benin to tell us the history from the right perspective. And not the perspective of those, the colonizers, who had an absolute incentive to dehumanize this kingdom. So, what we learned was so countered to that. Yes, they were involved in the trade at one point which is inexcusable. Obviously, we know almost every culture in the world dealt with slavery at some point. But we said at this time, specifically, when the trade was -- it had actually dropped and (INAUDIBLE) by 91 percent. There was a definitive shift in both the government and in society to get rid of the trade. And the women, the Agojie women lead by Nanisca, Viola, they were really at the forefront of pushing the kingdom and their society to move away from the trade.

The reverence that people had for these women, which is something so many women back then didn't get to feel, and certainly, it feels like that's a connection that so many women have.

Ithas to do with economic stagnation and the living standers of ordinary citizens. I think in the part, being self-critical, you and I as sort of members of elite just by virtue of being on television and talking about these topics, I think often has to do with, you know, people out at social circles being a little bit out of touch with the rest of the country and trying to perhaps impose our preferences, our ideas about the world, not always listening to the -- just not always listening to feedback. All of those are reasons. But I do think that one important reason is this great contestation of what are the rules of our society going to be like? Is there going to be a vision for our society in which members of historically marginalized groups feel that they have a full seat at the table, but are being treated as equals? But also, members of a historical majority, of historically dominant groups, become paranoid about, you know, what's this country going to look like in 20 or 30 or 40 years. Am I still going to have pride of place in this country as well? That is a great challenge of this moment. But I am quite optimistic about us being able to create that. I actually think that what we have the foundations for civic patriotism, and I also think that we have foundations for a cultural patriotism. I think most Americans love their country, agreed -- not ending about politics today but about some of the fundamental principles and values and documents which would guide our common life. And I think most of us love the country in its concrete way. Love its cities and landscapes and sites and sound and smells and it's every day culture, which has become that diverse over the last decade. And with a few exceptions, you know, very small minority of migrants accepted, people love that about their country and appreciate that about the country.",

What's interesting about the great replacement theory is that it posits this sort of weight intentionality to these democratic changes,right at saying there's this deliberate ploy by a bunch of people who have decided that want to exchange our population. And when you look at the history of how our society has become diverse, it's simply not true. In Germany, where I'm from, the guest work is -- you know, the idea that all the government officials had was, you know, they're going to go home after three or four years. But what now? The fact is we pay them well, they'll go back home. And that, of course, didn't happen. And so, (INAUDIBLE) denial for many decades. In the United States, when you look at the key reform of Immigration Act from the 1960s, which had a big impact on the Roe and diversity in the United States, people at the time were convinced that it wouldn't have a big impact on the demographic composition of a country. So, you know, factually, of course, his conspiracy inferior -- of a great replacement is simply wrong. When you look at the impact it has, I actually think it is a problem of very motivate extremists, but it is not a problem of the majority of the population. There are some people who really are deeply afraid of these demographic changes, who cannot imagine a place for themselves in the future in the United States, if it's not a majority white nation. But that is very thinly a minority of the population when you look at polls. Most Americans do welcome people from different backgrounds and the country do understand that we are made stronger by having that kind of ethnic and enrich diversity.",

It assumes, first of all, that you can easily cleave America into right (ph) homogeneous block of white people and a right (ph) homogeneous block of so- called people of color. But there's actually a huge amount of variation within those groups. First of all, the so-called people of color, including many mixed-race people who may have, you know, three white grandparents and one Latino grandparent, and they don't think of themselves as somehow split down the middle. They think that they belong to both cultures. It assumes that in a natural way, you know, Asian Americans or Latinos who have European extraction are always naturally going to go, for example, with African American. Or best, natural way -- in which these are two mutually hostile blocks. And I think that's a vision of our society that we should reject. It's cynical. And if it came true, if it came to be true in 2050 that we have these two blocks in population that vote inconsistent ways, that mistrust each other and so on, that would be a deep failure of in our society in a very dangerous development. Now, thankfully, for all the negative trends in our politics, all the polarization, all the dysfunctions in Washington, all the worries that I have about right in populist like Donald Trump, we have actually seen a deep polarization by race in our politics over the past 10 or 20 years. In 2012, in 2016, if you told me the democratic attributes of the (INAUDIBLE), if you told me about their race, I would have been able to create very well who they voted for. Today, I can predict that much less well than the past in part because Joe Biden became the legitimately elected president of his country in 2020 by increasing the share of a white vote relative to Hillary Clinton in 2016. And Donald Trump who was competitive, came quite close because he significantly increased the share of the vote among every non-white voter groups, particularly but not only among Latinos relative to 2016.",

They voted for thephotonegative of whoever the last president was. And if think -- if you try to think of the man who has -- is unlike Barack Obama as possible, you sort of get to Donald Trump. But fundamentally, you know, there are is a hardcore of Trump's base which helped win him the 2016 primaries in particular. But I think really is a very uncomfortable what I call \"The Great Experiment,\" that really doesn't want to live in a diverse nation that actually gives people from different ethnic groups equal rights. But when you look at what the great majority of U.S. population, well, that's polarized than we think. And we have opinions that are a lot more subtle that may appear. Most Americans believe that there is significant discrimination against African Americans, most Americans believe we have a serious problem with police violence that tied us, not only, but particularly African Americans. Most African Americans also think that we shouldn't defund the police, and that we need a functioning police force that will actually behave respectively and protect its citizens. The same is true when it looks to -- when it comes history. In a recent study from Moran Common (ph) has shown that, you know, Democrats believe, you know, Republicans don't want to talk about slavery, they don't want to acknowledge the evils and parts of our history. They don't want to talk about the negative stuff at all. And Republicans think, you know, Democrats wouldn't be willing to celebrate George Washington and think we should be ashamed of being Americans. And both of those statements are in true. Most Americans believe that slavery was a great sin that we need to teach our children about in school and at the same time, we can be proud of the very positive aspects of American history and some of the great things we've achieved as a country, those are not mutually exclusive. We don't have to choose between 1619 and 1776. And the great majority of Americans recognizes that.",

So, this is one of the things that gives me hope that, you know, there is a research program, a social psychology that's been goingthis time for a policy that's going on for 60 years, with thousands of studies, with very, very robust findings which show that when people have contact (ph) with each other, when they live next to each other as neighbors, when they're in school together, when they work together, when one support teams together, it has a very significant impact on reducing prejudices about each other. There is a positive piece of news here, which is that the country is becoming more integrated. That the number of deeply segregated neighborhoods has been reducing overtime. But it's the country is just becoming more diverse as, you know, the sort of ethnic majority has this elastic share of a country, it becomes much harder for people to live in these completely monochrome communities, and that is having really good impact on how people think about each other. When you think about the change in attitudes towards immigrants in California from the 1990s to today. I think that's a really good sign of what may be ahead in other parts of a country as well.",

Saying,hey, the train came on time today is a boring statement. Saying, can you believe I had to wait an hour and a half, you know, to get in the subway? That's interesting. So -- and that's heavily because we want to fix that problem when it's there. We have many problems in our society today. But we also need to be able to assess how well we're doing in a realistic way. And again, when you compare the Unites States today to what it looked like 100 years ago, to what it looked like 50 years ago, even to what it looked like 25 years ago, I think it's clearly true that we've made tremendous progress in including sexual minorities, including ethnic minorities, religious minorities in the country in a much better way than we did in the past. And actually, living up to the fundamental promise of our constitution, of our founding documents that every American citizen should have the right to living in freedom and being able to pursue the happiness. And so, the first start to an optimistic vision is to continue being angry about the things that are wrong, but not to be cynical. To realize that some of our fundamental institutions and principles have helped us strive for a more perfect union in the past and we need to continue working towards that on the basis of those same values and documents in the future.",
