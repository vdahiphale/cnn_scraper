If you're just joining us, dozens of Iranian drones are now bound for Israel, as well as cruise missiles, according to the Israeli news media. This, of course, leaving the entire Middle East and beyond very much on edge. Israeli forces are planning to intercept as many of those aircraft and missiles as possible. The United States has said they will help with those interceptions as best they can. At this hour, however, we do not yet know what the results of these attacks may be. Just moments ago, the White House said that this attack is expected to unfold over the next few hours. It is just past midnight in Israel. We have got reporters and analysts all over the map as we track this news, including MJ Lee at the White House, Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem, Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv, and Ben Wedeman in Beirut. I want to get straight to our Ben Wedeman, who is in Lebanon. Ben, if you could please bring us up to speed with the latest. What is Iran using now to attack Israel?",

Now, we heard also that the United States is going to try to intercept anything that flies in the direction of Israel. Israeli military spokesmen are saying it could take hours for those drones to reach Israeli territory.And as you said, cruise missiles as well, according to Israeli media, have been launched in the direction of Israel. Now, as a result, Israeli airspace has been closed. Jordanian airspace has been closed. Iraqi airspace has been closed. In Israel, of course, we knew even before this news came out about the Iranian launch of drones and cruise missiles that tomorrow all schools and universities in Israel have been canceled. We understand that in Haifa, bomb shelters have now been opened. So, essentially, the region is waiting to see when those projectiles reach Israel. Will they actually hit anything? As we know, Israel has the ability, along with the United States, to track them as they fly in the direction of Israel. And we've seen that whether it's the Arrow anti-missile system, the Iron Drone and other means, whether Israel will be able to actually shoot all of them down before they actually hit the ground.

Now, there is a sense that if Iran does not want to escalate this, that they won't go, for example, for civilian centers. They won't try to target downtown Tel Aviv where you are. Obviously, we don't know what those targets are going to be.

And it is one that the United States and its allies, both in the region and in Europe and elsewhere, are trying to make sure that Iran and Israel essentially do thread it carefully in a way to avoid this escalation.I want to get to Jeremy Diamond, who is in Jerusalem. Jeremy, what have the Israelis been saying about how they may respond to this Iranian attack? Because, as we're seeing now, this is not proxies yet, perhaps coming from other countries. This is an attack from Iranian soil, raising the possibility of an Israeli response against Iranian soil.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Alex, there's no question that in recent days, Israeli officials have been trying to deter this very scenario, a direct attack by Iranian forces launched from Iranian soil directed at Israeli soil. And indeed, in trying to deter it, they have been warning that an Iranian attack on Israeli soil in that context would result in an equal response from Israel, meaning an Israeli attack directed at Iranian soil.Now, the question that I have now is, if Israel is able to intercept all of these drones or the majority of these drones, does that change the calculus from Israel? But, of course, we don't know that this attack from Iran as of yet is limited solely to these drones. We could also see cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, which take a considerably shorter amount of time to actually reach Israeli soil that could still be launched by Iran. I do have some new information for you, though, Alex. Earlier, we reported that it was dozens of drones. I'm now told that the latest Israeli estimate is that there are over 100 drones that have been launched by Iran towards Israeli soil. This is being described to me by sources as a very large-scale attack by Iran. And what we are trying to confirm at this hour is whether or not this involves additional sources of attack by Iran. That could change the game in terms of how much of a response Israel feels compelled to deliver here. But that is something that we will be monitoring very, very closely over the coming hours.",

I don't think there's a on the cruise missiles just yet. It's going to take hours for those drones to get to Israel. How soon could those cruise missiles get to Israeli airspace, and how much more complicated does this make it for the Israeli air defenses when you've got this combination of weaponry being used in this attack? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, Alex, that's going to be one of the biggest difficulties and challenges that the Israelis are going to face, because those cruise missiles could basically get to Israeli airspace in about a little less than two hours from launch. So they travel at about five to six times the speed of these drones that we believe the Iranians are using, probably from the Shahed family, the same kind of family that is being used in Ukraine right now. Those drones travel at about 110 miles per hour. Cruise missiles of the type that the Iranians have generally go anywhere from 500 to 620 miles per hour. So that's the kind of difference in speed that we're looking at, and that is definitely going to be a challenge for the Israeli air defense system and, of course, the associated radar systems, as well as the intelligence systems that are tied into that.",

GENERAL MARK HERTLING, (ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Oh, absolutely. And what Cedric has just said, Alex, I think is a critically important point. You know, when you're tracking 100 drones coming in on a swarm like we're seeing, it's relatively easy to determine where they are and when they're going to get there. Suddenly now, as Cedric said, you're going to get cruise missiles potentially arriving earlier and overcome some of the air defense systems. So it's going to distract. And from the very beginning, you know, when you launch drones from 400 or 500 miles away, that first launch was a distraction for what might be coming next. And I think we're seeing that right now. When you add to that the potential for not only Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen, but also some PMF forces, some Popular Mobilization Front forces in Syria, on the border with Jordan, inside of Iraq, that could potentially launch as well. [17:15:15] You are going to overwhelm or at least challenge that integrated air defense system, which -- which Israel has. But that's why the United States has been coordinating so well with them over the last couple of days, and General Kurilla has been in the area to really contribute to this. You know, there's also some potential for launch sites that will come over the sea in the Mediterranean. I'm suggesting that you're going to see some U.S. naval assets there, as well as some Israeli naval capabilities that will intercept. The danger here is, as any military guy will tell you, it's the multiple fronts, the multiple directions, the multiple types of rockets and missiles that are coming in, which will confound any kind of electronic system. And it really goes down to the sensor and the shooter on the ground, the individual human being that's running those systems. These things don't automatically respond. It takes well- trained soldiers and sailors and airmen to make sure it happens well. But yeah, it's going to be overwhelming. That hundred swarm drone attack, along now with however many cruise missiles and potentially rockets and missiles coming out of southern Lebanon, are going to be a challenge for Israel.",

Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. The question of this retaliation by Iran, it was not a question of if, but when. And now we are looking at the possibility of not just what -- or the question of what happens in Israel, but then what happens in terms of an Israeli response. So how worried are you right now that there will be a significant escalation? REP. ADAM SMITH, (D-WA): I think I'm very worried. And I think anyone paying attention to this should be very worried. You know, I mean, it's gone back and forth on a number of different levels. Obviously, Israel has been long concerned about Iran sending supplies through Syria, to Lebanon to arm Hezbollah. Missiles have been flying back and forth between Hezbollah and Lebanon and Israel for months now. Obviously, there's the fight in Gaza with Hamas as well. And this is escalating. And I think both sides are assuming if they appear as strong as possible, it will force the other side to back down. But there's really no end to that if both sides have that approach. So after this attack by Iran, it's going to be a very dangerous moment to see what comes next.",

As, you know, you do this us, we have to have a proportional response to discourage you from doing this in the future. But that's not 100% certain that that's Iran's approach.Now, I heard an analyst earlier say, and quite correctly, that if Iran really wanted to go all in on Israel, they would unleash Hezbollah in Lebanon. That's the greatest threat because that's right across the border. Israel would not have the hours that they have now to see these drones and then potentially missiles if they come coming at them. Iran to date hasn't done that. So I think Iran is planning on this being a one-off. But if missiles get through and hit Israel, what does Israel do? Do they strike back directly at Iran? The risk of escalation is high for all of those reasons, even if at the moment, I agree, I don't think Iran wants that full-scale war, but they may well stumble into it.",

I mean, Israel is sitting in the middle of a very dangerous neighborhood with Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas, among others, threatening them. Do they want to go all in on a conflict? I would say no, and I think the Biden administration will be advising them no, that they are in a vulnerable position and they should look to de-escalate across the board where possible. They still are very strong and able to defend themselves. They don't need to risk an all- out war to prove that point.And I also think it underscores the need to get to a ceasefire in Gaza, to get humanitarian assistance in to Gaza and to have an endpoint to that conflict. You know, completely admitting Israel's right to defend itself there without question. But things need to calm down or Israel is vulnerable in the region.",

We now know it's more than 100 attack drones. What are you hearing in terms of what U.S. and Israeli officials are expecting more from Iran and from elsewhere in neighboring countries? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Hi, Alex. So what I hear from Israeli officials and from U.S. officials that the drones were launched both from Iran and from Iraq and Syria. And at the moment, some of them were already intercepted, especially by U.S. forces. What Israeli officials tell me is that it will be something like 2 a.m. local time when the drones will reach Israeli airspace. That's, I think, something like, you know, an hour and a half from now, more or less. And the Israeli aspiration, I think, and both the U.S. aspirations to intercept as many drones and cruise missiles as possible outside of Israeli airspace. There was an interesting report in Reuters that said that the Jordanian military is also preparing to shoot down any drone, any Iranian drone that enters Jordanian airspace.

And back at the time, exactly a year ago, he said Israel's enemies will never attack us because they know it will be a mistake. And I think that when you put those two together, I think many, many Israelis look at what's going on. The war in Gaza is stuck. There's no hostage deal in sight.

That entire team will be convening here to brief the President on this situation that is unfolding with Iran directly attacking Israel.You know, so far, Alex, we have not heard directly from the President himself since confirmation of these strikes being launched, whether it is a paper statement or on camera. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of that one of those things in the coming hours or in the coming days, just simply given the gravity of the situation.

First, Iran has got to punish Israel and show that it defended Iran's national pride as a result, for the Damascus attack/ But, secondly, it's going to want to show that despite Israeli technology and U.S. support, that it's able to break through that and punish Israel directly. And after that, I think Irans wants to show that it is cemented its growing regional posture and maintain contact with international players for its international stature. The most important thing here that's happening is that there has been a red line for many years. Neither side would directly attack the other. That red line is being erased.

We saw that in Saudi Arabia through its proxies.Indeed, Hamas' thousands of rockets fired against Israel have almost exclusively gone against civilian targets. But in this case, the situation is a little different. Iran wants to show that it is sort of an equal of the Israeli government, as a national government-to-national government striking significant national security entities. I think most of their targets, if not all of them, will be military and government entities. At the same time, they could miss and hit civilian targets.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Alex. I just spoke with an Israeli military official who tells me that the Israeli military intends to try and intercept these drones, more than 100 of which have been launched now by Iran, before they reach Israeli skies.We know, of course, that Israel has been coordinating significantly with the U.S. military and that U.S. air defense assets could also be deployed to intercept some of these drones. And so the combination of that could mean that the majority of these drones could potentially be taken down before they even reach Israeli skies. We know, of course, that there is a significant lag time, hours between a when these drones we're launched from Iran and when they are anticipated to make -- to arrive in Israeli skies. And so that gives the Israeli military and its partners a significant amount of time to try and intercept them. And the goal is, indeed, to do so before they enter Israeli airspace. I'm also told that Israel anticipates that Iran may launch additional waves of drones. That may be why the estimates that we got earlier have started to tick up. I was initially told dozens of drones fired, launched by Iran. That has since ticked up to over a hundred. Additionally, Alex, Israel -- this Israeli military official would not yet confirm with 100 percent confidence that cruise missiles have been launched. But he did say that Israel is, indeed, monitoring other Iranian assets for additional potential types of attacks. Indicating that that is it's certainly the expectation here in Israel that these waves of drones will not be the only asset that Iran uses as it carries out what is being described to me as a very large-scale attack by Iranian forces directed at Israel. So those are the updates we have at the moment. And we're also, of course, Alex waiting to see whether this is just going to becoming from Iranian forces directly, or whether Iran will also activate its proxies in the region. I think what's so interesting about this moment that we're in is that, for six months, we have been expecting that, if a significant escalation happened to broaden this conflict between Israel and Hamas, that it would come from Hezbollah, where Iran -- where Israel and Iran -- and Hezbollah have been exchanging near daily cross-fire -- cross- border exchanges of fire. But right now, it seems that the major escalation is instead going to come directly between Israel and Iran rather than via Iran's proxy forces. But again, waiting to see whether or not those proxy forces could also be pulled in.",

But I've got to give kudos to Mr. Roule, because his assessment of the intelligence capability of the sensors -- again, I'll go back to that statement I made you earlier.The criticality of the radars, the overhead sensors, and even the satellite sensors to determine where these drones, missiles, rockets, cruise missiles are all coming from is critically important. So a combination of the radars on those ships. And if you've ever been on a destroyer or a cruiser, the kind that are like in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and even in the Mediterranean, you would know that each one of those ships have multiple radars that can pick up these devices. So it's the sensors, it's incurred that's critical. What Jeremy mentioned about the potential for the U.S. defending the skies over Israel before these systems, whatever they happen to be, whichever type happened to come in first, yes, the U.S. we'll defend against them. And they have capabilities on the ground, like Patriot Missiles and other types of air defense systems. So what I'd say, Alex, is the air defenders and the airman in the -- in the sky and the satellite watchers are very busy right now. And they're looking, again, I'll just say it one more time, in multiple directions. The other point that you've made with Barak Ravid, I think, is an important one. Because Israel is now going to be faced not only with missiles and rockets coming in from multiple directions, but they're facing a different kind of war. What they have in Gaza is a counterterrorism, counterinsurgency fight. They're seeing the same thing as counterterrorism and rockets coming out of Hezbollah in northern, or in southern Lebanon. What they're now seeing is a new conventional rocket missile strike against a conventional force of Iranians with a lot of proxies. When you start dividing up a country's capability -- and Israel has experienced this before, where they were trying not only to do a counterterrorism fight, but also a counterinsurgency and a conventional fight -- it gets extremely complex and difficult. And you have the military of that country looking in multiple directions to defend itself. I think that's what these swarms are trying to do to black out the Israeli systems, to strike them from different directions, to cause complex attacks. And it's going to be very challenging if these continue, as we've seen in the first couple hours of this fight.",

And that is that Iran is now saying that they have launched the first wave of ballistic missiles, firing those at Israel, according to Iranian state media.These missiles travel at a far, far faster rate, with some estimates putting it at about a dozen minutes between when they are launched from Iran and when they could reach Israeli soil. And this was reported in just the last five minutes or so. So we could be in a situation where we hear -- we're hearing sirens in parts of Israel in the coming minutes, if, indeed, those reports from Iranian state media are accurate. But of course, ballistic missiles would carry a more significant payload and also potentially have a more significant impact within Israel if, indeed, they make it through Israels defense systems. Now we know that, of course, beyond the Iron Dome missile defense system, Israel has a number of other air defense systems, many of which it has tested for the first time during the course of the last six months of this war. In part, because Iran's proxies in the region have been firing missiles from various directions. Just this past week, we saw Israel test, for the first time, a sea-based Iron Dome -- Iron Dome system, intercepting missiles that we're fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen. We know that Israel has tested it's Arrow defense, missile defenses system as well. So there's no question that Israel is prepared for a variety of aerial threats directed at its soil. But this will certainly be the biggest test of all of those air defense assets. We've been reporting, of course, in the last hour, that Israel is going to try and intercept these drones outside of its airspace. Whether or not it can do so with these ballistic missiles is another question. But certainly very, very significant news that Iranian state media reporting that it has now fired the first wave of ballistic missiles at Israeli directly.",

And Israel is able to with -- with U.S. assistance, bring down these weapons, then Iran will be embarrassed that their weapons we're not able to achieve anything and may likely continue attacks for that reason.At the same time, if these reports are true, then Israel has got to consider whether it undertakes a counter strike of some sort against Iran to prevent further attacks. Not because it wishes to escalate the conflict, but whether some sort of action, be it cyber, be at drones, some other operation, could degrade Iran's capability to fire additional ballistic missiles against Israel.",

And I think what we're seeing is the potential for those dramas to continue the movement toward the Israeli border as Israel prepares for it.And at the same time, the cruise missiles, if they have, in fact, been launched, could reach there much faster. So the cruise missiles are going to overwhelm the big systems, as Alex, or as Oren Liebermann and Jeremy Diamond both mentioned. Those will be the priority targets at first to knock down those cruise missiles and destroy them. Then will come the drones and that will overwhelm the rest of the system. If it's been synchronized well -- and what I suggested earlier might happen -- is you'd have a combination of those Iranian drones, Iranian cruise missiles, a sudden launch of rockets from Hezbollah, as Mr. Rule posited, and also some cruise missiles coming out of Yemen that have been launched by the Houthis. They should, if this was a well-coordinated action, they would all hit at the same time. Or if they're sequential, it could also cause significant challenges for the Israeli air defense. And that's why I think you're going to see the United States with their systems in the area helping to defend and actually attack those incoming missiles from a bunch of different directions. But again, depending on the numbers, the directions, and the types, you're going to see a very complex attack. And it's going to be very challenging to the ear defenders and the soldiers, sailors, and airmen in the area.",

It's called DOTS, and that stands for \"depends on the situation.\" Again, it depends on where they're coming from.You don't have a solid wall of air defense. We've learned that in Ukraine as we've talked about what they can do. So there is an integrated air defense, a bubble. Israel is a much smaller territory. It's about 250 miles long by 70 miles wide. So you can defend inside the territory better. There are some capabilities to hit outside the territory, both from the long-range missiles. As Oren Liebermann stated, the Arrow and the David's Sling, can hit outside the boundaries and stop those missiles and rockets from coming in. But you can't stop all of them. It isn't a perfect wall. But you will be able to stop some that are headed toward key targets. The problem is, in some of these, if it's a ballistic missile or ground-to-ground, you know where it's launched from, you know, where it's heading, you know, it's apogee and perigee and fight, you can intercept it. But a cruise missile can go back and forth just like the drones and can maneuver around. So it's much more difficult to use some of the systems that Israel has to hit those moving targets. The ones that go from ground-to-ground are easy to hit once you pick them up on the radar. The other ones are much more difficult because they fly next to the earth or they go a circuitous route. So it's much more challenging from an operator's perspective to knock those down.",
