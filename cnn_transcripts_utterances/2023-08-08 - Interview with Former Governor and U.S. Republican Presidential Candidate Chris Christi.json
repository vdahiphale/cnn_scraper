Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Washington grand jury that indicted Donald Trump for alleged election interference has been working overtime today. Jurors are weighing evidence about the chaotic aftermath of the last U.S. presidential election right up to the shocking January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. But despite the intense legal heats of three indictments and the mounting cost of expensive lawyers, Trump is head and shoulders above the rest of the pack, racing to become the 2024 Republican presidential nominee. Most of his rivals are too timid to take him on, but not our first guest. Chris Christie is the former governor of New Jersey and a former federal prosecutor. Now, as a Republican presidential candidate, he says flat out that Trump cannot be the nominee, and won't win the election against Biden. Christie just got back from Ukraine where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and that is where our conversation began. Governor Christie, welcome to our program. FORMER GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, Christiane.",

When you go to Bucha and you see the cruelty and thebarbarism that war has executed by the Russian army, it's really breathtaking. Stories of civilians, men being pulled out of their homes by the Russian army, their eyes gouged out, their ears cut off, and then murdered execution style in the back of the head and then going into the homes and raping the women. Over 160 people buried in a shallow grave by the cathedral, where the memorial now sets, after the church itself was also ransacked. You then talk about the toll on the children of Ukraine. Verified now, Christiane, nearly 20,000 children kidnapped by the Russian army, repatriated to the Russian federation. The mothers and fathers in Ukraine don't know whether their children are dead or alive, whether they're being cared for or abused, and they think that worse. And I met with some of those parents, and I can tell you as a dad of four myself, I don't know how they put one foot in front of the other with that constant worry. And, you know, the end of that is that, as I sat there, I thought to myself, this is the barbarism that's being committed by Vladimir Putin.

So, I give it that much credibility. But what I worry about, Christiane, is that the way he'd settle it is just to turn Ukraine over to Russia, by withdrawing all of our military support and allowing the Russian army to continue to run Rashad (ph) over Ukrainian civilians, kill them, maim them, rape them, and then take this free country and occupy it.",

He's done better than President Trumphas done in terms of providing support, but he has not been out there rhetorically making the case to the American people about why this is so important. And it is important, Christiane, as you know, because China's funding this war against Russia -- for Russia against Ukraine. This is a proxy war between the West and China. And China is going to be watching what we do here. And if we cut and run, believe me, it's a pay me now or pay me later situation. If we don't supply the Ukrainians with everything they need to win, then we're going to be fighting in Taiwan to try to protect Taiwan. And if you don't care about the Taiwanese either, let me give you a reason to care. Two-thirds of the semiconductor chips in the world are made in Taiwan. Everything from running your telephone, to your computer, to your automobile, to most things in American life, do we want the communist party of China owning two-thirds of the semiconductor chips in the world? And when you talk about support for Ukraine, most people don't know, in artillery alone, in the average day, Russia is shooting 56,000 artillery shells into Ukraine. Ukraine is able to respond with only 6,000. So, the pessimism that's being shown by some western officials, I believe, is based upon two bad premises. One, they are ill-informed about how outgunned we are allowing the Ukrainians to be. And two, they haven't looked in the eyes of the Ukrainian people and President Zelenskyy like I have and know about the results they have. What we need to do is to arm them to win. We need to give them greater artillery, greater anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and we need to give them F-16s. And if we do that, I believe the Ukrainians can win the war, and that will be a major win for the West and a huge miscalculation by Vladimir Putin.",

These nationalpolls, Christiane, mean nothing in the United States because we don't have a national primary. We have a state-by-state primary that determines who the nominee will be. The first one will be in Iowa, in mid-January and then, probably late January, early February in New Hampshire. Those are the first two and very, very important to determine the tone of the race. So, I don't believe that. And I do -- I believe that Americans do want this country to become focused on the big things again. We have an education system where a third of our children cannot read at grade level. This is outrageous, and we're not going to be able to come up with the next set of cutting-edge inventions. The next set of economic achievements if we have children who can't read at grade level, and a third of them in this country can't right now. We're not spending any time on that. We're not spending time on, you know, how we're going to fix entitlement programs that in 11 years we'll have a 25 percent cut in Social Security and that bankrupt Medicare system. I'm the only one in this race talking about those things. I think it will break through, Christiane, because I think the American people know we are at a real crossroads in this country, and it's time to stop worrying about who the TV stars are and start worrying about who can actually lead this country and lead the world. Lastly on President Biden, as I admitted to you, he has done better than Donald Trump did, but he is doing just enough in Ukraine for the Ukrainians not to lose. A Christie administration will do what it takes for the Ukrainians to win and to set a defeat in motion for both the Russians and the Chinese.",

By the time we get to the debate stage in three weeks, he will probably be out on bail in four different jurisdictions. I hardly think that's going to play well.

And so, I know that independent voters in this country are not going to support Donald Trump in the fall of 2024. And as far as the primary is concerned, it's now up to me and candidates who are willing to fight Donald Trump directly to lead and to defeat, and to lead our party to a change, a generational change, and also, a philosophical change. And that philosophical change is very simple, Christiane. It's about putting the American people first, not the ego and the interests of any one individual. And Donald Trump does not put America first, he puts himself first. And we see that all the time, and even in the speeches that he's giving now. He spends hours going on and on about his problem. His problems are all self- created. He should have fixed them himself. And now, he's doing things like spending $40 million of donor money to pay his legal fees just in that last half year.

So, we want to be clear on the record there. But, yes, I did support Donald Trump. I thought he was going to be a better president than Hillary Clinton. And I didn't leave Donald Trump, Christiane, he left me. When he stood there on election night, 2020, behind the (INAUDIBLE) president in the east room of the White House and said the election had been stolen, when he had absolutely no evidence to support that, and we know now that was a complete lie. And when he did it that night, I was on \"ABC\" doing commentary, and I said that night, I cannot support someone who would make the American people believe that the election that they just participated in was stolen when he had no evidence to support it. And he still does it today and still perpetuates the lie today, it perpetuated that lie on January 6th, inciting people to go up to Capitol Hill, in fact, urging them to go up to Capitol Hill and blaming the failure to reverse the election on Mike Pence who was doing his constitutional duty as vice president. People need to understand, I have always been critical of Donald Trump, when I thought he made mistakes. And in 2020, after the election and on election night, I broke with him permanently. And I'm running in this race because I do not believe that America needs the type of leader who puts themselves before the country, we need a leader who is willing to try to unite the country behind smart certain principles and wants to lead the world as well, Christiane, against the efforts of the communist Chinese, against the efforts of the authoritarian Russians and a theocracy in Iran, and the complete craziness of Kim Jong-un in North Korea. If Kim Jong-un sends me a nice letter complimenting me, it won't mean I think he's a good guy like Donald Trump did. I'll know exactly what he's in for as he continues to build more intercontinental ballistic missiles to try to deliver weapons around the world.

Really, for young writers and anyone who is really serious about writing, a lot of your work has to happen in libraries and historical societies and through interviews to get to that real meat of a story, because you only use 10 percent of what you come up with, most of the time.",

Dodo is a deaf child who completely loses hearing as a result of anaccident, and he doesn't want to go to school anymore because he can't communicate that well. He just doesn't like it. He's, you know, a black child in the 1935, Pennsylvania. And his parents -- his uncle and aunt who are taking care of him take him to this -- to Chona and ask her to hide him from the state, because the state is trying to take him and put him in the Pennhurst, which is a mental institution. So, that's the -- that's where the conflict that pushes the book -- the narrative along. In real-life, when I was working at the Variety Club Camp for handicapped or disabled children, or so-called disabled children, I met many kids like Dodo. At Variety Club Camp, at the time, when I was there as a college student, I had kids from all walks of life, all walks of disabled life, wheelchairs, crutches, cerebral -- what they called cerebral palsy, everything. And it was run by a man who was inspirational. His name was Sy Friend, and he was inspirational director of the camp. And so, I wanted to write a book about the camp, but I couldn't. I ended up writing about this town. But --",

It's only -- the truth is, you know, as they say, it will set you free. But the truth is, it takes a lot of engine to run the kind of hate machine everybody that is pushing against books.

Those are the real heroes. No, I'm not worried about it. I mean, I don't like it. But if this is what the war is, then let it wage, because in the long run, these books will find their place.
