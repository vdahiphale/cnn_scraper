And as many people as you talk to, you'll get as many different possible outcomes and answers here. So, it's really going to be in the wording and what they say.At one extreme, they could say legally they don't think there's a way forward because Trump's team has said, you know, the president is immune, there's a transition in place, a state judge shouldn't have any say over an incoming president. Some of these are unanswered legal questions. But the DA's office could say, we don't think there's a legal way forward, and then put it in the judges hands, who would decide whether or not to dismiss the case. They could say, we do think there is a legal way forward here. There is so much uncertainty in the law. Let's move ahead. And then again, though, it's in the judge's hands to decide what to do. If the DA's office wants to proceed, I think we'll see Trump's team try to step in there. But there's still so much that's unclear. It's about proceeding. But does that mean the judge will issue his decision on immunity? What does he say, if anything, today about sentencing, which is currently scheduled for next week. So, a lot in the air and certainly unprecedented times. We say it, but it truly is something here that people just - they can't even figure out when you're talking to people who are very informed on this, there's no clearly identifiable path forward.

Patrick Haggard, because the prosecution chose to play that recording in court because it felt it was significant that the wife, the estranged wife of the defendant, Jose Ibarra, had a lot to say about what happened and how surprised she was about some of the facts in the case. So, you may remember - and we reported this previously, she was urging the suspect to, number one, tell the truth, and also she said in that phone call that she felt that it was crazy, in her words, that they had only found her husband's DNA at the crime scene. And then at one point she had said that she finds it unbelievable that someone can see a person die and not call 911.Well, the judge said that admitting - admitting this in court would have been - it would have violated the defendant's rights to confront a witness. Specifically, the judge said the following after hearing the translations, \"I do find that it was more than contextual and therefore violates the confrontation clause in the Sixth Amendment.\" So, those rulings, those - those recordings are not going to be considered for the verdict. Also, the judge ruled out several videos. There were selfies, essentially, of Jose Ibarra, the defendant, Spanish lyrics. The judge reviewed them overnight and he decided that they were not relevant to the case. Now, today, the prosecution may rest their case. The defense had said that it's going to take about half a day for them to finish. So, this trial is moving much, much faster than anybody anticipated, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I think the thing to keep in mind here, Sara, as we look at all of this, is just how important Donald Trump views the attorney general role. He had hand-selected Matt Gaetz to serve at the top of the Justice Department. And we're told that he is not backing away from that. He thinks the attorney general is going to be the most important cabinet position in his future administration. And because of that, he is now putting pressure on Republicans in Congress, privately calling them up over the past couple of days and telling them that he needs their support, because this is a decision that he does not want to back away from.Now, I think what's also interesting is we know that behind the scenes as well that Donald Trump and his transition team recognize how hard of a chance Gaetz is going to have, particularly in light of whatever we learn, whether or not this House Ethics report is released. But also in general, there is no question that there is a lot of uneasiness in Congress right now, particularly among Republicans in the Senate, about how to move forward with this. And that's why you're seeing the former president, now president-elect, call them up personally and tell them that he is committed to getting Gaetz through. Now, one thing that I also found noteworthy is that Elon Musk, we know, of course, how important and influential he has been to Donald Trump, not just as an ally, but someone who is also really making his opinions known to the former president, as well as publicly, how he feels about certain transition picks. They are very much aligned on a lot of what Donald Trump wants to do in his second term. This is what he posted really early this morning. I'm going to read for you what Musk wrote. He said, quote, talking about the allegations against - against Gaetz. He said, quote, \"as for these accusations against him, I consider them worth less than nothing. Under our laws, a man is considered innocent until proven guilty.\" He went on to say, \"case closed.\" So, clearly, Donald Trump is not moving away from this, nor is Musk, who the two are also going later today to Texas for the SpaceX launch.

And I was just on X, Twitter, whatever the hell it's called now, and Erick Erickson, conservative broadcaster, just wrote, \"it is increasingly unlikely that Matt Gaetz can make it through a confirmation process.\" Terry, let me just put this first to you. What does it feel like to be Senator Thom Tillis, for instance, today from North Carolina, having potentially to vote on Matt Gaetz? TERRY SULLIVAN, FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, MARCO RUBIO 2010 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Yes, well, look, he's had four luxurious years of not being asked about Donald Trump's tweets or other comments or decisions. So, you know, it's time to - this is the new normal now. And the reality is, is that Donald Trump was elected to blow things up, to blow Washington up. And that's exactly what he's doing. And anybody who's surprised by it now wasn't paying attention and didn't believe that he was going to do what he said he was going to do. Last - he said that last time he thought that he picked too many conventional picks that weren't loyal enough to him. He said he was going to have loyalists. And that's what he's doing. And so for a Thom Tillis, you're going to have to decide, are you going to really be willing to stand up to the president who, you know, not only won Electoral College decisively, but the first Republican in decades to win the popular vote. And I don't think a lot of these senators are going to have that much backbone.
