What Hope Hicks said today, there was drama around it, but what she said did a lot of things for the prosecution as a witness, forming a piece of the bigger picture of the puzzle.So, one of the things she did was she read some texts about what she and Michael Cohen were discussing in reacting to these stories coming out about women on the campaign, Donald Trump. She's establishing the link between her role as a campaign official, someone in that world of Donald Trump talking to Michael Cohen repeatedly and being aware of these things bubbling up as there was a public testimony about it. And then near the end of her testimony, she gives the prosecutor something to work with about Michael Cohen, who's going to be the focus of much of the coming days of this trial. She says, I didn't know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person. He's the kind of person who seeks credit. Put that into the bigger narrative here, Michael Cohen wiring $130,000 of his own home equity line of credit to pay off Stormy Daniels, to pay off Karen McDougal and other context. That is going to be something that matters. Who is Michael Cohen? Why would he wire money toward women to keep them quiet?",

Even the ones who many of them have notepads, they're writing at times, they put down their writing materials, and they were intently focused on her, they were listening to her, and I think this was a powerful step forward for the prosecution's case.",

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly hurts. I mean, look, there's a couple of tactical things I would just point out to start with. First is, when you're at the end of a week of a multi-week trial and you're a prosecutor, I did this for years, 27 years, you'd like to end strong. You'd like to end with something where the jury goes home thinking that was pretty important stuff. So, they certainly began to cross over from just kind of tawdry to President Trump's intent, which will drive whether they can make the felony charge.The other thing I would say, on kind of a pure kind of advocacy level, sometimes really, really reluctant witnesses become the most powerful ones. And you can just read it. It's just human psychology. You see a person that is clearly uncomfortable with being there, doesn't want to hurt anybody, doesn't want to be a part of it, but they end up giving kind of devastating, very entertaining and interesting information. So, you know, I think it's early to do a parade or to say it's over. I think the real battle that's shaping up, aside from everything about Cohen and the cross is redirecting the jury back to Cohen's lack of credibility, but the jury instructions, which is really a boring thing for non-lawyers, it's watching paint dry, but does this judge tell the jury that President Trump to be convicted has to have an exclusively personal motivation or can it fix mixed? Hope gave mixed. She said at one point he's worried about politics, another point, I'm worried about the wife. It could be, if the judge wants to kind of put the finger on the scale here, the judge says any element of political preservation is enough to support the conviction. So, the instructions the jury gets at the end of the case are absolutely a nuclear moment as to --",

I actually want to read two different quotes from her back-to-back, because they're the quotes that I think we may see when the prosecution closes and then when the defense closes. We might be hearing them again because Hope Hicks was serving as such a valuable narrator and someone that the jury was so clearly invested in listening to.The first thing she says, direct quote, this is on the direct examination of the prosecutors asking her about the crisis after the Access Hollywood tape comes out and as stories are emerging, she says, everything we talked about in the context of this time period and this timeframe was about whether or not there was an impact on the campaign. So that clearly is playing exactly into what the prosecution narrative is. But then, as Mr. Trusty was saying, on the other side, there are things she said, even in direct examination that could be used by the Trump defense, this quote, he was concerned about the story, Donald Trump. He was concerned about how it would be viewed by his wife and he wanted me to make sure that the newspapers weren't delivered to his residence that morning. That's regarding the story The Wall Street Journal was going to print about Karen McDougal that Hope Hicks was asked for a comment on. BLITZER:  So, Norm Eisen, what do you think?

He's a colorful New Yorker, and people are going to be surprised when they actually meet him because he has not varied in the story that he told me in January 2019, one jot.

Trump brought it up a lot.First, it was the fact that he was worried about what Ivanka or Melania would think of him if these stories had gotten out in the National Enquirer, then it moved to what would happen with the campaign, and that still holds true today. Donald Trump cares what other people think about him. That's why he has to react when somebody says he's sleeping in court, because he has to show that he was not sleeping in court. He believes that everything impacts his image. He wants to control the media narrative. If something negative comes out, he wants to take control of that.

It absolutely corroborates Michael Cohen's story, which has been corroborated in numerous respect, and it shows that he knew that when he was signing those checks with the backup that said, and he was doing this at the at the resolute desk, for goodness sake, that when he saw the backup, the backup said legal retainers he knew that wasn't true. And that goes to his intent to falsify business records. And even if you accepted the lie, I mean, the obvious lie that Trump told to Hope that she didn't believe that you know Michael just did this on his own, it was still a campaign finance violation because what he was essentially, Michael Cohen, at least temporarily was giving $130,000 for the benefit of Donald Trump's campaign. And that would be a campaign contribution that's over the limit and would have to be disclosed. And so the fact that he then signs these documents to cover up the fact that this was done on his behalf to silence women or even whatever that -- I mean, that was clearly Michael Cohen's intent, he's covering up campaign finance violation.

She turned to the jury and told them, I'm very nervous today.And then, as she was giving testimony, answering a question, she interrupted herself surprised by the sound of her own voice in the microphone, so clearly uncomfortable with this testimony, even when she provided favorable testimony compliments to Donald Trump, she never appeared to look over in his direction, keeping her eyes locked on the prosecutor or Trump's attorney asking the questions or turning to face the jury to explain things and testify to them. So, she did seem very uncomfortable. And then there was the moment after the prosecution had finished asking her questions. And as Trump's legal team was beginning their cross-examination, that she just appeared to become overwhelmed with emotion, broke down in tears on the stand. The judge excused the jury and everyone took a break. She came back in and finished the testimony, but, clearly, a tough date for her. She looked pretty eager to leave the courtroom.",

I mean, she kind of took everyone in the courtroom back to 2016 and what those final days and weeks inside the Trump campaign were like, but also the first year inside the White House, as The Wall Street Journal was learning more about what Trump had done and other outlets were reporting on it.And so I think she was able to do something that no other witness really has done so far, firsthand knowledge of Donald Trump, but also of what it was like inside the Trump campaign and inside the Trump White House. And I think there are parts of her testimony that could be seen as helpful to both the prosecution and the defense. Clearly, the prosecution is coming out of this feeling a lot stronger today because there were those two moments, one, where she was skeptical that Michael Cohen would ever do anything out of the goodness of his own heart to pay the six-figure sum to a porn star. But, secondly, Wolf, and importantly, she said that Trump said to her that it was much better that the story came out once he was already inside the White House instead of during the campaign. And it was kind of a mic drop moment for the prosecution. You notice they ended their questioning there because they felt that she had delivered what they needed. The one thing the defense thought that she did say that was helpful, Wolf, is she said that Trump did care what Melania Trump thought about this story and that he did respond in part out of consideration of how she was going to react, including asking Hope Hicks to remove the newspapers from outside of their apartment the day after this story broke, Wolf.",

There have been other witnesses who have no relationship to Donald Trump that have come forward and said they were very nervous.I mean, this is someone who was one of his most trusted aides. So, I don't think it's a surprise that she was kind of overcome with emotion on the stand. But it is notable that there has been a real break in their relationship, and Trump was angry with her about those texts that Brian Todd just read, the ones that she sent on January 6th, and her concerns about what Trump had done to his legacy that day. He doesn't like anyone who doesn't view that day as favorably as he does. And so there certainly has been a chill on the relationship. And also, I think, when Trump left the White House, a lot of people were kind of done with him and just did not want to speak to him, especially those who had been inside the White House and were really frustrated by that period after the election.",
