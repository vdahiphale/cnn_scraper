Plus, even more angst for Trump. New York's Attorney General now asking a judge to throw out the $175 million bond Trump posted in his civil fraud case. Could the former President's assets now be at risk again? That court hearing, get this, set for Monday morning, while Trump is in criminal court, just down the street. And the Republican House Speaker in even more jeopardy tonight, as a third member of Mike Johnson's conference signs on, to the effort to oust him, meaning he could need Democrats, to step in and save his job. I'm John King, in for Kaitlan Collins. This is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump's first criminal trial is about to get real, much more intense, with opening statements now set for Monday. At the heart of it, a hush money payment to a former porn star, just before the 2016 election that put Trump in the White House. Phase one, now in the history books, 12 jurors, six alternates are in place. That full jury impaneled after a four-day process that yes, had a few bumps in the road. But overall, things did move quickly. Something the former President does not sound very happy about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants this to go as fast as possible. That's for his reasons, not for my reasons. And this is really a concerted witch-hunt, very simple. Everything you heard in there, this is a witch-hunt by numerous judges, Democrat judges.

Former federal prosecutor, David Kelley, who served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. And two veteran New York attorneys, Renato Stabile, Arthur Aidala. And let's get straight to the question. Joey, on Monday, it starts. This process was important. We'll talk a little bit more about the jury selection process and what we learned. But on Monday, it starts. So, what is happening right now? Each side spends the weekend thinking, first impression matter. You want to win the jury on day one, right?",

And so, I think we know what the narrative of the prosecution will be. We've heard it. It's been laid out in the statement of facts that the prosecutor has already indicated. I expect Monday for them to go at it, and really lay out to the jury, what is their theory, to talk to them about what the scheme was all about, to talk to them about the players involved in this scheme, to talk to them about the evidence they have to substantiate it. And I also, John, do believe that they're going to talk about the issue of corroboration. We know they'll go after, attack Michael Cohen. He's a liar. He's a perjurer. That won't happen, Monday. But I think through their testimony, in jury selection, they've conditioned the jury to having unsavory witnesses. And I think they'll talk about don't only rely upon our witnesses. Rely upon the text messages, the emails. The last point, and that as a defense, what would be curious to me is to know how much they're going to commit. Will we see a defense? Or will we say, it's not about Donald Trump. Keep an open mind. They have to establish it through reasonable doubt. This has nothing to do with politics. I want to know whether they lay out a defense, that is the defense team, or whether they keep it generic and general.",

It's from his followers and his over-exuberant supporters at times. We know what they did in the Capitol. We know that they can be activated. We know that he called for them to come and demonstrate.
