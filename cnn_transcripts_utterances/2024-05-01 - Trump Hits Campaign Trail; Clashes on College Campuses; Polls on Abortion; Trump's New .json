Doors will open later today. And then later he's going to be speaking in Michigan. And these are both very critical battlegrounds that his campaign and his advisers have told me they are characterizing as must win in order to win the White House ahead of November. Now, part of what he's going to be focusing on today in both of his speeches is the issues that he thinks Joe Biden is most vulnerable on. That includes crime, the border, immigration more generally, but also Joe Biden's handling of the war in the Middle East. Now, when I've talked to Trump's advisers about his visits here, both in Michigan and in Wisconsin, they argue that they've been paying very close attention, not just to polling, but also the protest votes that they saw cast in the Democratic primary against Joe Biden. And so I think you can expect some of that language and that rhetoric to come through in Donald Trump's speeches. Now, they've also, you know, when they talk about November and being here on the ground, I just want to point out that one of Donald Trump's most recent visit was to both of these states about a month ago. And again, we have not seen Donald Trump a lot on the trail. And so the fact that he is coming back here less than a month later, both to Michigan and to Wisconsin, really underscores that they need to be hitting the ground here in both of these states very hard as they look to campaign against Joe Biden.

Dozens of people arrested here.In Tulane, SWAT teams have gone in and there has been a rumble on that campus. And then all the way to the other side of the country, in California, in Los Angeles, there is a large police presence at UCLA at this hour. We are watching police in riot gear there on that campus after violence broke out on that campus overnight with fireworks being thrown into the pro-Palestinian encampment from those who support Israel. There has been clashes. We have seen a student beaten. We have seen people holding all kind - all manner of things like boards and pipes to try and get the protesters out of that encampment. Now, that's - that is two groups that have nothing to do with the police. Now the police are on campus and the university has declared there at UCLA, they have declared that that encampment is illegal. We just spoke with a student who said they have not yet been told by the police that they must disperse, which is something they have to do legally. But we will be watching that scene very closely. Meanwhile here on the Columbia campus, we are hearing from two professors who I just spoke with who are telling me that some of those students and some of the people who were inside of Hamilton Hall occupying it as pro-Palestinian protesters have been now released from jail. Some of them, they said, had lacerations and bruises, that they are treating themselves with volunteer medics outside here in New York. But we do understand that some of the people who were inside of that hall have now been released from jail after being arrested overnight. About 100 people arrested overnight between Columbia University here in New York and City College as well. There is still a large police presence surrounding Columbia at this hour.

Now in Florida, where all the news is developing this morning, 57 percent of registered voters say that, in fact, abortion should be legal up to 24 weeks.Now, why is that 57 percent important? Because in Florida, in order for a ballot measure to pass, you need 60 percent of the vote. So, even though the majority here believed that abortion should be legal up to 24 weeks, the fact is, that may not be enough to enshrine abortion rights in the state of Florida because, again, you need at least 60 percent of the vote to do so.",

I want to hear what it means though for strategy. This - abortion is the issue that Joe Biden runs most ahead of Donald Trump on. Twenty-three percent, though, of voters polled say that the candidates must share their views on abortion. That's saying that they could agree with Biden on the issue but still not vote for him. And the top issue amongst voters in terms of top issues, abortion is at 5 percent in terms of voters who are saying it's their top issue.

And I guarantee you that there is something that is absolutely not showing up in this polling that also did not show up in the polling for 2022, which is what allowed so many people to talk about this massive red wave that never appeared.And frankly, abortion being on the front pages is something that is going to help Democrats because it's something that Republicans have not learned their lesson on. Clearly, women believe that they should have bodily autonomy. Women believe that they do not want their daughters to grow up in a country where their daughters will have less rights than they do. Women believe that women should not be treated as second-class citizens with all of these extremist bans, including the one that's going into effect today in Florida, which should practically be a full, all out banned because, as you know, a lot of women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks.

And there will be a hearing on even more alleged violations tomorrow.With us now, CNN's senior legal analyst, former federal and state prosecutor, Elie Honig, the bureau chief of our Metuchen bureau. Elie, I want to start with where we are in the case and some of the exchanges we saw yesterday between the prosecution and Keith Davidson, who was the lawyer who represented Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels and negotiated their hush money payments. This is the prosecutor, Steinglass, \"did you ever believe Michael Cohen was going to be the ultimate source of the funds?\" We have a graphic for this. Davidson responds, \"never, never prior to funding, no.\" Steinglass, the prosecutor, says, \"even after he said, I'll just do it myself, where did you understand the money would be coming from?\" The defense objects. \"Objection.\" The judge overruled. Davidson, the witness, says, \"from Donald Trump or some corporate affiliation thereof.\" If you read along, it makes a lot more sense.

But how much of the details did he know? Because the details is where the crime sits. The structuring and the financing behind the payment. Thats the actual crime here, which is falsifications of business records.Which leads me to the second way prosecutors are going to want to prove this. They don't want to just have Michael Cohen's word. They want to back him up. And so if they have ledgers, invoices, notes, emails, memos, texts, and we've started to see a few of them in the trial thus far that backup Michael Cohen, that's gold for prosecutors. They're going to want to say, folks, you don't need to just rely on Michael Cohen's word. You can rely on Michael Cohen's word as backed up by the documents. BERMAN: To what extent are you expecting some kind of, you know, you're damn right I did order the code red moment here. And, obviously, Donald Trump won't be on the stand.

It's not like \"A Few Good Men.\" A lot of times prosecutors build cases in ways that are methodical. And I think the prosecutors here are doing that, not without any flaws, but you build methodically and you don't have a code red moment, but you can still prove your case if the evidence adds up.",
