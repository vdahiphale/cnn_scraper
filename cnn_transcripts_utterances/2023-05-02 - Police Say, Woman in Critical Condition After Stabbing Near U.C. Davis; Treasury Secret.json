She is in the hospital in critical condition.The suspect, police say, is a light-skinned man with curly hair wearing black Adidas pants and brown backpack. This rash of stabbings has really knocked the city of Davis. This place would normally expect maybe two murders in a whole year. They have had three stabbings, two dead in under a single week. The two people dead, David Breaux, 50 years old, apparently well-known around town, was an activist, pushed his message of peace, love and compassion to anyone who would listen. He was found dead Thursday in the city park. Then a 20-year-old computer science student Karim Abou Najm was stabbed to death, riding his bicycle through a park on his way home Saturday night after an awards ceremony. Here is what his father had to say about his now dead son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJDI ABOU NAJM, SON STABBED TO DEATH NEAR U.C. DAVIS:  He was just six weeks away from graduating.

There are (INAUDIBLE) things the bureau can bring in terms of logistical and just human resources.One of the primary areas of investigation I would expect in this case would be the location and acquisition and analysis of video capture. So, you have two of these occurred parks one in a different location in the city. You might have videos that captured people coming and going from those locations at various times. The bureau is particularly good at collecting those videos and analyzing them in a way that can point you towards a particular suspect. We've also got behavioral science folks who can try to put together possible sketches of who might be involved in this sort of activity based upon the circumstances that we know from the three crime scenes.

So, you establish that kind of the crowd sourcing of investigative leads. You really want all of the information pouring in as quickly as possible. And then finally, just, obviously, see something, say something, but keep your wits about you.

Kevin McCarthy has accepted that invitation. But they start from a place, complete opposite sides. Republicans are making very clear there must be spending cuts, significant spending cuts attached to raising the national debt limit. Democrats on the opposite side, said that should not even be part of the discussion, which should be a clean debt ceiling increase, without any conditions whatsoever.

They have 51 seats. Nine Republican senators would have to break ranks. The number two Senate Republican, John Thune, told me simply that would not happen in this -- any deal, and McCarthy's explicit blessing in order to get there. And also Republicans making clear they are simply not going to undercut Kevin McCarthy's position.McCarthy himself making clear for months, including yesterday, that they will simply not just raise the national debt t limit, as the White House has insisted. So, how this gets resolved is anyone's question, but not question about this. This is the biggest fear of a potential default since 2011. That's when the time that the United States' credit was downgraded. Ultimately, they did reach a deal to raise the debt limit. Can they do it here? It's anyone's guess. Sara?",

That's still a big number, but the smallest in a couple of years. So, that is maybe some relief for the Fed that all of those rate hikes are taking a little bit of the froth out of the labor market, and the job market is getting a little bit more balanced. Where do we see the fewer job openings? In transportation warehouses and utilities, professional and business services, health care services, these are places where you didn't have quite so many job openings this time around. And, again, that is a good sign. The labor market is not overheating. Bosses have been just frantic to try to get enough workers. This shows some relief on that front.
