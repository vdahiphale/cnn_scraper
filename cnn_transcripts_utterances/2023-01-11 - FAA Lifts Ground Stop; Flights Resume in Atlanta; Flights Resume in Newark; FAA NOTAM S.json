Think about this, the planes are in the wrong spots. The crews are in the wrong spots, And they are mandated by federal regulations that makes them essentially time out if they have been on the clock for a certain period of time.

You can see a lot more people stepping up to these kiosks, not just international flights, which were not being affected earlier on, but folks flying to Miami or Fort Lauderdale are now able to check in. And immediately right here they'll find out if their flight is delayed. We've spoken to folks at Spirit Airline. You can see the counters, the lines filling up. This was not - there was no one here an hour ago. Almost no one standing in line to check in. And the folks at Spirit tell us that most of their flights are -- they're showing some delays, but most of their flights are getting back on track. You heard Pete Muntean mention that the domino effect, the ripple effect of some of these earlier flights causing future delays. Some of the folks we spoke to said they're delayed a couple of hours. And the boards are showing that as well. An hour, two-hour delays. We do know from Flight Aware, as of the last maybe 15 minutes ago, the last update from Flight Aware, more than 4,000 delays, nearly 700 cancellations. And so while things are beginning to get back to normal here, there is clearly going to be an impact. And I want to show you some video of what passengers have been experiencing this morning as this - the FAA tries to deal with this issue. This is from State College, Pennsylvania.

CNN aviation safety analyst, former FAA safety inspector, David Soucie joining us now in the conversation. So, David, just - let's step back for a minute. We don't know the exact cause at this point. But this system that we've been talking about all morning, this NOTAM system, just walk us through what it does and why it is so important for pilots.",

It doesn't tell them, hey, the 'stem is ready to go. It says, if you're going from Denver to D.C., then anything that's in between there, you could have cranes that are in a local area around an airport, you might have any kind of information about construction at the airports, you might have anything in between there that might affect your flight. But the important thing to point out is that it only points out the abnormal things. It doesn't say the system's good to go.So, here's the problem. So, if you don't have any -- if something abnormal happens and you don't get that notice, then you don't know if it's safe or not. So that's why the FAA made a precautionary effort to say, look, there's other ways to get this information, but this is how everyone realize -- everyone relies on the NOTAM system. Always have. And in my 30, 40 years in aviation, I've never known this system to go down. So, I think this is a significant problem right now.",

I mean even the - even drone pilots use this NOTAM system to see what's going on in any particular operational area. So, here's what bothers me. The FAA says, yes, it's OK, go ahead and fly. However, when I go to the NOTAM search and look at it right now, it says, due to system processing delays recently entered NOTAMs may not be displayed. And then it has you confirm that you read it. It says, yes, I read this. I know that.So, what it's done is shifted the responsibility now over to the pilots and the dispatchers. So, we're going to continue to see delays because they're going to now have to check every airport, every route, 25 miles both left and right on that route to see if there's anything that might affect that flight.",

So, your technology is advancing as far as the volume is advancing very rapidly, but the technology is having a hard time keeping up and the people that run that technology, that's the most difficult thing because technology moves much faster than the human brain can adapt to it.

There's still a lot of standing water. As you can see here in this neighborhood, a lot of the residents telling me, look, it usually drains if it floods, but that is not the case this time around. So, they're having to deal with all this water driving through flooded streets. And the county telling me they're assessing the homes that have been damaged. There's at least 135, more or less, that have significant damage. They say those numbers are likely going to go up as they continue making those assessments throughout the day.Erica.",

Law enforcement sources tell CNN that investigators found a hacksaw, torn up cloth material and what appears to be blood stains while combing through a trash facility they were searching. Earlier in the week, investigators put crime scene tape outside and around dumpsters located in an apartment complex in Swampscott, Massachusetts. That near the home of the mother of Walshe's husband Brian. He is being held on a felony charge of misleading a police investigation.Joining me now to discuss is attorney and legal affairs commentator Areva Martin. Areva, very good morning to you.",

But since then we've learned he bought cleaning materials, nearly $500 worth, the day after she disappeared. He was doing internet searches for how to dispose of a body. And now this. They're clearly searching this disposal area here. And they found some things that could be connected to the case. Do you see investigators moving in the direction here of charging him?",

      "sentences": "A lot of moving parts at this time, Jim. Obviously, prosecutors can file murder charges even in the absence of a body, but it makes it very difficult to get a conviction in cases like that. They have to rely on circumstantial evidence. And the circumstantial evidence here looks bad for Mr. Walshe, but it doesn't establish, first of all, that there's even a dead body. The blood could suggest that there was some kind of domestic violence, some kind of altercation that resulted in someone bleeding out, but it doesn't establish that Mrs. Walshe is actually dead. So, I think that's the dilemma that the prosecutors have at this time. Do they wait and try to find her or find a body because we know there's no statute of limitations with respect to a murder charge.",

And that without a dead body, without someone who's actually deceased, you can't bring murder charges. They may, in some cases like this, we see people hire their own investigator to try to find the individual. Again, letters written to the court, not involving this case, but involving the fraud case that Mr. Walshe was charged for, for selling a fraudulent artwork, she wrote pretty compelling and warm letters to the judge talking about her husband in very kind and favorable words. So, the last evidence that we have of sorts relating to the condition of their relationship doesn't suggest that this was someone who was afraid of her husband, who thought ill of her husband. The letters, in fact, suggest to the judge that she thought very highly of her husband.So, the defense is going to be point to that letter as evidence that this is not a marriage in turmoil.",
