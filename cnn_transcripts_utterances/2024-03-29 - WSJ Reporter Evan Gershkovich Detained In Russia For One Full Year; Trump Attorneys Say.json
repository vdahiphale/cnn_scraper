The U.S. condemning his wrongful detention while offering hope for his release.This hour, two of Gershkovich's closest friends join us to share new details on how he's enduring and their own raw emotions right now. Also tonight, breaking news. Donald Trump just appealed a judge's ruling allowing District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the Georgia election subversion case. His lawyers are now arguing that Willis' entire office should be disqualified. Plus, an in-depth look at the unfolding crisis at the busiest migrant crossing at the southern border, where families, including children, are living in makeshift camps and facing often dire and dangerous conditions. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the \"Situation Room.\" Our top story this hour, the yearlong detention of \"Wall Street Journal\" Evan Gershkovich, jailed by Russia while doing his job as a journalist. The \"Wall Street Journal\" leaving most of its front-page blank today to honor Gershkovich and mark a year of what it calls his stolen stories, stolen joys and stolen memories. Tonight, President Biden is vowing to continue working every day to secure Gershkovich's release and the release of all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Adding, and I'm quoting now, \"we are with you and we will never stop working to bring you home.\" CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more now on Gershkovich's imprisonment and his fight for freedom. FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): No media allowed at Evan Gershkovich's most recent court hearing in Moscow. Just this short clip by the court's press service. Despite a year in a Russian jail, a defiant smile from the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter. No surprise, his detention was extended yet again through June 30th. The U.S. ambassador to Russia ripping into the verdict. LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: The accusations against Evan are categorically untrue. They are not a different interpretation of circumstances. They are fiction. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Evan Gershkovich was arrested and charged with espionage a year ago while on assignment in Yekaterinburg, central Russia. MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): I do not know if there are any other cases, but the allegations made by our intelligence services today were not related to his journalism. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The \"Wall Street Journal\" and Gershkovich's family strongly deny the allegations. Polina Ivanova of the \"Financial Times\" is one of Evan's best friends and still keeps in regular contact with him writing letters. POLINA IVANOVA, FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTER &amp; FRIEND OF EVAN GERSHKOVICH: He's doing remarkably well. He's absolutely staying strong. He's not allowing himself to, you know, to wallow, to get too upset by everything. In fact, he spends most of his time in letters to us trying to make us feel better. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Gershkovich faces a jail sentence of up to 20 years if convicted. But CNN has reported that Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan were part of a proposed prisoner swap with a now dead opposition leader, Alexei Navalny. The Russian president taunted on his re-election day that he approved a swap on the condition he'd get back a high-profile Russian intelligence officer in prison for murder in Germany, Vadim Krasikov. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The person who spoke to me had not finished his sentence yet. I said, I agree, but unfortunately, what happened, happened. PLEITGEN (voice-over): For those close to Evan, that means the waiting continues, outcome, uncertain.",

So the prosecutor's office pointing out to the judge that the day after that gag order was put in place, Donald Trump made statements about the judge and his daughter, and they asked the court to clarify if this gag order applies to the judge's family members, the family members of the district attorney, or family members of anyone else associated in this case, including some of the witnesses or potential witnesses here.Trump's attorneys are responding to that, saying that this appears to be an expansion, a request to expand the gag order. They're saying that Trump has interpreted it the way that a lot of people have in, you know, in the legal community, that it doesn't apply to the judge or his daughter, and if the judge is going to consider that, they want to be able to file legal briefs to argue against it. So it's now before the judge, but, you know, the prosecutor's immediately reacting to Trump's true social statements, where he was making statements about the judge's family members, and they're asking the court for some clarity, but Trump's team thinking that that is an overreach and an effort to expand this gag order, Wolf.",

I mean, we do these jobs because we're committed to the rule of law and we believe in the rule of law, and the rule of law can only function effectively when we have judges who are prepared to carry out their duties without the threat of potential physical harm.

And they're also saying that what he is doing, attacking the judge's daughter by name, pointing out that she has worked for Democratic political campaigns. They're saying essentially that that is campaign speech and so it should be protected. This is an argument that they have to make here because it's a bit different than in his other cases.In his other cases, there is a case where he has a gag order that's been upheld by the federal appellate court in Washington, D.C. This is another criminal case. And in that case, it's also says court staff and families should not be commented on, and he has not tried to go there in that direction. He has not commented since that gag order was put in place about that judge or her staff. And so when you look at these gag orders and the way they've been structured, they're in rungs. Witnesses get the most amount of protection. And then people who work on these cases, whether it's line prosecutors, people from the FBI, investigators whose names we wouldn't know in the public, or court staff and their families, that's the next rung of protection. And then the public officials are treated a bit differently because their names are out there. And so this clarification request, Trump's team says, you know, this shouldn't have been about the judge. We don't believe it's about the judge. But there is still an open question of, does the court order, should have it even applied to the families to begin with? It seems quite clear that protecting families and people whose names are not in the public spotlight is something that was intentional behind the gag order when Judge Merchan put it on this case.",

The more immediate question is, is the judge going to expand the gag order? Some of the statements that Trump has made about the judge's daughter, Loren, have been false. It has been disinformation, things that she did not actually say about him. And the pattern reminds me of his goading of Judge Engoron. There, he didn't attack the judge's daughter.This is the judge in the civil fraud case. He persistently attacked the judge's female clerk who was assisting him during the trial. That suggests that Donald Trump is very intentionally finding ways that he can provoke these judges, seeing how far he can go, and now the judge will likely push back.",

In 2020, Biden tried to sort of ignore him. Now, they are locked in to a fully trying to get in his head, I think, by making fun of his weight, his image, how he golfs. But also more than that, really, day by day by day. There's a crescendo of how the campaign is going after him. I'm not sure it matters at the end of the day to voters, but I think it's clear the Biden campaign is trying to go directly after Trump's psyche and things as well here. To the extent that he's watching, and we do know that he watches television. So it was notable the campaign decided to release that video clip. Of course, they did not allow news media access in its entirety. So we're not still entirely sure what was said there. And this wasn't a show of Stephen Colbert.

I will say, though, I do know some Republicans who prefer that Trump not be the nominee who are now really conflicted about what to do. And they're not as interested in what Donald Trump was saying about Nikki Haley. They're more interested in their -- how a gas they are at the way Joe Biden has conducted himself in office. And so they're really torn right now.So I just did the wrong numbers of it. I think a lot of Haley supporters were already never Trumpers, didn't vote for him in 2020. Some Democrats, they're gone. Trump's not going to get those people back. And so I really ultimately think we're dealing with a pretty small number here, frankly, for Trump. What's more important for him is to dig into Biden's working-class coalition, which you see emerging in some of the polling right now.",

But as these things go, I mean, those tend to be conversations that are had over a period of time before you -- you can't just expect you're going to pick up the phone and get those endorsements right away. And there's still quite a bit of legislative business that they're still trying to get done.The other thing I want to just quickly mention about that Haley ad. It's not just that he's insulting Haley voters. He's insulting women. His attacks on her. This is some of, you know, some of Donald Trump's greatest hits calling her birdbrain. He talked about Megyn Kelly and divisive ways in 2016. And we've heard him denigrate women time and time and time again. And starting in 2018, when I was working on a number of Senate races, we started to hear from voters, particularly suburban women who Trump still has trouble with. They didn't like that kind of talk. Even today in a piece that John King aired, you could hear people saying they don't like that meanness. They don't like some of that language.

This arms package reportedly includes 2,000-pound bombs that have been linked to previous mass casualty events in this conflict.Scenes on the ground in Gaza right now are already very disturbing.
