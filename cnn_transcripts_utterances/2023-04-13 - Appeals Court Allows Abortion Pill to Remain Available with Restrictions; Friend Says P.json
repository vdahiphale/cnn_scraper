The Democrats view as really essential to continuing the Biden ministrations legacy in the court.So what she's asking for what she released last night in a statement is that Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, temporarily replace her on that committee with another member. Remember, she serves on other committees, as well. But this committee really essential, because of the belief that, if she's not on the Judiciary Committee, if they can't vote out those judges, you really start to get into a backlog situation. So a very significant ask from Feinstein. And Chuck Schumer announced in a statement last night that he is going to respect her wishes. And next week, we'll try to move to replace her on that committee temporarily. Here's where it gets tricky, Poppy. As of this morning, we still don't know whether Republicans would agree to let Democrats do this easily or whether they're going to put up a fight. Normally, when you're member that you get named to a committee, it is a vote of the Senate that is so non-spectacular that most Americans back home aren't even paying attention to it. There's wide agreement. Sometimes they even get unanimous consent.

Since then, they filed that lawsuit, the $250 million lawsuit. And so the Trump team has now been able to see what all the allegations are against him. They also had a first look at all the questions that the A.G. wanted to ask him. Those 400 questions that he didn't answer. So now they're back again today at the request of the New York attorney general's office, and the president and his legal team have to make this decision of will he answer questions, some questions, or no questions? And one of the calculations here could be in a civil lawsuit, if you don't answer questions, the jury can hold that against you. So it would be essentially saying, you know, a non-answer is -- is a bad answer for the defendant. So that could be part of the calculus here of why he could come in and answer questions this time. You know, though, however, it is still a gamble, because the Manhattan district attorney, which did announce criminal charges against the former president related to the hush-money payments only just a few weeks ago, they're still conducting an investigation into the accuracy of these financial statements.
