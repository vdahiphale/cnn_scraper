Moments ago, Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke about the landmark verdict in the Oath Keepers trial, calling the decision a significant victory for the American people. His remarks come after a jury found the founder of the far right Oath Keepers and his deputy guilty of seditious conspiracy for their role in the Capitol insurrection. Those two and three others were found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding, a charge that carries up to 20 years in prison. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, here we see the attorney general seizing the spotlight and really taking a victory lap for these two significant but also very unique victories for the Justice Department over the past 24 hours, the first being those convictions on seditious conspiracy, a significant victory for these prosecutors. These have been the most serious charges filed in the over 900 cases brought related to January 6th. Here a jury found this violence was not spontaneous, but the product of an organized conspiracy.This is really expected to embolden prosecutors as they continue to work on cases already on the pipeline. And then as they contemplate other cases to potentially bring. The attorney general also wanted to highlight the Justice Department's work in Jackson, Mississippi, to try to protect and defend safe drinking water there. He said it was really important civil rights work, and he noted that this was a kind of thing that they're working on every day that does not get that much attention. And, Kasie, I can tell you over the past decade or so, of covering the Justice Department, they do get frustrated that's a lot of times what gets the most intentions are these high-profile political investigations. Beat Hillary's emails, Mueller, the current investigations into former President Trump. So even took the opportunity to check off some of the other things that the Justice Department is working on, including elder fraud, crimes against children, terrorism. But, of course, Kasie, he is going to get some questions as you would expect on some of these high- profile investigations, including his recent appointment on special counsel Jack Smith. He was asked if he had met with Smith and what was going on with an investigation. And he didn't say too much, but he did confirm that he had met with Smith. He said that he was working at the team. He noted that Smith is already gotten his work underway. Or proving some of the arguments the prosecutors made last week in Atlanta before a court of appeals. So it is a great opportunity for the attorney general to highlight some of the day today, the bread and butter work they do, and also a great opportunity for reporters to ask some questions about the other work they're doing.",

Let's bring in now, CNN's Evan Perez. He was in the room for Attorney General Garland's press conference. And, Evan, you asked him about the department's coordination with the January 6 committee. What did we learn? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kasie, this is been a point of contention between the January 6 committee and the Justice Department, which has been asking for access to all of the evidence. They want access especially to the transcripts of some of the witness testimony that the committee has received because, you know, obviously if you are going to put people on trial they have to be able to know what those people said to the committee that could play a role in discovery issues and people being put on trial. The attorney general said that the committee -- that the Justice Department is still pursuing access to all evidence to all of the transcripts from the committee. He would not say what the process or progress is in those negotiations. We know, Kasie, that the committee has been hesitant to turn over everything. They say belongs to the committee, that in some cases they are going to share some things with the Justice Department. But it appears that that is still a process that is ongoing. It is clearly not a resolved issue, and, of course, Kasie, you know that the committee has probably just a few more weeks to go before they cease to exist. We'll see whether the Justice Department can get those transcripts.",

And what they're going to be talking about is making possible criminal referrals to the Justice Department. So, they are going to assess all the evidence that they gather, and decide whether they think that they want, whether they want to ask attorney general to bring charges against people.That could be them asking for there to be charges brought against Donald Trump for the large amount of evidence that they collected over his interest in overturning the election results. They've been very clear that they think there would be a crime there. That is something that the Justice Department may already be looking at. They don't actually need the house to speak up and ask for an investigation into that. But there are other things that may have occurred during this House Select Committee investigation, Kasie, that really could prompt the Justice Department to get involved and look deeper, things like possible obstruction, possible perjury, possible witness tampering. So, we are going to have to wait and see what the committee does. It is all part of their wind down phase, writing the report. They wrapped up their very last interview today. And then those criminal referrals, there is going to be a outstanding question of whether not the committee makes a move there and said something publicly to toss it over to the Justice Department as this Congress ends.",

By my count there have been many maybe six different or more different ways that they have tried. This one was a very clean request that the house committee made in 2019, what they asked for was six years of Trump's tax returns, including the years he served as president. His personal, returns also returns around eight of his different business entities. And the courts, Trump was trying in court to block both. The courts ultimately all said, no, the House has this power. And those tax returns did go from the IRS to the House Ways and Means Committee.

I expect that today's biggest race verdict is significant in terms of what happens next.

So I think that is going to tell the Justice Department is that they have to make sure that they have evidence with everyone they prosecute for seditious conspiracy that shows that the conspiracy extends to those people.

One of the difficulties of this environment, especially frankly the Trump environment, is that a lot of people around Trump have not felt compelled to cooperate with congressional investigations, with special counsel investigations, and all kinds of a investigations for a number of different reasons. They stall. They assume that convictions are not coming. And I think that this idea that now there is a prospect of convictions on the table. I think it is a lot to change people's calculus. And then on top of, that there is always the prospect of what is coming.

And it is not so much, in my opinion, whether they have the evidence. And they found the evidence for a while. I think the DOJ has is going to proceed with their charging decisions matter what this verdict was. But, from a trial aspect, it can teach a lot about how to present that evidence. I think it is noteworthy that all of them were convicted for the obstruction of the official proceeding. To me, that says it's a little bit of an easier concept to grasp. Seditious conspiracy may sound very overwhelming like it is a real coup that might succeed. They need in the future to translate that into much more pragmatic step-by-step points of, this is seditious conspiracy.

And already handle of the more conservative members of a friends hadindicated that they plan to vote no. Some of them have suggested an openness to negotiate, and that's what McCarthy's team hopes ultimately will convince them to support him, pointing to his efforts to help Republicans retake the majority, and also some of the discussions about some possible rule changes to allow them more power over the leadership to give the rank and file more influence. And, Kasie, in a sign of McCarthy's effort to try to appease the right to show that he's not going to bow down to the Biden administration or Democrats, he sent a letter today to the January 6 Committee saying that they should preserve all records as he is they're suggesting that they may turn the tables and investigate the January 6 Committee that is investigating the insurrection that happened in the Capitol in 2021, a sign of his focus assuming he becomes speaker -- Kasie.",

After Russian parliament passed what it calls the LGBTQ propaganda law, claiming, in part, it's a defense against U.S. influence.

The medical examiner is coming up with information.So, what does that mean? That means that they have gotten the DNA from the victims. They have run that. They matched that to blood and physical evidence there. Now they have gotten the DNA from the two surviving victims and those known to visit the apartment. So, what they are looking for is an unknown sample of DNA that they can match to a subject. This is around the time when they would start to have those things. At the same time, talking to people who are working on this case and around this case, they have some very encouraging leads. I think they have some people that they are looking at that they are interested in. But I have been in these cases. And today's prime suspect can be tomorrow's back burner.
