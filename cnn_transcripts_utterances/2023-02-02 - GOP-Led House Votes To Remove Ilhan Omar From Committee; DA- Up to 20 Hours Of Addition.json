But some members had concerns about the precedent that they were setting here. They believe it was -- went further than what Democrats did in the last Congress.They said they didn't shouldn't engage in this revenge or tit-for-tat just because Democrats did something. This is a new Republican majority. They said they should focus on some other issues that congressmen like Nancy Mays had raised concerns about this, that Tony Gonzalez also raised concerns about this. They ultimately voted for it, one reason why Mays got some changes to the language to allow for member to give some more due process or allow for a future process to allow some members to appeal the potential of getting kicked off committees. But I put that question directly to the speaker, whether or not he was engaging in tit for tat, and if that was exactly the message that voters sent to Republicans in this new Republican majority that just took power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): No. And that's the clear part, how it's not tit for tat. We're not removing her from other committees. We just do not believe when it comes to foreign affairs, especially the responsibility of that position around the world with the comments that you make. She shouldn't serve there. But this is what the clear. This -- if it was tit for tat, we would have picked people took them off all committees, and said nothing about. We don't believe that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This required a vote of the full House.And as you can see, some members just were uncomfortable in going this route. McCarthy wants to figure out a new way to deal with this given concerns from his own conference that this is not the issue that they want to focus on right at the beginning of the new Congress.

You were in Memphis yesterday at the funeral for Tyre Nichols, which was as much of a call to action to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act as it was a celebration of life. Take us inside this meeting today. What will you be taking to the president? What's the strategy to get it passed?REP. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, (D-TX): Well, Victor, the first thing I'd like to do having been at the funeral is again off of my deepest sympathy to the Wells, family to the extended family of Tyre Nichols, to his beloved son, and all others in that community who are absolutely mourning and devastated by his death, this young spirited life. And so, there was a sense of urgency for police reform but it really should be a call to action for all of America. And I asked the question, would any American want their loved one to be beaten to death on the streets of this country? And so, for that reason, I think our meeting today called by the Congressional Black Caucus, our Chairman, Mr. Horsford, we're delighted to be part of this working team as -- I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee, the crime subcommittee ranking member, is that we are not turning any corner without a sense of hope.
