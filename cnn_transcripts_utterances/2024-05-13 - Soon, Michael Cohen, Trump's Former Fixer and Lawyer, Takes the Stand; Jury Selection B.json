And there is a really disproportionate lack of representation in aviation. It's primarily white men. And so we need to fix that. And so the hope is that we can sort of bring this and inspire kids and inspire people who are older, too. You know, it is, like I said in my broadcast from the cockpit, never too late.

This is CNN News Central. BOLDUAN:  The breaking news, it may all come down to this. We are right now standing by for Donald Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, to take the stand in this historic criminal trial, a crucial moment in this whole thing. By legal minds and casual observers inside and outside the courtroom, Michael Cohen is seen as the missing link in the prosecution's case so far. He made the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. He will tell the jury he paid her because Donald Trump told him to. But prosecutors need to prove Trump was directly involved in falsifying business records to cover it all up, which means Cohen's job is to connect the dots. Trump denies any role in falsifying the records and says that he never had sex with Stormy Daniels. His defense will call Cohen a liar and try, essentially, to eviscerate his credibility with the jury. But bottom line, the man who once wrote, I know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them, he will soon begin testifying under oath. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside the courtroom. It's all built up to this, Brynn.",

He's been called a fixer only because he broke things first. Now, they will be able to use their own judgment when he finally takes the stand.And, of course, as you just laid out perfectly, Kate, this is the time prosecutors want to use Michael Cohen to connect the dots to all that evidence, all that testimony that has come in the last several weeks. Michael Cohen for the prosecution, the hope is that he is going to bring jurors into that room in February 2017, the Oval Office when prosecutors say Donald Trump and he hatched this plan this way to reimburse him, you know, disguising those paperworks as legal fees on the business ledgers. So, we'll see if he does that for the prosecution. We'll see if jurors believe him. Of course, when it's time for the defense in cross- examination, we know that they are just going to hammer away at his credibility, as they have been doing with all these other witnesses that we have seen on the stand anytime his name is mentioned. They're going to pin him as someone who has a vengeance against Donald Trump, who really wants -- who's openly said that he wants his entire family to go to jail. So we'll see how it gets. But that's for sure. I can tell you there's going to be fireworks inside that courtroom for the next couple of days. We expect him to be on the stand for a couple of days. And then, listen, we're hearing from the prosecution, Kate, that there might be one more witness before the prosecution rests. And of course, then it's the defense's turn in this trial.",

      "sentences": "Right. Jury selection will begin today. It's expected to take about a day or so, and then we'll get right to opening statements where both sides of the defense of the prosecution will be laying out their cases for jurors.Prosecution will argue that Senator Menendez allegedly accepted bribes, bribes from two New Jersey businessmen, bribes in the form of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars and home furnishings, those bribes allegedly for his influence with the governments of Egypt and Qatar. For the defense Senator Menendez has all along said steadfastly denied all of these allegations, Sara, saying that this money that was found at his home was money that he saved over a period of time, for example, and that he kept it at his home in part for cultural reasons. One of the big questions, though, looming over this trial in terms of defense is whether or not eventually the defense will point the finger at his wife, Nadine Menendez, who's being tried separately. The reason why I say that is because I look at some of the court documents and it says part of the following. It says Senator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing in part that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracy. So, again, that's one of the questions looming over this trial when it gets underway, again, Nadine Menendez being tried separately for medical reasons. There was another man who was charged initially with all of this. Jose Uribe, he was charged with bribery charges. He ended up pleading guilty and is now cooperating with the prosecution. So, awaiting jury selection as it gets underway just at about 9:00 today. Sara?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. Good morning. This is going to be nothing quick about this. Okay, just to be clear, I think that, first of all, we should back up and note that Michael Cohen, right, a lot of what he will say has already been spoken to by other witnesses. I think that was very intentional on the part of the prosecutors such that they didn't want to leave too much reliance upon him.Having said that, I think those other witnesses, you can draw the reasonable inference that Trump knew about this. And, in fact, he has an own tweet saying it was reimbursement. There's a testimony as to the White House meeting with Michael Cohen in the Oval Office. There's testimony as to the Sharpies and the reimbursements from his personal bank account. Having said that, you could still argue that Trump has what we call plausible deniability. With Michael Cohen, not so much. If others have put Trump in the room, Michael Cohen puts him at the table. And so I think what you're going to see is they're going to walk Cohen through the chapter and verse, the totality of it, much of which again has already been testified to, but he's a very critical witness. However, what you're going to get from Michael Cohen is the words out of Donald Trump's mouth to him in addition to another person. His name is Mr. Weisselberg. He was a chief financial officer and we'll hear about his involvement as well. He's not testifying. Michael Cohen is, big, big day.",

You're going to be asked about your guilty plea and what you did. You just have to say it matter of factly.He's a lawyer. He knows all of this anyway, but they will be really taking him through it because he knows this is the crucial thing. He wants to see Donald Trump held accountable. He's said it a million times in a million different ways. If he screws up his testimony, that's unlikely to happen. So, it's really high stakes.
