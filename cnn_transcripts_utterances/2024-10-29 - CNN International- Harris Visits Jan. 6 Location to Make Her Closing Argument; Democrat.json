      "sentences": "Yeah, and I think when you talk to Harris aides, they knew they had to check a few different boxes when they were selecting the venue for this speech. One, they did want to emphasize the chaos that she says Donald Trump would bring back to the White House. And certainly, we know why The Ellipse would evoke that, those memories of January 6th, 2021, when Donald Trump spoke from that very spot, encouraged his supporters to walk down to the Capitol and walk down they did, and create a death and destruction down there.But the other box that they needed to check was to try and create a more proactive vision for the president that she would be if elected. And certainly, the spot does that as well. It's only about 500 yards from the Oval Office. You can see the South Portico of the White House from exactly where she'll be speaking. And so, they do want to create that balance in the themes that she'll talk about. And when aides used words to describe this speech, they say it'll be hopeful. They say it will be optimistic. They're not saying that it will necessarily dwell on some of the sober dark themes of January 6th that we might've expected when we first learned that this speech would happen here at The Ellipse. And so, you will hear her talk about some of the visions that she has for the presidency when it comes to the economy, when it comes to reproductive rights, and really the goal is to try and convince what the campaign calls conflicted voters. People who aren't necessarily sure about Donald Trump, who may be turned off by some of the rhetoric that he's been using on the campaign trail, but aren't necessarily convinced yet that Kamala Harris is their candidate. To try and convince those voters that this is the candidate for them. And they liken this to a closing argument that Harris might have delivered in a courtroom when she was a prosecutor. She's been laying out the evidence to the jury, in this case, the American voters, particularly in those seven battleground states. Now, she will bring all of those threads together into a cohesive argument for her candidacy. And we did hear her yesterday, preview some of the themes that she'll talk about. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  As I've said many times, I'll say tomorrow night in my speech, there's a big difference between he and I. If he were elected, on day one, he's going to be sitting in the Oval Office, working on his enemies list. On day one, I'm elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Last night, Trump also lashed out over attempts to paint him as a fascist, telling a crowd of supporters in Georgia that Harris is the one who was a threat to democracy, and he said he is the opposite of a Nazi. Trump allies reportedly think fallout from the New York rally could overshadow Trump's message in these closing days.

And we don't usually see that from the Trump campaign, that kind of statement or acknowledgement that something requires separation from Trump on.

This is why the Harris campaign was so eager to get another debate with Donald Trump.

But specifically, since October 7th attacks last year, Israel has been adopting a very hard line approach when it comes to the U.N. It has accused members of UNRWA of being members of Hamas and other militant groups. And it's said that UNRWA properties, facilities have been used as a location inside the Gaza Strip, from which Hamas has been able to launch attacks against Israel and against Israeli soldiers fighting there. And it's taken this step now to ban the organization.It's got three months to close down its activities and that's the justification basically that Israel has cited. Now, the big problem and the reason -- one of the reasons this has been criticized so roundly in the international community, including criticism from Israel's main ally, the United States, is that, as you mentioned, this U.N. agency provides humanitarian services, medical services, food, education, other things like that, to millions of Palestinians. And it's not clear at this point which organization, if any, is going to be equipped or able to sort of fill the vacuum when and if the UNRWA eventually is stopped from operating in the Gaza Strip, in the West Bank, and in East Jerusalem. And that poses a huge challenge to the 6 million or so Palestinians who are assisted by that U.N. organization at the moment. And so, that's something there's a lot of concern about.",

He served his four months behind bars for two counts of contempt of Congress for defying the House Committee that investigated January 6th. He got a subpoena and didn't provide documents, and didn't provide testimony. And so, I think what we can expect in the next week is a lot of inflammatory and incendiary rhetoric designed to try to push Donald Trump over the finish line and rev up the sort of Trump base and get them motivated.What was interesting is that we talked to some folks who track these kind of podcast metrics, like the War Room Podcast, which is Bannon's primary megaphone, and they did know this precipitous drop off and its popularity in the time that Steve Bannon has been behind bars, as it started to tick up slightly in anticipation of his release. But he's going to have to do a little bit of work to bring this Trump audience that he had surrounding him, back into the fold. I think one of the big worries though is not just what Steve Bannon can do in this next week between now and Election Day, but also the way he can use this sort of megaphone and embrace conspiracies and embrace lies about election cheating in the event that it looks like Donald Trump is coming up short on Election Day. He was a key voice of the 'Stop the Steal' movement in 2020, and there are plenty of election deniers, election conspiracy theorists who have still been on the show. And so, I think that it's not just a question of what Steve Bannon can do in the next week, but what happens if it appears Donald Trump is coming up short, and are we going to see Steve Bannon whipping people up again with more election conspiracies?",

Of course, she's going to focus on these things because this riles up the base and because he does pose such a huge threat.But she will have to balance it with some positive messages about why people should vote for her, why she should be the next president. And she'll focus on issues such as reproductive rights, which has really resonated particularly with women, and that's why she's doing so well with women, and that this is not just about abortion rights, but this is actually about women's health, that we've seen a rise in maternal death rates because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. And then she's going to have to really put the focus on how she cares about the middle class, and that she cares more about people like you.

They are training to fight in the war against Ukraine, and that is according to NATO, the United States and South Korea. But lawmakers who were briefed by South Korea's National Intelligence Service here in Seoul say that North Korea may be trying to hide from its own people that these deployments to Russia are actually happening. So, let's take you through what we know.We have two lawmakers briefed by South Korea's spy agency, the NIS. And the NIS says that North Korean families of these soldiers are being told the troops went to a \"military exercise\", not to Russia, not to Ukraine. The lawmakers add news of these troops going to Russia has spread within North Korea, despite the regime's effort to contain the truth. And they say there is some \"unrest\" among North Korean residents and soldiers about why they're making this sacrifice for another country. That certainly would be remarkable, considering North Korea tolerates virtually no descent against the regime of Kim Jong- un. We also heard from South Korea's president on this subject today. Listen to what he said.

The final federal rule requiring airlines to dole out refunds, not vouchers, took effect just a few hours ago. It is a major change and comes less than a month before what could be a huge holiday travel season in the U.S. CNN Aviation Correspondent, Pete Muntean joining us now from Washington, D.C. I'm sure a lot of travelers are happy to hear about this. What do we need to know, Pete? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENTHere's what it means. If your flight gets canceled or significantly delayed, the airline must give you your money back automatically. This is big because airlines have long offered vouchers or credits for you to use on a later flight, but this is in essence a cash refund. A little bit of fine print though. If the airline rebook you on a different flight, you must not accept that rebooking, essentially walk. Also must not accept any other compensation the airline offers you. Bottom line, choose not to fly, you get your money back. The other big change here is that this defined what is a significant delay. If you're on a domestic flight, it's going to be three hours late or an international flight that's more than six hours late, you now qualify for a full refund. Big question here. How fast you get your money back? Well, it really depends on how you pay. The requirement says the airline must refund you within seven business days if you paid with a credit card, money goes back to your account. 20 calendar days if you used another form of payment. Really the pushback for this came initially from the airlines who said this would be simply too complicated for them to implement. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted on X and then announcing this, and he says that passengers really deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them without headaches or haggling. He really put airlines on notice back in July, telling them to make it super clear to passengers when they are entitled to a refund. So the bottom line here is you're entitled to cash back from an airline if your flight is canceled or significantly delayed, not a voucher, not a credit. This is a really significant change.",
