I'm Jessica Dean in New York.At any minute now, former President Donald Trump will be speaking to supporters at a rally in the battleground state of Georgia. The Trump Campaign hoping to match the energy seen at Kamala Harris' rally in Atlanta holding its own event at the same venue were Harris greeted nearly 10,000 supporters four days ago, just days after Trump accused Harris of \"turning Black\" and after JD Vance called Harris a chameleon, Trump participated in a roundtable with Black business owners in Atlanta just before the rally. Let's go now to CNN's Alayna Treene, who is there in Atlanta. Alayna, what are we expecting to hear from Trump as they now try to sharpen their message against Vice President Kamala Harris.",

I know from my conversations with several of Donald Trump's senior advisers that they are still working their playbook and trying to figure out the best to define Harris, and you really have heard a plethora of attacks from Trump over the last several days. Oh look, he is actually coming out right now behind me, so it is going to get a little bit loud, so bear with me. But what I think, I want to point out here is that two weeks ago, it was just after the Republican National Convention. It like a lifetime ago, but it was only two weeks ago and Donald Trump in his party had a very different message and they had an entirely different opponent. Donald Trump had been urged at that point to really focus on policy and to continue to try to share a message that was more about uniting the party. That has completely changed now that we are two weeks later. We've seen Donald Trump really got to delve back to that 2016 playbook he used when he was attacking Hillary Clinton, when he was being so much more personal and nasty with his attacks. We saw that this week at the NABJ conference, Donald Trump has notched tried to walk back those remarks, instead he is leaning in. And you've heard him as well as other people this evening, lean into those attacks as well. And so I think you can expect some of that on the stage tonight -- Jessica.",

Now, we should also note that we did get a statement from his ex-wife, and in that statement today, she says that, \"He is a great father to our kids, continues to be a great friend,\" and she goes on to say that \"She is proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala and I have built together,\" and on that front, we should note that his ex-wife has supported and defended the vice president in recent days.

People at this rally have been echoing it today before he got on stage. To me, it just really does seem as though he is woefully unprepared to go after the policy issues because he is not comfortable doing that, and so for him, his comfort zone is to be a bully and to make juvenile comments, and to me, I think that's a disservice to the people he is supposed to be out there supporting and defending and standing up for in policy issues.

They're still trying to feel this out, they're still trying to figure out exactly what the message should be. Now Kamala Harris is an opposition researcher's dream because of all the very left positions that she took in 2019 when she was running for the Democratic nomination for president, and now that she is flip flopping and being inconsistent on those positions, but there is one quote that trump said in this rally, and I will paraphrase it. I may not get it verbatim, but it was -- we've been through enough in the last four years. We can't take it for another four years. That I think is a powerful message. If he can be disciplined and remained disciplined enough to keep reminding the American people what we've gone through -- the prices of groceries and gas and travel and everything skyrocketing and continuing to be high, that could be a very, very strong framing of who Kamala Harris is and what four years of her presidency would look like.",

And yet, as Priscilla noted, she telegraphed what appears to be their strategy, which is - the same old show. She turned it back and said America deserves better earlier this week, and then moved on.

Yes, I mean, she needs to focus on how to, one, address her record, because that is going to be a - once Republicans actually get back to policy issues, that will be a problem for her and a weakness for her. But she still has to focus on a VP pick and then solidify the ticket and campaign as the names that she's going to be on the ticket with.So yes, I think ignoring some of the stuff that Trump is saying serves her, because she's rising above it, but I also think that both candidates need to be looking at how to appeal to the moderate voters that are undecided on both tickets and how to reach them. And for Republicans, I'll say the big tent party is supposed to be more inviting and more encompassing. And unfortunately, we're not seeing that - you know, it's really taken a drastic shift since the convention, where it was this idea of unity. And I think that Kamala Harris has an opportunity to target where Donald Trump has largely abandoned by recently today making comments saying that he's going to purge the party of those who don't support him, his - you know, the Republican leader. So I think that there's an opportunity there to capitalize. And I think they need to be strategic in how they do that. You can't obviously respond to every single thing that Donald Trump says. That'd be a full-time job, I know. When he was president, it was really hard to do that with his outlandish tweets and things of that nature.

Two days later, you go and you assassinate the Hamas political leader in Tehran.Second thing Biden tells Netanyahu, we're going to help you now to defeat the Iranian response. But right after, my expectation is that you will move immediately to a hostage deal. And the third thing that Biden said, don't take us for granted.

Unemployment raising - rising to its highest in three years. It's something that former President Trump seized on in his rally that is currently ongoing in Georgia. Joining us now, Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics.Mark, thanks so much for being here with us. We appreciate it. What do you think about this data that we are getting from this new jobs report? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, it's disappointing. You know, the job market is still very good by any historical measure, but it's weakening. You can see that in the decline in the number of hires. You can see it in hours worked per week, temp jobs are down, businesses tend to cut back on temp workers before they cut back on full-time workers. Probably most disconcerting was the increase in unemployment. You know, 4.3 percent, that's where we are today. That's still very, very low by any historical standard, so that's good, but it is up a lot. It's up almost a percentage point over the past year, particularly for folks that have less than a high school degree. So, you know, the job market is good, but the trend lines are a bit disconcerting. Now, some of that is by design. The Federal Reserve has been working to slow things down and cool things off. But I suspect things are cooling off more than they would hope for at this point.",

I mean, they've been working really hard to get inflation back in the bottle and at the same time not push the economy into recession. So they've raised interest rates in an effort to do all that. And so it's a real balance, it's a judgment call.You know, my sense is if the folks at the Federal Reserve - they met this past week and they decided not to cut interest rates. I suspect if they had this jobs number before they actually met, they probably would have cut interest rates. They're low - they're slow to this. You know, in my view, they should be cutting - they've been cutting already. But I think, you know, after today - yesterday's jobs numbers, given the good inflation statistics, the balance - the judgment they're making here is now pointing to some rate cuts. So, you know, when they meet again in September, almost surely they're going to cut rates. It's really now a question of how much they're going to cut rates.",
