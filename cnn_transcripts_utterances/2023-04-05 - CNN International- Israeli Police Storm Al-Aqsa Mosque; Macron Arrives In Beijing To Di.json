      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead.(GUN SHOTS) Violent scenes in Israel. Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque and hundreds are arrested. We're live in Jerusalem. And historic meeting. The U.S. House Speaker and Taiwan's President is set to meet in the coming hours despite China's annoyance. We'll have reaction from Taipei. And Ukrainian diplomacy on display. President Zelenskyy visits Poland, one of his country's staunchest allies during its war against Russia. Israel's far-right security minister has made incendiary comments calling for heads to roll in Gaza. It's about Ben-Gvir's remarks come after rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel following a night of violence in Jerusalem. Israel says the majority of the rockets were intercepted or landed in open areas and no one was injured. Israel has already conducted retaliatory airstrikes and what it says are Hamas targets. The strikes come just hours after police entered one of Islam's holiest sites. This video shows Israeli police entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque by force to break up a group of Palestinians, where they say were barricading themselves inside. CNN's Hadas Gold has more on how the night's events unfolded.",

      "sentences": "Dramatic scenes overnight in the Old City of Jerusalem at the holy sites you can see just behind me. We have the Golden Dome of the Rock. But over here, the building with the black roof that is the Al-Aqsa Mosque and that is where we're seeing dramatic videos of Israeli police entering the compound in the middle of the night.They say they entered after they say hundreds of use barricaded themselves inside. Israeli police entering with their riot shields up and they say people inside fired fireworks at them. You can see them ricocheting off the walls. Israeli police responding with stun grenades and rubber bullets. The Palestinian Red Crescent saying 12 people were injured, three of them were transported to hospital. Israeli police saying, one of their officers were injured but that they also detained at least 350 people as a result of the events overnight. Now condemnation is raining in, because although it has been a tense time here for some time, and there was some level of clashes expected. I think the aggressive nature of what we saw from the Israeli police, that was a little bit unexpected. And we're hearing condemnations from the Jordanians, the Egyptians from Saudi Arabia, because even just the Israeli police stepping foot into the mosque is seen as provocative and offensive, but then the way that they engage with the people there, we're seeing videos of people being arrested and being laid on the floor of the mosque while in handcuffs. That takes it to a new level. And we're hearing from the -- alongside these condemnations things like saying that the Israelis are not allowing people to have freedom of worship and how dangerous it is that these sorts of escalations can explode into something further. And we did essentially see that overnight because shortly after these confrontations took place in the Old City, rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. Hamas, the militant groups that controls Gaza, saying that these sort of provocations will not be unanswered. Now, none of those rockets caused any injuries, although we do know that at least one of them fell on a factory while workers were inside. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes on what it says were Hamas targets. It's been a bit of a tense calm since then, but I have to say that there are a lot of concerns this could very easily spiral into something even bigger. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.",

      "sentences": "I think a lot of analysts, Max, are saying that the reaction might not be as severe as it was when Nancy Pelosi visited this island last year in August, and then China encircled the island with unprecedented military drills, basically even launching missiles in the direction of Taiwan, a ballistic missile over Taiwan.They basically erased the median line that was -- has been respected by both sides since 1954. That's the line in between China, the mainland and Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, which is only about 110 miles wide. But this time around, yes, President Xi is meeting with the U.S. House speaker but it is happening in California and not Taiwan. Also, as you mentioned, President Macron and the E.U. Commission President both in Beijing, Xi Jinping, perhaps not too keen to overshadow such an important moment of diplomacy at a time that China is trying to repair its frayed ties with Europe. There's also another interesting development that's happening. You actually have for the first time since 1949, a former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, also in China, for a visit that coincides with this meeting between Tsai Ing-Wen and speaker Kevin McCarthy. And this is significant because the KMT party that Ma Ying-jeou is a senior official of is -- did very well in the local elections. China likes the KMTV like working with the KMT. And they don't want to potentially do anything that could, you know, sway the vote here in Taiwan, which is happening relatively soon. This is President Xi entering the final year for two-term presidency. Xi on the other hand, says she's not going to let external pressure from China interfere with her plans to meet with the U.S. House Speaker and welcome him or any U.S. lawmakers or others from like- minded democracies, as Taiwan puts it, who might want to visit in the future, Max. So I think really, the one with -- the biggest amount to lose here would be China. If they push things too far, they already are pretty, you know, alienated from much of the West and they're trying to mend that relationship. So too much military action near Taiwan could have the reverse effect.",

And, of course, Russia is very much high on the agenda when it comes to the meeting between NATO foreign ministers, particularly for Antony Blinken, and he took part in a session this morning focusing on the threats and challenges facing the Alliance head of what is to be another NATO Summit, which will be very much focused on the war in Ukraine.Now we know that Blinken met yesterday with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, where he reiterated and reconfirmed the U.S. government's support and commitment to NATO's cooperation with Ukraine and the Ukrainian Armed Forces and bolstering that support in their efforts to tackle the Russian invasion. And, of course, we've also learned that the U.S. is now setting up another military assistance package for Ukraine valued at $500 million. So this will be a significant boost for Ukraine and that will certainly be another key talker today, of course, as Antony Blinken continues to meet with his NATO counterparts.",

We'll be following that press conference for you and bring you the highlights.Police in Scotland have arrested the husband of former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in connection with an investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National Party, that's according to British media. Peter Murrell was taken into police custody following an investigation into the SNP's handling of money that was slated for Scottish independence campaigning. The party says it is, quote, fully cooperating with police. For the first time in American history, a former president has been criminally charged. Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a New York courtroom on Tuesday. The charges stem from a payment allegedly made on Trump's behalf to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Just hours after that historic arraignment, the former U.S. President gave a defined speech at his Florida Resort, airing a familiar list of grievances and making a number of false claims. Trump lashed out at the judge, the Manhattan district attorney and both of their families. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me now from West Palm Beach, Florida.

It's only a fairly minor crime here in New York. It's either going to be a misdemeanor, or a very low level felony unlikely to result in jail time.

I was pleasantly not surprised, but I was very pleased to see that everything in Manhattan yesterday was very orderly. There were very limited protests. I was out by Trump Tower. I was down by the courthouse, but they were the kind of protests that we should have. People cheering and chanting and holding up signs. And the law enforcement authorities here did a remarkable job of keeping everything neat and orderly but while also respecting people's legitimate First Amendment expressions, but I do worry about people crossing that line.",

It was on the ground for over 32 miles or roughly 50 kilometers. It was a very intense tornado for this town in Arkansas.And now we're under a Tornado Watch. So we're watching storms that are just to our west that could threaten this very same region where we are. But let's talk about an immediate threat and bringing it to Chicago because I want you to see what the skyline of Chicago looks as we speak. You can see some darker clouds in the background. And I think this is looking on Michigan drive here, but I want to advance the graphics. Hopefully, they're working. But, basically, this line of thunderstorms that is coming through has been producing wind gusts in excess of 40 to 50 miles per hour even higher. Just in the western suburbs of Chicago, there has been hail. In Davenport, Iowa, just to the west, that was 4 inches in diameter, that's the size of a grapefruit. You can just imagine how dangerous that is. It's putting holes in cars windows, but it's also also produced tornadoes with this line of thunderstorms as well. So we're going to be on the lookout for that as Chicago is currently in their morning rush hour. So flying in and out of O'Hare or Midway Airport, there are ground stops and delays that are being reported coming out of that particular region. And that line of storms will continue to move through Chicago within the next 45 minutes to one hour. Now closer south, where I'm located in Little Rock, there are tornadoes firing to our west or at least stronger thunderstorms. And what they're doing is taking advantage of this very warm, humid and very windy air mass that we have in place here. So it doesn't take much for the atmosphere to start spinning. And that's what we look for as meteorologists for these long track supercells that produce tornadoes that caused the damage that you see behind me. Max?",
