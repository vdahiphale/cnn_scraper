Nine soldiers are now dead after the two Black Hawk helicopters that they were on crashed in Southwestern Kentucky. The Army says that the helicopters were on a training mission and that the soldiers were using night-vision goggles when the accident happened. Kentucky's governor rushed to the soldiers duty station, which is called Fort Campbell, and had this to say this morning: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY):  Today is a tough and a tragic day for Kentucky, for the Fort Campbell and for the 101st. The nine individuals we lost our children of God. They will be mourned and missed by their families, by their communities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Alex, there is an aircraft safety team that is on their way from Fort Rucker, Alabama, to investigate what caused this crash.According to the deputy commanding -- the deputy commander of the 101st this morning, there were two Black Hawks -- one aircraft had five service members on it, the other had four service members on it -- that crashed last night just around 11:00 p.m. Eastern time over Trigg County, Kentucky. It is a neighboring, more rural county here to Fort Campbell, right over Cadiz, Kentucky. He said that they were running a quote -- I'm so sorry here -- they were running essentially these routine training missions. It was a multi-formation. We were told that there were four different aircraft there in the training mission initially, but that one of them had stopped to refuel, and another was ahead of the two that crashed. They were using night goggles. These were also medevac variants of the Black Hawks. Now, they say that they may not know immediately what happened. Witnesses did describe hearing like a pop and seeing those helicopters fall there in Trigg County, telling a radio station there that it was just like a boom after that pop. We asked if there was any sort of alert or signal given, any sort of SOS, if you will, letting them know if something was wrong ahead of time. They said they didn't have any indication that there was anything radioed in before the crash happened. Alex, we do expect them to look for computer data on these aircraft. Essentially, much like when we talk about a black box on a plane, something -- they have something similar to that in these helicopters that they anticipate can give them good information to it. We do know that that helicopter that was ahead of the aircraft, that was ahead of the two that crashed was able to provide information to the authorities here to let them know that something had happened. There were authorities from all over the area that came to respond to this, and, of course, the commanding general offering his condolences and talking about how difficult this was for the base here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. JOHN LUBAS, DEPUTY COMMANDER, 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION:  I would like to express our deepest sympathies to the families of our fallen soldiers. This is a truly tragic loss for our families, our division, and Fort Campbell. And our number one priority is caring for the families and the soldiers within our combat aviation brigade.

      "sentences": "Yes, Alex, we are told that the State Department actually learned about it from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" who informed the administration that their reporter had been detained by Russian authorities.But we are getting kind of a flurry of statements now from the White House, from the State Department about the detention of this journalist, saying, essentially, that they are deeply concerned about it, that they have been in touch both with his family and also with \"The Wall Street Journal\" on this, and also, importantly, that the State Department has been in touch directly with the Russian government about his detention. And, of course, the data is directly contradicting something that the Russian government had said, which is that they had received no inquiries from the U.S. government. The U.S. now directly pushing back on that, saying that they have submitted multiple inquiries through the consular services there trying to get information when, how and why this reporter was detained there. Now, we also are getting additional information from the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, John Kirby, who told reporters just a short time ago that he does not know whether this detention was in retaliation for the U.S. charging a GRU operative, a Russian spy, essentially, just last week for entering the U.S. illegally and for impersonating a foreigner, someone he wasn't, pretending to be someone he wasn't. However, it is still too early at this point to say whether Russia is essentially trying to leverage this reporter's detention for another prisoner swap. So, we will just have to wait and see what happens here, but the U.S. still trying to gather information about why he was detained and whether they can get any answers on when he might be released. As of right now, he is going to be in detention until the end of May, Alex.",

Julia, thank you so much for joining me today. And I think this hits particularly close to home for you and I. We met years ago as young reporters in Moscow, like Gershkovich. And now we have these accusations of espionage, the Kremlin saying that he was caught red-handed. What does Evan Gershkovich now face with Russia's legal system?",

And for a young man who's 31, that is his entire youth gone, unless, obviously, some kind of deal is reached.You mentioned my background. And it's particularly relevant in Evan's case as well. Although he was born in the U.S., his parents were immigrants from the Soviet Union, Jewish immigrants. And there is a sense in Moscow, especially in the Foreign Ministry and in the Kremlin, that people of this kind of background, like my background, they are particularly sensitive to and they're particularly sensitive to our criticism. They feel that they're -- it's a different kind of level of betrayal when you leave the Soviet Union, you leave the country, you move abroad, and you basically lob grenades at the -- at your homeland, at your motherland from abroad. And I think that certainly does not help Evan's case. Those of us who had roots in the Soviet Union had bigger targets on our backs, for sure.",

But it didn't result in physical harm. It didn't result in arrests. It resulted in a couple of expulsions, but that was the extent of it. This is a terrifying new low and a terrifying new development. And it's, frankly, why I have been scared to go to Russia since the outbreak of the war, because of exactly this risk, because everybody said, well, but they haven't arrested American journalists.

And the fact that there's almost nobody there now makes the coverage suffer, makes Russia more of a black box, makes Russian decision-making and Russian public reaction much more inscrutable. As you said, American news organizations have been kind of tiptoeing back in. But, from what I have heard, in light of this news, organizations, like \"The New York Times\" are pulling people out of Russia again, because it's not safe. And to your earlier point about banking hostages, I have been talking to people in Moscow this morning. And, from what I understand, it isn't just about a tit for tat for this GRU officer or this FSB officers who is in prison somewhere in the West. In part, it's a sense of, we no longer care about the American reaction. They think America rules the world, including the International Court of Criminal Justice at The Hague, and that, in some ways, this is payback for the arrest warrant that they issued for Vladimir Putin, that:  The gloves are off.

They haven't given us any details about what exactly those treatments are. Let me give you an idea of where the pope is right now. If you can see behind me, on the top floor there, there's about five windows that are shuttered down with white shutters. Those are the papal rooms at the Gemelli Hospital. As you mentioned, the Vatican also told us that he had breakfast this morning, was able to read the newspapers, and indeed do some work, so obviously giving a sense of reassurance, especially considering the uncertainty, Alex, of yesterday's news, with the problems that they said the pope had been complaining about, not being able to breathe. Now, the pope is 86 years old. He also has a history of a respiratory issue. When he was 21, part of his lung was taken out for respiratory illness. So, he is particularly vulnerable to this situation. We also know he has other health issues, mobility, a problem with his knee. He was here in the summer of 2021 for 10 days to have surgery for diverticulitis, and they had to remove some of his colon. Hopefully, his stay this time won't be that long, Alex. There's Easter week coming up here starting on Sunday, Palm Sunday, at the Vatican, a very busy time of year for the pope. So we will see how he progresses in the next few days -- Alex.",

On Monday, a little bit before the shooting happened, Patton received a Instagram message from the shooter that said, in part -- quote -- \"Something bad is about to happen.\" Now, after Patton receives that message on Instagram, she calls a suicide prevention hot line. At some point along that conversation or at some point in that conversation, Patton is told that she really needs to call the sheriff's department. She finally gets a hold of someone at the sheriff's department and then is told she really needs to call a nonemergency number. So this all happens before the shooting happens. And, at 10:21 in the morning, she is finally able to get a hold of someone at this nonemergency number. By that time, the shooting is already under way. It is still unclear at this hour this afternoon exactly why Patton was being passed from one department to another. It's quite possible that the reason this happened is because Patton really did not have a whole lot of information to pass along. She did not know the shooter's name and she did not have an address where the shooter lived. Here now is a bit of that call. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",
