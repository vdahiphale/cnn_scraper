And welcome to Iowa, where in just 34 days, caucusgoers here will cast the very first votes, of the 2024 presidential race.We're live at Grand View University, in Des Moines, for CNN's Town Hall, with Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. I'm Jake Tapper. And right now, the presidential-hopefuls are furiously campaigning to win over Republicans, here in Iowa. It's a state that can make or break presidential candidates. Governor DeSantis has visited all 99 of Iowa's counties. And he won the endorsement of the state's popular governor, Kim Reynolds. But he is facing steep competition, from his rivals, including the Republican front-runner, former President Donald Trump. Tonight's event is about the voters. Governor DeSantis will have the opportunity, to answer questions, directly, from the Iowans, in this room, on the issues that will help them determine who wins the Republican nomination. I will have some questions of my own. But this is not an interview. This is a Town Hall. And the audience, are voters, who say they plan to participate in the Iowa Republican caucuses, both registered Republicans, and those who plan to register, as Republicans, by the time of the caucus. To find tonight's questioners, we reached out to Republican-affiliated groups, as well as business groups, farm associations, parent groups, young professional organizations, religious groups, and conservative advocacy organizations. Guests of the DeSantis campaign, and Grand View University, are also in the audience, tonight. But they're not going to get to ask any questions. We have asked everyone here to be respectful to each other, and to Governor DeSantis, so that voters in the room and you, at home, have a chance to hear, from the candidate. Now, please welcome Governor Ron DeSantis. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thanks. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)",

One, if you look at what we've done, in Florida, our economy's ranked number one, of all 50 states. We've boomed, like we've never had, even in the face of all the inflation, and the interest rates, which we have to obviously struggle with too. But our unemployment rate is 60 percent lower than states like California, which are Peer States.I'd also say this. I think the first three years of the Trump administration, the economy is better than it has been. But that last year with COVID, I think was mishandled dramatically. Shutting down the country was a huge mistake. Printing trillions and trillions of dollars was a huge mistake. That set the foundation, for the inflation that we see, granted, Biden came in and poured gas on the fire. It was reckless, that he did trillions. But if you look, you have trillions and trillions of dollars. Of course, you're paying more for that. You're going to have inflation when that happens. So, I'm going to come in, we're going to get the inflation down. We're going to open up energy, so that you pay less for gas. And we're going to get the interest rates down, so you can actually do things like afford a home. So, I think your hard-working employees are going to have a friend in the White House. And I think we're going to be able to turn this country around.",

We have a relationship with them that's like no other. And they have the whole world against us. They require the United States, to be there, to stand with them, as the friend. Ukraine has all of Europe. These European countries need to start pulling their weight. They don't meet their NATO dues. I mean, some of them have done, Poland, Finland. But a lot of them are not doing that. They have all these people. Russia is a threat to Europe. They need to rise to the occasion, rev up their industrial bases, and start arming themselves, so that they can help Ukraine, and keep Russia in a box. But Israel is a unique country, in terms of our relationship. And as Governor of Florida, it's something that when the attacks happened, against them? That impacted my state, because I had so many people that go back and forth. You had people that were stranded in Israel, they couldn't get back. The State Department wasn't helping them. The embassy wasn't helping them. So, I did an Executive order. We scrambled planes. And we rescued over 700 people, from Israel, and brought them back to the United States of America. You need -- when you're in an Executive position, you need to be able to lead, particularly in crisis situations. We stepped up and helped our friends, who were in Israel. And we would do that as President of the United States. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)",

I think that that's in our interest. But they have spent tens of billions of your tax dollars, to subsidize farming, in Ukraine, to subsidize small business, in Ukraine, to pay salaries for bureaucrats, and pensions for Ukrainian bureaucrats. How is that something that's more important to this country than our veterans, than some of the other problems we have? And from a national security perspective, that, open border threatens our country. We have people from all over the world that have gone in there. And so, I think what these Republicans are saying is, \"Let's get this done.\" And Biden's going to have to compromise on that and he's not going to do it. Look, as President, I'll do the border on day one. Day one, we're going to declare it a national emergency. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)",

It's because you have these people, at the U.N., who were disgraceful, who were trying to blame Israel. They wouldn't even condemn the Hamas attack, at the United Nations.So, Israel gets targeted, and singled out, more than any other country, in the world. They're the only Jewish state, in this world. And everyone's come gunning for them. The morning of the attack, I was actually in Iowa. And I said, we stand with Israel, we can all do that. But here's what's going to happen. Weeks, months in the future, you're going to start to see them blaming Israel, for all this. So, you look at what may be happening, in the Gaza Strip, if there's civilian casualties? That is Hamas' fault. Hamas should release the hostages. Hamas should unconditionally surrender. Israel cannot possibly live with a terrorist group that wants to annihilate their entire country, and kill every Jew, and usher in a second holocaust. So, they have every right to defend themselves. Now, in terms of the two-state solution, I don't think you can have a quote, \"Two-state solution,\" when the Arabs will view it, the Palestinian Arabs will view it, as a stepping stone, to the destruction of Israel. Why have you not had a solution there? Because they've never recognized Israel's right to exist, as a Jewish state. And until they're willing to do that, anything that would be done would just weaken Israel. And so, I think Bibi and a lot of people in his cabinet know, they've offered massive concessions, in the past, and it's been rejected. And that's the problem. The people in the Gaza Strip as well as in Fatah, they want to destroy Israel, more than they want their own state. And that is wrong. And we cannot stand for that.

And I think it's going to be very rewarding service for you.What can you do? Well, one, you can change the policy. Remain in Mexico. You have people that are abusing the asylum. They come, make a bogus asylum claim, and then they get a sheet of paper, say, \"Go ahead into the interior of our country, and come back in two years for a court date.\" That is not a deterrent. So, we will not entertain those claims. They can wait. I think we need to reform the law, so that the claims don't even happen. But we're not letting people in. No way. We're going to also empower states, to enforce immigration law. People are coming, across the Rio Grande? Texas should be able to deport and send them back. That's a force multiplier for us. I am going to build the border wall. And I remember, in 2016, I went to the rallies, with Donald Trump. He said he was going to build the wall, and have Mexico pay for it. And that didn't happen. And why didn't it happen? Well, one, I think he got distracted. And he didn't do it on day one. But two, he didn't utilize the levers of power that he had. So how do you get Mexico to pay for? Well, they're not just going to give us money. Although Trump said at the time, they would do that, because people like Jake would say, \"Wait a minute, how are you going to be able to do this?\" \"Oh, they're going to pay for it. They're going to pay for it.\" They didn't do it. Here's what you do. You impose fees on the remittances that workers send back, to foreign countries, Mexico, Central America, really all over the world. You'd raise billions of dollars. We'll put it into constructing the border wall. And here's the thing. We, as Republicans, probably 99 percent blame Biden, for 8 million people coming in illegally. It's been bad for the country. And I do too. But here's the thing. If Trump had built the border wall, it would have been very difficult, for Biden, to bring in all those many people. That's why you want a wall. It's a physical fact of life that even an open-border president would not be able to get around. So, I will get the job done. The talk is cheap. And I'm sick of Republicans always using this issue, every election cycle, to try to get donations, and to try to tell the people they could do it. We are going to bring the issue to a conclusion.",

So, not only do we have a right, as president, you have a responsibility, to fight back, on behalf of the people, of this country.And what that means is we're going to designate the cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. So, it's not just willy-nilly saying, we're going to shoot anyone. How do you know? Just like when I was serving in Iraq. When I was in Iraq, and anyone that knows that served there, the Al-Qaeda did not wear a uniform that said \"Al-Qaeda.\" They all dressed the same. So, someone could be walking down the street, you don't know if they're a civilian, or if they had an IED strapped to their body. And so, you had to make judgments about hostile intent, hostile action. You positively identified people. We're going to have intelligence, we're going to have a lot of things operating, in ways that we've never done before. But for those, who complain about me wanting to lean in on this, are you fine with letting all these people die? And one of the things that I've done, just as governor, and as a candidate, I've met a lot of these Angel parents. These are parents, who've lost kids, to fentanyl overdose. Really, they're getting poisoned, high school, college, in their 20s. And what you find is most of these cases, they're not drug addicts. They are may be stressed out. Someone tells them to take this pill. So, they take it, not thinking it would be fatal. But it's laced with fentanyl. It poisons them, and then they die. We actually had a case in Florida. Family rented an Airbnb unit. 18- month-old baby was crawling on the carpet. There happened to be residue, from fentanyl, on the carpet that killed the baby. Can you imagine losing an 18-month-old? This is happening all across the country. And I met a fella, a couple months ago. And he told me, he lost his son, from a fentanyl overdose. And he's like, \"You know? What really is the salt in the wounds is that these people, in D.C., they don't care about what's going on. They're not viewing this as a sense of urgency. They're not doing what it does.\" I can tell you this. I care. I think this is a sense of urgency. I think we need to fight this scourge. And it's not just the supply. It's also demand. And in Florida, we've actually done an Opioid Recovery Network. That's reduced overdose deaths. We're one of the only large states, in the country, where we can say we actually had a year-over-year reduction. So, I do think you fight demand, you do treatment and you do supply.

One of the problems with trying to crack down on this, as you know, I'm sure, is that according to U.S. government data, the overwhelming majority of fentanyl is smuggled into this country, by American citizens, and through the legal ports of entry.

Because it used to be China would make it, and then they'd send it. Now, China's sending the precursor chemicals, and then the cartels are making the final products, and doing. They'll put the fentanyl, in candy, to try to market it to very young kids. This is really sick stuff. So, I think we have to have all options on the table. But here's the thing.

But look, I believe in peace through strength. I think if you build up American strength, we will deter conflict, in this country. But you never know what's going to happen. But my pledge to all the active-duty, all the veterans, all the family members of active-duty is this. I will never put people in harm's way, willy-nilly. If we're going to do it, there needs to be a clear objective that we're trying to fulfill. We need to send people. When you send people, they need to have everything they need, to be able to accomplish that objective. That objective has got to be something that's in the vital national security interests, of our country. And then, when they achieve the objective, we got to bring them home. We can't have these situations, where people are toiling for years and years, in these foreign countries, with no concrete example of victory. So, I hope to never do it. But if we ever need to, we are going to win. And I think the lesson of the post 9/11 era was we got into conflicts, and we weren't achieving any clear-cut victories. You got to know, what are the limits of what the military can do? When I was in Iraq, part of what we were trying to do was create a democracy, in the Middle East. Well, nation-building doesn't work. Social engineering, in foreign countries, doesn't work. When you have to go to defend this country, you go, you do the job, and you bring our people back home. (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)",

I've been able to follow that up, in Florida, by enacting pro-life protections, to protect unborn that have a heartbeat, a detectable heartbeat. And that's something that the Legislature passed, and we signed earlier this year. I think though, one thing in this race that I think is important to point out is Donald Trump flip-flopping, on the right to life. So, if you look in January of 2020, when he was president, he stood in the March for Life, and he gave a speech. And if you read that speech, he said that all life is a gift from God. He compared the unborn child, in the mother's womb, to being the image of God. He said it was important that we had protections in law. And that's what he was saying in January of 2020. Now, he has attacked states that have enacted protections, like heartbeat bills, as being a terrible, terrible thing. So, how do you square that March for Life speech, with now trashing states that have advanced protections that he claimed to cover? Was he not being honest in January of 2020? Or has he just flipped his position to now, what he's saying in 2023? I think that's a huge problem. Because we know people come at this from different angles. It's a big, diverse country. There's a lot of division about it. But you should be consistent, in your beliefs, especially on something that's very fundamental. And he has not been consistent.

Obviously, it's a significant thing that you want to do.What we're going to do? And this was a big promise, of course, when Donald Trump ran in 2016 that he was going to repeal and replace Obamacare, because he did correctly -- and I've always said Obamacare is not making health care more affordable. It's made it more expensive. That was the central claim. And it hasn't worked. It's more expensive than ever. But I think they failed, because they didn't have anything to replace it with. The American people, at the time, were telling him, and telling Congress, \"Yes, we know Obamacare is flawed. But you got to produce something that's going to be a replacement.\" So, what we're going to focus on is accessibility. We want good health care to be accessible to people. We want affordability. It's got to be affordable. And we want accountability in the system. And there's going to be a lot that we're going to do. We'll roll out a bigger plan as we get deeper in the election season, because we're working with a lot of experts, in Congress, and all this stuff.

Big insurance companies, big pharmaceutical companies, big government bureaucracies. It's an iron triangle that really is a system rather than something that's an individual care. So, we want to make sure that people are protected. I think your insurance should be portable. The whole reason the pre-existing condition came is because it was tied to people's jobs. So, if you lost your job, while you were sick, then all of a sudden, in the past, you wouldn't do. That insurance should be able to go with you. So, we're going to work on all those things.
