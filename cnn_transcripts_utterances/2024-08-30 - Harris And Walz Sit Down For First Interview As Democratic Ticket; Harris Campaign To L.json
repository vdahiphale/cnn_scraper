So let's talk about the interview last night. You know, a lot of people are sort of saying that she did fine. You know, she did a nice job. Was it the best interview they'd ever seen? No. But it didn't have to be. She had to just do OK. She had to pass the test and she did that. Is there anything you think she could have done better in the interview last night in terms of how she came across? JEREMY THOMPSON, former KAMALA HARRIS 2020 SOCIAL MEDIA DIRECTOR: Yes, candidly. First of all, thanks for having me here. I think these interviews are one of those stepping stones that we have to do when it comes to just our political system and how it works. One of the questions people asked Vice President Harris when she went into the interview was, will she be able to answer questions unprompted, in an uncontrolled setting for a wide amount of time? And the answer is yes, she could do that. Do we think a lot of Americans are going to be, you know, blown away by the interview? Absolutely not, but that's not what the interview was done for. I think one of the things that, you know, when we look back at the interview that we think we could have done a little bit more of was really speak more about those reproductive rights that we know are on the ballot this fall, when it comes to our general election cycle. We know that's an issue that is really, really important to many Democrats, independents, and Americans across the United States. And we know that Kamala Harris and Governor Walz are going to be campaigning across the coast in swing states to really make sure that case is made. So I would have loved more focus there, but I think Americans got an idea of her economic policy, border policy. We learned who she was as a person and we took the first step that it takes to walk into a general election.",

When she was asked a question by Dana Bash essentially saying, you know, Donald Trump just said that you just became black, that you're not really black, you'd only just became black because it was politically advantageous to you. Did she miss an opportunity to sort of lean into how historic her candidacy really is? She sort of just dismissed the question.",

So I think we get the significance of this. I don't think she missed an opportunity, candidly, because I will tell you that when speaking to other candidates who've run for office, who've been those first or been those trailblazers who have hit those milestones, frankly, they're tired of their authenticity and credibility being challenged by people across the book. I think Vice President Harris was right. We saw this playbook in 2008 when it came to birtherism with Barack Obama, who I did volunteer for back when I was a young kid back when I was 18. And we're seeing it again now. I think Vice President Harris and Governor Walz understand that right now Americans want to focus on how they're going to make sure that the economy works for them, how we're going to make sure that we're safe at night, and finally, how we're going to get a commander in chief that can restore the dignity that's needed in the office of the president.",

She is generally excited to meet Americans where they are in their neighborhoods and their communities. And so I always argue as a social media director, it's not our job to make, say, a candidate go viral or a pod go viral. It's our job to be authentic. Because I will tell you, the arbiters of public opinion, Gen Z, will see right through any manufactured viral moment. But instead, what we do know when it comes to Vice President Harris is that the moments that really resonate on social media with her are where she's being who she is and what it's about. And I'll give you one example. We, I believe, were in South Carolina during the 2020 election cycle. And there were these two young girls who were standing at the end of the rope line and they both were looking up at Senator Harris at the time. And one of them said, if you don't win, I'll win for you. And, you know, it was a moment where Kamala Harris reached out and said, no, I'm going to win so we can pave the road for you to come. And I will tell you, that's the moment you can't make up. And I think that's one reason why young people are excited about Vice President Harris. I think that's why when we come off the tails of those viral moments on social media, it's important that we always work to pivot towards those core issues that matter most to Americans. And I think the campaign is doing just that this week.",

I would say that I would hope that our candidates who are running for president and elected office across the country would evolve over time. I think one of the things Americans are looking at is when you were vice president, when you were working with President Joe Biden to implement the agenda, the American people voted for. You know, what did you learn on the job? What was your experience? How are you going to apply that to today's everyday life? And the campaign, it seems to be walking that fine balance, right? I think, you know, we talked about fracking earlier. That's an example of that. But I would hope that we would evolve over time. So our Americans forgiving, I think we're forgiving people. I do think there is an understanding of politics though, during the primaries, that you start on the sides and you move towards the middle. I think we're seeing that shift on both sides. I really would hope that both candidates, both former President Trump and Vice President Harris, would want to tell the American people that they've evolved over time because it's critically important and then stick to those issues as we move into the fall. It is important that as voters, we know what our party stands for. If we know what our candidates want because after inauguration day, that's when the agenda gets started.",

He was a doting father and beloved husband, a son, brother and teammate who adored himself to every person fortunate enough to have crossed his path.\" Just an unthinkable tragedy, Zain.

The United States is getting ready to celebrate Labor Day on Monday and that means a lot of Americans are on the move. Millions of people are flooding airports and highways as they travel for the holiday. A record 17 million travelers are expected to swarm the nation's airports over the long weekend and folks are traveling by car. The good news though is that gas prices are at their lowest levels since 2021. My colleague, Rafael Romo, is at the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, which is by the way the busiest airport in the world. I know, because I used to live in Atlanta.

There was a point earlier today that this area where I'm standing at the world's busiest airport was full of people, but a way would come in and they would screen them and so on and so forth. Now you were mentioning people who are going to drive for this holiday weekend. There's a big incentive this year because I was looking at some numbers and gas prices, the average for today, a price per gallon nationwide is 3.35 percent. And compared that, Zain, to just a week ago when it was 3.37 and 3.50 last month by comparison, last year was 3.81. So big difference here in a big incentive for people to drive.

We will -- because we need not only the algorithms, but we need the distributed computing, the cloud computing platforms to be able to run hugely, you know, computationally intensive, you know, intensive calculations on. One of the benefits of the -- of the AI revolution is that there's huge amounts of investment going into data centers to provide all this computation. And that's actually, we think in the medium term, going to make -- going to make computing much, much cheaper. So we'll be able to do more and more of these intensive computations. And the algorithms themselves are getting more efficient all the time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
