Now, it is a factor as it relates to what your activities are. So, I think that bar is different.To your question, it's not only about getting a defendant to talk, many don't, right? And us defense attorneys don't like our clients to talk. But there are so many other circumstances, right, you could evaluate. What did you target that particular night, who did you target, why were you there, were they celebrating something, as they were on that occasion, in terms of the transgender community and a remembrance night, did you know about that, did people -- were people who are familiar with you, did they express concerns about how you felt about members of the gay community?

And the fact that we knew that, generationally, Jerry Jones had to have experienced the events in Little Rock more generally, but to find him in the alphabet photograph and to learn that he experienced one of those incidents right on the schoolhouse steps was pretty revelatory.

Owners don't spend much time with them.You know, owners talk to lots of head coaches. They talk to very few assistant coaches. If you're an owner of the New York Giants or the Dallas Cowboys, you're not probably spending a great deal of time talking to your running backs coach. So, this accelerator program is one idea to try to get those relationships moving along. We'll see if it works. Quite frankly, a much better idea is for a team like the Dallas Cowboys, a really maker of manners, to hire a black head coach and to have a winning record and win a Super Bowl with one. When Tony Dungy was hired and won Super Bowls with the Indianapolis Colts, it definitely did trigger a moment there where the NFL looked like it was going to become much, much more diverse in its head coaching ranks.
