But there's no doubt it's very damaging to the family that Camilla comments are very damaging to the royal family and the monarchy undermines the whole system.

We're standing in front of a high school one of the hits that took place just about eight minutes, very after midnight on Sunday. And as you can see a very large crater we believe created by an S-300 surface to air missile used as a surface to surface missile. It's blown up in front of this high school.The glass is all been shattered, but our crew went inside the building just hours after the strike. There's no evidence of any casualties whatsoever. There's no blood on the floor, there's not even any evidence anybody was in this building. They saw rows of desks and chairs blackboards on the wall, but no indication whatsoever that anybody was in that building or hurt in that strike. We went to another location where there's another very large crater like this one in the ground right next to a garage. But yet again, no evidence that there was any large concentration of Ukrainian soldiers or much damage beyond the crater it created. Now it's widely believed that this strike was in revenge to Ukrainian strike on a vocational school in the town of Makiivka in the Donetsk grid region. Just a few hours into the New Year, in which even the Russians concede at least 89 of their soldiers were killed. The Ukrainians claim as many as 400 Russians were killed and 300 wounded. But obviously, neither of those claims can be independently verified, but certainly what we've seen with our own eyes, and what we've heard from Ukrainian officials. Bianca, there doesn't seem to be a shred of truth in these Russian claims.",

      "sentences": "Well, immigrant advocates criticize the fact that the President didn't get to see the full scope of what they call a humanitarian crisis because he didn't see migrants that we know of now. There are migrants that are living on the streets of El Paso and the President did go to a migrant respite center. But there weren't migrants there at the time.And a senior administration official tells CNN that it was a coincidence, there just didn't happen to be any migrants there. And part of the reason to is that numbers of border crossings have dropped there. But the bigger picture here is that this has been a political problem for the administration and it's not an easy one that they can fix. They need the assistance of Congress, which President Biden has made quite clear, in fact, saying in a border security speech last week, that Democrats and Republicans need to come together to reform the U.S. immigration system. But they also need the help of their partners to the south, primarily Mexico, where I am. So we are expecting to hear President Biden talk to Mexican President Lopez Obrador a lot about migration and what they can do to stem the flow of migration. Of course, a lot of the initiatives that the U.S. rolls out to try to stem the flow of migration typically require some level of buy in from Mexico take last week the announcement that the administration would push back Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, Haitians, and Cubans to Mexico, if they didn't come in through a parole program, which has been newly established again, that requires Mexico to agree. Then what we expect to hear more on climate change, economic development and security. Fentanyl has been a big issue. That is one that is likely to come up. So the three leaders will meet later today. They'll then have the summit tomorrow where there will be more discussion. But it is just very clear at this point that the President Biden needs the assistance of these countries as he deals with a massive migration issue across the Western Hemisphere that is landing at the U.S. doorstep.",

And you can see it here. We've got it up on the wall for you.So on the right, we're looking at the scenes from inside and outside the U.S. Capitol that happened on January 6th, United States. And obviously on the other side, we're looking at the scenes that are unfolding in Brazil just hours ago. Now Leaders from around the world including the President of the EU, the British Prime Minister and of course President Joe Biden are condemning what they're witnessing unfolding Brazil. Biden says I condemn the assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil and goes on to say that the U.S. has full confidence in Brazil's institutions. Bolsonaro's supporters use social media to get heavy exposure of their propaganda prompting social media giant Meta to label the unrest as a \"Violating Event\". And to remove all content that supports those who stormed the buildings from its platforms. To discuss let's bring in CNN's Senior Political Analyst John Avlon, and he joins us now from New York, John, great to see you. We were looking in a split screen at the January 6th, Insurrection and scenes in Brazil. Bolsonaro has been referred to as the Trump of the tropics, there are obviously similarities. But how do their grievances stack up? Do those in Brazil also reject the result of the election? Or is it more than that?",
