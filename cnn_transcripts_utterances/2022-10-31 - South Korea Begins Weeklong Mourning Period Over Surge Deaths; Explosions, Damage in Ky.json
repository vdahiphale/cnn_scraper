The Korean Ministry of Education says one of the victims was a middle- school student. Five were high-school students. And there was also a lack of information, because the crowds were so big people didn't know what was happening just around the corner, around the block. A truly terrifying situation. And I think part of the problem here is, it's hard to just blame one person for this incredible loss of life. And it makes the senseless tragedy of this all the more painful. I have to point out, you know, there are two photos here that have been erected, just two of the 154 victims, American exchange students here for a semester.

In other words if you don't win the election, violence is always an alternative. Democracy can't survive this way. We believe in elections, and we support elections and in the peaceful transfer of power. That \"peaceful\" is the key word there; it's not transfer.

Not just because they would like those people to be voting for Democrats, but because they're worried about the actual real-world consequences of it. A Democratic strategist said to me in the reporting for this that it's just an abstraction for voters, and they can't get people to focus on it when there are these more immediate concerns. And so Democrats are looking to try to connect some last-minute energy among their base to these issues, admitting that they failed to make people care about it and make it an immediate concern that was linked to their economic worries, and seeing if they can get some of their voters there. But I talked to Tom Cotton, the senator from Arkansas, a Republican, who said to me that he hears a lot of threats from Democrats about -- or a lot from threats to democracy, but that Democrats should be worried about the threats from democracy, is the way he put it.
