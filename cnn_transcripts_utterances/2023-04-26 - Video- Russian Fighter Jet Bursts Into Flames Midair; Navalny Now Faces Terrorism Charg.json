And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight -- one of Putin's prized jets is gone. One of the most elite supersonic jets in Putin's air force blowing up today in midflight. You can see the jet on fire here. It takes a sudden and terrifying nosedive on Russian territory. The jet was not shot down. This is all that is left of it. It's just a few pieces of scrap metal, and as you can see on the ground. In today's accident on Russian territory is just six days after another Russian fighter jet bombed its own city, bombed their own city. That blast left a 65-foot crater in the middle of the street in Belgorod. These are major setbacks, you know, for what's supposed to be an elite air force and they're taking place at the same time Ukraine is ramping up for a major counteroffensive. Now, in a moment, I'm going to speak to a Ukrainian fighter on the frontlines. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But while Russia may be down, a lot of soldiers dying, do not count Putin out at this point because tonight leaked U.S. intelligence documents obtained by \"The Washington Post\" revealed that Putin has enough money in the bank to fund the war for at least another year, despite the sanctions. And Putin is putting more soldiers on the ground. A top U.S. commander, General Christopher Cavoli today telling lawmakers that Putin's ground forces, quote, bigger today than it was at the start of the war. And even as they have used that method of wave after wave of soldiers now just getting machine gunned down, they still, even after all that death, have more in than they did at the beginning of the war. Meantime, in Moscow, Putin opposition leader opposition Alexey Navalny appeared in court from his prison cell. Navalny is now facing new terrorism charges that could land him in prison for another 35 years. Navalny was told his time in solitary confinement would now be extended for the 14th time, which is a brutal punishment. Yesterday, Navalny's team posted a message from the opposition leader in which he said the prison and the inmates are governed by many factors. But the three main ones are threats to kill, beat, rape somebody. Tobacco, food. But food? That Navalny letter continues, is never ever actually serve to him while in solitary. They show it and tell him it's expired. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT. And, Fred, what more are you learning about these new charges against Navalny?",

The Ukrainian army is fully ready to move and cut our flanks, he says. Nobody has ever cut our flanks. Although stories about preventing the Ukrainian reserves from entering Bakhmut are total crap. Not a single shot was fired by the Russian army. While Russia's forces struggle on the battlefield in Ukraine, the attrition against the Russian opposition continues. After Alexei Navalny's hearing, he was sent straight back into solitary confinement, his supporters say.

Of course, China right now trying to style themselves as negotiators in all this possible peacemakers as well. Afterwards, Zelenskyy said that all this was about promoting a just peace for Ukraine. Well, the Chinese held back a little bit. They were saying that they want to promote that what they call dialogue and talks over all this, seems to be lopsided on the part of the Chinese.

So, why is this panda being tracked so closely?Because, for the Chinese government and many citizens, Ya Ya the panda cannot get home soon enough. Angry over her chronic fur and skin condition, that makes her look thin and patching, Chinese state media and many Chinese people are accusing the United States of mistreating Ya Ya, and anti-American outrage is very serious, is getting very ugly. Selina Wang is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Once a symbol of Beijing's goodwill, now a center of angry debate in China. This panda in Memphis, Tennessee, has become the latest victim in worsening U.S. tensions. Ya Ya arrived in America with her playmate Le Le two decades ago, as an emblem of growing bilateral friendship. But recent videos, showing the once fluffy panda, now looking skinny with scruffily fur, has sparked outrage in China, many Chinese people and animal advocates accusing the zoo of mistreatment. Videos on Chinese social media claiming the pandas are being abused, quickly went viral against the backdrop of growing anti-American sentiment. The rumors, often fanned by state propaganda. And meanwhile, Chinese social media users are praising these viral videos -- claiming videos of the active and playful panda prove Russia is taking excellent care, of the Chinese bear. State TV saying the pandas are helping the Russia-China relationship. Chinese and American scientists launched a joint investigation, concluding that Ya Ya has a genetic fur and skin condition, that does not impact her quality of life. It has received excellent care, but that message is not getting through. Outside a panda exhibit at the Beijing Zoo, I ask people if they've heard of Ya Ya the panda. This man says yes, she is abused in America. An 11-year-old boy tell me I heard the U.S. is treating the panda poorly. This man says, is in Russia taking good care of pandas? Pandas are happy over there, not like in the U.S. And this man with his granddaughter tells me, pandas and Russia are very happy. Why? Russians and Chinese are friends. At least Russia is not sanctioning China. Ya Ya will soon settle in this Beijing zoo. Now, China has long used its pandas as diplomatic tools. are on loan to 20 countries, the United States is not received when for ya ya at lola 20 years ago. Currently, these pandas are loaned to about 20 countries. The United States has not received one since Ya Ya and Le Le 20 years ago. Now, these pandas are only loaned on these 12-year leases, and they cost $1 million annually. The Memphis Zoo had already planned to send Ya Ya and Le Le backed to Beijing this spring, because their lease is expiring. But Le Le died of heart disease two months ago, at the age of 24. The average lifespan for pandas is usually under 30 years, yet that didn't stop rampant speculation, and led to an explosion of accusations about Ya Ya's treatment too, accelerating calls to bring Ya Ya back to China. The message even featured on billboards from New York City to major cities across China. In 1972, during U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, his wife visited pandas in Beijing.
