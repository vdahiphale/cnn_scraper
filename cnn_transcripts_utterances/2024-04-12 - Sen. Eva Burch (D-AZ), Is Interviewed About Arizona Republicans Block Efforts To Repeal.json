      "sentences": "Now, this announcement today comes just a few days after President Biden rolled out a sweeping new proposal to reduce or wipe out student loan debt for millions of Americans essentially a do over of his first student loan forgiveness plan, which was struck down by the Supreme Court.The hope here is that this plan would be in place by the fall in time for voters as they're set to make up their minds before November's election. But this also marks the latest attempt by Biden to show that he's trying to bring down costs for Americans. You often hear him talk about reducing the price for the prescription drugs taking on junk fees. Student loans, is also an area where the White House believes they've done a lot of work on. But it comes at a time when the President has consistently faced pessimistic views of his handling of the economy. And many Americans are still feeling like their financial states are not doing any better. The President got some tough news this week, when a key inflation report found that prices had ticked up in the month of March, really highlighting the fact that inflation has been a very stubborn political issue for Biden in this campaign. Now, the Biden campaign is also eager to draw some economic contrast with former President Donald Trump. Campaign officials this morning tell me that next week President Biden will hit the battleground state of Pennsylvania. He will be there over three days in three different cities and his very first stop is his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Officials tell me that the president there will really seek to highlight the differences in the two candidates tax policies arguing that Biden is working for middle class Americans while former President Trump is working for wealthy Americans. We have often seen Biden trying to return to his hometown, using it as the backdrop to make his appeal to working class voters. That will be no different next week. I will also note that as the President is in Pennsylvania, we will have a pretty stark political split screen as former President Donald Trump is expected to spend most of the week in New York for his criminal trial.",

Her visit comes after the state Supreme Court reinstated a near total abortion ban that dates back to the Civil War era.I want to discuss now with Arizona State Senator Eva Burch, thank you so much for joining us. We will talk politics in a bit. But I want to talk to you about your personal experience. You've spoken about your own abortion and you're a nurse practitioner, when you look at what has happened now in Arizona, and what the law of the land is there. What is this been like for you? SEN. EVA BURCH (D-AZ): Well, I think that disappointing would be a really dramatic understatement. The timing really couldn't be any worse anymore ironic. I just had my abortion procedure less than three weeks before this decision was handed down. And what we're really looking at here, if this goes into effect, is an impossible scenario for medical providers in Arizona, where they really have to make decisions in critical circumstances that are life and death. And that really isn't the sort of legislation that we should be promoting in the state of Arizona.",

      "sentences": "No, of course not. We had an opportunity to bring it back into reason on Wednesday. And it is a simple solution to fix this problem in Arizona. All we have to do is repeal the ban. It's something that we could have done at any point in time. We've been in session since January, and the bill was sitting in the House collecting dust where it couldn't get a hearing. So we could have fixed this problem at any time.They have proven and shown us that they're not interested in that. What I think is likely happening now and what the legislative Republicans have told us what Leader Toma over in the House has said publicly is that we're going to, you know, put the brakes on this, and we need to have a talk about it. And we need to consider what we're going to do next. And what that means is they're going to try to decide how they can use this to their advantage, how they can put something else into the conversation into whatever the bill is or the solution that they come forward with to make it probably something that Democrats can't vote for, or something that is not in line with what the people of Arizona wants. If we were going to do the right thing, we would have done it on Wednesday. We would have just done a straight repeal of the ban. But when we have extremists like Donald Trump and Kari Lake at the top of the ticket, and then we have extremists like Shawnna Bolick and like Matt Gress here in the Arizona legislature, those kinds of things can't get done. And I am exhausted hearing Republicans ask Democrats to clean up their mess. Donald Trump can say that, no, you know, this is too far. But this is your problem. This is the problem that you created. And we're not seeing any accountability. And what we're experiencing in Arizona is a problem that Donald Trump and legislative Republicans created. And now they're expecting other people to clean up their mess without taking any accountability and we just can't stand for it.",

      "sentences": "All right, we do have some breaking news. What you see there on the screen is a vote, a procedural vote in the House of Representatives. Normally, this would not be such a big deal. But this time that vote you're seeing there signifies House Speaker Mike Johnson's control of his own party where it might be headed. This is a vote on a rule to allow a full vote on reauthorizing a surveillance bill, a FISA surveillance bill, a lot of that sounds complicated. But what you need to know is that Mike Johnson was sort of embarrassed a few days ago when 19 Republicans voted against him on this narrow procedural measure.But this time this morning just minutes ago, we're looking at it right there. It passed, and no Republicans voted against him. With us now is Democratic congressman from Florida, Jared Moskowitz. Congressman, nice to see you this morning. The rule, the FISA rule passed, does this mean House Speaker Mike Johnson, all his problems with his own party are over? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Thanks, John. Thanks for having me. No, it doesn't mean it. I mean, look, they've had more rules go down this Congress since the last time that happened was in the 70s. And so, you know, this is an historic Congress, right. You know, they've removed a speaker that never happened. They impeach the cabinet secretary, that hadn't happened 150 years. They removed a member of their own party that hadn't happened in 20 years. And they've passed, I don't know, 50 bills, I think which the average is about 400. They're way beyond the pace and think -- I don't think we've sent a policy bill to the President since the middle of last year. And so, you know, look, it's good that this rule passed so that we can make sure that we're keeping Americans safe from terrorist threats around the globe. But, no, the dysfunction of the 118th Congress is not over just because they passed one rule. They were able to convince Donald Trump to stop telling his members not to vote for it. BERMAN: So House Speaker Mike Johnson was seen on the floor with Marjorie Taylor Greene just before the vote, don't know what they talked about. What we do know is she has been talking about calling for a new vote to oust him from the speaker's chair. If that were to happen, if it were to get to the floor again, where Republicans push to remove the speaker, Democrats, they get to vote too. You get to vote too. How would you vote in this case?",

And they cast their vote for Kevin McCarthy. The vote is on a motion to vacate. And there'll be a motion to table that.So first, you'll vote on the table, right? And so Democrats could decide to table the motion so we don't even get to the actual vote. If the table were to fail, then the motion to vacate is either just yes to declare the speaker's chair vacant or no, to declare the speaker's chair vacant. It's never on the person.
