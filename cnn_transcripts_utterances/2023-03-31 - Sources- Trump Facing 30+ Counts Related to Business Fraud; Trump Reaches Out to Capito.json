He has at his Mar-a-Lago home that he was huddled with top advisers off and on throughout the evening, he ate dinner with Melania in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago.And again, this was a controlled person. He seemed to calm. Now, one of the things that we know is for the last month they have essentially seen the former president go through a range of emotions. At times, he has been angry. At times he has celebrated that this potential indictment could lead to political success. But last night I am told that he was very controlled. He seemed to understand the gravity of this moment, as we reported last night. Several of these advisers, including the -- and the former president himself were really blindsided by the timing of this indictment. Yes, for two weeks, they have been planning for potential indictment. They were literally sitting on edge every day, trying to figure out trying to read tea leaves of when this might come. But they read the same media reports that we all did that said essentially, the grand jury was likely not to hear any more on the Trump case before they went on hiatus. So many of them thought they had some time. So now, after that initial surprise now they have moved on to that sort of shaping the narrative part of all this, Poppy.",

That's not true. We know from our reporting that prosecutors were a little bit thrown by Costello's testimony, and they believed they had a button up that case. We saw David Pecker go before the grand jury earlier this week, and apparently, there was another witness who we don't know. Now, I will note when I reached out to Robert Costello last night for comments. I mean, you know, he's a chatty, chatty one loves to talk. Loves to comment, he said, I cannot comment on this case right now because I am a potential witness, and that is a big difference right now between Michael Cohen and Robert Costello.

This is uncharted legal territory. This is an untested legal case to tie potential federal charges to a state crime.And you also have the possibility of a judge either downgrading it saying no misdemeanor or throwing it out.

That's not a very high bar, but to your point, there's a much higher bar proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.So the lesser crime is just that there was an intent to defraud, and that there was false entries made in the business records of that organization. That's fairly easy to say and easy to do, but to your point again, what is that other crime that would elevate this to the felony? And that is uncharted territory, and I would imagine a lot of this delay. And I use that in quotes because it's not really a delay. It's doing your homework and doing your job. A lot of that is figuring out can this case go forward on the theory that we're charging or looking at a federal statute to be the basis of that of that crime?",

I mean, it was really within minutes of this indictment that you started to see the rallying around former President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, particularly in the House of Representatives, where he still has a stronghold over the Republican Party, including over House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who promised in a tweet last night that Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan D.A. would be held to account. He did not say exactly what direction the House of Representatives is going to go to do that, but we've gotten some early clues.We saw a letter just a couple of days ago before this indictment was even announced from Jim Jordans, as well as other powerful chairman like James Comer of the House Oversight Committee, warning that they wanted testimony from Alvin Bragg expect that that is going to intensify in the days and weeks ahead. Lawmakers are on a two week recess right now, but there is a dramatic split screen that's playing out because while you have Republican leadership in the House, coming to Trump's defense. You have silence from some Republican leaders in the Senate, including from Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, who has a fractured relationship with Donald Trump in the wake of the insurrection two years ago appear on Capitol Hill -- Poppy.",
