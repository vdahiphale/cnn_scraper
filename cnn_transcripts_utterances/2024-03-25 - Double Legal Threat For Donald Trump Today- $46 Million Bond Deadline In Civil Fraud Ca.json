We are following an extraordinary day for Donald Trump and his many legal battles.Two of his court cases on the front burner today, each with potentially big consequences. First, this hour a pretrial hearing just getting underway in Manhattan. You could see the former president a try -- arriving there through the court doors. The cameras flashing. This is in the so-called hush money case involving the adult film star Stormy Daniels, the former president accused of paying her money to cover up an alleged affair. The bottom line, the judge today could deny any further delay sought by Trump's lawyers, keeping a start date for this trial in April. That would make it the first of Trump's four criminal cases to go to trial. It would also mean a verdict would be possible before the November election and outcome not clear with the other trials.",

If hedoes not come up with a $464 million bond today, the New York attorney general's office can start seizing his assets and that includes anything from bank accounts to private planes or even his prized real estate. We've got this covered from all angles. And joining us now from Washington, Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, reporter Alayna Treene and former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin, great to have you all with us. As we've just seen, those images of Donald Trump arriving at the courthouse. We've discussed Katelyn, how that April 15th trial date has been penciled in. But the question is now, does the Trump team, the legal team have grounds to request a further delay?",

We have to wait and see what the judge responds, how he responds. What Trump was saying just there into court, you couldn't really hear him. But according to our team over at the courthouse in New York, he was saying this is a witch hunt. This is a hoax. And now he's in the court, waiting for the court to come to order for the judge to take the bench. But one of the things that this highlights this hearing is the rigorous standards that the judges look at before cases go to trial, Trump may be saying it's a witch hunt and it's a hoax. But every step of the way, when the defense team gets additional documents right before trial, when there are requests from the defense team to dismiss the case on legal grounds or things the prosecutors are doing, that's why there's a judge and a court. They're looking at all of these instances before the case gets to go to the jury. And so, we are going to hear a little bit more of the judges thinking today. He has not provided much sympathy. He's not given a lot of room for Donald Trump's team to get everything they've wanted in this case leading up to trial. And had really told them at the last hearing, they were not going to get the delays that they were pursuing which were as long as possible. They were trying to take every opening that they could get. Right now, in this case, the date on the calendar is April 15th. That's what the New York D.A.'s office is going to be arguing to have hold. They want to go to trial as soon as possible and that looks to be the first date that's penciled in. But as this hearing progresses, we should get a better understanding of whether that's where the judge sees things as well.",

And if you do so inaccurately in order to cover up another crime, it's a felony. If you just do it, books and records misstatements, it's a misdemeanor. What Bragg is charged here is two misdemeanors, false statement records combining to create a felony and in violation of another law being a federal election. So, there's a big open question about whether or not adding two misdemeanors to create a felony in violation of a federal law is kosher under New York state law. And the judge is going to have to deal with that issue. That I think is the biggest problem that the prosecution has. There's a related statute of limitations issue. But if they can get over that hurdle, then the facts of the case are pretty straightforward. Trump paid Cohen to pay Stormy Daniels, who then was reflected on the books of records of having received repayment in the form of legal fees. So, the facts are pretty straightforward. Is this curious question, Jim, of can you add two misdemeanors in violation of a federal election and have a New York State charge withstand appellate or trial, you know, judge dismissal motions?",

And part of that is because it strikes to the core of who he is, he is a businessman, he wants the world to see him as a wealthy businessman. And not being able to put up the amount of cash for this bond is something that is embarrassing to him. And a lot of this comes down to public perception as well. He -- you know, the idea that he doesn't have as much cash that he claims is something that he does not want the public to see or to believe. And I do want to just read from you what we heard from Donald Trump, he sent a message or a post on Truth Social as he was heading to the courtroom for his hearing in the criminal trial, but this was him addressing this bond on deadline. He said, \"Crooked pols,\" that was referring to politicians. There should be no fine, did nothing wrong. Why should I be forced to sell my, \"babies\", because a corrupt New York judge and A.G. set a fake and ridiculous number? The post went on to say, witch hunt. So, again, this is the type of rhetoric we have heard from Donald Trump. He's talking about his babies, referring to his assets and properties that could be seized depending on how that -- what happens today with this bond deadline. But again, something that Donald Trump is -- something that is very personal to Donald Trump, I should say. And he has for years as a real estate mogul really been tangled up in a lot of different legal battles, but has always been able to avoid this type of situation where there is the potential that some of his properties and assets could be seized. And so, that is really what is very concerning to Donald Trump. And I know he's in this hearing in New York for that hush money case, but this is where a lot of his attention is on. Now, I just want to also quickly address how he's thinking about the criminal -- potential criminal trial. The big thing here is will they get a deadline for that trial, as you guys mentioned, it could be the first trial that he faces or only trial even before the election, and that is a concern of Donald Trump. One of his biggest fears has really been facing a criminal conviction. But at the same time, his attorneys behind the scenes do see this as the least politically damaging of the four criminal indictments that he is facing despite some of the personally mortifying details in this. It is the one that they think they can fight the most easily.",

So, that's in the civil case, that's not going to be addressed in the proceedings today that Trump is currently sitting incourt in Manhattan, that's the criminal case. And that's going to be the very narrow discussion about those documents, what it means to the case that Donald Trump's team got a number of documents recently to prepare for their defense. But in the civil case where he has lost that case, and the judgment of nearly $500 million, half a billion dollars has been entered. There was a 30 day window where Trump was able to post bond so that he could continue appealing to hold off essentially New York State the Attorney General from collecting the money that they are owed, that they have won in court in that case after a trial. And today is the day, the reason that today's important is because today is the deadline where the attorney general's office can start collecting on that money. They've told Westchester County, they've told authorities in New York City, that they are ready to collect this judgment. Now they're going to have to go piece by piece to try and freeze bank accounts, potentially foreclose on properties, file liens on properties on major assets that Donald Trump may have. That process will take time. We may not see that much today. The only thing that we may see today that would give us a little bit more clarity on what's going on is if Donald Trump were to post that bond, or write a check to the court for $464 million to keep appealing, or the appeals court in New York State could step in and say he doesn't have to post the bond. He can continue his appeals. We believe he's rich enough, or he has enough money to post. There are things that he is asking just to sort of drag things out a little bit more to allow him to keep appealing and hold off the attorney general. But we're watching for moves there that could come simultaneously as this court hearing in New York in his criminal case.",

She could go after any cash she has. Cars, furniture, even his plane before she moves on some of these buildings. We do know. She's put court paperwork in already. That suggests one of her first targets might be a big Trump estate in Westchester County outside Manhattan, where he used to live, which is one of the jewels of his real estate portfolio. Trump spent the weekend claiming on social media that people were going to try and seize Trump Tower. It seems unlikely that the authorities would go immediately for that, given the fact that it's a citadel of the Trump Organization.

But the Trump Organization received an appraisal back in 2020 -- that same year that it was only worth $84.5 million. So, this again goes to the idea that Donald Trump's Organization or he, himself, puts out values to the public of how much these properties are worth that simply put, aren't in line with what most experts are finding. And in this particular case, what the Trump Organization actually received an appraisal of in that very same year.",

Also making an exit, Boeing's chairman and the head of the commercial airplane unit. CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean knows all about Boeing's troubles, but reporting on them over the last several weeks and months. He joins us now from Washington. I mean, this is quite a housecleaning at the most senior levels of Boeing. Two people --including people who were brought in to clean up the last mess. I just wondered, a direct result, and was it actually Calhoun's decision to leave himself?",

The only person to get the axe before this was the head of the 737 Max line, which many saw as sort of a scapegoat. Now, CEO Dave Calhoun is leaving the company along with Larry Kellner, the board chair, as well as Stan Deal, the head of Boeing Commercial airplanes. But as you note, Jim, Dave Calhoun became the CEO after the two 737 Max crashes of 2018 and 2019. 346 people killed. Nobody died in the January 5th, Alaska Airlines door plug blow up, but it exposed a huge quality control issue at Boeing. And Calhoun said this in his message to employees. \"As you all know, the Alaska Airlines flight 1282 accident was a watershed moment at Boeing. We must continue to respond to this accident with humility and complete transparency.\" There's some surprises in the aviation community that Calhoun is not leaving immediately, and his resignation doesn't take hold for another year, or until the end of the year rather. But Calhoun notes in that statement, there are these investigations taking place. Not only the NTSB investigation that found that Boeing workers did not reinstall the door plug bolts at the factory in Renton, Washington. But also, the FAA audit and Boeing quality control and the department of justice investigation to see if passengers on that flight may have been victims of a crime. The timing is so telling here. And just last week, Boeing reported a huge financial loss in the first quarter. Boeing has also lost the confidence of some of its major customers. Alaska Airlines, want's compensation from Boeing. United Airlines says its new plane orders are now in limbo. The saying in corporate America, the buck stops at the top. But in this case, it seems the money does do as well, Jim. It's really significant that this is happening now. Although, it's a little too -- little too late when you ask many in the aviation community.",

Still significant though, it did not veto all other members of the Security Council voted in favor. This comes after the Security Council failed to pass a resolution put forth by the U.S. on Friday. This new resolution was put forth by some of the non-permanent members of the council. The new text demands an immediate ceasefire leading to a permanent, sustainable ceasefire. It also demands \"the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and that all barriers are lifted to providing humanitarian assistance needed for Gaza. Those all the issues that had been brewing over this question for some weeks now. We should note, at least, 30 civilians were killed in a series of Israeli airstrikes. These strikes on residential buildings in Rafah on Sunday according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. Hamas says there are still a number of issues unresolved in a potential prisoner hostage exchange. It is accusing Israel of trying to apply pressure to the terrorist organization. To make it sign an agreement, Israel reportedly agreed to the number of Palestinian prisoners it would release in exchange for hostages to be released by Hamas, those that are currently held in Gaza, according to CNN analysts Barak Ravid. CNN's Paula Hancocks is back with us this hour from Doha, Qatar. And Paula, this is significant because there have been a number of resolutions going back really to the very start of this war series of them rejected vetoed by the U.S. one of the permanent members. The U.S. put forward its own proposal on Friday that was rejected by -- vetoed by China and Russia and two other non-permanent members this one gets through. And that U.S. abstention is significant here to allow it to pass. Tell us what this means going forward.",

This, has calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.It's also calling for the release of the hostages, and calling for instant access to humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza itself. Now, while may not be legally binding, it is certainly symbolic the fact that this has passed the U.N. Security Council with the U.S. abstaining. Of course, it's significant that they didn't veto. They are one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. If they had vetoed as they have, as you say a number of times in the past, then, this would not have passed. This is not the first attempt to get this kind of resolution through the Security Council. There have been a number of these resolutions. We did hear though from the Russian U.N. ambassador just on Friday after they vetoed the U.S.-lead proposal that this proposal would be coming up. And it has been worked on by some of the non-permanent members, it has been worked on for some time to try and push this resolution through. So, I mean, what it does is it shows the international community's feeling at the moment that there needs to be this immediate ceasefire. So, a significant move that this has gone through and, of course, a significant move that the U.S. did not veto in the past. The U.S. has been wanting a ceasefire to be very closely linked to releasing hostages from Gaza. It wanted to make sure that one was not exclusive from the other. And it appears that this resolution was acceptable to the U.S.-side. Jim?",

We heard from CNN analyst Barak Ravid, that would be 700, and there would be 100 of them being -- Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences. Now, we heard just 10 days ago from Hamas that they wanted between 700 and thousand. So, it's certainly within that range. But we're also hearing today from Hamas pushing back on suggestions that this is a significant step forward, saying that there are many other issues that need to be looked at as well. Saying, that they haven't had any kind of answer from Israel on some of the other questions it has. For example, this permanent ceasefire, which we know, at this point, Israel does not want because they still want to do this ground defensive, in Rafah. Hamas senior leaders also pointing out that they have not had an answer on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, or at least parts of Gaza when this deal goes through. Again, that is something we've heard publicly from Israel that they would resist, given the fact they do not consider that they have finished the job, in their words, when it comes to trying to defeat Hamas. And then also, the issue of allowing some of those displaced Palestinians from within Gaza to go back to their homes, or in many cases, what is left of their homes. So, this is almost a reality check from Hamas to show that there are many other issues at stake here. Yes, the Palestinian prisoners' issue is a significant one and not to take anything away from the fact that there may be progress on that one particular issue. (CROSSTALK)",
