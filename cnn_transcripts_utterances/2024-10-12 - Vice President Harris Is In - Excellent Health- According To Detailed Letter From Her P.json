Brand new polling out today in two battleground states and it is giving us a new snapshot of where this high stakes race stands as we enter this final sprint to Election Day. Today's New York Times/Siena College poll shows a bit of a tossup race in two key swing states. The new polling shows Kamala Harris with a slight lead in Pennsylvania while Donald Trump takes a similar size lead in Arizona. Both the candidates are on the campaign trail today traveling to battleground states on opposite sides of the country. Trump continues to campaign out west while Harris is traveling to battleground North Carolina today for an overnight stay. The Vice President also releasing her medical information just moments ago. Her doctor released a letter detailing the 59-year-old's medical history and a health report. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now from Washington. So Priscilla, what are we learning from this VP's medical information, this report, and what are her campaign plans for today?",

      "sentences": "Well Alex, this is the most detail that we have received so far about the Vice President and her medical records and it runs through what you would expect. It says, for example, that her routine blood work and April physical exam show no causes for alarm, this according to a doctor.Also notes, however, that she does have seasonal allergies and hives and is nearsighted. So learning a little more detail there, but generally, there is nothing that raises alarm according to this nearly two-page note from the doctor who also says the following. Let me quote for you here. It says, quote, \"She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those of chief executive, head of state, and commander-in- chief.\" Now, of course, Alex, the timing here notable. Harris advisers want to draw that stark contrast with former President Donald Trump particularly when comes to his age. Of course, the former president is 78 years old and age was a big concern when this election was the former President Donald Trump against President Joe Biden. So clearly here the Harris campaign as well as the Office of the Vice President demonstrating the Vice President's bill of health through these records. Now, the Vice President and her team also keenly aware that those polls are very tight as you outlined there and they are trying to make inroads in a variety of these battleground states including today when the Vice President heads to North Carolina. I've spoken to multiple advisers who tell me that they are trying to remain quite bullish on North Carolina. They see an opportunity in that state to potentially put that in the Vice President's column come November. So she is heading down there today. We're getting some details from the campaign as to what she'll be doing. She's going to stop at a local restaurant and rally but she is also according to the campaign going to work with local volunteers to prepare supplies for those who are still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Tomorrow, however, she'll have a rally and on Monday she'll be in Pennsylvania. Of course that polling that you referenced there at the top shows that she has a slight edge in Pennsylvania but still within the margin of error. So, this is the final stretch of the election, the Harris campaign clearly trying to gain ground where they can in these battlegrounds remain present in them, and over the course of all of that, put out these medical records in detail demonstrating that she has a clean bill of health.",

I mean, what I was trying to get at is that, look, I'm not talking about people who it just didn't work out, right, for medical reasons, for social reasons, like, set that to the side, we're not talking about folks like that.

We are in the River Ridge Reserve area just a little north of that.It's about a half a mile from the Alafia River where all of this water spilled out from and this is what still remains. I want you to see some of the scenes here, the damage. You see here the trees that have come down on this fence line that at one point was underwater for the most part. It has come down quite a bit in the last few hours that we've been here, but you can still also see how high it is up on the porch where those steps are there. And then even further down this street here, quite the scene as well that bus that is submerged. We saw that on a tour that we went in and I'll tell you a little bit about that in just a minute, but first I want to tell you what the sheriff has been saying to us today. He said that more than 300 out of the over 1,000 rescues across the state were done by his office. So his deputies, they've been sleeping at sheriff's facilities instead of going to their families in order to take care of this and to be here. Now also from nearly 1 million customers in this county without power, that's been cut more than in half. It's now down to 426,000. So significant improvement there. There's also been quite the issue with fuel, with getting gas. We saw on the way in here, Alex, a long lines at the gas pumps. The sheriff telling us that this was not a delivery or a supply problem, rather it was a dispensary problem that some of the equipment at the port got fried and that created quite a bit of issues there. Now, the fuel tankers, they are on the way to the hardest hit areas and they are being given police escorts in order to get there freely. So that is good news there. I do want to tell you more about the boat tour that we went on with the sheriff's office here in Hillsborough County earlier today and we -- it was quite the sight. You can see water up to street signs in some areas. A lot of vehicles submerged, a lot of yards that you could not see because of the water. Some livestock even at one point, we saw chickens and roosters on roof lines waiting for this water to subside. Now, the sheriff telling me, despite some improvements, some of the water coming down, despite those improvements with electricity, there is still concern. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

It is the first time that the Jewish state has been at war on its holiest day since 1973. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has made his way to the Iranian capital.

He was in Saudi Arabia. He was in Syria. He was in Lebanon and a couple of other countries as well. But the Iranians are now saying and they're sticking with their bold language that they are not trying to defuse this situation per se. They say that if there is an attack by Israel, that Iran will definitely retaliate. That's what we're hearing from a source here in Tehran with knowledge of the discussions that have been going on. The Iranians also saying that they informed not just regional countries about this, but the United States as well. Of course, these two countries do not have direct diplomatic relations, therefore, that would happen through intermediaries. It's unclear how an Iranian retaliation would look or what it would look like. However, one of the things that we have heard from the deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, of course, that the elite units of Iran's military, is that they say that if the Israelis attack Iranian energy infrastructure, like, for instance, oil and gas installations, of course, many of them are located in the Persian Gulf, some of them also in the border area between Iran and Iraq, that then the Iranians in the future might not just target military installations in Israel like they have in the past, but also energy installations in Israel as well.

And you're hearing this also for SBA, and this will be true of a lot of federal agencies.The immediate response, I -- I don't think people that are, that been impacted should think that they're -- they're not going to get immediate help. But when we start rebuilding, that's where the big dollar is going to come in. That's where programs like SBA are going to be critical for businesses to be able to get loans to help them start rebuilding and get open.",

At the time, your professor at Tulane University, you left your home in Houston for New Orleans to physically rescue people who were trapped by the flood waters and were part of a civilian rescue effort -- effort long before those federal troops arrived.

It startled you. It told you the power of Mother Nature. And it was awesome for a minute, and then you'd go out on the street and see all the debris. And then the -- the levees breached in the city of New Orleans is sort of like a saucer.The water just started pouring in, and all the surrounding areas of people think Hurricane Katrina was just a story of New Orleans and flooding and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. It hit such a deep region of the Gulf South that town after town had people stranded. And my most indelible memory is trying to see our -- our National Guard, and, you know, Coast Guard helicopters drop baskets and start rescuing people from roofs, but also seeing that the waters had swollen, there were people that had died just lying there in the water, dead, waiting to be recovered.",

For starters, when Hurricane Betsy hit New Orleans in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson went right into the belly of the storm, went at night in a boat with a flashlight on him and saying, I'm your president. I'm here.When I interviewed people in the Ninth Ward, lower ninth, there's a lot of collective memory how proud they were that Johnson came to them when they were in need. By contrast, George W. Bush in 2005 seem to be nonchalant about it, first at Crawford, Texas's Ranch, then went to San Diego, where he was doing a speech on the war in Iraq, didn't cancel it, started playing air guitar while people were dying and drowning. And meanwhile, the Michael Chertoff, the head of national Homeland Security, acted like was no big deal. Katrina continued going to an avian flu conference in Atlanta. But the big kicker was FEMA wasn't anywhere to be found, you know, there -- it was just a disaster. And it eventually culminates in that moment when the anger of the area comes out, when eventually Bush comes down there and wraps his arm around Michael Brown, the head of FEMA, and says, Brownie, you've done a heck of a job. And everybody just gasped, because FEMA had been AWOL for most of this long, torn out, you know, week of Katrina. One quick thing, because we're going to see with both of the more recent hurricanes, that it's -- a hurricane isn't a day, it is in a week. It goes on up for a year and years when you have to deal -- deal with rebuilding.",
