The Hollywood actor soon to be cleared of an advance of involuntary manslaughter charge after that gunshot on a movie set killed his colleague. But is Baldwin legally cleared for good? And a father and daughter both shot after the six-year-old's basketball rolled into a neighbor's yard. Another case of tragedy after a child's innocent mistake. Her grandmother will join me this hour. Plus, incredible sight as the most powerful unmanned rocket ever made explodes midair. Why Elon Musk's SpaceX says it triggered the fiery scene on purpose. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. We start with big breaking news in our pop culture lead. Prosecutors say they plan to dismiss charges against actor Alec Baldwin after that prop gun he was holding fired doing during movie rehearsals and killed the cinematographer of his film. That update is, according to Baldwin's attorney who says that his attorneys are now pushing for a, quote, proper investigation into what exactly went wrong on the set of the film \"Rust\" in October 2021. Let's get straight to CNN's Chloe Melas. Chloe, what led to this decision?",

We know that a month ago after a court filing by Alec's attorney Luke Nikas that the special prosecutor due to a conflict of interest for holding also a job in the House of Representatives due to New Mexico's state law, you're not supposed to do both jobs. She stepped aside and the D.A. recused herself. So that sort of was the first red herring so to speak.And then you know before that, Jake, I want to point out that the charges were downgraded so the fire enhancement charge was removed, which meant that Alec Baldwin could only face up to 18 months in prison if convicted of one of those manslaughter charges, but I just want to read you. The full statement from Alec Baldwin's attorneys Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, who just spoke to me moments ago, saying, we are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.

Moments after the D.A. announced the charges in this case, our colleague Josh Campbell interviewed her, and she was utterly unable to articulate a coherent theory of the case. Josh asked her whether she knew where those live rounds came from. She said, no. I don't know how you charge a case like this without knowing that Josh Campbell asked the D.A., are you charging Alec Baldwin in his capacity as the producer or as an actor? And she said both, which is two completely different theories.And on top of that, Jake, as Chloe just alluded to, this case was wildly overcharged that the most serious charges brought against Alec Baldwin initially was a firearms charge. That was not on the books at the time of this incident. You cannot do that. They had to dismiss that charge.

Apocalyptic scenes in Sudan were fighting between rival armed forces continues to rage, and there is a new plan from the Pentagon to try to get some Americans out. More than 300 people are dead in this war, and 3,000 are injured after six days of fierce fighting. That's according to the World Health Organization. Today, we saw smoke rising from the capital amid broken ceasefires between the Sudanese army and the forces it is fighting, the Rapid Support Forces, Rapid Support Forces. That's a paramilitary group that once was aligned with Sudan's army in the early 2000s until there was a coup and that ultimately forced these two rival leaders to share power. But that deal fell apart. And now many civilians in Khartoum, including Americans are pinned down. They're stuck. They're forced to shelter in place as firefights rage throughout urban areas. Those who have tried to get out tell CNN, quote: We saw corpses in the street. And as Pentagon officials take this all in, they have announced that they are positioning American troops closer to the border with Sudan. They are getting ready to immediately evacuate U.S. embassy personnel and their families if necessary. CNN's Kylie Atwood is standing by at the State Department, but let's start with Oren Liebermann, who's at the Pentagon for us right now. Oren, what kind of U.S. military presence is moving in and how close to the action?",

And that would include securing the embassy and evacuating embassy personnel.Now, DOD won't say what those forces are or where they're located. But a U.S. defense official has said there are hundreds of marines at this point at Kent Lemonier in Djibouti, and that's still about 700 miles or so from Khartoum. But that is one of the places the U.S. Has forces ready to go. And that includes an aviation element that is aircraft that can bring in forces, move in ground troops that would be used if needed to secure an embassy and evacuate embassy personnel. At the moment, according to DOD data, the Defense Department only has about 13, or 14 troops based in Sudan. Most of those marines for embassy security, clearly not enough given the situation we're seeing now. So, DOD has forces in Djibouti, perhaps elsewhere, as well, waiting for the situation to allow itself to go in and waiting for that call that it's needed and that the decision has been made to send troops in with that aviation element, if needed to secure the embassy and bring those out. So, Jake, we'll keep you updated on how that situation goes. And if the USA adds more forces in the region as needed, or wait to see how the situation develops at this point.",

Obviously, there's one in place right now, but it is not being respected.It's a very, very violent place to be right now. And so, they're watching for that. They're watching for a ceasefire so they could actually carry out this potential evacuation. And then the other thing to consider is that there are about 16,000 Americans who are in the country right now. A lot of those are dual citizens and aren't going to try and leave the country. But, of course, some of them might and this is a unique situation, of course, because the main airport in the country's closed one of the borders, the Chad-Sudan border is also closed. And so I asked the State Department deputy spokesperson if they would consider standing up any kind of support for those Americans if they want to get out of country, he said that they are planning for all contingencies, wouldn't say specifically, that was one that was on the table.

There were brief moments where many of those we were speaking to on the ground say that they risked the bullets outside and being caught in the mortar strikes to try and get to whatever local stores were open and resupply, but even that is becoming too dangerous.And while that's playing out, there is a growing body of evidence, Jake, that we have uncovered that those who are seeking to opportunistically further entrench themselves in the region, Russia's paramilitary proxy group Wagner have begun to try and influence one of the parties, they -- we believe from the evidence that we've seen are resupplying have been resupplying the Rapid Support Force paramilitary group. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELBAGIR (voice-over):  The Sudanese and the Libyan Army celebrated a successful joint operation Wednesday, April 19th, near the remote desert border between Libya and Sudan, having captured the Chevrolet Garrison belonging to the rival Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF. But why is this garrison important, given how far it is from the existential fight in Sudan's capital Khartoum? Because CNN can reveal that the fight in Khartoum is being influenced by what was happening at that garrison, a Russian resupply campaign backed by a key regional player aimed at turning the tide in Sudan's war in favor of the RSF, who have been a key recipient of Russian training and military aid. In collaboration with all eyes on Wagner, a research group focusing on Russian proxy Wagner, CNN investigated the group's current presence in Libya. You can see here on April 16th one day after the fighting began in Khartoum, a Russian Ilyushin 76 transport plane at the al-Jufra base in Libya, previously identified by American intelligence as a Wagner base. Three days later, this same plane is spotted by flight tracker aviation expert Gerjon coming back from the Russian airbase in Latakia, Syria, before returning to the Libyan air base in Khadim. Images of that same plane began circulating online April 17th heading in the direction of Sudan. Sudanese and regional sources tell CNN that weaponry was air-dropped to the RSF within that timeframe, April 15th to April 18th, to the Chevrolet Garrison during a period of fierce fighting, boosting the RSF. The al-Khadim and al-Jufra bases where the Wagner planes departed from in Libya are under the control of field marshal Khalifa Haftar, who commands territory in the east of Libya. Haftar and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, aka Hemitte, have in common strategic alliances, one with Wagner, who Haftar is hosting in his territory in Libya and whom a previous CNN investigation exposed as working with Hemitte to extract Sudanese gold, a second with the United Arab Emirates, who tapped Hemitte to send forces to the conflict in Yemen and backed Haftar in the fighting in Libya. What does it all mean for the ongoing misery and conflict in Sudan? It means that both a regional Libyan General Haftar and a global player, Russia, putting their thumbs on the scale, which raises the stakes for the region, for the global balance of power and for the people of Sudan caught in the crossfire. (END VIDEOTAPE) ELBAGIR (on camera):  We reached out to both Haftar and Wagner and didn't receive a response to our request for comment, and RSF spokesperson denied that they were currently receiving support from Libya or Russia, although they had previously denied when our investigation exposed their relationship with Wagner, that there was a relationship, so at least this time, they've admitted that they had a previous relationship for what that's worth, Jake.",
