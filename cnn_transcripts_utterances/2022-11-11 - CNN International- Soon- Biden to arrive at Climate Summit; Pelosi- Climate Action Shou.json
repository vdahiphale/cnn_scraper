We have the report newly liberated town.Plus, the U.S. President set to touchdown at a crucial climate summit this hour. But it's a meeting with a Chinese President next week that has everyone talking and Twitter's Titanic moments. We'll take a closer look at what Elon Musk's plans are for the social media giants. Ukrainian troops are closing in on Kherson entering the western edge of the key city as Russia sounds a note of caution. The Kremlin says the Kherson region remains part of Russia, even as its Defense Ministry says Russian forces have completed their withdrawal from Kherson City as well as areas west of the Dnipro River. Social media shows residents have raised the Ukrainian flag and ripped down Russian propaganda billboards in a town on the outskirts of Kherson city. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops are receiving a hero's welcome as they liberate dozens of towns. Since Russia analysis pulls out on Wednesday, Ukraine accuses Russia of leaving behind mines and destroying infrastructure on its way out. CNN's Nic Robertson and his crew made it to a Ukrainian town liberated from Russian troops over the past 48 hours. And he shows us what they found in Snihurivka on the Southeastern part of Ukraine.",

The Russians left two days before as you drive into the town here, everyone's waving. Everyone's happy people talk to here has horror stories to tell about their treatment by the Russians, particularly over the last few days.I give you an idea of what you're seeing behind me. You see a couple of young teenagers here with Ukrainian flags on their shoulders. They were the first to raise the flag when the Russians left even before the troops arrived so sort of pre liberation by teenagers here. And they tell us that a month ago somebody had been shot here, shot and killed for raising a Ukrainian flag. And in the middle of the crowd here, everyone's gathered; we're sort of in the center of the town outside the administrative buildings here. That's the Regional Governor, he's just visiting here. He's just arrived in the last few minutes is explaining to people how they're going to get support from the Ukrainian government in the coming days, that they're going to be bringing humanitarian aid, supplies and support into the town here. The situation for people here is really difficult. There's no electricity, there's no gas. So they've had a very difficult time just in terms of surviving under the Russians. But what's happened in this town over the past few days as the Russians and past couple of weeks, as the Russians knew that they were going to pull out there was widespread looting vehicles looted. We've been to the bank here; it's completely ransacked and looted. The police station here was told was used as a base of torture that people would be taken in here and tortured. And if they want to extract more information, and they would take them there 45 kilometers on to Kherson I spoke to a young girl here and I'm telling you a lot of things here because everybody wants to talk everyone you speak to at the roadside here, wants to talk. This young lady 15 year's old, she told me her mother confirmed her story, that in the past over the last few days, or the Russians being here, she was taken away kidnapped to hurt put over her head. She told her she was afraid of being raped. She was only released yesterday. This is a town that is only just now getting to grips with the idea of liberation of what it means to be free of what it means not to have Russian rule here. And I think people are in all of it. We've seen people on the streets, meeting friends they haven't seen for a long time hugging each other in tears. But I think also there's a sense of OK, what's going to happen now.",

And that's very important for the U.S. President, because prior to the inflation Reduction Act, which House Speaker Pelosi was referring to the American government didn't necessarily have the best story to tell.At least now they can say domestically, there are congressional acts in place that will reduce emissions by what is historically the world's largest emitter. And it's important to note that Xi Jinping is not here, Vladimir Putin is not here, and Narendra Modi is not here. But Biden is coming. And it shows that the American government, at least from their perspective, wants to show that there's leadership. But the message might not be 100 percent accepted, just because it seems like many people here based on my discussions this week have moved on a little bit. Yes, there is, if not excitement, there is recognition the U.S. is reducing its emissions. But there is a call for rich countries, especially the U.S. and the European Union to help poorer countries and vulnerable nations finance the worst impacts of the climate crisis. And while that has officially been put on the list of topics of discussion that don't expect U.S. government or other rich nations to come up with concrete plans to give the trillions of dollars that is needed for what some are calling climate reparations. But what is rarely money to help stave off the worst crisis of today and tomorrow. We will see what Biden has to say in his speech in the coming hours. But I do think that issue will be the key issue in the coming months and years ahead, Max.",

      "sentences": "Exactly Max, incredibly high stakes you have the leaders of the two largest economies global peace hinges on the relationship between these countries. But the expectations out of this meeting are low. The U.S. side has said they just want to build a floor under the relationship so that it doesn't tip over into conflict here.We are expecting there to be multiple topics up for discussion, including tensions over Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, as well as concerns over human rights abuses in China. Also potential discussions for areas of cooperation like over North Korea and climate change. But there are just too many fundamental differences between these two countries for any one face to face meeting to even begin to address all of these challenges. We know that fundamentally, Beijing is increasingly seeing Washington's moves as trying to contain and suppress its rise. They would point to the recent sweeping new restrictions from Washington that chokes off China's access to critical semiconductor chips. Whereas Washington is also seeing Beijing more skeptically, they are labeling China as the most consequential long term national strategic challenge for the United States. We know that Taiwan is going to be a key priority for discussion, because this is the area where there's the highest risk of miscalculation that could turn into actual conflict. The other dynamics that could play into this are the current political positions of both leaders back at home of course, the midterms hanging in the balance for President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, Chinese Leader Xi Jinping is walking into this meeting more powerful than ever. He has recently re anointed for an unprecedented third term. He has stack all of the top leadership positions with his closest allies and proteges. We know that these two men Biden and Xi do have a long history. They spent a lot of time together before Joe Biden became President. But is that enough to cause any significant easing of tensions? Well, Max, the expectation is it will not.",

In two States, Nevada and Arizona there are still hundreds of thousands of ballots to count in races still too close to call. CNN's Josh Campbell joins us from Phoenix, Arizona. And Josh, one of the counties that they still want lots of outstanding ballots when to expect to hear the result. JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENTIt's the U.S. Senate race here and the governor's race. And these margins are very, very narrow. We're talking about on the Senate side, just about 115,000 votes separate the Republican and the Democrat on the governor's race is much, much closer, we're looking at about 27,000 votes. Here in Maricopa County, there are still about 350,000 votes that are yet to be counted. And that is because 290,000 of those votes were voters who had ballots that were mailed to them. Here in the U.S., you can do in certain States with cold vote by mail. They send you a ballot ahead of time you mark it you mail it in as long as it's in by election-day. It counts but for some reason voters here in Phoenix decided to take those mail in ballots and deliver them in person which is really caused this backlog here in Maricopa County. And so we're just waiting to see we've seen a lot of the candidates coming out expressing optimism. They think they will come out ahead we'll of course have to wait and see what the results are. Finally, it's worth noting that this election has also been plagued by Conspiracy theories, particularly the Republican candidate for governor here in Arizona is accusing election officials who are behind me counting the votes, accusing them of slow walking and slow rolling the vote for political reasons saying that is intended to help Democrats. Of course, it's worth pointing out that the head of elections here in this county is a Republican. He came out and blasting the Republican candidate, his own party's candidate saying that her comments was inappropriate defending his workers. And of course, we'll have to wait and see how long this process actually takes place. Of course, all eyes on the U.S. state of Arizona because of how this could impact the balance of power in Washington, Max.",

      "sentences": "Rapid movement and very important movement. We've said many, many times throughout this wall and throughout the last few days, of course, that Kherson is a vitally important city and an area for both Russia and Ukraine. It is the first major and the only major regional capital that Russia was able to seize and occupy since its invasion on February 24.So the fact of the matter is, as you've just reported in the CNN has confirmed soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have moved into the Western part of the city itself, which is very important. They've been ripping down some Russian billboards; they put up a Ukrainian flag. But as ever, there is what's known as the fog of war, the Kremlin is still insisting that the Kherson region remains a vital part of Russia. What does that mean on the ground we will see in the next few days, is this counter offensive and counter attack proceeds? Here in Ukraine, we don't have actual full-full confirmation of the minute by minute progress that the troops seem to be making. And we'll get that as soon as we possibly can. But you've seen from the visuals, that the Russians have blown up key bridges as they've retreated, that we spoke to the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a couple of days ago. He did not want to tell me for obvious reasons. The battle plan, but just said, you and your viewers and all countries that are supporting us should know that we have a plan and a strategy for Kherson to liberate or territory. That's what he said to me. So again, this was an anticipated counter-offensive, it's going somewhat faster than Ukrainians led us, or thought it might. And we'll see how it plays out, because the fact of the matter is that Russians remain dug in on that bank that's closer to the East, closer to the Russian border. They might have evacuated the city, but they remained again in the region and the region is also vitally important. But this is a huge step and we wait to hear details from this side, Max.",

And, you know, Ukraine is not out of the woods yet, because even last night, there was a missile attack reported by the Ukrainians on an energy plant.And that, again, has messed up there, you know, efforts to remake and rebuild the energy infrastructure in the grid. So again, there's rolling blackouts and energy and electricity shortages. So that part of the threat, you know, has not gone but more air defenses will help. They have got many military Analysts believe that the Ukrainians do have the momentum when it comes to artillery, now. They can reach the Russian forces and, and even, you know, behind the lines, I'm not talking about going into Russia itself. But they can project a lot more than they were able to do before. But of course, if you look at the City of Kherson, and if they really have left the Russians they still have, you know, shooting capacity and artillery capacity. So the Ukrainians moving in behind them are going to have to watch out for that as well. You know, it could become another front line, where both sides start shooting against each other. We'll wait to see how this plays out. But every move that Ukraine make south and east is another piece of liberated territory. And the President said they are going to go to the end. There's no question of surrender. There is no question of being forced into negotiations. There is no question of giving up any time at all he said.",
