He argued to his members that they would not push forward on their preferred plans to try to secure the border with Mexico if there was a shutdown, that was his warning to his member. He even said that he's not a -- you don't make your best decisions when you are emotional. That's what he said, according to sources in the room.And he also indicated that there was not support for the Senate proposal that would fund the government until mid-September. The bipartisan deal cut by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, would -- in addition to keeping the government open, but also would provide $6 billion in aid to Ukraine, $6 billion in disaster relief. That aid to Ukraine a major flash point among House Republicans that McCarthy indicating that he would not take that plan up. So, where does that leave things? Very uncertain. And the outgrowing expectation that a shutdown could happen. McCarthy though is still trying to get a vote on Friday on his plan which would cut spending but also would provide -- include some of those border security measures. But in talking to some of those conservative hardliners, they are making clear that even if McCarthy go forward on a plan to try to win them over to keep the government open, they will still vote against it.

Heuermann was -- has pleaded not guilty to the deaths of three women more than a decade ago. I want to bring in Trial Attorney Misty Marris for your expertise. You just read what happened in court.

That's what's called mitochondrial DNA. It's a mix of forensics and family tracing. This is direct DNA called nuclear DNA.So, the reason that that buccal swab happens, it either confirms that it's a match or it exonerates somebody because it doesn't match.

The defense pokes the holes, and so that's the way it happens.

Prosecutors have said all of those should be returned to Nassau County, which is his county of residence to assess whether or not any of those guns were obtained illegally.

About 15 percent of the U.S. population of adults has diabetes. 40 percent has obesity.That 1.7 percent though, that's still millions of patients. And these data further show that there are some disparities and who is actually getting access to these medicines. We know that supply is constrained and insurance can be a problem. 70 percent of prescriptions in 2023 went to white patients, even though we know that obesity and diabetes disproportionately affects people of color more so than white patients. And you know, I was talking with a cardiologist at Yale, Dr. Harlan Krumholz, about this.

Now. that could be explained by some problems with insurance reimbursement for Wegovy.
