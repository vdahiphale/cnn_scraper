We'll talk a lot more about it. But First Republic is now the third major bank to fail since March. The announcement came just hours before markets open. We're keeping a close eye on Wall Street to see how it reacts when the markets open. Our business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich, outside the First Republic Bank here in New York City.

And they have arrived in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. The U.S. government launched two convoys to get some of those stranded citizens out of the country. \"The New York Times\" reports that armed American drones flew overhead and guarded the buses as they made that 525-mile journey to the Red Sea. Our CNN international correspondent Larry Madowo is at the seaport in Jeddah where those Americans -- we see them behind you, Larry. They're being processed right now. And you actually traveled with them on this journey. What can you tell us?",
