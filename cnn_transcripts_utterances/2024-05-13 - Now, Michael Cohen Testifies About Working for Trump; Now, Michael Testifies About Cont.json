He testified to Congress that he made it estimated 500 threats on Donald Trump's behalf. When Trump was running for re-election, Michael Cohen reached out to his high school to the colleges that he went to and threatened them with legal action if they somehow released Donald Trump's grades to the public. I mean, he went to those kinds of lengths. He wasn't doing like actual legal work for Donald Trump. He was basically threatening people with legal action on his behalf. And Michael Cohen is saying, if reporting angered Trump that he would either express their need to redact or take the article down, or we would file an action against them. I mean, he went after schools, media outlets, anyone who would say anything damaging about Donald Trump.",

One of the things I think is the most interesting of all of this is going back to that line where he said he would feel like he was on top of the world just for that small pat on the back. And he was willing to do anything for the former president. As you've noted, the idea that he's putting out there that he might have done all of these terrible things, he has to do that.Remember what we've heard from some of these other witnesses, essentially, at one point, one witness saying that Michael Cohen was sad he might not get his Christmas bonus. At one point, another witness saying, they told Mr. Trump, Michael Cohen would do anything for you, he cares about you so much. They're going to have to paint out exactly who Michael Cohen is because of what we have heard over and over again from these various witnesses. But the other part of this that I want to point out, you know, we talk a lot about Donald Trump's relationship with Todd Blanche, with his legal team now. When you talk about what Michael Cohen was doing, that's the kind of stuff that Donald Trump believes that an attorney should be doing. Even though it wasn't legal action, even though it wasn't in court necessarily, he believes that they should be out there, aggressive, you know, strong-arming people. That is not exactly the kind of attorneys he has now. He has court attorneys, people who are going to follow the law, go through these questions, they've had this practice before. They're not the Michael Cohens of the world. But that is who Donald Trump wants by his side, this kind of rabid bulldog. So, what we're seeing now is what exactly this relationship looked like, and just how close they really were, Anderson.",

Rhona Graff has testified.But to your point, Kaitlan, he is experienced on the witness stand. He has gone through a lot of this before. COLLINS:  Right. And it is completely fair to raise questions on his credibility, how he'll do under cross examination. We don't know. Michael Cohen certainly has had no shortage of things to say about Donald Trump over the last several years, and he just is experienced in this. I mean, he went up against Trump's allies.

We can see where that's going to come into play with Stormy Daniels later.Second of all, Michael Cohen exists outside the formal structures of Trump world. When he started, he wasn't formally with the Trump Organization. Later with the campaign, you all know, he wasn't technically with the campaign. And in the White House, he was never technically with the White House, yet there he is, always sort of circulating around doing Donald Trump's bidding. Third, the prosecutors have begun to, as we say, pull the sting, to front the fact that, yes, when you're with Donald Trump, you lied, you bullied, that all has to come out on direct examination before the defense lawyers get to it on cross.

So it's a real balancing test about credibility.I will tell you being here, I was inside the court courthouse, not the courtroom, but the whole building, I know this sounds like a little bit of an exaggeration, but it's really a buzz. It's really like you could feel it from the court officers, the clerks who I know because they know that today is the day. I mean, what we discussed last week was up until today, if the prosecutor should have rested, the case would have to be dismissed before it even went to the jury. Michael Cohen is what ties Trump to the bookkeeping and to the bookkeeping in light for a furtherance of a crime. I don't know what else is going around here except a block away is the Menendez trial. So, there's a lot of activity here in Lower Manhattan here, Anderson.",

One of the words was legal. Cohen has got to be able to say that there was some conversation, there was some connection that Trump knew about that and knew how it was going to be listed and that they were doing it for the election. So, they were doing it to violate state election laws, federal election laws, or some sort of tax laws. So, he's vital. I mean, I'm reading the testimony that's coming out so far. I think as a prosecutor, I would have led a little bit more about his criminal past. They did not do that, but they have to do that. They have to take as much air out of the balloon. So, when defense comes out there to cross-examine him about his criminal history, about his time in prison, that it's not as much of a big deal. I mean, I'm sure Susan Hoffinger will do that before she is seated either today or tomorrow.",

And, you know, they're going to try to catch him in as many lies as possible.And the judge at the end of the case, after the summation, but before the jury goes to deliberate, he's going to instruct the jury that, if you find a witness is lying about something, a material fact, you could discount all of their testimonies. I mean, you could piece it apart as well, but you could say, you know what, jurors are allowed to do this. The judge is going to tell them they're allowed to do this. Stormy Daniels lied about this. I think she lied about everything. Michael Cohen lied about this at this trial. I think he lied about everything.

I mean, it speaks to Trump's involvement in knowing what was going to be coming, what he anticipated and what he wanted Michael Cohen to do about it. I think that's really important testimony for the jury to hear in the sense of what's coming and the fact that Trump anticipated this, what it looks like when it actually happened and what Michael Cohen carried out.And so this is the meeting, obviously, just to remind everyone, because it was 16 days ago in this trial that David Pecker testified about this, where he essentially said that Trump and Michael Cohen sought him out to ask him how he could help them with the campaign. Initially, it had been reported the other way around, that Pecker was seeking to see how he could help. Pecker testified that they sought him out and asked what he could do with his platform of the National Enquirer and largely AMI in order to help their campaign. And that's what Michael Cohen is saying, that they discussed the power of that in the terms of where it was located, how many people saw it, the eyeballs that it got. Also, the National Enquirer was something that registered high in Trump's mind because, of course, his brain is often kind of -- his mindset has been stuck in the 1980s in the sense of what he values, covers, headlines, and what that looks like, and how important he believes that.",
