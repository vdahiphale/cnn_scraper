And that was seen at the time, as something that was very remarkably -- a remarkably political statement, from one of these justices. But they literally sit at the very heart of the election that Joe Biden -- President Biden is up there, tonight, fighting for, in a way that they have not been, certainly since 2000, in Bush versus Gore, and possibly ever, in terms of having to decide whether or not President Biden's opponent is going to be able to be charged in the, you know, for basically sending a mob, to this very building, on January 6th, 2021.",

They do not think that that is going to be what this is going to turn on. And there are a lot of people, out there, talking about how -- it isobviously important for democracy, for the country. But they understand that the prospects of these cases, being concluded before the election, not great. The prospect of them being definitive, and going in any particular way, and moving voters, in any particular way, is too uncertain. What they do know, though, and I think to Jake's earlier point, they're not wrong, when they say that voters have been voting, in a way, that sometimes differs from what they say to pollsters, about how happy or unhappy they are, about Joe Biden, or even the direction of the country.
