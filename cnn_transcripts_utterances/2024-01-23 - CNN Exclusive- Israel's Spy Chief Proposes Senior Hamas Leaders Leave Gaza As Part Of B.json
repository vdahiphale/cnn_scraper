Israel spy chief is proposing that Hamas senior leaders could leave Gaza as part of a broader ceasefire agreement. That is according to two officials familiar with the ongoing discussions. They tell CNN that although the deal would offer safe passage out of Gaza for some of the architects of the October 7th attack, the militants grip on the enclave could weaken once they are gone. The suggestion has been discussed as part of broader ceasefire negotiations, at least twice in recent weeks. It's not clear who would be included in that deal. But there is no bigger target than top Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar. And let's go to journalist Elliott Gotkine now, following developments live from London. Good morning to you, Elliott. So, what more do we know about the IDF soldiers who died on Monday?",

But as you say, 21 soldiers, by far, the deadliest incident for Israeli troops since this war began on October the seventh in the wake of those Hamas massacres.And what we know from the IDF's chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, is that an RPG, a rocket propelled grenade was fired towards its forces who were inside a couple of buildings in the central part of the Gaza Strip. And that, at the same time -- this is around 4:00 p.m. on Monday, local time. At the same time, explosions were triggered inside those buildings, causing them to collapse on the troops in and around them. And the working assumption of the IDF is that the explosions triggered in this building were from mines that the IDF itself had laid to destroy those two-story buildings and the infrastructure around it in order to make it easier for communities inside of Israel, the other side of the border, some 600 meters away to return to their homes. Now, they've informed the families and they've named the names publicly of 10 of those soldiers who have died. And they are going to be releasing further details in due course. And that brings the total number of IDF troops killed since the war began on October the seventh to more than 200. Rosemary?",

Look, I think things are at approaching an inflection point in terms of the sorts of issues your report just highlighted the lack of ammunition, or Ukrainian forces, the concerns over the western military support drying up in the course of this year due to political infighting in the U.S. and also lack of support in Europe. So, I think Ukrainians are really starting to face a difficult situation. If that support doesn't keep going then, the Ukrainians will be very hard pressed to defend against Russian offensives going into 2025. So, what the Ukrainians can do, I think, is strike at long range targets. And that oil depo, I think was a classic example of that, that they are having to conserve ammunition.

So, from Putin's perspective, he is playing the long game in terms of outlasting Western resolve, such that when, or if that Western military assistance dries up, particularly, for example, if Donald Trump were to win in November of this year, and become president, then, Putin's Russia is well placed them to go on the offensive in 2025, and turn the tide of the war.",

They have to prioritize their firepower in terms of the missions they use that for, and they have to identify targets that are going to have the greatest effect on Russia's ability to sustain operations throughout this year. But I think the real test comes late this year going into next year. If that Western military support is not there, then, we could see Russia turn the tide of the war.

Today is day one, a day after the concentration that was presided over by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some of them have managed to go in, but a huge significant amount of people are still waiting. The gates have been closed till about 2Now, we did speak to some officials over the last few months about what they are anticipating in terms of the response by the general public to the opening of the temple, and one of the officials who has been very closely monitoring the developments here had to say that they expected about 100,000 people per day, Rosemary, which means according to him, that an individual, when he or she enters the inner sanctorum, will not get more than 20 seconds inside.

And now, when they see the celebrations on the roads, it just brings back memories of 1992 that you spoke off in detail. Now, wherever you walk, in the alley ways, on the main roads of Ayodhya, you will see a billboard of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi every ten meters, and I am not exaggerating here. And that in itself does indicate how Narendra Modi and the government are getting ready for a third running term as the government here. They are seeking another term in the general election, which is due in May this year. And with Modi presiding over that religious ceremony, which a lot of critics have also gone ahead and expressed concern over, because the word secular is a part of the Indian Constitution.

So, I think that's one observation. The other one is, when you just look at the ways in which these political parties have not just moved into parliament, but actually into governance over recent years and you can see the ways in which the appeal of these platforms are working. You see Hungary, you see Italy. We saw in the Netherlands, Wilders' party come out ahead and now work towards forging a coalition.And I think one of the most interesting examples is the case of France, where in 2017 and 2022, Emmanuel Macron in the runoff stages against the far-right Marine Le Pen argued that it was absolutely imperative to put up a front and to block her. And at the end of 2023, in order to pass harsher immigration legislation, essentially kind of flirting with this political party, is an indication that he is also moving away from those particular issues and rather than coming up with alternative plans, essentially taking far-right political agendas and mainstreaming them as a way to try to secure popularity and demonstrate as a real response to the fear and concern that they have of the sort of prominence that these parties are gaining now, Rosemary.",

It's either political parties that are opposing these harsher measures and therefore, not devoting adequate number -- time to their own sort of new projects and plans. But I think what we saw in the German context over this weekend, it's not just outcry and outrage at the AfD's platforms, but it's some of the sort of very sinister policies that they're talking about. I mean, deporting German citizens that in their estimation do not demonstrate to the adequate integration. These are sort of concerns and I think that those demonstrations show the extent to which this is polarizing in Europe.And now, not everybody shares the ideas of these political -- these political parties. The question is, how does one go about combating this sort of scare and fear mongering, which are very powerful kind of politics of emotions that detract from the real issues at stake. And that's what many governance and many political parties have as yet not come up with solutions, to be able to combat these agendas, but rather working with them.",
