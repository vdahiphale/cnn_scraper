The - according to the city of El Paso, about 2,300 migrants are living on the streets of El Paso right now, about 1,800 here in the location that I am right now. According to city officials, they are expecting to open shelters in the coming week. They're expected to prepare to use other city resources. And a lot of those moneys are FEMA dollars. Now, that is going to impact the scene out here for the following reason, FEMA dollars can only be used, according to the city of El Paso, to help immigrants who have done the right thing, turn themselves into authorities and been processed by U.S. immigration authorities. A lot of the individuals that you see here, though, decided to enter the country illegally. It's what you were talking about exactly, Jessica, that misinformation used by smugglers that then lures immigrants into entering the country illegally. Now, why? Why is that? There are 10s of thousands of migrants. So what you see here is also replicated in northern Mexican cities, 10s of thousands of migrants waiting for the lifting of Title 42. Some of those individuals have grown very impatient. And so they do believe the lies from smugglers, Jessica, and have decided to enter the country.

They are looking at every possible option. Some of the ideas that are being considered include putting tents in places like Central Park, Orchard Beach, Coney Island Beach, the parking lot of Citi Field where the Mets play. So it really shows you how much of a crisis the city is anticipating. Now, none of these plans are finalized. However, the city tells me they are already running out of room.

This jobs report has forced investors to take those bets away. But listen, markets are ending what was a very nervous and turbulent week on a decidedly positive note here, Jim.

But what this looks like, Jim, this looks like what happened in Kherson when the Ukrainians were about to go on their offensive there and take back that territory. The Russians started loading people on buses and shipping some of them out of the country. We saw it in Mariupol as well when they took control there last summer and there they shipped many children, thousands of children, thousands of Ukrainians are off to Russia, didn't give them an opportunity to go back to Ukraine.

So listen, what's happening here is the U.S. Supreme Court said in an 8-0 decision that it wants to take a look at those two filings that Glossip's attorneys, with the support of the Oklahoma Attorney General, a Republican, said that there is enough evidence to prove that he at least deserves a new trial. So those two filings went before the Supreme Court and they said they want to stop this execution until they can take a look at those filings. And that's what's happening here. Now, this goes back - we've been covering this for quite a while and this goes back ways where his attorneys were essentially saying there's a lot of new evidence in this case that casts a ton of doubt about whether or not he should receive the death penalty for what he was convicted of. And the criminal court of appeals in Oklahoma denied those and that's why his attorneys went to the Supreme Court. I want to give you a reaction from his attorney, who in a statement said, \"There is nothing more harrowing than the thought of executing a man who the state now admits has never received a fair trial. Thankfully, for the time being, Mr. Glossip is out of peril. Our hope is that court will reverse the decision of the OCCA,\" the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals, \"and vacate Mr. Glossip's conviction once and for all.\" I just want to tell you, Jim, also, I spoke to Rich yesterday and we were talking about how he was planning his burials.
