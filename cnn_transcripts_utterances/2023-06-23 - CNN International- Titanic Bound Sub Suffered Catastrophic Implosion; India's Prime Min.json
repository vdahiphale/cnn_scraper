Modi was asked about this at the White House. He pushed back on the notion that India is no longer a democratic country, amid concerns of his heavy-handed approach that his critics say has essentially caused the country to backslide on some of the democratic ideals.

This is \"The Times of Indian,\" and it says the sky is not the limit says Modi as India U.S. ties go to the moon and beyond. And that's because of some of the deals that have been signed between the U.S. and India.Now the \"Hindustan Times\" talks about a new dawn for India-U.S. ties. And right to the side you can also see a reference to the questions that were asked to Modi in a very, very rare moment there where the Indian Prime Minister was asked a question on the growing concerns over human rights in India. And his response was exactly, no democracy if there is no human rights. So, that was a top headline internationally as well, Max, because like I said, it's very rare to have the Indian Prime Minister respond to the media. In the last nine years that he's been Prime Minister in India, we hardly heard him or seen him at the news conference or speak to the media. So, he did take those questions and clearly, he was a bit out of his comfort zone there as well. It was a trade-off. Meanwhile, for the U.S. President Joe Biden, we did hear from the White House, previously before his visit that he will be lecturing India on human rights concerns. But the president would be talking about it both privately and publicly. He will be addressing how democracy is important to both nations, which he did. But for me, what stood out also was the geopolitical equations really playing out here. When you had Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the Congress, these two sentences really stood out to me and I will tell you why after we hear Modi speak. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is exactly what Joe Biden really wants, to draw India into a closer, Max. He knows India is the counter weight to China in Asia and that's why this relationship needs to be so strong and so robust. But also, Modi is aware that Russia has been a traditional partner, alongtime ally perhaps -- for there weren't for a better word here -- and that's what the fine balance really is for India. To maintain both these relationships without one getting in the way of the other. China, of course, being a huge issue for India. And remember India is the only country in the recent past that's militarily confronted China at the line of actual control. So the effort here from Joe Biden will be to draw India as close as possible in the coming years. Back to you Max.",

So that they cannot come back at you. So that you can fortify and set up your supply lines for you most forward positions for the winter.You know, I think from Ukraine's perspective again, this is -- we're having a Hollywood type discussion about a Hollywood type war. The reality is, Russia has a very strong defenses, and they need to find a way to outsmart them and probe somewhere and find a way to weaken them, to push forces one way. And then use their, you know, use that as a diversion and come out somewhere else. It's not easy. It's a real war. I think, again, when you step away from the actual battlefront, you forget what it's like. I was there, you know, not to overstate this. But when you're there in the trenches in the frontline and you're with the troops and seeing them training as they come running out of their armored personnel carriers, to go forward and storm positions. And you look at that camera footage of when they have done that actually in the real fire fight, it is not easy. You do not take a lot of ground quickly. It's hard. You are up against a very real enemy. And this is why the concern is that Putin will be able to run the steam out of this counteroffensive, and turn this into a very long, prolonged trench warfare for which he can rebuild his forces in Russia and armaments, and maintain those lines, and therefore maintain the ground he's taken. It is hugely important -- this counteroffensive. But it's not -- it's not easy. In essence, Ukraine needs more resources. A month or so ago, we were hearing they don't have quite enough. I think that's a reality that hasn't changed.",
