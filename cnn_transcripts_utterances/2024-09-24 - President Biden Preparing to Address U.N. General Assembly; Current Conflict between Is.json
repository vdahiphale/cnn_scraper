But there are instances in the past where this has happened to several members of a team at one team. We saw one from Iowa about a decade ago where more than a dozen football players were affected. There's one from South Carolina even longer ago than that, seven swimmers were affected. Supplements weren't necessarily involved in those. So sometimes this can happen if folks haven't been training for a little bit and they come back. And we know it's the beginning of the school year. Maybe these players were coming back into training and this one was particularly rigorous. So we're going to find out all these details.There are estimates this affects about 26,000 people per year, so it is relatively rare. Doctors and the university say they expect these guys to make a full recovery. And so, of course, we're all hoping to hear that that is indeed the case, but it can be scary, as you pointed out, John.",

Now, Biden has been talking about that for years since he's been in office, and he's expected to touch on a lot of that today, fortifying alliances with like-minded nations and elevating democratic values in what is expected to be it more of a capstone address from President Biden as he seeks to burnish his legacy on foreign policy just as he has in other recent speeches on, for instance, the economy and also reforms he says are needed at the Supreme Court. But in today's address, he is also expected to announce that he's going to be donating 1 million mpox vaccines to Africa to try to stem an outbreak there. And he's also going to be talking in later engagements about the need for climate policy around the world to create good paying jobs, and also about the work that's being done by a coalition that he helped to establish to fight fentanyl trafficking around the world. But John, senior officials acknowledged that it is the ongoing tension, the escalating situation in the Middle East that's going to be front and center both for Biden in his remarks, but also in his discussions with world leaders on the sidelines. Now this is a conflict that many senior advisors never predicted and then thought would be short-lived. And while they've been working behind the scenes around the clock for a ceasefire deal, that deal remains elusive, and they now say that the goal in these discussions here in New York is simply going to be to stabilize the situation.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is really the most concerned that they have been since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in Gaza last October, because as officials have emphasized, repeatedly, the potential for a full-scale war has always been much, much higher when it comes to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah than between Israel and Hamas because of that key player, of course, Iran, which backs Hezbollah. And the question of whether if there is a full blown war between Israel and Lebanon and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, and Israel goes in on the ground and tries to defeat or seriously weaken Hezbollah that way, will Iran then get involved, turning this into a full full-fledged regional war.And this is something that officials are deeply, deeply concerned about. As you said there, one official told me that we are the closest we have been since last October to this kind of full-scale regional conflict. Now, at this point, officials are working around the clock really feverishly to try to de-escalate the situation, trying to deter Israel from launching this kind of ground incursion against Hezbollah, which could escalate the situation even further. We have seen, of course, tit for tat strikes between Israel and Hezbollah over the last week. But things have really escalated since that pager and walkie-talkie attack that Israel conducted on Hezbollah last week, and of course, the multiple rounds of airstrikes that we have seen from Israel which have killed many civilians in Lebanon. And so the U.S. now saying, look, we are deeply concerned about this. We don't necessarily know at this point what Israel's ultimate goal is, whether they simply intend to try to weaken Hezbollah from the air, or whether they are preparing and softening the battlefield there for some kind of larger ground incursion. That is something that the U.S. right now is really trying to prevent Israel from doing. But of course, ultimately it is their decision. And what they are really emphasizing to Israel here is that if they do go in on the ground against Hezbollah, if this does escalate, it's not going to be a quick war. Hezbollah has been seriously weakened over the last week, but they are still a very powerful force. And as I said, of course, they have Iran's full backing, Sara.",

      "sentences": "It really couldn't be a grimmer background. I don't recall a General Assembly with all the leaders gathered with this much real havoc in the world, that it seems according to what were all reporting that even the United States, the biggest backer, for instance, in this case of Israel, apparently doesn't know what Israel's plans are. Does it plan to go in on the ground? Does it plan to see what's going on and try to do as much weakening from the air or not?That, I think, speaks to the notion of leadership and the ability to influence things on the ground. As Sara just mentioned, I covered the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. It did last about six weeks, and it was fought to a draw. That's in 2006. Israel didn't win Hezbollah didn't win. It was fought to a draw. And now everybody is much more armed. I think you'll see potentially, according to my sources, will Hezbollah respond in a way to yesterday's bombardments which killed maybe 300 people, wounded 1,000, including civilians, will Hezbollah respond in a way that breaches any so-called red lines? In other words, a long-range missile, ballistic missile on a heavily populated urban area in Israel is a major red line, right? So I think that's something to watch. And if that happens, then I think all bets are off, and we don't know what Iran will do in the meantime. And of course, the president has to deal with a very real war that's going on in Europe right now, and that is Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine. I spoke to the Ukrainian president this week. He's going to be seeing President Biden tried to present his victory plan, but clearly what they want is to be allowed to use American weapons in the way that they can with no restrictions to be able to hit Russian military targets which are targeting them.",

And so what the engineers wanted to do is they wanted to, at the end of the season, bring the Titan back so it could be examined to see perhaps what was the exact cause. At the time, they thought perhaps it was the sub's frame readjusting itself. But instead of bringing it back, what happened was, it sat on a dock exposed to the elements for several months. And Brooks says, the final decision when it came to safety and everything else came down to one man, Stockton Rush, OceanGate's former CEO. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  PHIL BROOKS, FORMER DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING, OCEANGATE: It was -- it was very frustrating because it was left in St. Johns and left on the dock and we had no way to work on it, no way to look at it.
