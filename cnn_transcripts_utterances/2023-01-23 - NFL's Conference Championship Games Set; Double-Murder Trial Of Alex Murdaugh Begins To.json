It's the highest on record.Home prices surged last year more than 10 percent from the year before even as home sales had their weakest year since 2014. High prices and mortgage rates kept buyers out of the market, but economists expect sales will ramp up again as mortgage rates fall. Looking at markets around the world right now, European markets have opened higher. They are up. Asian markets are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. On Wall Street, stock index futures are barely mixed here. The Dow and the S&amp;P look to try to bounce back after the first weekly declines of the new year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished higher, notching the third consecutive week of gains. Bloomberg, this morning, is reporting Spotify could be the next big tech name to announce job cuts. The number of layoffs at the streaming service expected this week. Not immediately clear, but we have seen these big tech companies unwinding some of their super-aggressive hiring sprees of the last couple of years.

Up next this week, GDP numbers for the fourth quarter -- the first look there -- jobless claims, new housing data, and the PCE price index. That's the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. All right, mortgage rates falling to their lowest level since September as the economic data is showing inflation might be easing. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 6.15 percent last week, down from 6.33 the week before. Now, economists say the easing rates are boosting both homebuyer demand and homebuilder sentiment.

So, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. it is just rain, and it's likely going to stay that way for the Eastern Seaboard. Again, most of that snow is really going to be focused over interior New England. However, Boston is likely to get that transition from rain into snow once we get a little bit later into the day and those temperatures do drop back. The heaviest snowfall, however, is going to be focused over areas of Maine as well as southern New Hampshire where six to eight inches, tops, is not out of the question. Here is the thing, though. Even interior places that will get snow -- they need to play catch-up. For example, Worcester, Massachusetts -- they've had 10 inches so far, but that puts them almost 16 inches below what they normally would be this time of year. Boston, Albany, Hartford -- even D.C. -- all of them well below where they normally would be in terms of snowfall by this time of year. Another area that desperately needs to see some snow is New York City. They have gone 318 days since the last time they had measurable snow. That's actually the fourth-longest consecutive set of days where they haven't had measurable snow. For those wondering, the record is 332 days. So it is very possible if we go all the way to February 5, we could potentially break that record. And they're not going to get any more snow today. But here's the interesting thing, Christine. You actually have some southern cities that have picked up more snow than New York, including Atlanta, Nashville, and Memphis.",
