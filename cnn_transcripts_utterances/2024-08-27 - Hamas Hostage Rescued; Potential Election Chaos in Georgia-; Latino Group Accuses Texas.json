So far, no charges have been filed since the searches were carried out last week in three counties. The attorney general's office says they were all tied to allegations of voter fraud. The League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, claims that it was a direct attempt to suppress the Latino vote. CNN's Jessica Schneider is kicking off our coverage on this. Jess, what can you tell us about these raids?",

The DOJ is responding by telling our team they have received this letter from LULAC, but they're not commenting any further. So our team in Texas also talked to an 87-year-old woman who said armed officers from Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton's office showed up at her house last week before the sun was even up and searched it for hours. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are trying to be proactive. They're going on offense against disinformation. A lot of these voting technology companies, as we know, with Dominion and others, they sued FOX News and Rudy Giuliani and a bunch of the Trump allies. They got -- some of them got a big payday already, but they're hoping also to deter people this year. They're sending a warning shot, Boris. If you lie about us again, if you put these crazy conspiracy theories out in the ether, we will come after you again. But it's not just that. Another company, even a bigger company called ES&amp;S that provides election equipment to more than 1,000 counties,they forced all of their employees to undergo social media scrubs.",

As you mentioned, they have beefed up their physical security for their employees. I was told by a Dominion official that some people have actually quit over just the trauma from last time around. They don't want to go through the abuse again. And there's another company that I spoke to that said that they're actually going to be providing panic buttons, wearable panic buttons, like Life Alert, you press the button, it calls 911, to perhaps as many as 1500 election workers in five key states for this November. They're afraid that people upset by what they have heard, the lies, the smears, they may turn this into a physical confrontation, so wearable panic buttons for election workers.

And that duty, that ministerial duty, is simply to certify these votes to assume, to assimilate the ballots, to count the ballots, to certify a total. Then, if there wishes to be a recount, if a candidate wishes to challenge an election, to file a lawsuit because of some irregularity, he or she can do that. That avenue is never foreclosed.

And in this case, I think it's pretty clear that all they're asking for, all the plaintiffs are asking for in this case is for a court to declare that the Election Board and county elections officials have to follow the law and that they can't somehow use this new rule as a way to circumvent their legal responsibility. So, they can't use the new rule just to impose delay for the sake of gaining one side or the other some political advantage or disadvantage. And so they really -- as far as the legs on the lawsuit, I think that it's a pretty clear case. There will be a question, I think, whether or not a judge may say, well, it's not right. You haven't -- there's been no challenge. There's been no rule implemented or effectuation of the rule in the counting of the votes. But nobody forgets really that we are this close to an election. And I don't think there's an appetite, frankly, to have sort of the scramble of lawsuits that we saw the last time. And I also think that this is a good check, frankly, on a court looking at a politically appointed body to decide if those rules actually fit the laws of the state. And the court is going to be concerned with what the law of the state is, not just what one political party or the other may want to have done.",

The fact that he was found alone suggests to me that maybe his captors just rushed out because they knew the IDF team was coming in and they just wanted to leave him behind. What I think is interesting about the story, though, is that he's one of several Arab Muslims who were captured by Hamas and kept now for over 320 some days. I find that quite interesting. But I think the fact that the IDF is continuing these operations provides some reassurance to the Israeli people that the government is still looking and trying to rescue hostages, which is a -- which is a good sign.",

It's dark. You're likely to lose communications in the myriad of tunnels going on, lose contact with one another. The defender in this case, Hamas, has the advantage of knowing their way around. Maybe they set up traps and ambushes. So it's a very tricky operation. And you have to do this at a time where you want to need to be on guard against the enemy, make sure that you don't kill the hostage you're trying to rescue in the process. So, it's a very tricky operation and I'm glad to see the IDF continue it. But the other important point here, Boris, is that there's 108 hostages still being held by Hamas. And, tragically, the view is that 40 of them are deceased. So, really, Hamas is holding on to bodies that the Israeli people want back. And there's really probably around 60-some hostages remaining. And so rescuing all of them is going to be quite difficult. So, obviously, the best way forward to release the hostages is through some type of deal.",

They're not going to concede because -- the Israelis are going to continue to demand that, because, otherwise, Hamas will be able to stay in power and sustain themselves.

As I wrote in my memoir, when Trump beat impeachment in January or February 2020, he felt energized and renewed. And that's when he brought in fresh troops and real loyalists and tried to start going through the departments and pressing loyalty tests for people in the departments. So, it was a completely different ball game by year four, not to diminish the trials and tribulations that H.R. wrestled with.
