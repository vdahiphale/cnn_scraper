      "sentences": "Very serious incident, John. And this really is laid out in the air traffic control audio that we now have our hands on. This flight, an Alaska Airlines Flight operated by Horizon Air, it's a totally on regional airline yesterday afternoon on the west coast from Seattle's Paine Field to San Francisco.And apparently, according to the airline, they call this a serious in- cockpit incident. This pilot on board this flight radioed air traffic control to say that a pilot riding in the jump seat, that is a little seat in the front of the cockpit typically used by off-duty pilots to try and commute back and forth between different airports, attempted to try and shut off the engines. And then, they decided to divert the airplane to nearby Portland where the plane made a safe landing. But in essence, what they are describing here is an attempted hijacking of this airplane by this off-duty pilot. We're still learning information about that person, and trying to come up with a name and some charging documents. We'll see though. We know at least that this pilot who was off duty was arrested on the ground by the port -- Portland Police Department, and that other agencies are investigating this. The FAA is aware of this. The TSA is aware of this as well. So, they're all sort of leaning into this investigation. Potentially, the FBI could be a part of this investigation as well. But essentially, they're laying out that this off-duty pilot tried to tamper with the flight controls, which is an extremely serious charge. You know, something like this has really not happened in decades. Reminds me of the FedEx incident back in 1976 where an off-duty pilot -- a flight engineer in the -- in the third seat of the airplane attacked the flight crew with a hammer and other weapons on board. They were able to safely land. But this is really an incredible case. We are just still learning about this, John. And the details are coming in fast and furious. But really a pretty serious charge here. And we just need to learn more about exactly what precipitated this. And why this off-duty pilot did this?",

An airline pilot who was off duty and was able to be up there in the cockpit, the only risk of that, of course, is that you have relatively easy access to the controls there and the other two pilots flying the airplane.This does sort of lean into the argument though, for two pilots in an airplane. If one pilot was potentially subdued by this off-duty pilot, that they could have continued flying the airplane. We know from the air traffic control audio that this off-duty pilot who is essentially given this very serious charge was subdued and taken into the back of the airplane. The flight crew who is still able to fly the airplane normally and safely said he was subdued. They would like law enforcement on the ramp. And that's exactly what happened. This pilot was arrested.",

And that has drawn Donald Trump's ire trying to make him toxic, despite the fact he has McCarthy's endorsement and he's a member of leadership. McHenry, as a caretaker may be possible.
