      "sentences": "Donald Trump has 10 days to surrender to authorities in Georgia in his historic fourth criminal case.Last night, an Atlanta grand jury voted to indict the former president and 18 others, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his post-election attorney Rudy Giuliani. They are accused of engaging in a conspiracy to commit crimes intended to reverse Trump's loss in Georgia in 2020. The 98-page indictment lists 13 state charges against Trump himself, including racketeering, as well as false statements. Prosecutors claim Trump and his co-defendants -- quote -- \"refuse to accept that Trump lost and knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election.\" District attorney Fani Willis wants the trial to start within six months, and, unlike in federal court, that trial could be televised. Let's begin at the courthouse in Atlanta with CNN's Sara Murray. And, Sara, this is a much more sprawling case, both in terms of the number of defendants, but also the nature and scope of the charges, than what we saw in the special counsel's case. Help lay it out for us.",

What the Fulton County district attorney lays out in this sweeping indictment is essentially this whole parade of individuals, from people who were in Donald Trump's inner circle, people like Rudy Giuliani, his former attorney, like his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, down to people locally here in Georgia, and alleges that these people were all working together with the aim of trying to keep Donald Trump in power illegally. And, as you pointed out, Donald Trump faces 13 charges in this case, but all 19 defendants face this very serious racketeering charge in this case. I think what we saw throughout the scope and the length of this indictment was a district attorney's office that wanted to be very clear that they were offering a detailed accounting of why they felt this was a compelling racketeering case. We see act after act after act listed in this indictment as in furtherance of the conspiracy, some of which happened in Georgia and some of which did not, because they wanted to show that this is a wide net that Trump and his allies cast in their efforts to try to overturn the election results and keep Trump in power, Jim.",

And then, normally, for defendants in this jurisdiction, they would show up at the Fulton County jail and they would be processed there, which would include, of course, getting their fingerprints taken, getting a mug shot taken. And then, at some point after that, we do expect these defendants will be appearing in court. That will be their initial appearance, their arraignment.

Then you have these state cases and this case in Georgia. Say he were to be going to trial. Maybe they don't have the trial by then, or maybe they are trying to do things once he's in the presidency. Actually, there has been situations in the past where there are lawsuits and other things that arise during a presidency, and a president has a lot of ability to argue, I'm the president. That's a very demanding job. It's a very important job, and you can't take time out to deal with some other things. And so it's very likely this is another thing that could be tested in court.

In this case, it's Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis. Now, Donald Trump in an early TRUTH Social post this morning -- quote -- \"So, the witch-hunt continues, 19 people indicated tonight\" -- I think he meant indicted -- \"tonight, including the former president of the United States, me, by an out-of-control and very corrupt district attorney.\" The post went on to read: \"Why didn't they indict 2.5 years ago? Because they wanted to do it right in the middle of my political campaign.\" Now, Jessica, it's unclear how the judge will ultimately, in this case, rule on some of his social media activities. We know that -- in the federal case regarding the 2020 election and Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the results there, that the judge has posted some restrictions on his social media activity. But I'm told from my conversations with Donald Trump's advisers that he has no plans to cease posting. He views TRUTH Social and social media as his most direct way of communicating with voters, and particularly his base, in that he thinks it's the best way to defend himself. And so the problems that we're seeing arise in the federal case, the special counsel's case with his social media activity could also potentially be a problem in this case as well.

We know that Trump is now facing -- it's 91 charges in four criminal cases over the course of four months, for everyone following along at home. Yet we know that the bulk of the 2024 GOP candidates really are not going after him on this at all. And, in fact, the ones who are pulling closest to him have really taken his side in all of this.

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, I did a quick search on Twitter just before I came on. And you're right. It's mostly been crickets. Nothing from Ron DeSantis. Nothing from Nikki Haley. Nothing from Mike Pence. Tim Scott apparently was giving an interview, and he called this a weaponization of the legal system. So he's defending Donald Trump. Asa Hutchinson put out a statement critical of -- condemning Trump for these indictments. But, yes, I mean, this feels like all of these campaigns are pretty much vanity projects. I don't think any of these people really want to win. Because if you really wanted to become the president, and you're polling at least 30 points behind the top guy -- that's if you're doing well -- you would definitely go out and say to voters:  Hey, I get it. You like Donald Trump, I like Donald Trump, but Donald Trump is most likely going to be facing prison time. That's not a great scenario for voters, for the country, for the Republican Party. Let's just be realistic here. None of them are really willing to do that basic thing in any kind of fully frontal way. So that leads me to believe they don't actually want to win.
