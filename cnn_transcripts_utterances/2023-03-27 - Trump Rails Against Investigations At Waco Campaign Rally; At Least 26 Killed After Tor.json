Obviously, right now, everybody's focusing on the potential for the indictment, and I fully understand why that is. But I think the more important question is what would be the outcome of a trial if and when we ever get to a trial? If Trump is acquitted all of those who have said this prosecution in New York over Stormy Daniels is political, it's selection prosecution -- it's really highly partisan in nature would be vindicated. And I think that would have enormous political consequences -- sadly, all of them favorable for Trump. That's why I think there are conspiracy theories on the right. People believe -- or they worry that the Trumps want Trump -- the Democrats want Trump to be the Republican nominee next year because they think he can -- they can beat him. So having his base stirred up by an unfair prosecution from that perspective is not bad for the Democrats. But I think if Trump were actually convicted in this case, then I think it would be something significantly different. That whether it was selective prosecution or not, a jury had found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So there's a lot to go here. I don't -- I don't know of anybody who looks at the plethora of criminal investigations of Trump, who doesn't think this one in New York should come last in a long list before it. But it's not under central control. You've got three different prosecutors in three different jurisdictions looking at four different cases, obviously uncoordinated.",

The defense itself will be able to challenge the indictment if it comes down on many different reasons. This is -- this is a state prosecutor investing -- investigating conduct that essentially took place in New York before Trump became president. And it may be unfair and it may be a lot of things but I think it's -- if we begin to band almost to the breaking point, principles of federalism that Republican conservatives believe in when they go after Alvin Bragg.",

She is a futurist tech entrepreneur and founder of a startup called WAYE or Weekly Advice for Young Entrepreneurs. She's here to weigh in on just how viral this photo went. And Sinead, thank you for being here. I saw this picture on Twitter over the weekend and I saw people were responding to it. It's not real but it looked pretty realistic. And I think the thing it raises concern about is how soon before we're just drowning in these deep-fake images that aren't real. SINEAD BOVELL, FUTURIST TECH ENTREPRENEUR, FOUNDER, WAYE (via Webex by Cisco):  Right, yes. I think that it went so viral not just because it was -- it was funny to some people but because most people couldn't tell that it was fake. Though we've known for years that AI-generated imagery -- it presents quite a looming threat on democracy and on societies in a world where we can't distinguish what's real and what's fake. And what this weekend's viral images show of the Pope is that world is here. That world in which images -- video may no longer be synonymous with the truth.

Journalists have a role to play in this. So I think on the technical front tech companies that are building these systems also need to equip journalists and newsrooms with the tools to be able to detect AI-generated imagery and content. And maybe we see a new role evolve -- AI fact-checkers in newsrooms. On the policy side of things, maybe we require AI-generating image systems to have a watermark on them. Nothing that ruins the quality of the image but something that could be detected by systems so to speak. And maybe on social media posts we always flag when something is AI- generated.
