The United States Supreme Court ruling that former President Donald Trump cannot be removed from any state's ballot for his actions on January 6th. The nine justices affirming that he can run in a general election and once again serve as the United States commander- in-chief.In the majority opinion, the court writes that only Congress can enforce the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding federal public office. Trump is responding to the decision, calling it, and I'm quoting him now, a big win for America. But the court did not directly speak to whether or not his actions on January 6th equate to insurrection. Let's get straight to CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates. She's outside the Supreme Court for us. Laura, what more, first of all, can you tell us about this very historic and consequential decision?",

Now, for practical purposes, tomorrow is Super Tuesday. He was already on the ballot. It had been sort of stayed, as they say, until this moment in time. But here's why they're saying it. They're saying, look, Congress is the one whose job it is to decide about a federal office and how to apply that Section 3, the so called insurrectionist ban.Now, this was a unanimous decision, but there was concurring opinions in this case. And that dealt with an issue of whether or not the majority went too far. And it comes down to this, a patchwork. Remember that word today, a patchwork. I'll bring in Paula Reid on this as well, because the patchwork, Paula, has really been about consistency. If every different state has different approaches to how they might determine whether there has been an insurrection, a criminal prosecution, or lack thereof, different states will have different results. And that could lead to a very confusing electoral process. The Supreme Court wanted no part of that, it seemed.",

They say, if the states are each able to make their own determination about this particular subject, then we will have a patchwork. It will result in chaos and confusion. And they say, in this opinion, nothing in the Constitution requires that we endure such chaos.So this does appear based on the law and the confusion around Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This appears to be a correct decision. Now, it is also an enormous win former President Trump, but it's what we expected after we saw the oral arguments. The justices just did not appear to be buying Colorado's argument.",

And, Joan, let me start with you. Twenty pages if you read single space, a lot of details in this document. I know you've gone through it. All of us have gone through it. No mention in this document whether Trump actually qualifies as an insurrectionist. What did you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. And I think we knew that. The handwriting was really on the wall when we heard the oral arguments in February that the justices did not want to go to whether Donald Trump actually engaged in an insurrection, as the lower Colorado courts had. But they were ready to at least get to what I think was a relatively easy bottom line. It was an easy bottom line. The Colorado Supreme Court was an outlier. States just are not empowered to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.But I think the language you're talking about in terms of any kind of insurrection, just look at what the three liberals wrote as they talked about how the majority had gone too far. They agreed, of course, with the majority that Donald Trump should be on the ballot in this case. But they kept referring to this oath breaking insurrectionist possibility. So, you know, at least that was hanging over it. And one thing I want to mention about potentially why this took as long as it did and why the three liberal justices wrote what they did. You know, the chief and the majority were able to put together that procurement pretty quickly. But they had to wait to see just how these concurring justices would write. And I think what that statement by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson reflects is intense frustration behind the scenes. They're losing on the big substantive cases that the court is taking. Aside from Donald Trump, they have just lost in some ways as the majority decided to take up the immunity question and really run out the calendar on that. Because we know now, because of the justices deciding to hear whether Donald Trump would be immune from any kind of criminal prosecution, it's unlikely he will have any kind of trial before summer, if not all of through 2024. And I think they just wanted to make sure they laid down a marker that they were not all in here. And, you know, Justice Barrett, who does play nice with all her colleagues all the time, felt like this was just not the time to do it.",

What they disagree on, Wolf, is how exactly the 14th Amendment could be enforced moving forward. The five justices said, only if Congress acts. That's the only way this could work. And the liberal justices, I think, plus Barrett, slightly different tones, but the other justices say, well, there could be other ways this could be enforced other than Congress.For example, what if somebody was criminally charged with insurrection and convicted? And Sotomayor and Kagan and Jackson say that should be enough. So the bottom line here, though, is this is unanimous. It's not up to the states. And another really important point, this is it nationwide, all the 14th Amendment challenges, Maine, Illinois, the dozens of others that had failed or were still pending. It's over. The 14th Amendment will not be applied to Donald Trump. He will be on the ballot in every state where he wins the primary.",

She was kind of telling her fellow female justices to calm down a little bit. But she said, particularly in this circumstance, writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.[11:10:30] And they've got this immunity case coming up, which is very important. And of course, you know, Donald Trump believes he deserves total immunity, and that's going to be a very divisive case. And lots of people think Donald Trump is going to lose. And the question is, I mean to me, does this give us any indication about the arguments that are going to go on behind the scenes given immunity because, you know, that is, to me, not a difficult decision either.

But, Wolf, I have to say that everything that informs that case, you know, in terms of prior law and just where the legal arguments are, I would be shocked if they somehow grant former President Trump immunity from criminal prosecution. The law just isn't there.I think they just wanted to have the last word. They didn't want to leave it to the D.C. circuit, even though that opinion was soundly written and as I said, hewed very closely to related precedent. So I don't think that Donald Trump is going to win in that one.

And I think that was all that was sort of animating my view on this.Here's my view on immunity. Some of the arguments that Donald Trump is making I think are ridiculous and easily dismissed. The idea that he has blanket immunity the entire four years he was president because he was president, that I think can get the back of the hand. The argument that he made about impeachment, well, first I would have to be impeached and then convicted by the Senate, and only then could I be removed.

All nine justices agreed. This is the way this should come about, and Donald Trump's name should be placed on the ballot.And we heard reverberations throughout the GOP agreeing with Donald Trump. This is a win for America. This was overzealous liberal justices and secretaries of states who took action to remove who they see as a threat to Joe Biden. And ultimately, this was unlawful and uncharacteristic for this type of action to be done. And they agreed with the Supreme Court's decision, and the American people should have the right to do so. And, look, if I was a Democrat, I would actually embrace this. If their argument is that Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump fairly at the ballot box, then this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

The reason being is because he participated in an insurrection. That question was not answered by this Supreme Court. Is Donald Trump an insurrectionist? Can he be charged with those crimes? It's something that we will have an oral argument on in a decision later in the spring.The fact is, many Democrats have not spoken out in favor of this ruling. Many of us want to beat Donald Trump at the ballot box, not necessarily have him removed for the simple reason that this was a slippery slope. You can have a president or a candidate for president on a ballot in certain states and removed from other states, like Texas or South Carolina or Arkansas, Alabama. And that slippery slope seems to be unfair. And so the justices got it right in this case by restoring Donald Trump to the ballot in all 50 states. The question still remains, though. Did Donald Trump participate, help orchestrate back an insurrection on January 6th? I think we'll get that answer sooner rather than later.",

It will be well briefed because they're giving plenty of time for amicus brief to get filed. They have time to think about it. And I think, you know, it's not an exorbitant amount of time.
