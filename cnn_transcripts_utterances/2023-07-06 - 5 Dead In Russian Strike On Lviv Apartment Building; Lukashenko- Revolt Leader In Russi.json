The initiative is in our hands.\" Now, we assumed that they both know what that plan was. Of course, there's been lots of talk that the offensive isn't going according to plan, that it hasn't really resulted in the sort of progress that they were hoping for. According to this note in Facebook also Zaluzhnyi spoke with Milley about Ukraine's needs for better and more munitions and weapons. And in fact, we know that the United States is considering announcing tomorrow a new aid package, a weapons package for Ukraine that is supposed to, we believe, going to include cluster munitions that Ukraine desperately needs to make progress in punching through the very deep Russian defenses all along the 600-mile long front, Boris?",

So it's quite clear that he is there.And one of the things that he may be actually doing is trying to ask for an apology, at least through intermediaries with Putin trying to get forgiveness, trying to convince him that this was not about Putin, that this was not a coup, that maybe he overreacted a bit, got overly excited at the front and that we should just forget all about this.

They are the ones that funded Wagner. They arm them, they gave Prigozhin a lot of money.

It's also never made sense to me that the Wagner soldiers would be invited to set up camp in Belarus where they could be an object of considerable instability.One of the things that we heard from President Lukashenko was that they could be used to defend Belarus or to train the troops in Belarus. I'm not entirely sure the group that you want training your troops is one with the brutality and absence of any of respect for the rules before that we saw with the Wagner group. And then the big question which is one that goes beyond Prigozhin himself is, is Belarus really going to deploy Russian nuclear weapons as both Lukashenko and Putin has said, when is that going to happen? There's been some suggestion it could happen fairly quickly, remembering that President Biden will be in Lithuania next week at the NATO meeting. And it's up - I'm sure that Putin is trying to think about what he can do around that time. And then there's this worrisome expansion of some of the civilian casualties in the war. You saw the attack on Lviv. You've seen the harassment of American airplanes, aircraft and drones over Syria. All of this suggests that there are tensions here that could expand the war.",
