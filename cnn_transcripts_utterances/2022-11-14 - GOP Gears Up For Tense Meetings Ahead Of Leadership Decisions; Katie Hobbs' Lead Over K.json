So odds favor Republicans at this hour, but the larger issue for the Republican Party is their underperformance in these midterm elections with Democrats holding the Senate, perhaps even picking up a seat, and House Republicans falling way short of what the opposition party historically achieves in a midterm election. Republicans, therefore, are now questioning out loud who is to blame. Is it Trump? Is it the Republican establishment? Is it fringe extremist candidates? And more pointedly, Republican officeholders are asking right now who should lead them going forward. Should House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy be the next Speaker of the House? Does Mitch McConnell still have enough support to lead his party in the Senate?

It appears we're well on the way to doing that. And that means that we're going to be able to stop this disastrous Biden agenda that continues to wreak havoc on our economy. The inflation crisis, the border crisis, the crime crisis, none of that changes. The president's approval rating is still historically low, and so, the problems facing our country are the same.

You can't lose any one vote. What it means is we have to be unified. If we're not unified, then none of these Republicans will get what they want.The only way to advance our cause, to advance the cause of conservative, to provide that check, that meaningful check and balance on the Biden administration and be the voice that our constituents sent us to Washington to be is to stay united. Otherwise we might as well not even be in the majority. We might as well just turn over control of the House floor to the Democrat majority. So I hope that's the lesson that all members regardless of where they are in the party ideologically, I hope we come to that consensus. No doubt it's going to be a challenge, but I think we all knead to need to recognize if there's any substantial deflection in a small majority, we might as well not even be in the majority. And that's I hope the lesson that we will take from this. But at the end of the day, while Republicans are certainly disappointed we didn't have a red wave, they don't give out small, medium or large-sized gavels. They only give out gavels.",
