And China extends its military arm with Russia's help. We'll have the latest on Beijing's first of its kind voyage. It is 9:00 a.m. in Beirut where new evacuation orders are in effect in Lebanon's capital as Israel's military vows to keep hitting Hezbollah targets. Lebanese authorities report dozens of people were killed on Thursday, more than 1,400 in the past few weeks. And we're following a brand new development. Lebanon says an Israeli strike on a key border crossing with Syria has cut off access to the international road. Tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in Lebanon have used the crossing over the past few weeks. (VIDEO PLAYING) So that video you're seeing there is from Beirut. A source tells CNN the IDF targeted Hashem Safieddine with a strike on the Lebanese capital. He is seen as a possible successor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an airstrike last week. His fate is unclear. Israel says it struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut and killed several Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon. The IDF says its goal is to eliminate Hezbollah's threat to the residents of northern Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERZI HALEVI, IDF CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF (through translation): We will not allow Hezbollah to settle itself in these places in the future.

We don't know how long that is going to last for. Western governments are trying to evacuate their citizens. They're trying to arrange additional flights. For ordinary Lebanese who don't have the means or the visas to travel to other countries or can't squeeze themselves onto one of these sold out flights, the Syrian border is the only real land border that people can escape through. More than 160,000 people have crossed through there in just the last about two weeks, and now that appears to be closed. And you know, in full transparency, Kim, my own in-laws, who are all displaced from their homes by the Israeli bombardment, were considering, we were discussing the possibility that they might try to escape the deadly Israeli bombardment, arial bombardment, to try to go through Syria to Jordan. And that now, that door appears to have closed and people are being stuck while fleeing their homes inside Lebanon. A big difference between what has happened in Lebanon and in Gaza with the Israeli assault there for nearly a year that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians, is Gaza is so much smaller. Lebanon is a much larger country. But civilian families are frightened and looking for places to hide from these deadly aerial bombardments.",
