So, combining the fact that there was a drone attack being repelled by air defenses in the vicinity of where this aircraft was attempting to land, and the damage that was sustained in flight and visible after the crash points to a Russian surface-to-air missile being launched at this aircraft.

Rescuers rushed to the scene, extinguishing the fire that engulfed the front of the plane and pulling out dazed survivors from the wreckage. Out of 67 people on board, including crew, at least 38 died. Remarkably, 29 people, including two children, survived and were taken to hospitals. Questions swirled on why the plane, which took off from the Azerbaijani capital Baku en route to Grozny in Russia, diverted to Kazakhstan. Flight radar 24 shows the plane flying across the Caspian Sea and circling near the Kazakh city of Aktau before the crash, in a pattern an aviation expert says indicates loss of flight control systems. The crash came shortly after drone strikes hit Southern Russia. And while investigators say they are exploring all scenarios, multiple Azerbaijani sources have told Reuters that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. Video verified by Reuters reveals a rare glimpse into the last moments on board the flight. Oxygen masks down as the camera tilts to the window, showing damage to the wing. Then, in another geolocated social media video, the plane appears to nosedive. In the resulting explosion, the plane fuselage is broken into parts, with its rear half miraculously landing almost intact but upturned. Parts of the plane scattered across a wide radius. Bodies seen covered in blue blankets. Russia and Azerbaijan evacuated their injured citizens as families in Baku waited to see if their loved ones had survived. For Azerbaijan, it is a time of mourning. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS: Russian President Vladimir Putin is talking peace, but without slowing down his relentless strikes on Ukraine. A Russian missile hit a central market in the city of Nikopol Thursday, about 40 kilometers Southwest of Zaporizhzhia. Eight people were injured, according to Reuters. But the Russian leader also says he's open to holding peace talks with Ukraine in Slovakia, whose prime minister is known for his pro-Moscow stance. The Kremlin is making it clear it's not interested in a ceasefire, and it wants a legally binding agreement that will address Russia's security concerns. The head of the World Health Organization says he and a U.N. team are safe after Yemen's main airport came under Israeli bombardment -- bombardment just as they were about to board a plane. Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus said, quote, \"The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge -- just a few meters away from where we were -- and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave.\" He says one of the plane's crew members was injured and sent his condolences to the families of those killed in the attack. Now, the strike on the airport was part of a series of Israeli attacks on Yemen on Thursday, which killed at least six people and wounded at least 40 others, according to Yemen's Houthi rebels. The militant group is vowing to retaliate, and Elliott Gotkine is in Jerusalem with more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
