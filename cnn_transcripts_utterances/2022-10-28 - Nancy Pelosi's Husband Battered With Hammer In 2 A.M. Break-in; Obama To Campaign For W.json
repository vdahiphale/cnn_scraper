The new details coming in, including how police knew to respond to the Pelosi home and the suspects twisted stolen election thoughts pushed online. Plus, the attack underscores the alarming number of threats to U.S. lawmakers and their families. How much is the current political climate to blame? And 11 days out from Election Day and the big names hitting the field late in the game that may signal concern about midterm victories. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm John Berman in for Jake Tapper. And we do begin with a national lead and right now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is rushing to a San Francisco hospital to be with her husband who was viciously assaulted overnight. Police say, 82-year-old Paul Pelosi was attacked with a hammer after a man broke into their home. The Speaker was not there at the time. Her office says her husband is expected to make a full recovery. CNN reports the intruder shouted, \"Where is Nancy\" during the attack and also tried to tie up Paul Pelosi to wait for the Speaker to arrive. Ahead, how police knew to respond to Pelosi's home. But first, CNN's Whitney Wild with new information about the suspect who CNN has learned posted about January 6 and 2020 election conspiracies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It may be in his pocket, maybe on the table.But at that point, Heather Grimes, an Emergency Dispatcher at San Francisco Police -- yet this happens all the time. You get a call. There's no voice on the other end of it. Hello, hello, 911. What's your emergency? And sometimes you disconnect. But she's sensing something there's a conversation going on in the background. She's sensing something isn't right. So she listens in, turns up the volume. And Paul Pelosi is basically trying to tell her in code what's going on. Why are you here? What are you going to do to me? I mean, you can imagine how he's trying to not let the the attacker know that 911 is listening, but he gives enough information. So she puts out a priority a wellness call.

So they go code three and Kobe Willens (ph), the first officer, his partner, Kyle (ph), comes through the door. And Pelosi apparently is still trying to keep this down by playing off, you know, as the police come in, what's going on.

So look, first and foremost, what Georgia Democrats want the former president to do is simply get people out to vote. And one more week of early voting here, already 1.3 million people have voted early, one in five registered voters in the state of Georgia. But that means many have not. And there's only one more week of early voting.So the former president here there's a long line, you can see it forming behind me, but it goes on blocks and blocks and blocks. And what's happening in that line right now, people are going through it, asking people if they voted, encouraging them to vote early. So what Barack Obama is now a post-president, a celebrity, but he's an organizing tool for the Democratic Party. He's going to be used to help get people to the polls.

At the time, the company was valued at around $30 billion. So already it was a massive premium. Then the markets began to take a turn for the worst. Elon Musk tried to back out of the deal blaming bots, Twitter sued, Elon Musk countersued.And when a Delaware judge began to side with Twitter on a bunch of legal filings leading up to the lawsuit, ultimately, Elon Musk saw the writing on the wall, and he conceded before he could be defeated. And now he is the owner of one of the most influential public discourse platforms in the world. And he overpaid a lot for it.",

No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.\" So, is this just translation for Trump isn't coming back anytime soon? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I don't think so. I think it's translation for Musk, trying to distance himself maybe a little bit from all these really, really difficult decisions, right, that he's going to have to make. I joked that this, you know, running a social media platform like this may not be rocket science, which we know Elon knows a lot about. But, I mean, it's extremely difficult. Every day, there are thousands, tens of thousands of content moderation decisions to be made. I would be surprised if Trump were not allowed back on the platform, given Musk's statements on this in the months leading up to this deal. But, of course, we will see what this council of experts that he says he is pulling together. Facebook has done something similar with setting up their oversight board, which is also kind of viewed as a way of Zuckerberg distancing himself from some of the most controversial decisions that have to be made.",

But I would say that, that there was an interesting point in the letter that Musk sent to advertisers, where he said, we need to have a space where both the left and the right can come together. And after January 6, when we saw a lot of people, including Trump suspended from platforms like Twitter, many people went further into echo chambers of platforms where only -- they only had people that agreed with them.",

They're telling people to turn off heaters, to turn off lighting, anything they can.They've even told people Ukrainians who moved overseas early on in the war not to come back this winter because the situation is so bad. The energy minister of Ukraine describing it as energy genocide. And Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev saying that they would solve these problems relatively quickly if Ukraine would be willing to negotiate.

And these threats of violence will extend this bulletin says even beyond Election Day on November 8. So what this bulletin is saying that these threats of violence could incorporate elected officials, election workers, even candidates. And they're saying with spring, all of these threats are the perceptions still that the 2020 election was rigged or stolen. And then enduring perceptions of those false election fraud claims, as well as what they say, are new or emerging perceptions of fraud undermining the integrity of these elections coming up here. So this bulletin is warning of this potential of violence by domestic violence extremists. And what's interesting here is it's really coming after a cascade of warnings that we've seen over the past week. In fact, it was just earlier this week that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that he had heard from many election workers worried about their safety. The FBI also has briefed sheriffs' associations across the country saying that misinformation could also fuel violence. And then of course, John, just yesterday, we saw the NYPD talk about this elevated threat, no particular threat, but they're saying overall, all this misinformation, disinformation and concerns about the validity of the election could, in fact, spur violence before and after Election Day.

It's not the only poll that has that race tied. There's a number of polls, a Marist College poll had that race within a point.But I think here's the whole thing, John, why I'm worried about those Ohio polls and why maybe I don't believe them. Take a look at the last few cycles. How much better did the GOP do than their final Ohio polls. 2014 Gov, that GOP outperformed by 10 points. 2016 Pres, the GOP outperformed by six points. 2018 Gov, the GOP outperformed by six points. And 2020 Pres, the GOP outperformed by seven points. Now, we obviously won't know if the polls are off this year until obviously the vote happens.
