      "sentences": "You get a sense there of how sensitive these decisions are from the United States to carry out strikes inside of Iraq, but we will get to that in a second.This begins Monday morning, according to the U.S., when U.S. forces in Erbil, Iraq, came under attack from a one-way attack drone, or a suicide drone. In that attack, which Kataib Hezbollah claimed credit for, three U.S. service members were injured, including one critically. President Joe Biden was briefed on the attack and was then given a series of options in terms of how to respond. That response, we saw early in the morning local time of Iraq, when the U.S. carried out three strikes against targets of Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups of Kataib Hezbollah. They are an Iranian proxy that operates inside of Iraq. The attacks, according to U.S. Central Command, targeted specifically the unmanned aerial capabilities of Kataib Hezbollah. That was the weapon they used to target U.S. forces. According to Central Command, a number of militants of Kataib Hezbollah were killed. They say, according to those early assessments, civilians were not affected by the strikes. This comes in the broader picture of a number of attacks on Iraqi -- on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria that we have seen over the course of the past several months, the number of those attacks, about 100 since mid-October, as of right now. Iraq condemned the U.S. attacks in Iraq, saying they were hostile acts that have infringed upon Iraq's sovereignty. It's worth pointing out the U.S. forces are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government. So anything that upsets that or threatens that is an incredibly sensitive point here, so the U.S. trying to maintain those military-to-military relations, even as it carries out these strikes against Iranian proxies inside of Iraq. The U.S. has tried to calibrate these to make sure it doesn't escalate the situation. But, Kate, given the number of attacks we have seen on U.S. forces, it's hard to believe that those attacks are going to stop, which means the U.S. has to figure out how to calibrate its continued actions at this point with its forces inside the Middle East, with, of course, the ongoing war in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "And this is worth noting.Normally, when we have seen attacks in the Middle East, it has been attributed to Iranian proxies. In the maritime domain, it was many of those, the Houthis, an Iranian proxy in Yemen. But over the weekend, the U.S. says an Iranian drone launched directly from Iran targeted a ship in the Indian Ocean, causing a fire on that ship, but not injuring any of the crew members. It was on its way from Saudi to India, where it docked. The Indian navy essentially picked it up and helped it in with an aircraft and a ship. But it's interesting and certainly noteworthy that the attack was attributed directly to Iran. So there, too, we see the risk of possible escalation, and one more thing U.S. Central Command needs to keep an eye on as it tries to sort of grapple with the entire situation and the unrest in the Middle East.",

Today, Ron Dermer Israel's minister of strategic affairs, will sit down with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and several other top administration officials. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House for us.

And, number two, over the last decade or so, he's established pretty good relations both with Republican and Democratic administrations, I think a priority, frankly, on the Republican side. But, nonetheless, he's an authoritative conduit. And if Dermer's in town, I suspect what he's dealing with and what the Biden administration is dealing with is an expectations gap. The administration wants a fundamental change in Israeli tactics, lower- intensity, in a matter of weeks. The Israelis, particularly the prime minister, whose political forehands are tethered to a successful campaign and probably a longer war, is thinking in terms of months. Whether or not that -- those two clocks can be synced, and, if they're not, what the administration tends to do by the end of January, I would think that's the -- I don't believe in moments of truth in the U.S.-Israeli relationship. They never seem to materialize. But I think, by the end of January, you will see a significant change in Israeli military tactics.",

That political objective should be a new reality in post-conflict Gaza, which provides security and prosperity to 2.3 million Palestinians, who have suffered greatly over the course of the last three months. Right now, I mean, to be -- I mean, to be brutally honest, the ideas for fixing that problem, I think, are light years away, the prospects of the Palestinian Authority returning anytime soon grim, the prospects of the United States cobbling together an international force to assume responsibility for Gaza not likely. The reality of Arab states deploying their forces to maintain security, that's a real stretch. I think the only thing that we can actually predict is that Israel will be operating in some fashion militarily in coming months. Hopefully, hopefully, the reduction of the intensity of that campaign will allow badly needed humanitarian assistance to surge into Gaza. I hope so.",

So that's where we're going to focus our attention on, because that's where the worst weather is at the moment. May not look like much on this video, but, as you see it kind of traversing some of the roadways, you will see that the visibility does drop off rather quickly because this wind is blowing around the snow, and that, of course, makes it very difficult to drive on the roadways. You saw the video of the overturned trailers there just a moment ago. This is part of a larger, expansive storm system that stretches from the Southeast all the way to the Upper Plains. This is the low focused right over Nebraska, and what it's doing is actually driving down a significant amount of wind on the backside of this system, and that is what's whipping up the snow that is falling from the sky. So that reduces visibility as we reach the blizzard criteria for many locations. There's the half-a-million people or so that are under blizzard warnings, but we still have ice storm warnings for parts of South Dakota and North Dakota, even Western Minnesota, and then these winter weather advisory stretch all the way to Kansas and Nebraska as well. Current wind gusts right now, check this out, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 55 miles per hour. So you add the falling snow from the sky, you're going to reduce the visibility across these locations, and that is going to make it very difficult to drive. So, according to the National Weather Service coming out of the Denver office, they're actually discouraging travel along that interstate 25, I-80, perhaps into I-70 as well, some portions of that, before the winds relax overnight tonight. And then the snow starts to taper off and conditions improve there. But I told you this is a far-reaching storm system. Because the East Coast is now getting the warm side of the storm, this is all rain. And we're focusing our attention in on Western South Carolina and Western North Carolina. That's where we have flood watches in effect, the potential here for another two to three inches of what's already -- on top of what's already fallen. And, yes, you're right, Sara. You noted it's been a mild winter in New York City, still going almost 680 days without an inch of snow on the ground in the Big Apple. Incredible.",

And, since then, there are the names of justices on the Colorado Supreme Court being discussed on far right pro-Trump Web sites. One of the things that we had heard was written was that \"Robed rats must hang.\" That is some of the language that's being used online by extremists. But those are very nonspecific threats at this time. And so, at this moment, now the FBI is saying publicly: \"The FBI is aware of the situation and working with local law enforcement. We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation.\" So, no specific threats at this time that are requiring law enforcement to make arrests that we know of.
