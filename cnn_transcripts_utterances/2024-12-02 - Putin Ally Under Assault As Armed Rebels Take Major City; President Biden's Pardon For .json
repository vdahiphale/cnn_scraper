Rebels seizing the second biggest city as a top Russian oligarch threatens all out nuclear war. Plus, Biden defiant, pardoning his own son even as his own party has been turning on him over it. New details tonight that Hunter Biden pled guilty only because he expected a pardon. And the tweets Trump's new press secretary didn't want anybody to see, especially Trump. But guess what? KFILE unearthed them. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, a major Putin ally tonight under assault. At this hour, the second biggest city in Syria is now in the hands of rebels for the first time since the war began, a decade ago. As its dictator, Putin's close ally, Bashar al-Assad backed by Russian forces, is clinging to power. The situation there is changing by the hour. The rebels surprising both Putin and Assad, storming Aleppo, toppling statues of Assad's family. Overnight, Putin's air force reportedly carrying out strikes in Syria in response. The crisis in Syria for Putin tonight, coming as another one of his allies is in serious trouble. Let me just show you the images out of Georgia tonight protesters furious after Georgia's Putin supported government decided to postpone talks to join the EU. It has led to mayhem and protests on the streets. That move, of course, by the government, one that Putin was celebrating and supporting. But the overwhelming uprising that we are witnessing in these past days, these images you see on the streets of Georgia are adding to a perilous moment for Putin, who today approved a budget spending a third of Russia's entire national budget on the military. In fact, increasing the size of his standing military for only the third time since Putin invaded Ukraine, something that appears to be a sign that whatever peace deal is eventually negotiated, Putin's goals remain unchanged. And tonight, a Russian oligarch close to Putin telling Max Seddon at \"The Financial Times\" that Putin will reject Trump's peace plan, the first one that Trump's floated there. He said, then, quote, the world is on the brink of nuclear war. That oligarch saying that and also adding a specific warning to Trump, saying that if Trump does not stop U.S. backing for Ukraine, quote, there will be a radiation zone nobody will ever go into in our lifetime. And the war will be over, threatening Trump with nuclear war if he doesn't stop supporting Ukraine. Something that Putin's state media is betting Trump will do, thanks to his cabinet choices so far. According to journalist Julia Davis, the host of one popular Russian state television program, saying overnight,, quote: What an excellent team is coming along with Trump, not with respect to Ukraine, but as far as everything else goes. If they're allowed to get in, they will quickly dismantle America brick by brick. They are so great. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT tonight live in Moscow to begin our coverage. And, Fred, obviously an assault on Putin backed governments in Georgia, in Syria, nothing, though more precarious than what is happening on the ground in Syria tonight.",

General, right now, you're looking at a crucial moment for Vladimir Putin and it comes as the financial times is reporting that you know, that oligarch and his inner circle is outright rejecting even Trump's offer for a peace deal. You hear what's happening in Georgia, what's happening in Syria as Putin is trying to send this massive increase in his armed forces, how crucial is this moment?",

As Fred just mentioned, they face some threats on their on several fronts and decreased assistance from a bunch of allies that are having problems themselves.So we're seeing you know, as calm as Putin is and as his spokesman may appear to be, they don't have reason to feel very good about what's going on. They are facing dynamics on every single one of their fronts, which could -- could cause increasing problems. Putin is not in a good place right now, and I hope that you know, based on our approach toward the Ukrainian war, we take advantage of that.",

As you point out, the Putin's air force was crucial in Assad maintaining power. But now, Aleppo has fallen for the first time since the civil war began, a war where Bashar al Assad had been out on the public stage, right at international meetings, you know, sort of back, back. I don't want to say business as usual, but this is this -- this sort of seemed to stun, not just Putin, but Assad. How much of this do you think stems from Putin being overextended?",

And one of the things we have to mention is we're watching the attacks in Aleppo and Hamas and seeing the kind of tactical action on the ground.We also have to remember that Vladimir Putin loves Syria, and he only loves it for one reason. He has a major naval base at Tartus. He has a major air force base at a place called Khmeimim and both of those bases give him access to the Mediterranean. Once he loses that because of a potential overthrow of Assad, he has lost his capability to influence in the Med. He is somewhat lost his influence to influence and the influence in the Black Sea based on the war with Ukraine and his naval bases in the Baltics, at Kaliningrad, are also threatened. So you're seeing Putin really being tossed into a corner. These bases are all critical for their military presence in these areas. And increased rebel activity in northern Syria and Turkish and the Turkish incursions have heightened concerns about the Russian supply routes, even into the area. Assad is saying Russian is. Russia is bombing in the area, and they're helping counter the rebels. Yeah, they're not bombing with much because they don't have much to bomb with. They've lost a lot of aircraft in Ukraine and they're like, I said a minute ago, they're in very bad states and giving anything. And I just comment on your statement about the Russian ministry saying that they wanted Zelenskyy removed. That's been the objective of Putin since day one, in February of 2022, to get Putin and his -- or excuse me, to get Zelenskyy and his government out of Ukraine. So they would meet their strategic objective if they could do that.",

Now to -- to have to deal with Syria right now and Hayat Tahrir al- Sham, with really no effective ground force because Hezbollah is not going to play a role. They did in Aleppo when the Syrians took it. The Iranians had a major ground presence as well. Qassem Soleimani, the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, Quds Force, actually was in the joint operations center.

Such an abuse and miscarriage of justice? Of course, the reality of it is, is pardons are often abused by outgoing presidents. We see it all again and again, Marc Rich, remember? Trump himself, though, doled out dozens of pardons to his allies and supporters, including 26 in the final hours of his administration. Like his daughter's father in law, Charles Kushner. Trump in December 2020 pardoned Kushner, who had pled guilty to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time called Kushner's offenses, quote, one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I ever prosecuted.

It is self-serving for all the obvious reasons in your report. But it's one other thing, too, that I think get lost in the overall story this pardon goes back ten years. It goes back to 2014. So if you wanted to pardon him just for the gun charge and just for the related drug charges or even the tax charges, that's one thing.

They served as U.S. attorneys, high level positions in the Department of Justice, served in the FBI, ran field offices as Clarence -- Clarence Kelly did. So Kash Patel has done none of those things.

So, that's that I'm sure makes him in some ways the ideal candidate.What concerns me, Erin, is what it says about Donald Trump's intentions for the FBI. You don't have to listen to everything Kash Patel has said. He hasn't actually said that much but the comments he's made about what he would do as FBI director, some of those that you played in the last piece make it pretty clear that he intends to essentially take the FBI backwards 50 years. We know what the FBI looks like when it is hell bent on pursuing the president's political enemies. We know what it looks like when an FBI director takes the awesome power of the agency. Its investigative authority, its legal authority, and trains that at Americans for the purpose of executing political revenge, of collecting political intelligence for the president. We know this because J. Edgar Hoover did it for 40 years, and in 1975, after the Church Committee and the Pike Committee and the post- Watergate reformations, we got away from that. So America is familiar with an independent FBI that actually knows how to protect America and uphold the Constitution. My concern is that's what we'll lose.",

He said that Patel made up information in a crucial moment, and you can think of a situation like this, you know, this is -- this is this is about war and peace.So basically, the United States, during a hostage rescue, needed clearance to enter the airspace of another country. Patel says that the U.S. has permission. Now, it turns out that the United States did not have permission. And Esper says and I quote him, by the time Mike Pompeo and I spoke an hour later he still didn't have the okay from the remaining country. He also did not know where Patel received his information. Pompeo never spoke with him. \"How do we receive the bad information in the first place?\" Pompeo wondered. Esper said his team suspected Patel may be approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts. What concerns you the most when you hear a story like this? Obviously, it appears from what Esper is saying that the no one ever understood exactly what happened. But what would be the implications if someone were willing to make information like that up and convey it to the defense secretary?",

She took it off. It says: Love him or hate him. He kept the wheels of democracy moving and pushed forward to certify his own loss. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. That post also included a video of Mike Pence certifying the election, calling it a dark day in our nation's history. Well, why did she remove that? Well, that post essentially admits that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, something that he still doesn't admit and something that the entire Republican Party has been just such a big part of the Trump movement. Now, this other one that she removed is really interesting. Its a post in which she praised a Capitol Hill police officer she called him a, quote, hero and what did this, this, this guy do well, this Capitol Hill police officer, Eugene Goodman, and there were rioters -- essentially sort of trailing him up the steps near the entrance to the Senate chambers. He made a quick decision, led senators away from the entrance to that chamber. He was credited with saving possibly senators' lies. She deleted that tweet.
