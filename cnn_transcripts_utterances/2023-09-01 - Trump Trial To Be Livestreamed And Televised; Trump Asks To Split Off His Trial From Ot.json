The Florida governor tries to sell his national leadership chops by shepherding his state through a brutal storm. While his Super PAC goes full Oliver Twist and asked donors for 50 million helpings dollars to get them through the next stretch of the campaign. And a Mitch McConnell mystery. The Capitol position gives the Republican the all-clear to keep doing his job, but plenty inside his own party are worried about the leader. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, he feels no need for speed. Donald Trump wants to make sure his trial moves slowly. So, he's now trying to separate himself from his alleged co-conspirators in Fulton County, Georgia. But whenever he sees the inside of a Georgia courtroom, a judge ruled that the world will also see it live. We're going to start our coverage with CNN's Zach Cohen. Zach? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Dana, yes. Judge ruling that all proceedings and potential trials in this case in Georgia will be televised, does create a scenario where we could watch a criminal trial of an ex-president play out in real time. Now, we need to remember that this is assuming that the case is not getting moved to federal court where there are no cameras allowed. We know that there's defendants in this case that are already trying to move their cases and potentially all eight or all 19 defendants' cases to federal court. And Trump may have the best case of all of them to do that. But for now, this decision by the judge does mean and does create a tantalizing possibility of being able to watch as the criminal trial of Donald Trump plays out in real time and really does add a possibility of more transparency to that process, especially in a moment now where, you know, this case is already really polarizing in terms of the way different political, you know, corners of the political world are seeing it. Donald Trump himself is out there constantly claiming that this investigation in this case, it's just election interference. So, you know, the potential for this to be televised live in real time could give us a firsthand window into the trials. It's happening. But we're going to have to wait and see if Donald Trump does try to move this federal court. And if he does, that means rather luck, basically.",

Joey, what's your take on this? JOEY JACKSON, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYThe consequences here, Dana, are quite significant. We know that the room for appeals and other errors are quite significant. The notion of fairness to the public and treating the president fairly like anyone else is significant. We want a justice system where people should embrace the notion that there's justice. And so, when you have in your papers saying, hey, I'm on trial in September, and we have this meaty case that I have to deal with, and by the way, it involves the former president, may I have it adjourn. I think that that has to really resonate with the judge. And I will be very surprised if it's not granted. And your honor says, listen, let's move the trial to another date where it's more appropriate, everyone's prepared can move forward. And it eliminates the notion of not having a fair trial.",

And part of the reason is, you already have some of the other defendants who are trying to separate themselves because they want to go to trial very quickly.And so, I think there is, I think, a pretty compelling case to be made for the former president to also try to sever him his case. And then take it, you know, certainly because he's going to -- we're going to see a filing from Steve Sadow in the coming weeks, where they're going to ask for this case to be moved to a federal court. So, there's going to be some delays that are going to be built into that part of the litigation anyway. So, I think there's a very good chance that that happens. And, you know, I do think that, you know, certainly, when you have this many defendants, the other thing that's getting lost is that no one really thinks that there's going to be 19 defendants, by the time we get to the end of this. There are some of these people that are going to plead because they're not in a position to defend themselves over the course of a long litigation. So, there are some of these lower-level people who are going to make deals and that's going to happen soon.",

I mean, he does have a good story to tell on job growth, on inflation easing. This is not like he doesn't have a story to tell. But you are right, there is no evidence yet that the American people have sort of grabbed hold of that story and buy it completely. And I'm not sure by the way, I'm not sure that they will. You know, it seems to me, the American people are pretty locked into how they think about Joe Biden, and I'm not sure that he's going to be able to turn that around dramatically.",
