I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.This morning, millions of Americans are in the grip of extreme weather, deadly wildfires, a record-breaking heat wave, and the first alert of a much feared Atlantic hurricane season. Buckle up, everybody. In New Mexico, thousands of people are racing to escape two wildfires. At least one person has died, and the number of destroyed buildings has tripled in just a few hours. A short time ago on CNN, we heard from a man who made the gut-wrenching decision to evacuate with his wife and their three-year-old daughter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Caribou could hit a record of 96 degrees today and a heat index of, get this, 104 degrees. That's in Maine. If people in Caribou want to escape the heat, they could go to Miami, where it's about 10 degrees cooler. It's a lot of wild weather right now. Let's begin with the wildfire.

And the visibility because of the smoke from this fires is just really cut down dramatically. The smoke is intense.This is a roadway that leads out to the northern edge of town. This is an area where people were scrambling Monday night to get to get out of this area. As you know, one resident described us, ash was falling from the sky. And as you look at it, everywhere you look here, visibility is cut down dramatically, very difficult to breathe and it really kind of gets into your eyes as well. You can imagine what the firefighters on the front lines are battling in this canyonous, mountainous area, fighting these fires are extremely difficult. As I mentioned, about 1,400 structures have been destroyed or lost so far in these fires. More than 8,000 people have evacuated. And one resident says they're lucky to get out alive.

The two leaders signed what they called a strategic breakthrough partnership treaty, deepening a staunch anti-west alliance that Washington is closely watching.Joining me now is CNN Global Affairs Analyst and former Trump Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

These two visits come just on the hills of an important G7 meeting last week in Europe, which he's been excluded from in terms of the G8 and other bodies. And, of course, there was the peace summit in Switzerland for Ukraine. So, you can see that this block is forming up the block led by China.

And we are learning that officials have also relayed their frustration directly to the prime minister himself.CNN has learned that Amos Hochstein, who has been traveling in the region, met with Netanyahu yesterday. And in that meeting, he told Netanyahu that his comments were unproductive and more importantly completely untrue. The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, also reiterated similar comments saying that what Netanyahu said was incorrect. And another senior administration official told CNN these comments were perplexing and wrong. Now, it's unclear what exactly Netanyahu was talking about with these comments. In early May, the administration had put a pause on the shipment of heavy bombs for Israel as there were concerns about their possible ground operation into Rafah.

He did an end run around Obama, got the Republicans to invite him to give a joint address Congress and essentially snubbed Obama that way. This is a replay of that tactic.What he's essentially trying to do is to give the Republicans talking points to beat up on Biden, to say, you're withholding aid to one of our closest allies at a time of war. He's also trying to preserve his own political survival, where he wants to show that he's tough and he's battling even pressure from the Americans, which helps him with the hard right at home. Bibi Netanyahu is not acting these days like a statesman or a war statesman in any sense. He's acting like a besieged political figure scrambling to ensure his own survival and do whatever it takes, however partisan, however unethical it may be.

He has not moderated his strategy very much and then plays this very partisan game and the legacy of Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, among other things, is going to be that he has turned support for Israel, which used to be a non-partisan issue or a bipartisan issue in America into a deeply partisan issue.
