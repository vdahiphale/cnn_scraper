Let me read part of it, \"De Oliveira told Trump employee for that, quote, the boss wanted the server deleted. Trump employee four responded that he would not know how to do that, and that he did not believe that he would have the right to do so. It continues De Oliveira then insisted that Trump -- to Trump employee four that the boss wanted the server deleted and asked what are we going to do about it? We now know who employee number four is. They are Yuscil Taveras. That's a Mar-a-Lago employee who oversees the property's surveillance cameras and we know that he received a target letter from federal prosecutors after Trump was first indicted in June. Kara Scannell is here with more. Just want to be clear for our viewers, it's not a new target letter that he got on Friday or something. It's been there. The question is, what is it mean?

But it's something that we just don't know. But obviously, he is at the center of these allegations here. And they chose not to indict him at this time. But someone who was engaged in what the prosecutors say was this allegedly obstructive conduct, who -- there's no evidence that any surveillance tapes were deleted.

So Bernard Kerik was working for Rudy Giuliani, who at the time was Trump's attorney, and he was kind of the quarterback for all of these efforts to dig into allegations of fraud in the election. So he was essentially Giuliani's investigator.And the reason why he will go in is because they want to know what exactly he was following up on and looking into and, you know, his attorney was on CNN yesterday. And, you know, he was saying that it would be, you know, idiotic for the special counsel to bring charges before speaking with Bernie Kerik, but that is because their argument is that, you know, he was running down all of these legitimate concerns or questions. And so obviously, this wasn't a corrupt intent. But, you know, the counter narrative of this is that there none of these election fraud claims were legitimate, the courts were throwing them out, you know, there were affidavits by people that, you know, just were never substantiated. But, you know, he's one of these witnesses that he was involved in this effort. He's someone that Smith's team would want to talk to, to want to understand exactly, you know, what conversations he had, obviously, he turned over those documents. They already spoke with Rudy Giuliani. But, you know, as this investigation, if anything we've seen it is so expansive and they're almost leaving no stone unturned talking to nearly everybody. You know, that interview his lawyer said is in the next week, but you know, Smith's team can operate on their own schedule. They don't have to wait to talk to him.

That's according to a source familiar with the matter. And that's also more than double what it spent last year.The political action committee which raises most of its funds through small dollar donations from Trump's supporters is expected to report to the FEC this morning, as the former president's legal battles continue to mount. CNN's Kristen Holmes is live in Washington this morning. Kristen, that's a big number. It's a huge number. And I think it's easy to kind of get numb to that reality. But it's also the small donor element of it. They're the primary driver of Save America PAC's funds, for the most part, at least as far as I understand. They feel like inside the campaign, this is going to have any impact on those supporters.",
