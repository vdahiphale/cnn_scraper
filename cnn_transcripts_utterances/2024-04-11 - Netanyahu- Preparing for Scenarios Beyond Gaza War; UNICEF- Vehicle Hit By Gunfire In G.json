It is 9 a.m. currently in Washington, DC., 5 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. This is \"Connect The World.\" Also, happening this hour. The Israeli Prime Minister says, he is preparing for scenarios outside of Gaza. Russia has destroyed the largest power plant in Ukraine's Kyiv region. And Donald Trump says the near total ban on abortion in Arizona went too far. And the stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes time. The futures are mixed right now, rallying slightly on a better than expected report in U.S. producer prices. Wholesale inflation rose to 2.1 percent year-over-year. And we will break those numbers down for you later this hour. The future is just ticking into positive territory. We're 30 minutes away. Well, we begin with fears of conflict escalating in the Middle East. In the past few hours, the Israeli Prime Minister has visited his country's Tel Nof Airbase where he has said, Israel is preparing for scenarios beyond the war in Gaza.

He said whilst in the middle of this conflict in Gaza, he was talking to the F-15 pilots. F-15 pilots, as we know, very active in the skies, dropping bombs in Gaza and very active as well along Israel's northern border with the south of Lebanon. So the timing of this, it comes right on the heels of President Biden telling Israel that it has United States' steadfast support amidst the concerns that Iran may strike directly into Israel as a result of Israel strike. Although, they haven't claimed responsibility for it. The United States says they believe they did it at an Iranian consulate in Damascus a little over a week ago. The tensions are still high. The Prime Minister, again reading between the lines, seems very clear. What he says here, you're about to hear it, is aimed at Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU PRIME MINSTER OF ISRAEL (via translator): We are in the midst of the war in Gaza which continues in full force. At the same time, we continue our unceasing efforts to return our hostages. But we are also preparing for scenarios of challenges in other arenas. And we established a simple principle, whoever hurts us, we hurt him. We are preparing to meet the security needs of the state of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw economic announcements when it came to trying to deepen semiconductor production partnerships between the two countries. We've -- there's going to be new space collaboration as Japan is hoping to land its first two astronauts on the moon. All of this really speaking to the fact that the U.S. has viewed China -- or has viewed Japan as the center of their Indo-Pacific strategy. They have seen a very willing partner Kishida, based on the fact that he has increased the country's defense posture, committing to raising defense spending to 2 percent of GDP in the coming years. He also has been quite a vocal supporter of Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion of that country. The President really stressing that it's not just a regional partnership that they now have, but they view Japan as a global partner. And just a short while ago, we actually saw Prime Minister Kishida's motorcade leaving Blair House where he was staying on this trip, and he's heading up to congress for a joint session to address members there.",

Thank you, Arlette.Well, it's strike 3 for Donald Trump as the, former U.S. President and his legal team lost a third petition to delay his criminal hush money trial, which is, of course, set to begin on Monday. It took an associate justice just minutes to reject their latest motion on Wednesday. Trump's team wanted to appeal a lower court's ruling on presidential immunity and have the, judge recused from the case. The criminal trial regards payments made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged one night stand with Trump nearly 2 decades ago. Trump can still appeal the denied motions to New York's highest court, but that court doesn't have to accept the appeal, and so it goes on. Well, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he'll be holding a joint news conference on Friday with Donald Trump to talk about election integrity. Now this comes as he faces backlash from his fellow Republicans with some threatening to vote him out of the leadership position. CNN's Manu Raju has details of a contentious day on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Frustration within the House GOP is palpable. REP. GARRET GRAVES (R-LA): We don't truly have a majority at this point. You have a loosely aligned coalition government right now, and it's an incredible challenge. RAJU (voice-over): Bitter GOP infighting, derailing the GOP agenda and now threatening speaker Mike Johnson's job as he weighs major decisions over the FBI spying power and providing billions in aid to Ukraine, all as a threat to oust him continues to loom as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene escalates her attacks. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): The motion to vacate is real. We can't continue to be led by our elected speaker of the house that's passing the Democrat agenda. Our voters will not tolerate that. RAJU (voice-over): All of it enraging fellow Republicans. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is incredibly reckless. REP. MAX MILLER (R-OH): This is nothing more than just, look at me. No one else is paying attention, so here's my motion to vacate. Now it's my time. REP. MARC MOLINARO (R-NY): I think it's an absurdity that's unnecessary, and frankly, it was a mistake when this congress allowed it to happen to Kevin McCarthy. REP. TROY NEHLS (R-TX): It's an impossible job. The Lord Jesus himself could not manage this conference or this -- you just can't do it. RAJU (voice-over): Johnson will soon see his razor thin majority shrink, giving him just one vote to spare. But the Right Wing continues to give Johnson fits of furious over his deal making with Democrats and warning him about his moves ahead. Greene outlined her anger in a scathing 5 page letter, attacking Johnson over his handling of a funding package to keep the government open, and missed 70 minute meeting with Johnson today, warning him not to move ahead with any more aid to Ukraine or a bill to renew the FBI's warrantless surveillance authority, something former president Donald Trump successfully urged Republicans to kill earlier today.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, I would argue that this is a rare bit of positive news on the inflation front, because this was the first coolerthan expected inflation gauge that we've seen in a bit. Now, again, we're talking about wholesale inflation. This is prices before it gets to all of us as consumers. PPI, producer price index, was up by 0.2 percent month over month. Now that is cooler than expected, and it is a slowdown from the month before a significant slowdown. The big number, the annual rate, 2.1 percent. Again, that is cooler than expected, but that does mark an acceleration from what we've seen recently. It's actually the hottest rate in 11 months. Now let's look at the trend for this annual rate. And you can see the good news is that we're nowhere near the peak of that chart back in 2022. Right? This gauge was at almost 12 percent. That was pretty crazy. So we're nowhere near that. The bad news, though, is that you can also see that recently some of the improvement here has kind of leveled out. Right? It's actually starting to creep a little bit higher, and that's not what we want to see. I do think that the reaction on Wall Street is telling. Yesterday, as soon as that consumer price index came out, we saw stock futures plunge, bond yields go up, and fed fears and inflation fears really come back. Today, though, we are seeing the opposite reaction. Bond yields come down and the stock market opening significantly higher after it was supposed to be opening. Stock futures were actually sharply lower before these numbers came out. So where does that really put us? I think that this is all just another reminder that the effort to try to really conquer inflation, it's been a lot harder than people thought. Right? Economists are throwing around the word stubborn a lot. Some even comparing it to a toddler who just doesn't want to leave the playground. And this does raise questions about what the Fed is going to do next, because a lot of people had hoped for a rate cut as soon as June, but those expectations, Becky, are being dialed back significantly. We're hearing from Goldman Sachs, no rate cuts until July. They now only see 2 rate cuts. Barclays says 1. Some economists are saying no rate cuts this year. And there's even some talk that maybe the Fed has to start thinking about raising interest rates again. Now it's too early to say that's going to happen, but just the fact that we're even talking about it speaks volumes. Becky?",

And as we speak, it goes to flat. The S&amp;P at less than a fifth of 1 percent higher, and the Nasdaq really knocking around, below a half of 1 percent high. Investors really, I think, very confused as to what is going on. And as you rightly point out, they're getting a lot of sort of mixed messages from those who are investing their money at present. So I think we need to just spend a little time digesting, let these markets do what they are doing, and, I would expect these volumes will be relatively low until people get a bit of a sense of what happens next.

In fact, less than a year ago, the ground I'm standing on was covered in water. And right now I don't even need to wear rainboots for walking here, because of how dry the ground is. The situation is so troublesome that Colombian authorities have called for water rationing measures in the city of Bogota, which is about 10 km that way, starting today. Now, Bogota's mayor has urged his fellow citizens to save as much water as possible, at least until the rains come back. In fact, much of the supply of water to the city comes from surface water like this one, which are highly dependent on precipitation. This year, however, rain has been scarce in part because of El Nino, a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean, which is hundreds of miles from here. El Nino can have different effects at different latitudes, but in Colombia it largely means less water. And the Colombian government has issued a natural disaster decree as early as in January to mobilize resources to prevent the effects of El Nino. SUSANA MUHAMAD, COLOMBIA ENVIRONMENT MINISTER (via translator): We must have a deep thought about the type of development we want. We can't keep handling emergencies.
