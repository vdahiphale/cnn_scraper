And his decision to step down really kind of seals for the people of America. What character really looks like. He made a decision that was selfless. I don't know another politician in my life or a CEO of a major company that would see the most powerful position in the world to think of other people rather than himself and that's what he did.

I mean, normally in every campaign, and you're a campaign junkie like I am, you don't see things change this fast. But it has been amazing what the Vice President has done in a very short period of time.Just think about three weeks ago from the debate until, you know, Sunday, everybody in the world was talking about the President being too old and wanting to pass the torch to the next generation. And would he do that? And what would happen? And from the moment that this happened to sometime mid-Sunday until today, the Vice President has now brought all the donors back in plus $100 million and 30,000 volunteers. More has coalesced all of the Democratic leadership, and she is off to the races. I think a speech yesterday created the contrast that the people of America have been asking for. You know, people, if you look at all the polls didn't want Donald Trump or Joe Biden to be president. Now they have a different choice, and the choice could not be more different. The past versus the future, including people rather than escalating people, fighting for the working class or fighting for the rich. You know, the game is on. So let's go.",

He can't say a kind word about anybody. And that speaks a lot to whether or not somebody can actually lead the country.This guy, every chance he's given to say a kind word, literally, about anybody. I think even his dog, if he had one, or a dog, cat to be in his house. It's just incredible to me that he continues on this path of hatred and vitriol. That is not who the American people are. Secondly, I can't answer this question for the Vice President. She won't answer it, but I can answer it for me, because I've worked with him closely. He is absolutely ready to continue to do the job. Joe Biden will go down in history as being one of the most consequential presidents that we have had and has passed some of the most significant legislation that has actually put this country back on track. You know, all of the things that I'm about to tell you now, but just let me run through 15 million jobs, a stock market that's actually roaring. That's had five or six highs. You have the lowest unemployment rate that was seen in generations. You have wages that have gone up. We're actually rebuilding the country as we speak. Joe Biden promised to be a bridge to the future. He not only was a literal bridge, we're rebuilding 40,000 bridges in America. He was the functional bridge. And so he is going to -- he's going to run this through the tape. That's exactly where the focus ought to be. But Donald Trump, what he needs to be thinking about is Kamala Harris because she's coming for him. She's a prosecutor. He is a convicted felon. She fought crime. You remember crime actually went down in Joe Biden's administration with the vice president. It went up when Trump was there and he's a criminal himself. So he's going to have to answer for that, for that prosecutor. That's where she spent her life and she founds her jobs.",

Something President Clinton used to say is when you talk about we the people, who in your mind is in the word we. And the Vice President spoke about this yesterday.She said, if you want to know the difference between me and Donald Trump. Donald Trump is trying to create a past where people of color and women did not have equal opportunity. I'm trying to create a future for us all. And so that comment about DEI is not an accident.

That there are some people in this country, and I believe Donald Trump believes this, that not all of us come to the table of democracy as equals, that some of us are better than others, that some of us ought to be given benefits and other people ought to sit in the back.And if you're a woman, or you're a person of color, or you come from another country, you know what, it doesn't matter how many qualifications you have. So let's just be clear about this. Kamala Harris was a prosecutor. She got elected in San Francisco and fought crime, sexual abuses, and business fraud. She became the attorney general of California, which, by the way, probably is the largest law firm in the entire country. She then became a United States senator. She became the vice president and has served for four years. And for some reason, she is not as qualified as J.D. Vance, who has only held one office and hasn't been in office for less than 600 days. Therein lies the idea that no matter for women and people of color, no matter how much you do, no matter how great you are, no matter how high you jump, that's just not enough for us because we're not equal. Therein lies the issue of who is in the we of we the people and Kamala Harris is pretty clear that all of us are. And Donald Trump is like only some of us and I get to say.",

First of all, if you could just summarize, I mean, I know I just did broadly, but how this has become a thing, and in particular, taking what conservatives tried to use against the Vice President, even before she was at the top of the ticket, including that coconut tree thing, which is, I will tell our viewers, if you didn't already know, she was telling a story about something that her mother used to tell her and her sister about you didn't just fall out of a coconut tree.

So I have really seen a huge tide turn. And I think one thing that is interesting to remember is I think people like to say, oh, you know, you write about Internet culture or you know about Internet culture. But I think that that's kind of a misnomer because the Internet is culture. The Internet's more of a mirror that's reflecting back to us, what we're thinking, what we're, you know, wondering about, what we think is funny.
