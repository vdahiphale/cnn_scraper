Any moment from now, we're expecting the attorney general, Merrick Garland to announce a blockbuster lawsuit against Apple, yes, Apple, alleging the iPhone maker's practices and policies violate antitrust laws. We will bring that news conference to you live once it gets under way and we will just go right to it. So, stay tuned for that. But, first, Donald Trump running out of options, running out of time, with his nearly half-billion-dollar bond due in a matter of days. He has until Monday to pay the massive judgment from his civil fraud case, or some of his most prized properties could be seized, like Trump Tower. Sources say the former president is panicking, but it's not exactly clear why he can't come up with the bond at this point, because he has a history of bragging about his wealth. Listen to what he said back in 2015. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I'm really rich. I will show you that in a second. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, Trump can still try to find money from a number of sources. It's just not clear that he's going to be able to come up with half-a-billion dollars in time by Monday.He has said that he's been unable to get insurance companies to secure a bond based on property as collateral. They all want cash, and Trump does not have half-a-billion dollars in cash to put up here. He could also try to get money out of some of the properties he owns by going to banks and taking out mortgages, but there are complications with that as well. You still have to get someone who's willing to take out that much money, who's willing to take on that risk. Some of these companies already have debt on them, so that's another step for a financial institution to take on. And there's limited number of big financial institutions who will do business with the former president because of his history as being litigious and as a bad client. So he's blocked out of a lot of that market. I mean, his other possibilities is, he could try to sell a property, but there's really not enough time to pull that off. And he has been arguing that that would be unfair and harmful because he would have to do it at a fire sale. And if he were ultimately to prevail in any way, he would not be able to recover that asset and that money. So the clock really is ticking here. They're -- his big hope is that the appeals court will allow him to post a smaller bond or say he doesn't have to post any money until the appeal plays out. The attorney general's office, Trump, they have been making all these filings this week. The ball, though, is in the hands of the appeals court. Trump's due date to post this money is Monday. So, the big question is, does the appeals court act in time? Or does -- if they don't, does the New York attorney general's office on Monday take the initial first steps to try to seize some of his assets, including potentially Trump Tower, his penthouse apartment there, the hotel on the corner of Central Park in New York, or the family compound known as Seven Springs in Westchester just north of the city, Jim?",

And so this administration has made it a point to direct their attention and their law enforcement and their regulatory attention towards the tech sector and all of the big tech companies. This Apple case, I thought was really interesting, some of the things the attorney general said, because he went right after Apple's commitments to security and privacy. And those are two aspects of Apple's business and the iPhone that they purport to be a market leader, but also a leader in providing to their consumers security and privacy, in particular. So I think that point that the attorney general is making is really going to be one that Apple, when it defends itself in this suit, is going to come back at really, really hard.",

I mean, he's happy to take his supporters' hard earned money, and he's asking for it again. He's also used the RNC to fund some of his legal defenses. There's no one he won't go to for money.

Joe Biden has a substantial cash advantage, cash-on-hand advantage over former President Trump in the latest figures that are -- that are just out, in part because he is diverted -- Trump has diverted, I think, $10 million-plus of campaign contribution toward legal fees. And Joe Biden now is able to blanket the swing states with an advertising barrage that Trump can't match. The general feeling historically has been that paid media doesn't matter as much in the presidential election as in other elections, because there's so much other information that voters get. But there are exceptions, like 1996, when Bill Clinton did exactly this to Bob Dole. I look at this is kind of an important moment for Biden, when he's got this big advantage on the airwaves and whether he can see any movement in the polls. But I would say that the implications of this are probably less significant for the presidential race kind of tactically than the larger question of, you have a potential U.S. president who is in enormous financial strain and distress at this moment.",
