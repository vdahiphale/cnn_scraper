This is Smith's latest significant and aggressive move. It matters, because Meadows has firsthand knowledge of Trump's actions on several fronts. He was in and out of the Oval Office on January 6 as rioters were storming the Capitol. He was also on that infamous phone call that happened between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Remember, Trump wanted him to find more votes. Meadows was also in that bananas December 2020 White House meeting with Sidney Powell and others about election fraud claims. Meadows also visited a Georgia audit site at that time. And he sent e- mails to the Justice Department and officials there about unsubstantiated fraud claims. Meadows's attorney and the Justice Department are not commenting about the subpoena. We don't know how he'll respond. But it could set up a clash over executive privilege. I'm told that Meadows got his subpoena before former Vice President Mike Pence did, and he overnight is vowing to fight that one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The courts have taken a pretty broad view of this. So he's really playing at the edges of this. But look, this will likely go to the courts. I will notice -- I will note, though, that he -- when he was trying to avoid testifying before the January 6th Committee, he argued that he was part of the executive branch and, therefore, should not be compelled by Congress to testify.

A lot of people feeling pretty good about Joe Biden's record, if they're Democrats at this point, feeling like they have a strong case to make going into a re- election campaign. But at the same time, knowing his age is going to be a factor. It's going to be a factor in people's minds. It's going to be a factor in logistics. But you have Mitch Landrieu, the infrastructure coordinator for the White House, who was saying to a couple of Democratic mayors recently, yes, the president's age is something people want to talk about. But there are much more important numbers that they should be talking about, like COVID shots, like the unemployment rate, like jobs created.
