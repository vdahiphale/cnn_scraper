I'm Bianna Golodryga live in New York.The 2022 midterm elections have finally come to an end with a runoff victory for Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock. The Georgia pastor won a special election in 2021 and will now serve a full six-year term. He defeats Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, the former football star who had never held public office. Warnock's victory gives Democrats a 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Which means that they will have majorities in every committee. Walker's campaign was filled with gaffes and missteps. He was handpicked to run for the Georgia seat by former President Donald Trump and Republican strategists say his defeat is yet another nail in the coffin for Trump's influence. Walker was quick to concede the race after CNN and other news organizations projected Warnock's victory and the Senator addressed his supporters at his campaign headquarters in Atlanta late Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): And after a hard-fought campaign, or should I say campaigns, it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy. The people have spoken. HERSCHEL WALKER, U.S. REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE: One of the things I want to tell all of you is you never stop dreaming. I don't want any of you to stop dreaming. I don't want any of you to stop believing in America. I want you to believe in America and continue to believe in the Constitution and believe in our elected officials most of all. Continue to pray for them because all the prayers you've given me, I felt those prayers. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, two years ago, there was a question as to whether that was a one off, an anomaly for the Democrats. And the question of is this what shade of purple has Georgia turned? Can we now definitively say that Georgia is a purple state and are we looking at a deep red purple or, you know, I guess the question is what can Democrats glean from tonight's election? BERMANthe Democrats have now won three Senate races in two years. Raphael Warnock twice and Jon Ossoff who also won in 2021 there who was two years into a six year term. But one thing I want to point out, for all the glee that Democrats have in maintaining this Senate seat, in the gubernatorial race Brian Kemp, the Republican won handily. He won by nearly 8 points and Republicans won just about every other statewide race in Georgia this time around. The only race they lost was the Senate race where one big reason, according to many Republicans you talk to around the country, was this guy, Herschel Walker. It might be more of a candidate issue. So, it's a state that Democrats can and have won. Is it a state that they will start winning every time like Virginia, which is now seen as less purple, more blue? Hard to tell.",

Jackie Kucinich is the Washington bureau chief for the \"Boston Globe,\" and a CNN political analyst. April Ryan is a White House correspondent for The Grio and a CNN political analyst as well. Maria Cardona is a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator. Charlie Dent a former House Republican and a CNN political commentator. And Karen Finney is a CNN political commentator who was a senior advisor to Democrat Stacey Abrams in her 2018 campaign for Georgia Governor. A lot to digest here, panel. Welcome all of you. So, Jackie let me begin with you. The fourth election for Georgians in just two years' time here. There had been some concern going into this election about voter exhaustion especially given that the seat did not hold control of the Senate anymore. Yet people came out in droves, record numbers in early voting and even yesterday. What does that tell you the about where voters stand in this state?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you also have to look at what was at stake here for Democrats versus Republicans. The fact that Democratic spending was so high tells you that this was about a lot more than one Senate seat. It absolutely is. In addition to having 51 and a little bit more breathing room, so perhaps to neutralize a Joe Manchin or two, it also allows them to have subpoena power. To have committees that are not easily split which makes it so Republicans don't really have a say on -- they don't have to get bipartisan agreement to get a lot of stuff done on the committee level. This is good news for judges, for parts of Biden's agenda that doesn't -- doesn't involve the House, of course, because that is flipped. So, there was so much more at stake than even just one Senate seat for Democrats. And you saw that in the investment and in the way they were trying to mobilize every voter possible.",

And you have Atlanta and then you have the rest of Georgia. But what's happening is, people -- there's been an influx over the last 10 years. People coming for jobs, et cetera, to Atlanta.But when you look at Atlanta in these counties, in these cities, the choices have been clear. In the northern part of the state where Dalton, Forsythe, et cetera, it went to Herschel Walker. More Democratic populations, and the Atlanta area and Atlanta suburbs, Savannah, et cetera, you have more of a solid blue for Raphael Warnock. Leaving the state trying to come to grips with who it is as the population is swelling with new traditions and some of the old that include coming to grips with issues of race, voting rights, abortion, et cetera. There's an influx of a new mindset, some liberal in ways in college areas, but this is a state that still has to come to grips with the old and the new. And last night we saw that the new won over the old concept with the Trumpism and the mindset of Donald Trump and the Republican Party making way for a man who wants to bring the parties together. Who wants to heal divides. Who wants to deal with issues of abortion. Who wants to deal with issues of voting rights. Who wants to deal with people seeing everyone if they voted for him or not.",

      "sentences": "Well, I actually think the issues vis-a-vis the candidate quality are connected in a way that you really can't separate them. And what I mean by that is that voters went into this Georgia runoff frankly not all that different than they went into the midterm elections, with so many issues at the forefront of their minds. And front line first and foremost -- and this is something that a lot of pundits and reporters and frankly a lot of people in my own party got wrong. And Karen and April and I actually talked about this, and we were all in agreement that the issue of democracy, the issue of abortion, the issue of freedom and privacy and rights were absolutely going to be front and center, both in the mid- terms as well as in this Georgia runoff.And the reason why you can't really separate it from the candidate quality or the character of the candidate is because these candidates, and specifically in Georgia Herschel Walker as handpicked by Donald Trump, represented those key issues completely on the opposite and wrong side of history. But also, on the wrong side of where voters were going into the voting booth in Georgia as well as in the midterm election. And so, for example, when you had women who were absolutely worried about the economy and rising gas prices, they were also worried about their rights. And we had women tell us, look, the economy will come back, but my rights won't. And so, that is where you kind of see that the lack of candidate quality, integrity, moral character, really was integral in why these voters went into the voting booth to make the decisions that they made. Because they wanted somebody that was not going to take away their freedoms, that was going to be decent, that was going to represent the values that a lot of these voters felt traditional as American values and they clearly made a decision that they were not going to accept the extremist MAGA Republican agenda that so many of these Donald Trump handpicked election denying, abortion rights denying, democracy denying, constitution denying candidates represented.",

      "sentences": "It's a really excellent point. I mean, look, number one I think we should acknowledge that the state of Georgia is a fertile ground for Democrats today in part because it was Stacey Abrams who 10, 12 years ago was really looking at these demographic changes you were talking about with John and a little bit earlier in the panel. The increase in Latino voters, API voters, looking at women voters and looking at the places where you could increase, you know, the Democratic turnout.To the specifics though of the governor's race, you know, there were a couple of challenges. Number one, Stacey was running against an incumbent. That is always a challenge. In 2018 both were somewhat unknown. And so, I think part of the challenge here you did see in the general election something we haven't seen in a long time where you saw ticket splitters. You saw some people who voted for Kemp and may have actually voted for Warnock. We know that, you know, in that general election Walker underperformed Warnock's vote by about 200,000 votes and it's clear in this runoff election he was not able to close that gap. The other thing I want to mention that I think was at play here in addition to the things others have mentioned, is for African American voters, particularly African American men, there was a conversation going on around which of these two men is -- will -- do we want representing us on the national stage and in Washington, D.C.? Someone who's going to stand up and talk about wear wolves and vampires or someone who is a pastor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church and who has delivered for the state of Georgia and has, you know, really maintained his connection as a Senator. He's done all of the things that you would tell someone to do in terms of get back there every week and make sure that you're staying connected to the voters. He really did do that. And so, there was some different dynamics at play there as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly this should be a breaking point. We'll see if it is. But let's be very honest about what happened here tonight. Herschel Walker was an awful candidate. Had Republicans nominated -- and thank you Donald Trump for your unhealthful intervention. But had Republicans nominated somebody more conventional without all the baggage, somebody like Brad Raffensperger or Geoff Duncan. I tell you, that person would have won tonight. Absolutely would have won.But you nominate candidates, you know, who have allegations of domestic abuse, hypocritical on abortion. His own son says he was never involved in the lives of his children, some of whom we learned about in the campaign. There are residency issues. There are regular incoherent statements and we heard Herschel Walker. The most coherent he said during his campaign was his concession speech which was quite good. But you cannot nominate candidates who -- they cannot defy political gravity. I mean, these were disqualifying issues. And it's not just in Georgia. I mean, Trump's interventions in Pennsylvania, you know, Dr. Oz, you know, he's a good and honorable man but he never lived in the state. It was a problem. Everybody knew it. You know, Arizona, same problems with that candidate. Trump kept good candidates from getting in. So, Governor Sununu in New Hampshire and governor Ducey in Arizona. Look, people wanted me to run in Pennsylvania because they knew I could win in swing districts and win independence. But you know, I'm not going to run in the party right now where people have to be a Trumpian guy. Trump has caused enormous damage to the party. Until the Republican National Committee and the state committees wake up and realize that their job is to nominate electable candidates who do not offend independent and swing voters, if they're more concerned about pledging loyalty to Donald Trump and the art of winning, we're going to have more of this disaster. I hope this is the breaking point. It may not be.",

And we can go on, all the outrageous and outlandish things he's said over the years. But at some point, we talked earlier about a breaking point. I hope we've reached it. Because it's quite clear to me, he is unelectable. He is unelectable. So, the question for the Republican Party and the Republican base is do you really want to go through this again? You have to not only beat Trump, you have to beat Trumpism. You can't run as Trump like, oh, I love his policies, I just don't like him. That's not going to cut it. We're going to hear that from a number of these guys. But I'm looking to see the one who's going to stand up and take this on head on, by name, not sugar coat it and not try to, you know, mitigate the damage that this guy has done to the party and has made it so difficult.
