MIKE THOMPSON (D-CA): Well, it's very sad. Senator Feinstein was a legend. She was an iconic public servant. And she earned and held the trust of voters throughout California for many years. And that's because she cared. She understood the importance of the institution of representative government. And she worked tirelessly for the people of our state, and for the people of the United States of America.",

I've worked closely with her on a number of issues, gun violence prevention, certainly one of those, but to protect the environment.She and I carried legislation together that was signed into law that protected into perpetuity 375,000 acres on California's on North Coast. And she was just wonderful to work with. She was whip smart. She understood both the policy and the politics.

What -- I think everybody at this point knows that Senator Feinstein witnessed a double assassination that she -- I shouldn't say she witnessed it, but she dealt with it in the aftermath. And she was forged to steel after that.And she thought about at that time, the assault weapons situation. And then just strangely, when we got elected right in the early years, there was a terrible massacre at 101 California Street. And the two of us were shaking. This was in San Francisco. And as a matter of fact, one of my son's best friends perished in that. And she just said, we have got to ban assault weapons. And will you help me with it? I said anything. And I think one of my endearing memories is we said, we lifted each other. And I think I said to her or she said to me, I said, I'll take the short ones, you take the tall ones. And, you know, we were very different in many ways. Physically, she was very tall as I'm hardly even five feet. And we wouldn't stop and she wouldn't stop. And then Senator Biden, now President Biden said to us, look, I'm with you. And he said to Dianne, you have got to get 60 votes, or I cannot do it. And by God, she did. And it was really amazing, just amazing. And when we didn't get along, there were certain environmental issues we're our different sides -- we basically said to each other do no harm, you know.

And, you know, here is a woman who was forged into politics by gun violence and was able to lead. And then, sadly, the assault weapons ban expired in 10 years. And so we never did it again, couldn't get it done. But she never stopped trying.But I have to say, that was a huge passion. I also think, equal rights for women. When we came in, it was on the heels of Anita Hill. And we both felt very strongly that protecting a woman's rights and her right to choose and be respected for her decision, so all of that, you know, really was -- it was important. But, you know, she -- you have to be a generalist in this job. And she worked hard on wilderness protection in our beautiful state. So, you know, but I think for her, I'd have to say, the gun issue was a motivational force for her.",

I'm not going to retire, you know. I'm going to have a busy, productive, but, oh, well, she was not happy.She was mad, to be honest. Because to her, and she has told me this, we talked, and she has decided to run the last time we chatted about it. She talked to me. She said will you help me get up the electives? I said, of course. And she said -- this was after I had left. And she basically said, I -- a lot of people are telling me not to do this. But, you know, this job is a calling to me. She said to me, this job is a calling. And that's how she viewed it. SIDNER: And that's how she ran her life, her campaign, her work.

That's what he said at a fundraiser in Arizona. But White House officials have been saying for some time is that the onus is on Republicans. It is on them to avoid any type of government shutdown.And over the course of the last several days, they have been releasing a series of press releases highlighting the impact of this on federal workers and for Americans. That includes for example, at least starting today with small businesses, small business administration will stop processing new business loans in the event of a government shutdown. There will be delays in long term disaster recovery efforts. Those are those disaster relief funds that we talked about with FEMA. They have had to only focus on response and they've had to put recovery on hold as their coffers start to empty out, the risk of millions of women and children not receiving food assistance, and of course, millions of federal workers not receiving pay. Now there are functions of the government that will continue, for example, border enforcement, border patrol agents will have to continue to enforce the border, but they won't get paid for it. And so all of this is what the administration has been highlighting, and that federal agencies are bracing in for. In fact, just yesterday, they started to tell employees to brace for a shutdown telling them that they may be temporarily furloughed. Now at the White House to give you a little bit of a glimpse of what this looks like, senior aides at the White House are having to learn some of what the junior aides do because those junior aides may be furloughed. So that gives you a sense of just all the logistical challenges here as well as the very real impact for Americans across the country.",

But his argument is trying to pressure some of those conservative hardliners that if they don't rally around this short term spending bill, this conservative package that I laid out, you are basically voting with the Biden administration, that is going to be his argument, because he's trying to say that their bill includes strong border security provisions, provisions that the House already passed, provisions that conservatives have been fighting for.His argument is, if you don't vote for this short term spending bill, you're essentially saying you don't really want border security. And that is where the pressure point is for the Speaker right now. But so far, this argument that he's been making publicly and privately it has not moved the needle. We at CNN have counted eight hardliners who have said they are not going to vote for a short term spending bill, no way, no how, no matter what's in it. And they have held firm to that. So unless there's some miracle that happens in the next several hours, it appears that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's argument for unity is not resonating for some hardliners who want to try and oust the Speaker who want to force him potentially into a shutdown and force this issue of whether or not he can lead their conference.",
