Authorities in Gaza say the strike left three people dead, including the head of the Palestinian militant group, missile unit. And Palestinian militants are retaliating with rocket attacks on Israel, hundreds in the past two days according to the IDF. In all, at least 25 people in Gaza have now been killed in Israeli airstrikes since Tuesday, including several other Islamic Jihad commanders, as well as women and children. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now from Jerusalem with the latest. Elliott, are we expecting this fighting, these attacks to continue? ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: For now, we are, Bianca. There were rumors and hopes that an Egyptian brokered ceasefire might prevail late last night, but that didn't happen. There were about 8 1/2 hours of calm during which no rockets were fired by Islamic Jihad towards Israel. But the rockets are firing again from Gaza towards Israel. Israel is also carrying out airstrikes against targets in the Gaza Strip. And all managed by Islamic Jihad. Israel Defense Forces saying that it struck around about 160 sites belonging to Islamic Jihad. It says that more than 500 rockets have been fired towards Israel and that 379 of them went towards Israel with only six falling in populated areas. And of course, one of those targets that were hit by the IDF overnight using helicopters, drones and fighter jets was that of the commander who was in charge of Islamic Jihad's rocket firing unit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the nation last night and saying that Israel has dealt the hardest blow in its history to Islamic Jihad. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, we are still in the middle of a campaign. At this very moment, our forces are fiercely attacking the Gaza Strip and exacting a heavy price from the terrorists' organizations.

Meaning that his third bid for the White House will probably feel quite similar to the first two. Trump refused to answer a number of pointed questions directly. Such as, does he support a federal ban on abortion? Would he rather see Ukraine or Russia win the war. Trump also returned to his name calling tactics of past campaigns referring to CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins as a nasty person when she pressed him for answers and knocked down his false statements. [04:10:00] He also called the woman who accused him of rape a whack job just a day after a federal jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation.

She said, they listen to you and you know it. And Trump agreed with that. He said that's right. Now if you're a prosecutor, you're thinking, OK, there you go. That is the cleanest, clearest admission by Trump that he understands that his words have an impact on the actions of his followers. That to me is the best piece of evidence that we've seen so far on that. Then shifting to Mar-a-Lago there was a point -- and Trump has said things like this before -- where he said essentially, I took everything. I had the right to take all of it. One of the things that you have to establish as a prosecutor in that case is knowledge and intent. And right there he admits, I knew we were taking everything and, you know, he argues wrongly that he had the right to take it.

Consumer prices jumping by 4.9 percent year-over-year in April, that is the smallest increase in exactly two years. There have now been ten consecutive months of cooling prices. Unfortunately, though, the pace of the improvement has slowed. It's basically leveled out. Even though it's currently at a level that is more than twice what the Fed is targeting.Now on a month-over-month basis, inflation actually heated up between March and April, though a lot of that was driven by a spike in used car prices and that spike is not expected to last. Digging into the report there were definitely some positives here. A record price drop on an annual basis for major appliances and for health insurance. On an annual basis, used car prices are actually down. Grocery prices, they're still going up rapidly, but even that has cooled off. On the other hand, car insurance is up more than 15 percent over the last year. And this one is painful to me as a parent, daycare and preschool prices experiencing their biggest percentage spike on record. So, if you put it all together, inflation is clearly moving in the right direction but the pace of the progress has slowed. And it's still too early to declare victory on inflation. For now investors and economists, they are betting that this latest inflation report very much keeps alive the potential for a pause by the Fed in June. At last check there is about a 99 percent chance priced into the market that the Fed does nothing at all as far as interest rates go at the June 14th meeting. That is up from 79 percent a day ago. Still though, you know, there's one more jobs report and one additional inflation report due out before the Fed has to decide what it's going to do and as we've learned in this economy, a lot can change in a month -- Bianca.
