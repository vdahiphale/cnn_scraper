Look at that -- Fetterman got 62.9 percent -- almost exactly the same. That's a winning margin there.Hillary Clinton, OK, got just 59.6 percent, so almost a three percent difference. That can be the difference between winning and losing. And it's not just Delaware County, it's these other counties surrounding Philadelphia, too. Montgomery County, which is just to the north of Delaware, Biden got 62.6 percent; Hillary Clinton, 58.9 percent. Again, let's look at Bucks County, the most Republican of the counties surrounding Philadelphia. Biden, 51.7 and Hillary Clinton got 48.5. You can see that three-point difference or so in all the counties surrounding Philadelphia. One reason that's so important for Democrats to boost their results in the counties around Philadelphia, in Philadelphia County itself -- yeah, Biden cleaned up. He got 81.4 percent. But Hillary Clinton actually did better in 2016. So in the urban area itself with Philadelphia the Democrats might be slipping a little. It's the suburban areas where they're cleaning up. And just to give you a sense of how much that has changed over the last 20, 30, 40, 50 years -- a generational shift -- 2020, Joe Biden got 62.7 percent in Delaware County where they will be today. I'm going to go on the way back machine to 1988 before Kate Bolduan was born. George H.W. Bush got 60 percent. So Republicans used to win 60 percent in Delaware County and now it's the Democrats doing it and needing to do it if they want to win Pennsylvania, which they need to win the election -- Kate.",

JOCELYN BENSON, (D) MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE (via Webex by Cisco): Well, thanks for having me. And yes, we have been preparing, really, since that time for a resurgence of those same tactics in 2024. So we've been holding scenario-planning exercises all around the state because we realize that type of disruption might not just occur in Detroit. It could occur in Flint, in Benton Harbor, in other communities in our state. And so we have partnerships with law enforcement and first responders on the ground to ensure we're able to de-escalate or mitigate anything like that from reoccurring. We've also reminded people that our system is rooted in transparency. And so if you have questions about how we're -- you know, how paper ballots are being counted, become a poll worker is what we've invited people to do so you can watch and observe in a legal way without disrupting the process so that people know they have access to observing but can't disrupt.",

He is set to be arraigned in New York on Friday for federal sex trafficking and international prostitution charges.

We won't get into too many details about that but it's important to point out here that, like you just said, he resigned -- or rather retired from the CEO position at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in 2014. Prosecutors are alleging all of this, at least these charges that he's related to right here, is from December 2018 to March 2015.So they say he was using his influence, he was using his power, his wealth to do basically all of what is alleged in this indictment. And what is alleged is he and his romantic partner Matthew Smith, along with a third man who was considered sort of a middle man in this conspiracy -- that middle man would essentially recruit men from all around the world -- men who typically wanted to be a model -- wanted to further their careers in some sort of way with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch possibly -- and would groom them. Basically, have them try out to eventually meet with Jeffries and his romantic partner Matthew Smith. And they would attend these sex events. And at these sex events, according to the indictment, there was Viagra pumped into these men. There were some horrific things that they would have to do, including signing an NDA, wear costumes, and essentially perform sexual acts on both Jeffries and his romantic partner Matthew Smith. So a lot of grotesque details coming out in this indictment. And as you just said, he is going to be back in New York to face these charges. He was actually arrested in Florida along with Smith who is detained right now. Jeffries was released on $10 million bond yesterday, but they'll be back here on Friday to face a judge in New York.",
