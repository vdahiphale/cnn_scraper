Great to see all of you, guys. John, I know you have some great reporting on what happened with this attack, how it went down. How did the did the attacker get into the Pelosi home?

There is this person in the house, so on and so forth, and the operator is trying to glean this about where we are going here. And at one point, Heather Grimes, the 911 dispatcher, says, sir, are you okay? And he says, no, I'm not. And the training these operators have -- a lot of this comes from domestic violence where the offender is there and, you know, somebody is calling and they are trying to get the message across that I really need somebody.So, she takes that call, makes it a category A with a code 3 response, puts out on the MDT so those cops are reading the job exactly what was said, which doesn't make a lot sense but they are getting a sense that something is not right here and that this is the residence of Nancy Pelosi. So, when they come through the door, there are these two men holding the hammer. They're basically saying, okay, to both of them, put down the hammer. And Mr. Pelosi, Paul, lets go of the hammer. The other guy strikes him immediately, the suspect, and then they crossed the room and tackle the suspect. The rest is history. That phone call, he was very cool and managed to get the message across to save his own life. The 911 operator was very intuitive to figure out this is worse than it sounds.",

They pointed to a lot of things, but including the 261-page \"The Hard Reset\" document that went down on the site \"Terrorgram,\" which is a right-wing extremist chat room, that said, attack political meetings, attack political leaders, attack law enforcement on multiple levels, including violence, shootings and so on.

She says, I'm sorry to hear what happened today. Need to stop the conspiracy theories. Everyone needs to vote.

Last year, you chose an incredible woman named Shirley Raines for that top honor. She (INAUDIBLE) and serves people living with homelessness on L.A. Skid Row. So, before we kick off voting for this year's CNN hero of the year, we wanted to check on last year and give you a peek inside her big win night, the reaction from her Skid Row community, and what she has been up to.
