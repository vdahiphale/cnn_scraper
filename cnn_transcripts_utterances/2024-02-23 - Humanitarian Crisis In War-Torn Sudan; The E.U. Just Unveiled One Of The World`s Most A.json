MADOWO (voice-over):  They are overwhelmed that these mothers and their children have nowhere else to go. ASHIA ABUBAKER ADAM, DISPLACED SUDANESE MOTHER (through translator):  We are out of everything, even wheat. Now we just get insignificant amounts of food to make it through the day. I have five children apart from this one. MADOWO (voice-over):  Sudan has the world`s largest displacement crisis. The U.N. says as 15% of the population has fled their homes. Humanitarian workers say it is not getting enough funding or attention.",

DEPUTY HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR FOR SUDAN:  It is arguably the biggest humanitarian crisis today. It is bigger than the other crisis that gets a lot more attention. MADOWO (voice-over):  Everything is in short supply in Sudan, and a ceasefire appears unlikely. Those caught in the middle of another war worry and the wait. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The European Union recently announced one of the world`s most ambitious goals to tackleclimate change. It wants to cut 90% of its carbon pollution by 2040, that`s from 1990 levels. There`s a lot standing in their way. Farmers, for example, have been protesting for months against some of the E.U. strongest climate policies, because they say it`s too hard to keep food growing for their people if they have to do these new measures, like using certain types of fertilizers. Auto makers, for example, don`t want to phase out combustion engine cars quite as quickly as the European Union does. They want to get rid of combustion engine cars by 2035. And a lot of countries are saying that`s too soon. Another sticking point is defense. So Ursula von der Leyen, and the President of the E.U. announced she`s going to run for reelection. She made climate center of her agenda in her last term, but this term climate was largely missing from her agenda speech. And that`s largely because defense has really taken over the climate agenda in the last few months. So what happens next? The E.U. is notorious for taking months and months to get legislation finalized. This is going to be up to a year of talks to discuss exactly how to reach this 90% target. And while there`s broad support for that target in the current parliament, that all may change in June. There are elections coming up and the greens parties are expected to lose a lot of their seats to conservatives and even far right parties, that may not be so progressive and ambitious on climate. So what that will look like in the future? We`ll see. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "All right, everybody. Ten second trivia.Which country became the first European nation to establish a national parks system. Is it England, Sweden, France, or Germany? If you said Sweden, shout it from the nearest mountain top, it is Sweden. In 1909, the country designated nine areas of its country as national park, the first nation to do so in Europe. All right, speaking of Sweden, that`s where some we`re going to call them, brave, young students are taking a school course in a chilling situation. Quite literally, dozens of children, fully clothed are jumping into this frigid lake. Is this an ice sponge challenge? No, it`s actually part of the elementary school curriculum where it teaches kids survival training on what to do if they ever fall through the ice from one of the many lakes in the country. As you see students with big backpacks, strapped on, learn how to use ice spikes to help pull themselves out of the icy waters. These classes are gaining attention now with a rise in ice incidents in the country. All right, as you know, today is Friday and we couldn`t let you go the whole week without getting at least some FaceTime from our very own Coy Wire. Recently, Coy had a chance to speak with a bunch of celebrities who graciously offer some tips for success specifically for you. Check this out.
