And what happened was the security people made a sweep. They got very upset that there were three mortals on this floor as just three men standing in a hotel room. So I scampered to hide to make sure that if they pulled Arnett and Holliman out and took them downstairs into custody, at least there would still be one CNN person on the air. John?",

But I was able to do it at least. And these security fellows also took some of the videotape out of one of our cameras. They say we`ll get it back tomorrow. I`m a little skeptical that we will, but it was the beautiful pictures that we took to go along with the commentary that you heard earlier tonight on CNN.",

BUSH, PRESIDENT: Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Ground forces are not engaged. Tonight, 28 nations, countries from five continents, Europe and Asia, Africa and the Arab League have forces in the Gulf area standing shoulder to shoulder against Saddam Hussein. These countries had hoped the use of force could be avoided. Regrettably, we now believe that only force will make him leave. I`ve told the American people before that this will not be another Vietnam. And I repeat this here tonight, our troops will have the best possible support in the entire world. And they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back. We have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety. Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq. It is the liberation of Kuwait.",
