Now of course, what we've seen over the last few months actually, going back to 30th July, is Israel has been targeting systematically senior members of Hezbollah's particularly military wing.

The CPI - Consumer Price Index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months ending in September, similar to where it was during the pandemic. There you are. You see, maybe just marginally elevated, but pretty much where it was. This is the last look at CPI before the US election. The economy is a key issue according to Gallup. Fifty-two percent of people say the candidates' positions are extremely important, which is the largest share since the 2008 financial crisis. Rana is with me, Rana Foroohar, to put this into context. So look, I had an interesting discussion because when my producer said 2.4 percent or whatever, I said, well, yes, but that's still nearly a quarter higher than the target. And so the target was -- they were already above the target when the whole thing -- when pear-shaped. Will the Fed be happy with 2.4 percent?",

Okay, maybe it is not quite target yet, but look at what we've done with all of these headwinds coming at us and there is a lot to be said for that. In particular, I think they are going to be pointing that shelter has eased up, rents, housing. That is one of those pain points that people really feel. And so you're going to hear them talking a lot about that. But on the other hand, when you strip out food and energy, core CPI was actually up, and as you say, it is still not at target. So you already hear the Trump campaign saying, oh, my gosh, it is going to be disaster if we let this White House continue. I personally think that we are in a pretty good place. I think this is better than I would have expected. It gives a little fuel -- it is a little bit of fuel to those who might have said, oh gosh, we shouldn't have done well that big half- percentage-point cut in September.
