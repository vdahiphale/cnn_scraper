But one of Trump's longest-serving and most-trusted aides disputes that. Dan Scavino, posting on social media, quote, \"Just spoke to President Trump regarding Mike Rogers going to the FBI. It's not happening. In his own words, quote, 'I have never even given it a thought.' not happening.\" So Rogers does appear to want the job, seeming to pitch himself today on FOX. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE ROGERS, (R), FORMER MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN: People have lost faith in the FBI and they don't even know it. Not showing up for a Senate hearing, they think, is their -- I mean, that hubris is exactly what people are seeing outside that say, I have lost faith in the FBI. Somebody like me, I can -- I can restore that faith. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

DANIEL BRUNER, PRESIDENT, THE BRUNER SIERRA GROUP &amp; FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Thank you for having me on, Brianna. And you have to understand that, you listen to the people, yes, I think there are people -- there's a -- there's a large voice out there that are they're saying they've lost faith in the FBI. But I think a lot of those -- that loss of faith is based upon negative conversations. And of course, just like anything else, a lot of the negative things that come out about the FBI, you know is not discussing about a large a lot of the triumphs of the FBI. Without a doubt, any organization is going to have room for improvement. I think the FBI needs -- has got room for improvement. Of course, I think that there is -- a change in management, a change in leadership, a change in style is a good thing. And you can always bring in new voices, new ideas. I think under the -- under Director Wray and deputy director, Paul Abbate, I think the FBI has had great direction in the last seven and a half years. But if the changes are warranted by President-Elect Trump, I think bringing in the right people who can make change, but yet not destroy the institution are good ideas.",

So he may decide to go after the case agent, who was the leader of that investigation, and then anybody else involved. You've got thousands of employees, analysts, support staff, other agents, other divisions who may have assisted in that investigation because they we're tasked to do that. I need you to write this report. I need you to write this intelligence. Those individuals that he has threatened, he will go after anybody that supported those investigations or assisted in those investigations. He could go after these individuals and revoke their security clearance. That seems to be one of the threats that he's been supporting. And deciding to completely revamp -- you know, completely flatten the FBI institution and rebuild it. He has no experience in law enforcement. He has no understanding of how a law enforcement agency is to be built. So that's where I think it's dangerous if he comes in and decides to flatten the organization, in his words, and to rebuild a law enforcement agency how it should be. Those are his words. I don't think he understands what a law enforcement agency should be. So I think it would be very dangerous.",

We're going to examine that next on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:41:37] SANCHEZ: Ultra-processed foods make up nearly 70 percent of the American diet and they've been linked to all sorts of health problems. Sodas, processed meats, and sugary cereals are just a few examples. But the list also includes things you probably didn't think of, plant milks, packaged breads, for example. Right now, researchers are studying how these foods may be affecting your health. Meg Tirrell spoke to people involved in that study, and she joins us now live. Meg, what did you learn?",

And you can try to derive some linkages based on that information.But to really prove some sort of causal effect of ultra-processed foods and their ingredients on health or behaviors, you have to keep them in a really controlled environment. So we went down to the National Institutes of Health to see how they're doing that. Take a look.

(on camera): Oh, I think your food is coming in. And we saw the kind of food he got and -- eggs and spinach and yogurt. But we don't know. That could be processed. It could be unprocessed. That's part of the trial. (voice-over): Ultra-processed foods contain additives and ingredients you wouldn't find in your own kitchen. They were shown in the previous NIH study to drive overeating and weight gain, according to researcher Dr. Kevin Hall. (on camera): Are ultra-processed foods just junk foods? DR. KEVIN HALL, SENIOR INVESTIGATOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: What we often think of as junk foods probably captures a big chunk of the ultra-processed foods in a kind of a category. But there's a lot of things that people would be surprised are in the ultra-processed foods category and could potentially be healthy for you. So things like whole-grain breads that you might buy from the supermarket. Most of those are considered ultra-processed because of some of the additives and preservatives that are in there, as well as how they're manufactured. But there's a lot of debate about whether or not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you. TIRRELL (voice-over): And that's what this trial is trying to find out.",

(on camera): This is where they prepare all of the food. And they don't just prepare it; they weigh it before it goes up and when it comes back after the participant has eaten. (voice-over): Each day participants in the trial are offered a total of 6,000 calories and researchers measure how much they choose to eat. The trial is a month long and each week has a different diet, minimally processed or different kinds of ultra-processed.
