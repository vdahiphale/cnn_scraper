Of course,since the war began Turkey has been one of the most outspoken Middle Eastern countries when it comes to Israel. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called Israel a terrorist state, called the Prime Minister a war criminal but when it comes to Hamas, the tone is noticeably different. And when I spoke to Erdogan's Chief Advisor for Security and Foreign Policy Akif Cagatay Kilic, he went out of his way to stress that look, Turkey does not support in any way the killing of innocent people on either side of the conflict. But beyond that, there was no direct criticism of Hamas. Turkey does not consider Hamas a terror group. It has a permanent presence in Turkey. And there are even unconfirmed reports that suggest that the Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh may have been in this country on October 7th when the attack began. I asked Kilic much about that. But one of my most pressing questions was the one that you alluded to Eleni. And that is what Israel has said and the Domestic Security Chief, and his vow to take out Hamas wherever they are, whether that's in Lebanon, Qatar or right here in this country? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, it's pretty far reaching what has been said from the Israeli side, that they would be basically assassinating people in other countries I mean, this is basically a no go and unacceptable on any terms.

They actually take a sample of the cancer. They sequence it. They decide using artificial intelligence what the best combination of mRNA signatures should be. And then they give the individualized treatment to the patient. They train their immune system to better fight the cancer. And they're doing this on top of very powerful immunotherapy drug that's already approved called KEYTRUDA. And what they found at this three year follow up is that that combination reduced the risk of the cancer coming back or patients dying by almost half. And this is really important that we have three year data now because it's showing that this treatment actually is durable. Previously, we only saw a two year follow up. Now in terms of the side effects here, they're actually pretty similar in terms of the most common ones to what you get with the COVID vaccine fatigue, injection site pain and chills. And I was talking with Moderna CEO this morning, Stephane Bancel, and he was saying the company is preparing potentially for this to be available as soon as 2025. They're building a new manufacturing plant here in the United States in Massachusetts to be ready, potentially that soon. And melanoma isn't the only thing they're pursuing here. They're also starting late stage trials in a certain kind of lung cancer as well. So there's a hope of course, this really opens up better ways of fighting cancer really on a personalized level.",

It is happening on the Voyager 1Spacecraft which is exploring the outer reaches of our solar system. Now Voyager's flight data system appears to be stuck on auto repeat, meaning the spacecraft is sending the same information back to Earth over and over again. Voyager can still receive commands from the mission controls. And NASA is still trying to figure out what caused the problem before deciding what to do next. Red Bull, Formula One's best team in recent years is trying to push the boundaries again, this time with a pit stop in pitch black darkness. We've got Amanda Davies with us who's going to explain how this is going to work and why they're going completely dark?",

You know Red Bull until a couple of months ago held the world record for pit stop, which was 1.82 seconds. McLaren did beat them in Qatar is now 1.80. But this is 22 individuals and just an indication of how incredible they are as a team. They practice firstly with tape over their visors. They then had 10 attempts, 22 individuals working together from 10 seconds which was where they started. They managed to nail it in 2.84. A lot of teams and a lot of races we'd be more than happy with that in a race situation with the lights on. But I guess you know if you're winning and you're breaking new records, how do you find ways of keeping it interesting? You do this but yeah, absolutely incredible to see.",
