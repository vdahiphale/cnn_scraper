MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): ... not debate but to listen both to the case against the accused and to his defense. At this point in any trial in the country, the prosecution presents the evidence of the case, counsel for the defense does the same, and the jury remains silent as it listens. This is what our rules require of us as well. But the Senate has not had the opportunity to perform this duty. The Senate will not hear the House Managers present the details of their case against Secretary Mayorkas - that he willingly neglected the duties of his office and that he lied to Congress about the extent of that failure. Likewise, we will not hear the secretary's representatives present the vigorous defense to which he is entitled. Our colleagues know that we are obligated to take these proceedings seriously. This is what our oath prescribes; it's what the history and precedent require, and I would urge each of our colleagues to consider that this is what the Framers actually envisioned. The power of impeachment is one of the most delicate balances our constitutional system strikes with a portion of the American people's sovereign electoral authority. It purchases a safeguard against malpractice, and it gives the Senate the power and the duty to decide. This process must not be abused; it must not be short-circuited. History will not judge this moment well. Therefore, I move to table the point of order and ask for the yeas and nays. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): Is there a sufficient second?",

There is a component of this that it provides aid to Ukraine, a component that includes aid to Israel, and a component that includes aid to the Indo-Pacific region.But altogether, that funding adds up to about $95 billion. There is one small change and that about $10 billion of this funding is actually a repayable loan to Ukraine. There is a catch, though. The president, in a couple of years, can forgive that loan entirely, but that was put in there because the loan idea was something that former President Donald Trump had suggested that he would be supportive of.

They wanted to block Chuck Schumer from moving ahead. That all failed.The Democrats killed those Republican efforts to try to essentially end their push to end the trial altogether. Now, they're voting on what Chuck Schumer put forward. That is essentially to say this first article of impeachment that was put forward by the House should be essentially dismissed. The procedural vote is basically that - it says, \"Is the constitutional point of order well taken?\" That is the question before the Senate. So they vote yes. They essentially are voting to kill this article of impeachment. So that's what we expect to see. And we do expect this to happen along party lines as all the other votes have happened so far. That'll be a surprise if anybody breaks ranks at this point, we will see. Now that they're voting on the merits, maybe there will be a member who disagrees with what the House put forward and the Republican side may decide to defect. Maybe there will be a Democrat who is in a swing state and wants to show alliance with the Republicans on this. We'll see. Those are some of the questions that we have to ask here. There's no question about the outcome, though. This will succeed. This effort to kill this article of impeachment will succeed by the Democrats. And then they'll try to move on to the second article of impeachment, to try to stop and essentially throw away that second article of impeachment. And then we will see how the Republicans respond. If they do the same thing they did before, try to procedural vote after procedural vote to try to delay it, delay it, delay it, until we get to the ultimate outcome.

But one thing I think we should keep in mind, and we're kind of seeing this live, and that is - and it's particularly true for the Republicans - if you take the sword, you die by the sword.Sen. McConnell said not too long ago, well, there's an obligation to hold a trial. Keep in mind, back in 2016, when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, Democrats pleaded with McConnell to have a hearing and to allow for a vote, and McConnell didn't allow for anything. Well, that's coming back now, in a sense, to haunt him. There's no obligation that the majority has to do anything more than it's doing. And it's not obliged to conduct a full trial like Republicans want. Instead, they can consider the possibility of debate. Sen. Schumer held open that possibility at the beginning today. But once Republicans shut that down, they now have to live by the rules, and the rules allow points of order to kill it as quickly as possible, and that's what the vote is on right now.",

I really wonder whether the institutional play here is to do what Schumer is - what Sen. Schumer is doing.I've been thinking about, in 1999, senators from - on both sides of the aisle understood that the offenses - the articles of impeachment against President Clinton did not reach the level of - for removal and the leaders then, the minority leader, Tom Daschle, the majority leader, Trent Lott, worked together to streamline a process to get this done fast without destroying the sort of the process of impeachment and they did it. What's really interesting to me is it looks like Sen. Schumer and Mitch McConnell - Sen. McConnell, haven't really reached an agreement. They both seem to understand that this particular impeachment does not reach the level of seriousness for a full fledged deep trial.

They want to put it under the rug they're trying to blame Joe Biden, blame the Democrats for the handling of the - what's happening in the situation of the border with Mexico saying that essentially - knowing that this is a central issue in the campaign which is what the arguments are trying to make here on the Senate floor.The Democrats want nothing to do with this they say that this is an impeachment that is - that lacks any real merit to charging someone with a high crime and misdemeanor over a policy dispute they say is simply unprecedented. It's something that's - and they call it a dangerous precedent and they really don't seem to be too concerned about any political backlash. As you can see from the votes, there have been expectations this would be vote along party lines. That's exactly what happened in the 51-48 one vote. Yes, Lisa Murkowski registering her objections voting present which is interesting, it shows you where she views her party she's been very outspoken and critical of particularly folks on the far right of her party and the Trump aligned wing of GOP. But Democrats are making no qualms about voting to dismiss this altogether not worried about the political ramifications because there have been a lot of pressure on Sen. Jon Tester in particular, the Montana Democrat in a swing state, someone who could, who is battling to hang on and millions of dollars will be spent. Immigration will be a key part of that fight but he voted with Chuck Schumer on this issue. He believes as the other vulnerable Democrats who voted for killing that first article of impeachment, they believe that they could be on a higher ground on immigration because Republicans just a few months ago killed a bipartisan border security deal that they said would actually have fixed some of the problems in the southern border of Mexico. Republicans disagree with that and the way they handle that will be litigated in the campaign, but they believe - Democrats believe they have an issue. And look, we talk about the politics of this because that is really was driving so much of the strategy here. Republicans want some ammunition to use against Democrats in the heat of this campaign season and Democrats seem to be fine with the votes that they're taking which is to kill this impeachment proceeding. They did in Article I, it's going to happen soon on Article II we'll see how much longer Republicans, though, decide to prolong this by pushing their own points here on the floor of the Senate, yes.",

Part of the reason that Speaker Johnson brought up that border bill was because of pressure from members of your conference that have argued that there should be some kind of legislation making the border a priority before even a single dollar, according to Marjorie Taylor Greene, goes to Ukraine or allies of the United States abroad. Folks like Greene, Bob Good, I'm trying to think of a few others that Manu spoke to previously, have said that they are going to oppose that bill, that they don't believe that it actually addresses the problems at the border. They - several of them have told our reporters that they would support vacating Speaker Johnson over this. Your reaction to where they stand from the view of this border bill potentially passing and even possibly costing the Speaker's job?",

      "sentences": "Well, A, I will not support any kind of motion to vacate and the vast majority of this conference do not support that. Remember, the only way that you're going to be able to vacate the speaker is by having vast Democrats support. You're going to have a small number of Republicans maybe support the motion to vacate but they need all the Democrats in order to make it happen. And so we'll see whether where the Democrats lie with that.As far as the border is concerned, look I believe that we should know border security packages that actually mandate certain things. But to be frank with you, the only way we're going to get this border under control is with a new president because president Biden has for the last three years on purpose caused this entire calamity which is the southern border through a series of executive actions which we have told them time and time again you need to reverse those actions in order to get this border under control. He has refused and then you see the consequences right now. So even if we pass a border security bill, the strongest one ever, the - it's up to the President to see if he's actually going to enforce the things that we want him to enforce. So far he's not willing to do that and so I don't have high hopes for any legislation coming out of congress that will help the - to secure the border. It's up to the president to undo the things he did in order to secure this president - to secure the border.",
