General, I just want to ask you, if you think Vladimir Putin's calculus here was that Joe Biden could deliver the release of Vadim Krasikov for Germany but that Donald Trump was not going to be able to do it if he ends up winning the election. Do you think that factored into this timing? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, RETIRED: I think it could have factored into the timing, yes. Because apparently, this man is really important to Vladimir Putin. You know, the intelligence assets, that's his prize. That's what he came out of. That's what he's groomed. That's what he's using, really, in this hybrid war against the West. So this man probably has secrets. He probably has things that could have been revealed. He obviously didn't reveal them. If he did, we're not going to talk about it. And he's back in Russian hands. We'll see what happens to him back there. And maybe a hero or maybe he'll disappear somehow.

That was a failed attempt by Iran. And this was obviously tremendously embarrassing that Israel was able to strike in the heart of Tehran, in the middle of the president coming to power there. And so I don't know what they're going to do. Obviously, the hope is that we don't see escalation. But, you know, look, Israel is doing exactly what the United States, not only would have done, but did do. We moved heaven and earth to get Osama bin Laden. We did the same thing with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who just took a deal the other day, and perpetrators of 9/11. For Israel, 10/7 was their 9/11. So the idea that they're taking out the head of Hamas is -- you know, is how this goes. And it's how we saw it in America after 9/11. No one in the world is going to miss him. He's a murderer. The same thing for the second in command of Hezbollah. He also was a murderer, killed hundreds of Americans. And so the world is a better place that these folks are gone. But obviously, we don't want the region to turn into a powder keg. But we should realize that everything that's going on right now, what's going on in Gaza, what's going on in Lebanon, is all being -- the strings are being pulled by Iran. And so we need to continue to build a coalition with our allies in the region, Israel and beyond, to keep Iran at bay, to make sure they don't get a nuclear weapon. Anyone who is curious about what would -- that would be like, only take a look at the last several -- the last year, basically, of what that would be like.
