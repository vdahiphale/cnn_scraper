And they -- we only have one race outstanding on the map now that's gray here, that's in Georgia for that December 6 runoff.So there is no path to the majority anymore for Republicans. Democrats haven't. How did we get here? Democrats needed to hold their own. They were in the majority, they had 50. And their mission critical was hold what they've got. Yes, it would be nice to expand that, but hold what we've got. And so, how they got here was that Maggie Hassan up in New Hampshire really soundly defeated Don Bolduc in an 9 percentage point rates there in New Hampshire. That was the first one of their vulnerable incumbents to get called, OK? Then, in another key contest, John Fetterman in Pennsylvania defeats Mehmet Oz. This is a pickup for the Democrats. And so now they have a little cushion that if indeed one of their incumbents fall, they are still going to be able to be in the majority. Now we were lingering on Arizona and Nevada for quite a long time. Mark Kelly last night was projected to win the Senate race defeating Blake Masters in Arizona. And that brings us to tonight's drama in Nevada, Wolf.",

Catherine Cortez Masto is 4,822 votes ahead of Adam Laxalt. We have projected she is going to win this race. She's going back to the United States Senate.How did it happen? Well, first of all, up here in Washoe County in the Reno area, earlier this week, Wolf, Adam Laxalt was winning this county. This was red in the first day after the election or so. And then it flipped to blue as more votes came in. You see here 50.3 percent in this county to 46.9 percent. So a little more than a 3 percentage point margin in what has been a bit of a battleground county in Nevada politics. But it was down here in Clark County, in the Las Vegas area, Wolf, that delivered Catherine Cortez Masto her victory today because we were waiting for those 22,000 votes from Clark County, the largest county, the population center Las Vegas. Three quarters of Nevadans in the state live in Clark County. And Donald -- Joe Biden won this county by more than 9 percentage points just two years ago against Donald Trump when he won this state. So when we got those votes in, and we saw that Catherine Cortez Masto won 60 percent of them, if not more, she put herself in position to be projected the winner because it was such a large vote share. And whatever else is going to come in, we determined there was no way that Adam Laxalt was going to be able to catch up.",

You see here, 52 percent for Hobbs Inside Maricopa County to roughly 48 percent for Kari Lake. So when we get that 85,000 additional votes from Maricopa tomorrow, we should watch carefully to see is, Kari Lake hitting her target? Is she getting 55 percent of that vote? Or is she getting more like 48 percent of the vote, which is what she has now America. But because if that's all she's taken in, it's not going to be enough to overtake Katie Hobbs.

So the fact that they're leaving in 10, they could lose three of the races they're currently leading in and the Republicans can still have the majority. What is clear, Wolf, is that when all these races settle, if it is the need of Republican majority or Democratic majority, it's going to be an extraordinarily narrow majority. But we can't call the House yet, because we have not mathematically eliminated the chance that Democrats could potentially, potentially, it's a reach, could get those 14 seats and up in the majority.

And, you know, I think what we're seeing here, and we'll see how the house shakes up is that this Congress is looking like whether or not Republicans take the majority or not, it will be a slim majority either way. And that means people are going to have to work together to ensure that we're providing for folks.But what I want to see Democrats do is not come to the negotiating table already at the compromise. You know, we have a mandate in this country to fight for the future. We believe in a future where everybody has health care or people live free of gun violence. And I really believe there's a bipartisan way to get there. But it's important that we stick to our values, and really rally the American people around them.",

And I think a huge way of doing that, in the general sense, is just electing young people at the office across the country. And look, I'm not one of these people that believes that we need to just only have young people we may have a diversity of opinion. But right now we're lacking.",
