Well, it's the second day of a fresh round of ceasefire talks in Doha, after what Qatar's Prime Minister describes as, quote, sensitive negotiations on Thursday. These talks coming at a critical time, not just for Gaza, where the death toll from the war passed 40,000 yesterday, according to health officials, but also for the wider Middle East, with the looming threat of retaliation against Israel by Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Of note, Qatar's Prime Minister called Iran's Acting Foreign Minister on Thursday to update him on the talks, a possible signal that Iran's actions will be influenced by what ultimately happens in Doha. Jomana Karadsheh connecting us today from the Qatari Capital and the talks still going a good sign. But what do we know about the sticking points at this point?",

A Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank has come under a devastating attack, meantime, by heavily armed Israeli settlers. According to Israeli Palestinian officials, dozens of settlers set fires and threw rocks and molotov cocktails in the town of Jit. The head of the town council says it was like nothing there that he has seen before. Palestinian health officials say a 23-year-old Palestinian man was killed. Top Israeli officials have condemned the attack. CNN's Nic Robertson is in the West Bank with the very latest. And Nic, can you describe what you have witnessed there?",

And the two men who lived in this house, they tried to hold the settlers back. They couldn't. The car was set on fire. It was actually burning next to the house here, but a track. They bought a tractor in to move the car away so didn't set the house a light. We've looked at a house up the street here, where the family was sitting drinking orange juice in the kitchen. The settlers came around the corner of the hill, threw rocks, through the windows, they said, threw molotov cocktails, petrol bombs through the windows. The kitchen is totally burnt out. I mean, the light fittings are dripping plastic on the floor. The furniture is all completely burnt. The refrigerator is ripped open that's burnt. Just over the hill here, and this sort of mountain top village of Jit in the occupied West Bank, that's where Rasheed Seda the 23-year-old young man was killed. Several other houses were burnt over there. And when we arrived in the village here just a few hours ago, it was right in the middle of Rasheed Seda's funeral procession. He was being carried shoulder high by the young men of the village, wrapped in a Palestinian flag. The older men of the village lining the roads, watching them go by. There was a huge amount of anger, as you can imagine, not only against the settlers, but against the Israeli government, and also a lot of pain his father, Rasheed's father was literally, physically, physically being helped to walk up to the street. And at the grave site, there were orations for Rasheed and the local officials were speaking. And the absolute clarity from them, despite what they're hearing from the Israeli government. The defense minister condemning the settler attack. The interior minister calling it a nationalist attack and condemning it. Despite hearing all that, they feel that the Israeli Defense Forces, they say, we're protecting the settlers, not them, they feel in a very threatened and vulnerable position right now and frightened. So, they don't feel that they have the support of the Israeli government to defend them from the settlers. They believe that they're working in cahoots together. Now the IDF did manage to prevent a second attack on the village, but that really doesn't make anyone here feel any safer. And of course, this comes, as you say, and Jomana is explaining these very sensitive talks around Gaza. And when you ask people about that, they think this settler violence is intended to sort of really destabilize the situation in this very sensitive time.",

It may be that the Israeli government doesn't choose to listen or observe those red lines. But certainly, working with their other Arab partners in this region, they're being encouraged to draw red lines around settler violence. This is not the first instance and I've talk to a regional ambassador about this with earlier settler violence not long after the October 7th attacks, very bad violence back then as well, deadly violence, in fact. And he said, look, what we're urging our allies to do is to be very loud and very clear diplomatically, to make these red lines clear. You know, we know that the United States has sanctioned a tiny, tiny, tiny handful of settlers. Many people will say that doesn't go far enough, but it's trying to draw the red lines to make it clear for the Israeli government. And I think we got a sense of this yesterday from the U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew who called these attacks appalling, and he said they absolutely must stop now. You know, there's no amount of U.S. pressure that apparently so far, has caused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to turn back the military operations inside of Gaza that have killed now more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza. So, when it comes to settlers, and the amount of pressure that international diplomats are trying to apply to Israel -- you know it does seem that the settlers are able to continue to act. They are generally fairly well known the places on the particular settlements that have a reputation for precipitating this type of violence. And it wasn't the neighboring settlement here, but another group of settlements. They are well known, and it will certainly be the view of people in this village and in the Palestinian authority and other places that greater action could be taken. You know, look, let's see if the words of David Lammy can make a difference, or Jack Lew can make a difference in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with government officials there. But that's what they want to see, and it's certainly what the people here want to see. Tougher action on those particular settlers.",

At this stage, they say they have advanced more than 21 miles through Russia's defenses, more than thousand square kilometers that have been taken under the control of Ukrainian forces 82 settlements. So, this is a significant feat just across the border from Ukraine. We've been hearing from officials in Ukraine saying that what they're trying to establish here is what they've described as a sort of security buffer zone inside Russia to protect Ukraine's border regions. And earlier today, we heard from an aide to President Zelenskyy.

But the question really is -- what is the end goal here for the Ukrainian forces? But also, what could this mean in terms of Ukraine's ability to actually hold on to these particular territories, if indeed, Russia is moving several thousands of troops to the Kursk Region? We know, of course, from U.S. officials, that they believe that this has been a significant surprise for Russia. It's certainly been a point of embarrassment for President Putin. But according to U.S. officials have spoken to U.S. effort to CNN. They don't really believe that Ukraine has the ability to hold on to these territories for very long. And they're really at this stage uncertain about how this could affect the broader outcomes of the war. What Ukraine can actually gain from trying to take these territories along the border.",

The question, of course, will remain how she would be able to get any of them passed or signed if she were to be elected, but for right now, she's talking about things like a $25,000 credit for first time homeowners, a tax credit, a child tax credit, that would be renewing something that existed for the first couple of years under the Biden Administration for parents of young children. The expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which affects a lot of poor Americans, and then things like crackdown on price gouging in supermarkets. This is an attempt for Harris to say that she knows that Americans are still feeling the pain of inflation and of not feeling like their dollar is going as far as it was, even though all the economic indicators basically say that things are in a much better place than they were when Joe Biden came in.

She is one of five people facing charges related to Perry's fatal ketamine overdose in 2023. She pleaded not guilty, but she is considered a flight risk.

There is also an FDA approved version of ketamine, known as Esketamine. The brand name is Spravato, that's made by Johnson and Johnson, and that is approved for treatment resistant depression. But there's also this sort of wild west of off label use of ketamine, the anesthetic version of ketamine that is used for all kinds of mental health disorders through clinics used for depression, anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain, even things like Lyme disease, where doctors are arguing that this really has not been tested or shown to be safe and effective, but it is increasingly being used quite a lot. So, there is concern about the use of this drug. It also, of course, is used recreationally, and there are data showing that in the United States, seizures of illicit ketamine have been increasing over the years.

It's a mixed open that said here on \"Connect the World\". We do like a bit of nuance and context. So, we are asking you to think back 11 days when stock markets were frankly freaking out and were clearly fearful. The world's biggest economy was heading for a recession with quite a contrast to this week with a string of reports painting a picture of a more solid U.S. economy But even after some reassuring data, what if so many people in the U.S. feel strapped to keep in mind, prices in general aren't coming down. Cooling inflation figures just tell us that prices are rising less quickly than before, and the signs are that housing has become, frankly, unaffordable for millions of Americans. CNN's Matt Egan joining me now from New York, to put all of this in context. And it is important to remember, we've seen these better-than- expected U.S. economic reports, this week suggesting fears of a possible recession were overdrawn.

It is absolutely true that lifehere in America, and frankly, many countries around the world, life is so much more expensive than it was just a few years ago, groceries, rent, car insurance, day care, prices have no doubt gone up, but it is also true that the rate of inflation has eased. So no, it doesn't mean that prices are going down. They're going up at a more gradual pace, and that is good news. That is very good news. I mean, in some ways, that's actually the best-case scenario all along, was that not that prices would plunge, but that they would just go up at a more gradual pace, and that, that would happen without the jobs market imploding. And so that is why there is reason to be encouraged by the state of the U.S. economy. But here's the problem with inflation. It is cumulative, and so that is why people do feel frustrated. And some people, not everyone, but some people are struggling to pay the bills because they are feeling the impact of not one price hike, but years of price hikes. And as much as a lot of us miss those pre covid prices, we're not going back to them in most cases, and that's just not going to happen. You mentioned the jobs market, Becky. Two things are true on that front too. It's absolutely true that the unemployment rate has gone up and there are cracks in the jobs market, and hiring has slowed, and that is concerning to some extent. But it's also true that there's no imminent recession in sight. I haven't talked to any economists who are worried about something imploding in the economy right now. It's something to keep an eye on, but there's no sign of an imminent recession, and so I think that's why it makes sense. And frankly, I'm not shocked that the market has bounced back the way it did those fears 11 days ago. I mean, a lot of that was overdone, and I think that we're seeing that cooler heads are thankfully prevailing, including on Wall Street, where the market has basically recovered all of those losses, Becky.",
