I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is 6Fighting on Israel's northern border with Lebanon has flared up again in the past day, reigniting fears of conflict spreading far beyond Gaza. The Israeli military says Hezbollah militants in Lebanon launched at least two self-detonating drones and attacks on northern Israel on Wednesday evening. One of them killed an Israeli reserve soldier. At least nine people were wounded. About 30 rockets and drones were launched from Lebanon toward Israel on Wednesday, while Israel says its planes attacked Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. Meantime, officials in Gaza say at least 45 people there were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a U.N.-run school overnight. You're looking at the aftermath of that attack. CNN analysis of video from the scene shows fragments of U.S.-made bombs that were dropped on the school. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out this airstrike, saying it was targeting a Hamas compound inside the UNRWA school. I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who has more reporting on this. He is live from Jerusalem. Let's start with that. Strike. What do we understand happened and what's been the response from the Israelis?",

There were five people who were killed in a separate strike in Nuseirat, making it no less deadly, though, we should note; 40 people who were killed while they were sheltering in this U.N. building. Of those 40 people, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital records indicate that nine of them were women and 14 were children, with the youngest standing at just 4 years old. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it was targeting Palestinian militants who, they say, were sheltering inside that building and preparing attacks against Israeli troops. They have not offered any verifiable evidence, though, for those claims. But they say that this is not the first time, of course, that the Israeli military has said that Palestinian militants have been using U.N. buildings and facilities to hide. It's also not the first time we've seen U.N. buildings and facilities struck, including several U.N. facilities in recent days. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of that main U.N. agency in Gaza, says that about 6,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering at this U.N. school- turned-shelter at the time when it was attacked overnight, while people were sleeping. He said targeting U.N. premises or using them for military purposes cannot become the new norm, calling on those responsible to be held accountable. There is, of course, little in the way of accountability these days, either for the Israeli military or, of course, for Hamas militants. We are able though to confirm the types of munitions that the Israeli military used in the strike. It was a GBU-39 small-diameter bomb, according to footage filmed on the scene by our journalist Mohammed Zawahiri (ph), in central Gaza and analyzed by munitions experts. The same types of munition that was used also in that strike in Western Rafah that killed 45 people, the majority of whom were indeed women and children. So yet another devastating strike and one of several overnight; 52 people were killed overall in central Gaza in this strike as well as several others. Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, it really does seem, Becky, like they are focusing on the way in which President Biden framed this proposal. At least that was myinterpretation of this, which is to say that President Biden very much framed this as a way to end the war, as a clear pathway to a permanent ceasefire. But instead, what we've heard from the Israeli prime minister is that this is not going to lead to an end of the war and that he will not end the war until Hamas is first destroyed. And indeed, the proposal itself does not automatically go to a permanent cease-fire. It would allow for negotiations during the first phase of this agreement if indeed it were to go forward before actually implementing a permanent cease-fire, although there is a somewhat elegant solution here, of extending that initial six-week ceasefire for as long as negotiations between these two sides continue. So there's certainly some ambiguity that is intentionally built into this proposal, open for interpretation. The interpretation, though, that President Biden wanted to sell this proposal as, in order to try and get Hamas to sign on, is one that the Israeli prime minister, for domestic political purposes, simply cannot abide by. And I think that seems to be where Hamas is saying here, that look, what President Biden said and what the actual proposal said and also what Israeli  leaders are saying seem to be very different things. And of course, we should note that there is a lot more riding on this proposal than just what is happening in Gaza, than just the Israeli military's war in Gaza. And that's because we've been watching, of course, a pickup in the cross- border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah at Israel's northern border and in southern Lebanon, which has really been picking up over the last week or so. Renewed attention as well as a result of those wildfires in northern Israel that were sparked by Hezbollah rockets, as well as Israeli missile interceptors. And what one thing is clear is that a ceasefire seems to be the only way that there could be a diplomatic opening for Israel and Hezbollah to resolve these ongoing clashes without it spilling into an all-out war. And it also seems equally clear, Becky, that if there is not a ceasefire in Gaza, then the pressure is going to ramp up for the Israeli government to resolve the security situation in northern Israel through military means. And those military means would likely lead, it would seem, to an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah. It's not clear exactly what the trigger would be for that. But it is clear that the clock is ticking. Becky.",

But how do you do that? And you do that with armies. And if you look at the position of the British military, for example, you gave the example of prime minister Rishi Sunak is talking about another national service. The British military is probably at its smallest in several generations. And if Britain, according to former defense officials, who've talked in detail about this, were to be called upon by NATO to commit very large numbers of troops without building up the army, that would be something difficult to do. France isn't in quite the same position. Germany not in quite the same position, slightly larger militaries.
