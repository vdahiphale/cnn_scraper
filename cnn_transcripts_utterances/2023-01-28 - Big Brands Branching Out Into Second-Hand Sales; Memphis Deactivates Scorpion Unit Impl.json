(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN CRUMP, ATTORNEY FOR TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY: His parents, Ravaughn and Rodney Wells, my co-counsel, Antonio Romanucci, and I, we saw that that was part of the culture. As responsible as those five officers were for killing Tyre Nichols in that reprehensible conduct we saw on that video, we think this was part of the culture of the Scorpion Unit. And, so, we demanded that they disband it immediately before we see anything like this happen again. Citizens, other citizens, have come to us and said that they also attacked us. There was one young man four or five days before this happened to Tyre Nichols who said he was simply going to get pizza. He stopped at the stop sign and they pulled him out, used all kind of profane language, threw him on the ground and put a gun to his head. And so he tried to report them to the Memphis Police Department twice. Never got a call back. And we believe, had somebody been attentive, that Tyre Nichols may not have been killed in this way.",

They came out yesterday, the lawyers in a press conference, demanding that they be disbanded. Today, the police chief, in a statement, granting them that wish. It is also community members. We certainly heard from community members here that raised some issues with some of the tactics that this unit was created really to fight crime aggressively, to focus on homicide, to focus on assaults and robberies and theft in the community. And the police chief releasing a statement today saying that she is doing this because she has heard from the family, Tyre Nichols family, she's heard from community members, she's spoke to the remaining officers who are with this Scorpion Unit. And they all decided together that it was best to try and heal some of the pain and to try and get to the work that now needs to be done to restore the faith that people in this community need to have in the police, that it was just best to disband the unit. But this is a department that's about to undergo some heavy criticism, several investigations no doubt. I think Ben Crump, they're telling me about that DOJ investigation. And he wants a patterns and practice investigation. They may actually get that. You know, if enough community members are raising concerns, this is something that the DOJ is going to have to focus on. Certainly, you still have a criminal investigation perhaps into other officers, administrative investigations into other officers. So there's still so much that needs to be uncovered here -- Pam?",

SMILEY, (D), MEMPHIS CITY COUNCIL VICE CHAIR: Well, I think it's essential for the family to give them a small bit of closure. But I also believe for the Memphis community it's necessary. If you talk to the people in the city of Memphis, they all go through accounts of the Scorpion Unit coming into their communities and terrorizing them. But to the grand scheme of things, I think it is just, on surface levels, because the city's administration as well as the Memphis Police Department has the ability and authority to create the authority to create another unit and give it another name and call it Spider.

So to be clear, there are five defendants here and certainly they deserve and our Constitution permits and demands due process.Each of them are charged individually, right? But they're charged altogether acting in concert with the same thing. The problem, however, with everyone, is we're looking at them there saying, well, my client only punched him and my client only hit him with an asp, and my client merely kicked him. It was the collective conduct of all of you that led to his death. And you would have to know, as does the prosecution, that in the event you are attacking someone with everyone engaged in the attack, that you substantially contributed to his demise and ultimate death. So I don't think the prosecution, no matter what the defense says, my client only did this, my client only pepper sprayed, I think the prosecution is going to say it was the collective weight of all of you in engaging with him in that way. And you look at the differential with respect to, weight. He's 140 pounds, 6'3\". All of these, it appeared to me -- I don't have the actual specifics -- they were pretty big people. And so I think that the prosecution is going to say that the collective activities led all of them to know that he could die as a result of your misconduct. And that's the problem with parsing out the particulars of what each of them did and saying, give me a pass, I only did this. I just don't think that is going to be an effective argument.",

So this is certainly -- you know, this incident happened in Tennessee, but I think it is broad based with respect to the entirety of the country. And it provides an effort and an opportunity to re-examine policing and to see how it could be better, more effective and certainly more humane.

What do you make of the slow tempo start for the former president's 2024 campaign? He says, hey, I've got two years. CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, yes, well, he announced his campaign in November, as was stated, and then he went dormant for a few months. So now he's back out at it in New Hampshire and South Carolina. And I think what he's trying to do is maybe send signals to some of his likely opponents that he wants to see which one wants to jump in the pool first, because I don't think anybody wants to be first in the pool with Donald Trump, because they know what that's going to be like. And I suspect and whether it's Nikki Haley, or Mike Pence, or Pompeo or, or DeSantis, they're going to have to really draw hard contrast against Donald Trump. They're not going to beat him by saying, hey, you're a really good president, you know, people just don't like you, or we don't like the way you conduct yourself. I don't think that's a winning message at all. So these people who are going to jump in the pool with Donald Trump, are going to have to come at him really hard, very aggressively, and explain why Trump should be fired before they're hired. So I think that's really the key to this thing, but I don't think anybody wants to be first. Trump is trying to get in the field. And these guys are waiting before they jump in.

So this is the German Leopard tank, very capable tank. It has a 120-millimeter cannon that's associated with it, just like the Abrams does, good armor. Can be used in a lot of different environments, very maneuverable. And it has a lot of firepower along with it. But it has less required training time than the Abrams tank does.

It is a, you know, the top-of-the-line aircraft, although it's almost 50 years old, first flight was about 49 years ago. These aircrafts are really the mainstay or have been until recently the mainstay of the U.S. Air Force. And there's a real big part of the NATO inventory. And that's something that they would require a lot of training on, anywhere -- depending on the experience of the pilot, anywhere from three months, that's a real bare minimum, highly unlikely, all the way to a year or more.

So when you look at what you have here on the main map, you have the possibility of the Russians coming in, not only from the east, but also potentially from the south, going into these directions. That's what they want to do.So if you go to a more detailed map of the Eastern Front, for example, the big fighting that you have around Solider, around Bakhmut, all those areas, here, become -- that becomes a symbol for what the Russians want to do. Now, Bakhmut by itself is not very strategically significant. However, it is on our main highway that goes this way. And if they can use that highway, that could potentially be a gateway for the Russians to move forward into Ukrainian controlled territory. But they're going to, in essence, try to work around a stalemate. The Ukrainians are trying to run the clock out. And they're trying to make it so that they can fight the Russians. And at the very least keep them here. But their real goal is to eliminate the Russians from this part right here, this so called land bridge. That is where the Ukrainians want to move in the opposite direction, and bring the Russians in this way and force them out of the country.",

And you have some of the best designers and product developers in the world who have designed these products to make sure people are maximizing the amount of time they spend on these platforms.And if we tell a child, use a force of your willpower to control how much time you're spending, you're pitting a child against the world's greatest product designers. And that's just not a fair fight. And so that's why I think our kids need help. And what we need, which we don't have right now is we need transparency from social media companies as to the impact that their platforms are having on kids in which kids are being adversely affected. We also need safety standards, which we don't have. In my house right now, the vast majority of products that, you know, that we buy that I use, have some -- had to meet some sort of safety standards in order to be sold. That is not true in general of social media. And that is something we have to fix. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): I think it's not coincidental that Dr. Murthy and I are probably talking more about this issue of loneliness than others in public life, and we both have young kids, right?",

We could make a different decision as a country. We could decide to, you know, limit the number of young kids that can be on some of these sites. We could, you know, prompt or incentivize these companies to make algorithms that are less addictive.None of this is out of our control when we had dangerous vehicles on the road. We pass laws to make those vehicles less dangerous. We have a dangerous product not for everybody, but for some kids, social media, and we should make decisions to make it a healthier experience that would make kids feel better about themselves and less alone.

Those two people who are on the sidewalk again one of them shot and killed. Investigators right now say they are speaking to one person on the ground, but they're still trying to get to the bottom of exactly what led up to this. The only thing we know right now from the police chief saying that this is the result of just a cowardly and criminal act of a conflict that should have been resolved elsewhere in a very different way. And as you hear from Baltimore Mayor, Brandon Scott, you can clearly hear the frustration and the anger in his voice as he calls this a cowardly act and calls on the community for somebody to speak up about what happened tonight.
