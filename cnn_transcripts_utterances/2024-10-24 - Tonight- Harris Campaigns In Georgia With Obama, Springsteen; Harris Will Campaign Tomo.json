      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, closing arguments with just 12 days left. Kamala Harris is focusing on the threats to democracy and abortion rights issues. Two, she hopes will be at the forefront of voters' minds. And she'll get an assist on the trail tomorrow from the queen bee herself.Plus, daddy's home. That is actually what the crowd chanted as Donald Trump took the stage in Georgia last night after a very weird moment, when Tucker Carlson likened the former president to an angry father and talked about, quote, bad girls getting a spanking. And Mitch McConnell is offering a new blistering assessment of the party he still leads in the Senate, saying the MAGA movement is completely wrong, and Ronald Reagan wouldn't recognize the GOP today. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with the crowded campaign trail. Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia today for her first joint event with Barack Obama. Of course, he brings the political star power. But look who else is joining the vice president, Bruce Springsteen, Tyler Perry, Spike Lee and Samuel L. Jackson, while Harris looks to energize her voters in the peach state. Her running mate is making three stops in North Carolina, a state Democrats haven't won since 2008. Donald Trump is also in the crucial Sun Belt today with events tonight in Arizona and Nevada, while J. D. Vance campaigns in Michigan. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Clarkston, Georgia, where the vice president will be later today. Priscilla, I know you have some new information about the way that the campaign is trying to seize on the news that we got from the New York Times and The Atlantic this week about John Kelly's criticisms of his former boss.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. That's exactly right. I've obtained a digital ad that the campaign is going to be running in the battleground states. As part of a $370 million ad buy that essentially uses what John Kelly said about former President Donald Trump from his remarks to the New York Times and The Atlantic.And he uses the vice president's response at the town hall, condemning that and criticizing the former president. So that gives us, again, a window into this closing argument by the Harris campaign as they come to these final days of the election. Now I will also note, however, to your point earlier that a star power is coming out in force over these last several days, that includes with Beyonce. Beyonce going to join the vice president tomorrow in Houston, where they plan to amplify their message on reproductive freedom. Of course, this has been an issue that the vice president has spoken to often, and it is one that she is using to close out these final days of the campaign. Now, Texas may be an unusual place to do that. It's not a battleground, but it is what sources say is the epicenter of the -- what they call the Trump abortion ban. So, they hope to amplify that alongside Beyonce, before then going to Michigan to be joined with Michelle Obama. But coming down to today, the vice president will be joined for the first time with former President Barack Obama. It is their first time on the campaign trail together as they try to get out the vote. Of course, here in Georgia, early voting has already begun. This is what the campaign wants to capitalize on. So, as they turn to this phase of the campaign where they're trying to turn out those votes. This is going to be a rally set to do that, of course, headlined by Bruce Springsteen, which who often makes an appearance in the waning days of an election for Democratic candidates. So certainly, a big event here in Georgia as they try to turn out the vote over the next several days, Dana.",

No, she didn't, obviously, and that would have overshadowed the vice president's acceptance speech. But I'm told she is going to be appearing with the vice president tomorrow in Houston, as is Willie Nelson.And the point of the vice president making a detour, I guess, to Houston and Texas, is a couple things. One, to really shine a light on abortion rights. It's one of the central arguments of our candidacy. She's doing that through a new ad. But also, you know, for a bit of fun. So, it's -- I think, probably a good example of this. You know, the closing campaign, the closing arguments. It's not one thing. It is a sharpening of a critique against the former president. It is talking about issues that she represents, abortion rights, and it's also trying to show a little optimism and hope and joy. And I think Beyonce is one way to good and she's no stranger to politics. Obviously, the minute that Vice President Harris became the top of the ticket, she authorized the use of freedom. So, it's been the anthem at every Harris rally. I'm thinking back to 2016 though, when Jay-Z and Beyonce did a concert for Hillary Clinton in Cleveland --",

That is what's sort of fueling all of the new ground game strategies, et cetera. BASHBut let's start with the whole question of Donald Trump. And listen to what Kamala Harris said in the town hall last night, specifically trying to pull John Kelly, the president -- former president's chief of staff, and what he said, into the equation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why would someone who served with him, who is not political, a four- star marine general? Why is he telling the American people now? And frankly, I think of it as he's just putting out a 911 call to the American people.

Saying that she is concerned that now that Roe is no longer that it is the healthcare of women that is problematic. For her to say that is really remarkable. And that leads to this ad.

And that is what Liz Cheney was talking about. That is what Kamala Harris is going to talk about. And it's her key issue. It's her most important issue.I think the question is whether that will be enough, whether voters will meld the character question with the question of freedom on protective, you know, abortion. And I don't know the answer to that, because character is a very hard thing for voters to vote on when they're worried about grocery prices. I mean, we saw that in John King's focus group last night. And I don't know how voters are going to react. BASH: Yeah. And that is something I'm told that they are considering in the Harris campaign, and it is almost a choice that a lot of voters are going to have to make. Do I -- my more concerned about -- the real concern of my eggs being more expensive, or is it about something bigger? And is this country just headed in the wrong way? It's really fascinating.",

      "sentences": "Well, I will say, I was bit caught off guard by these comments from Tucker Carlson. It's definitely not something I've heard yet at any of these rallies thus far. And also, just to give you some context of what he was saying there about the quote, vigorous spanking.He was referring to doling out punishments for Democrats and what he called, you know, the mainstream media, for media that he argued was not being fair to Donald Trump. And he referenced all of that. He kind of put them into a box and said that is the machine. So that's what he was talking about here. And really, I think it underscores Donald Trump's themes of retribution. And honestly, the crowd was eating it up. They were relishing this. But again, I think putting this in the context of what we're hearing right now, when Donald Trump is talking about the enemy from within, about wanting to seek retribution against political opponents. And of course, as your panel was just discussing earlier, you know, those comments from John Kelly and him calling Donald Trump or saying he meets the definition of a fascist. And then you have, you know, Tucker Carlson and the crowd here, or the crowd there last night in Duluth, really, you know, cheering on this idea that Donald Trump. If he comes into office, if he's reelected, he is going to take care of what Carlson was referring to as the problem children. And they were chanting, daddy's home, daddy dawn, when Donald Trump was on stage. Now, first of all, I don't know if we're going to hear this again. I mean, we -- I do know that this was Carlson saying this. We have not heard Donald Trump meet that rhetoric or share that rhetoric as well. So, it's unclear if we're going to keep hearing, you know, daddy's home chants from the MAGA crowd. But one thing to watch, Dana, he is going to be the former president, appearing with Tucker Carlson just a couple days before the election on Halloween, actually. So, you know, I'd keep an eye out for that to see if we hear any more of this.",

And it's a very clear -- well, actually, it's not a very clear message. It's not a very -- it's a very weird message.

There has been a gender divide with Donald Trump -- among Donald Trump supporters, since before this election. But he is really trying to expand that divide between men and women.For months, he has been appearing on podcasts that that have a specific audience geared toward white men. He's going to be on Joe Rogan show. I think it's tomorrow as well. So, he's continuing this theme. But I think that Alayna was absolutely right that even though Tucker Carlson said it in this very odd and creepy, but a creepy paternalistic way, right? The issues are the same. The fact that Donald Trump, throughout his candidacy, is trying to seek revenge against people who have done him wrong. I was talking to a Republican close to Donald Trump yesterday who said, on background, look, Trump knows, and people know that this is -- election is very serious for him.

They understand that women are like gone, not large, not entirely, not in entirety, but there's a huge gulf. And they're trying to get as many men to get out and vote for them as possible, including and especially men who may have never voted before.OK, now look at the gender gap that we have here. This is from the Quinnipiac University Poll that came out yesterday. I mean, just look at those numbers in Georgia, in Michigan, in North Carolina, in Wisconsin. I mean, these are huge, huge gaps between the two of them, men versus women. KANNO-YOUNGS: No, absolutely. And you know, as we've been discussing this, this sort of language of framing yourself as sort of a paternalistic, sort of protector of the country, right? That's tapping into trying to galvanize as many men as you can because of other issues that we've been discussing, because of how prominent reproductive rights is in this election, because of Donald Trump's previous statements, I mean, disparaging times women as well. He's going to try and get as many men as he can to the polls. That carries over also directly into this interview that he's going to give to Joe Rogan as well. You can see a through line there, but it is worth just saying again. I mean, a top ally -- yeah, I understand, it wasn't the former president saying this, but a top ally and Tucker Carlson, who is, you know, basically stumping for the former president, saying something like this about a political opponent, just not normal.",

I mean, it's just like being said out loud.But I was struck this week by how many events that Donald Trump has had to Christian organizations, to Latino organizations, other things, she is not campaigning in a broad sense. I mean, he's obviously had tons and tons of big rallies, but this is all sort of just specific groups, and he's doing that next week as well, really trying to drive the turnout of every specific organization. But I'm not sure the background of that pastor who said that.
