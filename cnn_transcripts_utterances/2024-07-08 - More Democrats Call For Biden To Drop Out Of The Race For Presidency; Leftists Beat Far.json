The sources told CNN that about six top House Democrats said that they want to see the President leave the 2024 campaign that included Congressman Adam Smith, Jerry Nadler, Susan Wild, who is a frontline Democrat in Pennsylvania, all saying that they did not think the president should be the Democratic nominee. There were a few people who spoke up in defense of President Biden including Congresswoman Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott saying that he should be able to remain in this race. But sources tell CNN that the number of people who wanted to see the president step aside outnumbered those who were in favor of him staying in this race, at least those who spoke up on this call. Now it all presents a very interesting dynamic for President Biden, especially as Congress is set to return to Washington this week. So much of the debate about President Biden remaining in the 2024 race has played out with while lawmakers have been back at home over the over the Fourth of July holiday hearing directly from their members, but this week, they will be back here in Washington in front of reporters holding meetings of their own. We're certainly this issue of the 2024 campaign will arise. Now, the House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries held this call really to take the temperature of these leaders heading into this week's congressional business. But sources tell CNN that so far Jeffries has not shown his own hands either way. He has not weighed in in these calls about whether he believes President Biden should step aside or remain in this race. Now, President Biden is still charging ahead with his campaign campaigning in the battleground of Pennsylvania on Sunday. His -- joining him on the trail where several elected officials from Pennsylvania including senators Bob Casey, John Fetterman and Natalie Dean, the state's governor, a Democrat Josh Shapiro also joined the presidents at one of his stops the campaign really hoping that this will show some elected officials who are still supporting President Biden who are out there campaigning with him. The President has been defiant insisting that he will stay in this race despite some of the pressure within his party. He's already planning out travel to go to Michigan and Nevada in the coming weeks, two critical battleground states as he's really trying to convince voters and ease their concerns following that debate. But certainly there will be many questions facing President Biden here in Washington this week, especially as lawmakers are set to return.

The hospital treating him later said his health had worsened. The attacks came a day after Israel said it killed a senior Hezbollah operative in an airstrike in northern Lebanon. Meanwhile, CIA Director Bill Burns heads back to Doha this week to resume talks aimed at securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages still held in Gaza. An official familiar with the meeting told CNN he'll meet with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel, as well as the Qatari prime minister amid rising hopes that a deal may be close. This comes after a senior Hamas official told CNN it's considering dropping its demand that Israel agree to a permanent cessation of hostilities from the very start. A red line for Israel. Under pressure from protesters to do a deal but mindful that it could cause his far-right allies to bolt from his coalition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement on Sunday, insisting on four points. Firstly, that any deal will allow Israel to resume fighting until all of the objectives of the war have been achieved. Secondly, that there'll be no smuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt over the Gaza border. Thirdly, that there'll be no return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip. And finally, that Israel will maximize the number of living hostages who will be released from Hamas captivity. Israel believes there are still 116 hostages in Gaza who were kidnapped on October 7th, around a third of whom are believed to be dead. Elliott Gotkine, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That has not been the case. It's been a named storm for ten days. Now it's running out of time to strengthen as it approaches the central Texas coastline. But one thing's for sure water temperatures over this part of the Gulf of Mexico are running abnormally high about three days degrees above where they should be this time of year. That's like mid-August water temperatures and that is like jet fuel for strengthening hurricanes and tropical systems. So we anticipate storm surge as a threat as that water is pushed on shore along the Texas coast. And then of course winds. The strongest winds will be west of I-45 and south of I-10, closer to the coastline, but it's not out of the realm of possibility to see an experienced tropical storm-force gust in Houston. And we don't have to go back that far in history to remember the straight-line winds that knocked out the windows within some of the high-rise buildings in downtown Houston. So we don't want to see a repeat of that. The other concern, of course, flash flooding with five to ten inches and locally over a foot in this forecast. That is certainly a possibility and something that people need to monitor. This will not be another Hurricane Harvey, which sat over eastern Texas four days after making landfall. Beryl will move out very quickly. In fact, by Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, it is going to be nearing the United States and Canada border. That's how quickly it will move away from the region.
