Investors shrugged off yesterday's quarter point hike by the Fed. But the U.S. Federal Reserve is still unsatisfied and inflation is out of control. And on Wednesday raised its benchmark rate to the highest level in 22 years. It is the 11th time the Fed has raised the prime lending rate since March of last year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation numbers have improved but not enough.Still to come, a retired intelligence officer claims the U.S. has the intact bodies of aliens and their spacecraft hidden away. We'll have details of the hearing. Plus, Israel's Supreme Court sets up a showdown with the Netanyahu government over a newly passed judicial reform law. But it won't happen right away.

They accuse him of losing control of the border and failing to stop illegal immigration. But while border crossings remain high, they dipped to their lowest levels in about 2 1/2 years. Meanwhile, a feud between the federal government and Texas over floating barriers in the Rio Grande has escalating. The Justice Department is asking a court to block the construction of any new buoys and remove existing barriers within ten days. That's on top of the lawsuit it filed earlier this week. Mexico is also weighing in writing in a diplomatic note that the barriers violate two treaties and that many of the buoys are actually in Mexican territory. Israel Supreme Court has agreed to take up one of the most contentious laws in the country's history. Setting up a major legal battle between the government and opponents who warn that democracy itself is at stake. The judicial overhaul would weaken the Supreme Court's oversight of government decisions. Stripping its ability to block those it deems unreasonable.

In fact, over the last few hours we've been getting a lot of pictures and video from Pyongyang. In fact, let's take a look.We have video of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with Russia's defense minister touring what has been described as a military expedition. State media says this is basically new types of weaponry and equipment. North Korea and Russia for that matter have been strong supporters of each other. We have seen North Korea show its support of Russia and vice versa. In fact the Russian defense minister making the statement to the effect of the People's Army, the Korean People's Army, became the strongest army in the world. So that's the kind of verbiage that Kim Jong-un is certainly wanting to see. We should point out that it is not alone. There's also a delegation from China during this momentous occasion, this anniversary in North Korea. As one analyst pointed out to CNN, this is really an interesting trio to see China, to see Russia and North Korea together at a time when a lot of world has been condemning them. Especially for support of the war in Ukraine. In fact, if you look at North Korea, it has been accused by the United States of providing weaponry to Russia. Russia on the other hand has not condemned necessarily Vladimir Putin taking a more sideline approach. But it goes to show that these three nations have really been isolated at a time when a lot of world has been united against Ukraine. Max, there is always a possibility we may see a bigger military parade perhaps in the hours ahead, we'll certainly keep you posted.",

And I have to tell you, when I was there helping to conduct the draw in Auckland in October, this was the tie when the balls came out of the pots that really did bring the biggest reaction in the room. It's two of Women's World Cup heavy weight teams. And arguably the tie of the group stage of this tournament, and it was tight.The U.S., as you said, having to come back from a goal down. The Dutch taking an early lead on 17 minutes. And the game really changed when Rose Lavelle came off the bench for the U.S. She was one of the goal scorers in the final four years ago. And she was the person who combined with the U.S. captain Lindsay Horan for the goal that gives the U.S. a point. But I have to say, there's been sort of a criticism for the U.S. in this one. But they're not as clinical as they have been in years gone by. They're not taking the chances that we perhaps would have seen from them being ruthless as we've seen from them in years gone by. They have won 14 matches in a row at the Women's World Cup over three tournaments. So historically, as you well know, have been the team to beat. But this is a side in transition. They've got 14 tournament debutantes. It's Vlatko Andonovski in charge. Whereas Jill Ellis was the person who led the U.S. to their last two world cup titles. And there really is a feeling that they are finding their feet. They're finding their identity. And I have to point out, we're sitting here in London, the European teams recently are the sides that have troubled the U.S. They have lost to Germany, lost to England. And the Dutch here. But if you speak to the U.S. captain, Lindsey Horan, she is still fairly positive. Have a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDSEY HORAN, SCORED GAME-TYING GOAL FOR U.S.: I felt the momentum the whole time. I think in the first half we could be disappointed in how we played, but I think that we fixed things right away. The pressure that we got on and the amount of chances and opportunities that came from it, so proud of the team and their response. It's against a -- against a really good opponent. Very competitive team. You know, one that we saw last World Cup do such good things. So, I think for us, it's going down a goal and coming up and getting able to tie. And again, the chances that we got on goal. We got to finish a few of those, but we keep moving forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
