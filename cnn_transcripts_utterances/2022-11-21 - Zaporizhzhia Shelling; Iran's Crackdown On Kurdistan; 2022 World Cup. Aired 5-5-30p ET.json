Good to have you with us.Just ahead, we will be live in Ukraine as the nuclear watchdog says there are no immediate safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But the team warns of widespread damage caused by the recent shelling. Then, Iran steps up its military crackdown on anti-government protesters in the country's Kurdish cities. We'll bring you the latest. And Team USA and Wales played to a draw in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. CNN has full coverage of the World Cup. A dangerously close call, that's how the U.N. nuclear watchdog describes renewed shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. But it warns, if there is a next time, the world may not be so lucky. IAEA inspectors visited the plant Monday. They say all six reactors are stable, and there are no immediate safety concerns. But they did report widespread damage at the site. Ukraine and Russia are blaming each other for the attacks. The IAEA says whoever was responsible was playing with fire. CNN's Sam Kiley is following the developments and joins us now live from Odessa. Good to have you with us, Sam. So, a major explosion at the power plant, and inspectors on the scene. What more are they learning?",

This may be the closest, certainly the most sustained bombardment on the central areas of the facility. And that's important, Lynda, it landed, because of course these are nuclear power stations, as big as Europe, most of the reactors have been shut down and put into hibernation. But the Ukrainians over the weekend, accused the Russians of being behind this because they said the shelling had affected the ability of two of the reactors to feed electricity into the Ukrainian national grid. And, of course, the national grid has been itself under sustained Russian bombardment now for several weeks, particularly over the last week with over 100 cruise missiles being fired mostly intended to break the back of the Ukrainians, to generate power, as winter is settling in. The Russians, however, are accusing the Ukrainians of conducting these bombardments. The IAEA has not pointed the figure, but it's raised red flags of warning, Lynda.",
