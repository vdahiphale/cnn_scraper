Cohen confirms it was. Jurors earlier saw these records during testimony from Jeff McConney, a Trump Organization employee, Deborah Tarasoff.Let me ask a question here and this is a truly an innocent question. Weisselberg, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., they are signing these checks. Is that criminal, what they were doing?",

LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S FORMER ATTORNEY:  Yes. Weisselberg's document, I think the jurors are going to look at the document. The way I first looked at it, it has a numbers game divided by 12. No reference to legal services. It's a bonus doubled. It's paying for fake people to show up when he came down the escalator doubled. It's his out of pocket plus the money paid, $130,000, doubled, adding to 430,000 divided by 12. The document speaks for itself. There's no reference to legal fees.

I can't believe that there aren't several people on this jury who haven't been watching the news and who aren't aware of the fact that Allen Weisselberg is in Rikers at this point. I mean, we're assuming that nobody in the jury knows that. I'll bet they do and I'll bet that comes out.Will that be something talked about publicly? No, because, as you know, juries deliberate in secret. But I'm not sure it's as big a problem as some are anticipating.",

He's also saying that to the jury that when Stormy Daniels went public with her story back in 2018, Trump wanted to take legal action against her for breaching the NDA. Now, we've heard part of this before, Your Honor, about the idea of Trump being agitated and annoyed. He said that he was contacted, by the way, by Eric Trump, as well as Mr. Trump, regarding how to go forward with the arbitration proceeding. This is all coming in front of this jury.But, again, revisiting this issue of the absence of Allen Weisselberg, the documents themselves, how do you anticipate or what kind of moments you think might come up in the cross examination of Michael Cohen? Do you see the jury having to get a instruction of some kind after when they talk about his convictions?",

It's a question of, you know, how much of his end trails are pulled out by Todd Blanche. This is going to be quite a show. This will be Todd Blanche's cross- examination moment in his life.And he's got to discredit this witness because that's the only way you win this case, in my view. You know, he's got to create reasonable doubt or appeal to that one or two jurors who he hopes will hang him up you know, even if the other jurors want to convict. But it's going to be spirited. And I think, you know, based on my prior position, I think about Justice Merchan. Imagine, you know, he's going to have to referee this, this fight between Todd Blanche and Michael Cohen. And he's got all kinds of interesting characters sitting, staring at him, including governors, senators, unsuccessful presidential candidates. And he's also got a defendant who's doing something that most defendants never have the ability to do, which is getting out in public at the end of the trial day and shrieking about how corrupt he is and how conflicted he is. You know, if ever there was a time when a judge had to tune out the outside noise, here's one of them because, you know, we're all too human. It's incredible to me you know what he's having to endure to sit and preside in this case.",

Remember, there is this active gag order to which Trump's team initially, about a week-and-a-half ago, wanted to have removed with respect to Michael Cohen, as one person they felt did not need the protection, felt that he was no shrinking violet, could go toe-to-toe and had been on the attacking side of everything. But you make the point. There have been members of Congress. There have been other mouthpieces and spokespersons who have been talking about the people that Trump cannot go after.If you're the judge in this matter, and you hear, you know, members of Congress or other people trying to do that, which Trump cannot, does it -- how do you show that you are going to remain unbiased and unbothered to preserve your reputation before maybe even an appellate court?",

Right now, Cohen's attorney was being paid by the Trump Organization. Asked if that was important to him at the time, Cohen says, very much so. And this is about other monies and other duties that Michael Cohen did for Donald Trump. He said that the last filing he did, the last invoice he did that was bogus, was December 1st, 2017. Why was it the last one? He said, because I've been reimbursed the $420,000. He said he did minimal work for the Trumps in 2017 and he wasn't paid for it. There was something involving Madame Tussauds and Melania Trump when the museum wanted to create a model of her. He did it, he didn't expect to be paid for it, he didn't fill out an invoice for her. There was something where Michael Cohen said he was working with Attorney Marc Kasowitz on the Summer Zervos matter, and delivered documents to Trump on the Oval Office regarding that. Elie Honig, what is the Summer Zervos matter?",

This is another one. We've heard less about her than Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. Summer Zervos was a contestant on the T.V. show The Apprentice back in 2006. Years later, when Trump enters the political scene, she makes allegations that Donald Trump touched her inappropriately, sexually, unwanted kissing, unwanted touching, that kind of thing.Trump, as he is won't to do, then publicly calls her a liar and says it's all fake. She then sues him for defamation. Again, this probably, I mean, similar to E. Jean Carroll in these respects. This lawsuit, however, ends up going nowhere. It ends up getting settled, and I would put that in scare quotes, in 2021 for $0, for non-monetary exchange of something or other. So, eventually, it goes away, but she was one of many people who was coming forward with allegations. And we should note, where Michael Cohen is testifying now is really important. He's getting into his false statements to Congress.",
