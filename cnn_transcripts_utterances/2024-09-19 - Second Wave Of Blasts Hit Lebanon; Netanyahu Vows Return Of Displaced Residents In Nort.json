The Lebanese Foreign Minister tells CNN he fears the consecutive attacks could signal a \"introduction to war.\"Scores of walkie talkies exploded across the country on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 450 others. It comes a day after hundreds of pagers, some owned by Hezbollah members blew up nearly simultaneously across Lebanon in an unprecedented attack which wounded about 2800 people. The death toll rose to 12 on Wednesday, Israel's defense minister tacitly acknowledged his country's role in the exploding devices.

More now from CNN's Ben Wedeman in Beirut and a warning his report contains graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A funeral for those killed a day before is disrupted by another explosion. A wave of walkie talkie blasts across Lebanon killed more than a dozen and injured hundreds Wednesday, coming barely 24 hours after hundreds of pagers blew up across the country at food markets and shops, killing at least 12 people, including two children and injuring around 2800 others. In what CNN sources say was an attack by Israel's Mossad and military against Hezbollah, unprecedented in its scale and nature. Outside the American University of Beirut Hospital, distressed family members wait for updates on their loved ones. WEDEMAN (on camera): Friends and relatives of the injured. Don't want to speak on camera, but off camera, one told us, for instance, that a friend of his received a message on his pager. He looked at it and the pager blew up in his face, damaging his eyes and his fingers. And in fact, the chief medical officer here told us the majority of the injuries are to the eyes, to the hands and the hips, where, of course, people were holding their pagers. DR. SALAH ZEIN-EL-DINE, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT MEDICAL CENTER: We received around 200 patients, and we received them in a very short time, about within an hour or two, almost all of them went inside our doors. So, this stretched us pretty much too thin. WEDEMAN (voice-over): A Lebanese security source says the militant group bought the devices that exploded in recent months from a Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. However, Gold Apollo denies manufacturing the devices and says a distributor in Hungary is responsible. A Taiwanese security official said there's no record the pagers were shipped to Lebanon or anywhere in the Middle East. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, a message echoed by one of the group's lawmakers. HUSSEIN HAJJ HASSAN, HEZBOLLAH LAWMAKER AND FOREMR LEBANESE MINISTER (through translator): The resistance will continue. The support for Gaza will continue, and the Israelis will regret what they have done. WEDEMAN (voice-over): The tension between Israel and Hezbollah is nothing new. For most of the past year, cross border skirmishes have been common. These device explosions represent a new level of escalation. And Wednesday, Israel's defense minister said the explosions mark a new era in Israel's war against Hezbollah. [02:05:03] Worried citizens are now suspicious of everyday devices, including one found in a parking lot near a busy hospital, security detonated it in a controlled explosion.

And as Ben was just mentioning in his report, you know, that not -- unreasonably, Hezbollah members and Lebanese in general are wondering what devices could be next, what other gadgets and gizmos that they have in their homes, at their workplaces, in their cars, on their person, could also be booby trapped and primed to explode at a time of Israel's choosing.So yes, Hezbollah certainly on the back foot here. This is a massive blow to its communications, its ability for its fighters to communicate with one another. They of course, don't use mobile phones to avoid being hacked or surveilled. It's a massive psychological blow to the organization. Of course, it's also a physical blow to Hezbollah, many of whose members have been injured, at least 16 of whom Hezbollah said on Wednesday, were killed in that attack with those walkie talkies exploding. Now, Hezbollah has vowed retaliation. Iran has also vowed retaliation Iran, of course, Hezbollah's main backer, because Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was injured in Tuesday's attacks. And we do seem to be in this kind of holding pattern once more, almost like the third act, if you like. Back in April, you recall that Israel assassinated a top official -- a top commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps at a consular compound in Damascus. We then had that unprecedented barrage from Iran. At the end of July we had the assassination of Hezbollah's top military commander, followed by the presumably Israeli assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in a guest house in Tehran. We waited for retaliation then, which seems to have come from Hezbollah, but not directly from Iran. And so, now we seem to be back in that position where Israel has carried out an attack on Hezbollah and/or Iran and that both of them have vowed retaliation. But certainly, for now, at least Hezbollah is on the back foot. And for all we know, there could be more attacks on Thursday and these walkie talkie and pager attacks, these explosions, which we now have learned, were indeed carried out by Israel, a joint operation between the military and the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Mossad, could be a prelude to further attacks, or indeed, the wider war that everyone has feared would break out for most of the past 12 months.

We've heard it from in various expressed in different ways, from Prime Minister Netanyahu to Benny Gantz, back when he was in the war cabinet to defense minister.Yoav Gallant saying that look, the southern part of Lebanon is supposed to be demilitarized according to U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 from 2006 that ended that war between Israel and Hezbollah. That is clearly not been the case and Israel has now made it an official this week, in fact, made it an official war goal to get the tens of thousands of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes in the north of the country back into their homes. And understandably, those people do not want to move back to their homes if they are still effectively, you know, under the threat of Hezbollah. So, the idea is, and Israel has been calling for this for months for Hezbollah to move back to the Litany River, several kilometers to the north, in accordance with that U.N. Security Resolution. And has said in the past that if Hezbollah doesn't do it, then Israel will make them do it. And we seem to be inching or moving quite quickly now to a situation where Israel is going to carry out that threat. There is hope that all-out war can be avoided, but just because both sides seemingly want to avoid all that war doesn't mean we won't get one. Anna?",

A Ukrainian security source says the drones destroyed a Russian ammunition depot about 400 kilometers west of Moscow on Wednesday. Seismologists in Norway later said they detected seismic activity, probably caused by the blast. This before and after video shows the massive plumes of smoke following the attack. A Russian state news agency blamed the fires on fallen drone debris without mentioning what the target was.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to meet with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington next week, according to multiple sources. Donald Trump says he'll probably meet with him as well. The Ukrainian leader will also attend the U.N. General Assembly next week in New York. He wants to present what he calls his a victory plan to both Harris and Trump, as well as President Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Today, we can say that our victory plan has been fully prepared. All the points, all the key accents, the necessary annexes with details to the plans have been identified, everything has been worked out. The most important thing now is determination to implement it. There is no and cannot be any alternative to peace, any freezing of the war, or any other manipulations that will simply move the Russian aggression to another stage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
