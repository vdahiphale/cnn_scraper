It was that undisclosed procedure that ended up leading to complications for Austin. An official statement saying, \"Austin suffered severe pain and then had to return to Walter Reed on January 1st and was admitted then to the ICU.\" The next day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman was told about Austin's hospitalization but he is not in the chain of command. Also, on January 2nd, deputy defense secretary, Kathleen Hicks, taking up some of Lloyd Austin's duties but it was not until January 4th, three days later, that she and President Biden learned of the details that Austin was actually in the ICU. The Pentagon says one reason for the delay is that Austin's chief of staff was also sick. Let's talk about this now with Mark Esper, who served as defense secretary, of course, in the Trump administration. He wrote the book \"The Sacred Oath, Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times.\" Secretary Esper, you have said somebody dropped the ball here on Secretary Austin. Who is it up to besides him to alert the White House if his key aid is sick?",

So they are bound to follow orders. We want our military to follow orders. That's why, when I was in office, I always thought it was important for the civilian leadership, myself, beginning with myself, were the ones that needed to kind of defend the uniformed military. Against not just illegal and unlawful or immoral orders but inappropriate ones as well, to make that stand to the president and his staff, to say we are not doing this or we should not do this or this is a better way to do what you want to do because it does not cross any boundaries.

You can see this from this one clinical trial of Zepbound, the newest medication for weight loss out there. Generally patients lose weight when they are on it but when they split, and half start taking a placebo and half stayed on the drug, those that got off the drug and went on placebo gained the weight back. So we do hear from patients, sometimes they try to switch to a compounded version, for example. Those are versions of drugs that are allowed to be made by pharmacies when the drug is on the shortage of list, which these are. But they are not as tightly regulated by the FDA. So there can be real safety concerns. And the FDA has warned about using those versions.",
