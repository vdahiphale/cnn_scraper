We're going to take you there live as the country's president could soon face impeachment after a risky political maneuver that very clearly backfired.And we are following the search also for a missing grandmother who authorities believe fell into a sinkhole while searching for her lost cat. The clue investigators found 30 feet underground. I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. Sara's out today. This is CNN News Central. So, breaking overnight, Defense Secretary Ron DeSantis, it is being floated as a possibility now that Donald Trump's nomination of Fox Host Pete Hegseth seems to be in serious jeopardy. Trump insiders say it is an absolutely critical day for Hegseth, who will sit for his first T.V. interview since new allegations of sexual misconduct, inappropriate workplace behavior and alcohol abuse surfaced. We're also standing by to hear from a woman who once raised concerns about Hegseth's treatment of women, his own mother. So, just how much trouble Hegseth could be in is highlighted by the floating of DeSantis as a replacement to CNN and all over the media. There's been bad blood between Trump world and the Florida governor and his nomination would rock the Republican political world and beyond. We are waiting for first word as to what he thinks about all this. Let's get right to our Florida man Steve Contorno for the very latest on all these twists and turns. Steve?",

And as you said, it is an absolutely critical day for him because not only does he have these key interviews on Fox News for him and his mother, but he also will be holding another round of meetings on Capitol Hill. And, previously, he had been mostly speaking with staunch Trump allies. Well, now he has some critical swing votes he has to speak with, including Iowa Senator Joni Ernst. And as we saw yesterday, there's already some concern among Republicans about his nomination. Take a listen to what a few of them had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  He, you know, obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is, it's going to be difficult. You know, time will tell. SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  I have not met with him yet. I'm looking forward to meeting with him. We'll be asking questions. But, look, the president always gets the benefit of the doubt on his nominees. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND):  Of course, it's concerning, but I look forward to visiting with Pete about it and seeing -- I'm interested in who Pete Hegseth is today and who he is going forward.

He is also weighing Ernst herself as a potential replacement. She, of course, is a veteran as well and has a background in military affairs. And then Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, another individual who has been increasingly close to Trump over the years and has been floated for a number of jobs in a potential administration. He's another name that some Trump allies have been putting out there as a potential replacement for Hegseth. We will find out later today.Now, the Trump campaign, I will say, continues to say publicly they are standing by Hegseth. I will point out they said very similar things about Matt Gaetz until the moment he pulled out of contention for A.G. John?",

Well, now the Trump transition team has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Justice that could pave the way for them to ask the FBI to conduct background checks on some of their nominees.Now, they had previously said that they intended to conduct some of these background checks on their own, but there are concerns and there are people speaking up on the Hill saying they want to see these background checks from the FBI. Senator Collins, for example, has been very vocal in saying she wants to see what the FBI has to say about these allegations about Hegseth before she supports his nomination, John.",

Justices will hear arguments challenging a Tennessee law that bans gender affirming healthcare for children and teens. The measure, it's a law, prohibits doctors from giving hormone therapy and puberty blockers to transgender minors. Tennessee is one of 26 states that have passed similar laws. Let's get to the high court, though. CNN's Joan Biskupic will be following all of this important moment from minute to minute and every minute of oral arguments is extremely important today. Joan, help people understand what is at issue here and also what is at stake.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, good to see you. And you're right, this case could become the most important of this current Supreme Court session. Much is at stake, not just for these youths who are trying to have this sex transition treatment, but for all transgender individuals, young and old, because this case tests fundamentals of just how extensive constitutional protection should be for transgender individuals.Three youths and their families and a physician brought this case against Tennessee, saying that it violated due process of law and equal protection of the law. The Biden administration intervened on the equality question, saying that this kind of regulation should be treated like sex discrimination and therefore require a pretty strong, important governmental interest to justify it if it's going to stand at all. Now, let's just pull back for a second, Kate. You mentioned that 26 states have these kinds of laws. Just consider how recently we've had debate over sports policies and bathroom bans on transgender issues. President-elect Donald Trump even ran on an agenda against transgender interests, so very important case. And I should mention that the lower court judge panel that ruled on the Tennessee law and whose ruling will be before the justices today sided with Tennessee. The court below said this is not a sex discrimination case. This is a case in which Tennessee is just merely trying to regulate medicine for young people and it should not be subject to any kind of heightened constitutional scrutiny. The Biden administration lawyer and the ACLU lawyer who will also side with these youths are going to say that these are people who cannot meaningfully vindicate their rights through the legislative process, so they should be able to have heightened constitutional protection here. The ACLU lawyer is going to refer to how this has benefited young people and CNN talked to one of the plaintiffs who said it's been very, very helpful, life changing for some people. It has even been lifesaving. Those are the stakes here today, Kate, when the justices take up this case.",

And peace has been restored to the area around the National Assembly. When we joined you this time yesterday, Special Forces troops from the South Korean military were still leaving this area. Special Forces troops a couple hours before we joined you and Kate were breaking through windows from the orders of South Korea's president to stop lawmakers from voting to prohibit this martial law from going any further.So, where we are right now, the president of South Korea, John, still has not resigned. He has fewer and fewer allies. I cannot count any on my hand right now. Where this is going, though, he could do either one of two things, John. He could resign or face impeachment. But I think it's important to tell everybody back home in the United States that impeachment could take months, and that could inject a new layer of stability to this key ally of the United States and western countries, democracies writ large. So, what's going to happen? The president has a deadline of essentially Saturday to resign or face the impeachment process. So, we're waiting for Saturday. What needs to happen, though, another judge needs to be installed on the constitutional court that would hear this case. That could take a beat. That could take a couple weeks. And then once this trial goes through that court system, John, the judges could take up to six months, I repeat, half a year, to decide whether or not South Korea's president should go or stay. So, it could, again, inject another layer of instability. Who represents South Korea on the international stage? That would be the prime minister, a sort of lame duck situation. So, a lot of unanswered questions. We're going to move, though, from, again, this National Assembly to where protesters have gathered in front of the president's house. Stay tuned for more. We are expecting demonstrations to continue throughout the evening there, John.",

Mind you, the FBI director still has two and a half years on his ten-year term, someone who was appointed by Donald Trump in his first term.But Kash Patel has also been very critical of what he says is a deep state. He says that the FBI needs to be ally, essentially dismantled. And so he now has been notified by the FBI that he was being targeted by Iranian hackers. And in this case, it appears that he was part of a larger group of a number of people associated with Donald Trump who were targeted by these hackers. Now, this is a campaign that's been going on for a number of months. This was, this happened during the, during the campaign before the election. First they got in through Roger Stone's email and they were able to hopscotch and get two people inside the campaign, even actually getting campaign documents during the campaign. So, as you pointed out, there's been a number of other attacks against Don Jr., against Todd Blanche, people associated by with Donald Trump. In that case, it was Chinese hackers who were believed to be behind it. We've got you a statement from the Trump transition, in which they say, Kash Patel was a key part of the first Trump administration's efforts against the terrorist Iranian regime and will implement President Trump's policies to protect America from adversaries as the FBI director. And, clearly, here in this case, the adversaries here were Iranian hackers and the FBI was doing its job trying to protect Kash Patel and other members of the Trump administration.",
