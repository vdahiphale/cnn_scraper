Alice, let's start with you. It's interesting, the \"New York Times\" reports that in response to those comments from the former president, the audience was mixed, both applause and groans. And it comes as we have new CNN polling showing that among Republican voters, 40 of them would support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee. But look who is at a close second, Ron DeSantis at 36 percent. They're the only two who came out in double digits. Both Mike Pence and Nikki Haley coming in around 6 percent. Alice, your reaction in terms of how you think the Trump camp would respond to these figures saying that DeSantis is tailing him closely?",

With incomes over $50,000, Ron DeSantis holds the lead. And education is a similar thing. No college, Trump over DeSantis. College grad, it's DeSantis over Trump. That was interesting. I hadn't seen those splits before. I wonder if you can marry that to what we've seen from each candidate the last few days. Trump going after DeSantis on Social Security. And DeSantis, all of a sudden, to FOX News saying that he does not support the U.S. efforts to help Ukraine, calling it a territorial dispute. Explain all that.",

It shows you the division between the two front-runners in the Republican Party.One of them is pandering to the base, which is Trumpism. Both of them, I think, I have that appeal. I think that Trump is still kind of trying to claim that he represents the forgotten Republican, so to speak, the working class. I would say that is his bread and butter. That's the message that he used all along to get elected, I think, the first time around. I think DeSantis is trying to establish himself. That was the quite the entry into the foreign policy field. I have to say that, as a national security person, from my perspective, it's horrifying to me that you have two potential front- runners for the Republican nomination espousing pro-Putin and standing against Ukraine. I think we have fallen very far from the Reagan party, I would say. I'm glad that Ron DeSantis put himself on the record on where he stands on this. It's a slap to the courage of the people of Ukraine. But that's good to know that's who he really is.",

And he wants to make sure that any assistance or military equipment that we give doesn't escalate and take this fight outside of the borders. He's got a very nuanced position on that. I did want to comment on the college-educated and non-college-educated support for Trump and DeSantis. What I think is another concern for Donald Trump, he's going to continue to hold many of the non-college-educated Republican voters. But as DeSantis continues to get out there, I believe there's more of a chance for him to pick up the non-college-educated voters than it is for Donald Trump to try to peel off some of the college-educated voters. Many of which left him and left their support of him because of the way he acted while he was president, the name-calling and January 6th and election denying and conspiracy theories.
