      "sentences": "Yeah, John. Donald Trump is looking to establish another pathway to get his conviction in the New York hush money case overturned and also indefinitely delay sentencing in that case. It's scheduled for next month.Now, like you said, he's asking a federal court to take this case from the state court level, and he's also asking the federal court to confirm that if they do take the case will that indefinitely delay sentencing in the state court level until the matter is resolved. Now look, this argue -- they're arguing that the prosecution in New York conflicts with the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision on presidential immunity. And specifically, that prosecutors presented evidence that qualify as evidence related to Donald Trump's official act. You'll remember that was the distinction the U.S. Supreme Court said that Donald Trump enjoyed immunity from prosecution for. I want to read a little bit of this filing by Trump's legal team. It says, \"The presidential immunity doctrine recognized in Trump v. the United States pertains to all criminal proceedings, including grand jury proceedings. The Manhattan D.A. violated the doctrine by presenting evidence of President Trump's official acts. The Manhattan district attorney's office violated the doctrine by presenting evidence of President Trump's officials acts in grand jury proceedings and at trial.\" And it goes on to say that essentially, this prosecution amounts to election interference, and that's something we've heard a lot from Donald Trump publicly. But in his filing, it says, \"The impending election cannot be redone. The currently unaddressed harm to the presidency resulting from this improper prosecution will adversely impact the operations of the federal government for generations. Sentencing is currently scheduled to occur on September 18, 2024, which could result in President Trump's immediate and unconstitutional incarceration and prevent him from continuing his groundbreaking campaign.\" So they're drawing a direct line to the upcoming 2024 election as they're trying to create a second option for getting this conviction overturned. You'll remember Judge Merchan is already weighing a proposal by Donald Trump's legal team to overturn the conviction and to delay sentencing until after the election.",

We're told that he's not going to do that. Instead, he's going to try to chart a path forward with the idea that even if a trial happens after the 2024 election that the case would still be intact and the evidence would still be preserved to present that to a jury if and when a trial ever happens. Now, obviously, the biggest threat to Jack Smith's case remains a political one, and if Donald Trump wins the 2024 election that case all but goes away.",

Thank you.And breaking overnight, Vice President Kamala Harris is now putting the spotlight on reproductive rights after sitting down with CNN for her first interview as the Democratic nominee. Her campaign says that it's launching a new bus tour next week in Florida, warning about the high stakes for women and families in the upcoming election. CNN's Eva McKend joins us now. So, Eva, Donald Trump announcing yesterday that he wants to make the government or insurance companies pay for IVF. How is the Harris campaign framing their message now considering that Trump announcement? EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Rahel, the fight for reproductive justice has always been a central focus of the campaign. She's running under the mantra of freedom. And one of those pillars is reproductive freedom or specifically, the freedom to make decisions about your own body, is how she says it on the campaign trail. But the former president raising IVF is an acknowledgment that they feel vulnerable in this space, and it's an issue Democrats very much want to run. Most Americans say they trust the vice president and Democrats at large more when it comes to this issue of abortion. And every time the former president raises this issue, they remind voters that he is responsible for elevating the three Supreme Court justices that ultimately were responsible for overturning Roe versus Wade, making abortion inaccessible in many states across the country. But she has had some other policy inconsistencies, and our colleague Dana Bash asked her about this during last night's interview. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what I found very fascinating is the first thing she said she was going to do is increase economic opportunity for the middle class.

And airline passengers fed up with a toddler's nonstop crying on a flight lock her in the bathroom. This morning, their actions are causing a lot of discussion. (COMMERCIAL) [07:52:00] BERMAN:  Fresh off his gold medal Olympic performance, Steph Curry has signed a huge one-year extension with the Golden State Warriors worth more than $62 million. This deal makes his contract $178 million over the next three seasons. And when it's up he will have earned more than half a billion dollars from NBA deals, putting him second on the all- time list behind LeBron James. New video this morning shows the flooding that destroyed a library in Long Island up in New York. Floodwaters burst through a wall and rushed through the entire bottom floor of the building, destroying books, equipment, and much more. This library is the home to some historical documents, including the Long Island town deed and letters signed by Thomas Jefferson. So a toddler on a flight with her grandparents in China was crying nonstop on a three-hour flight. It happens. Anyone who has flown with a toddler knows it happens. Two strangers locked the child in a bathroom to \"educate her.\" They said they had the grandmother's consent. They even posted video of it, which has been taken down, saying they just wanted a quiet flight. The airline has since apologized for the incident and condemned the passengers' behavior -- Rahel.",

But still, this is moving in the right direction, a far cry from that spike to $5.00 a gallon two years ago. And look, some drivers in some states are seeing even bigger drops. Nearly a dollar cheaper over the last year in Oregon, Washington State. Eighty-eight cents in the battleground state of Arizona. Sixty- eight cents in Utah. That is a big change. As far as why it's happening -- well, on the supply side, oil prices have been low in part because the U.S. is producing record amounts of oil. Refineries are doing really well. They haven't been sidelined by extreme heat, so that means gas supplies have been up. And on the demand side, it's actually been a little bit soft in the U.S. as far as the demand for gasoline.

And there's really one thing that the Ukrainians want to achieve in these meeting is they want to present the U.S. with a list of targets that they would like to hit with longer-distance weapons that are made in the United States. I think it's important to point out that we're not only talking about surface-to-surface missiles -- not just those ATACMS missiles, of course, have a significant range, which right now the Ukrainians are using to strike places in occupied Crimea, but not yet allowed to use to strike deep into Russian territory. But we're also talking, for instance, about air launch missiles that could strike targets in Russia as well. One of the main reasons why the Ukrainians want to do that John is because right now the Russians have become a lot more effective at using their own Air Force. And so the Ukrainians want to hit the air bases from where the Russians are taking off. Of course, also fuel depots and radar stations as well. So far, the U.S. is only allowing the Ukrainians to use U.S.-made weapons in the immediate border area. The Ukrainians want further allowances to use the weapons deeper into Russian territory. And, of course, all of this is part of a larger plan that the president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, wants to present to President Biden around the U.N. General Assembly in September -- what he calls a plan for a possible Ukrainian victory and to force Russia to the negotiating table, John.",

So that in itself is very significant. On the eastern front inside of Ukraine a very difficult situation there for the Ukrainians, especially in the eastern city -- around the eastern city of Pokrovsk. The Russians there now making pretty significant progress I would say. It's not fast but it is certainly very steady. The Ukrainians, first and foremost, have a big issue there with manpower. They're not able to bring enough soldiers into the fight. They're outmanned by the Russians. They say they're trying to stabilize that situation.
