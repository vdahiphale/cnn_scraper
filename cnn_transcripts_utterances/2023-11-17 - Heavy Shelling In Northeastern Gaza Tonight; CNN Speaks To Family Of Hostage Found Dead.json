      "sentences": "Good evening. Earlier tonight, our CNN crew witnessed what Correspondent Nic Robertson call perhaps the most intensive fire over northern Gaza that he's seen in days. We got a live update from Nic in a moment.Israel's Channel 12 News is reporting on what it says is a copy of a police report that shows the number of people killed on October 7th in the Nova Music Festival is much higher than previously believed. In the week after the attack, it was believed some 260 people have been slaughtered, now 364 people were, according to police -- according to Israel's Channel 12. Also, according to that news channel, police also say that 40 festivalgoers were kidnapped and taken into Gaza. Israel's military today announced that it recovered the body of a second hostage from near the Al-Shifa Hospital. Noa Marciano is her name. That's her picture. She was 19, a corporal in the IDF, and she had been kidnapped from Nahal Oz kibbutz. The IDF announced they had recovered the body of a 65-year-old grandmother, Yehudit Waiss, yesterday. She was also found near the hospital. It's not known whether the two were found together. Today, President Biden spoke about the hostage situation with the leader of Qatar, who brokered ongoing negotiations. However, three sources, including two Israeli officials, tell CNN that Hamas has demanded Israel stop flying surveillance drones as part of any hostage deal. The sources say Israel uses those drones to track Hamas' movements and thus is unlikely to accept that request. Nic Robertson joins us tonight from Sderot, Israel, not far from Gaza with the latest. So, Nic, we showed those heavy bombardments in northern Gaza. What's the latest you're seeing now?",

We can see over -- in this direction and, in fact, looking over there, now I can see there's a glow in the sky that wasn't there before. So that's clearly an aftermath of a blast over there right now. So the fight is still going on, not as intense as what we were seeing earlier on today.But as you were mentioning there, really sad news for two families of hostages. And I meant -- went to meet one of those families today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): Yehudit Waiss is the first Israeli hostage discovered by the IDF since their full incursion began almost three weeks ago. The dearly loved 65-year-old grandmother, a mother of five, was already dead. OMER WAISS (through translator): Yesterday, we were heartbroken for the second time in a stronger way. When they told us about father, there was still hope that mother would return, and yesterday, we were told that we will not see our mother and grandmother again. ROBERTSON (voice over): Her husband, Omer's father, Shmuel, was killed October 7th when Hamas stormed their home in Be'eri kibbutz. But even now, her death a mystery. The IDF claimed she was murdered by terrorists. ROBERTSON (on camera): Has the IDF been able to tell you how she died? WAISS (through translator): They could only tell us she wasn't killed on the day of the attempted rescue. They don't know if she was murdered in Gaza or her remains taken into Gaza. ROBERTSON (voice over): Early Friday, the body of a second hostage was recovered, 19-year-old IDF corporal, Noa Marciano, discovered, like Yehudit, by the IDF in a building near the Shifa Hospital. A Hamas propaganda video released this week, that CNN is not showing, claimed she died as a result of an Israeli airstrike. Omer is sure his mother did not. ROBERTSON (on camera): You said you knew for sure that she wasn't killed in an airstrike. How do you know that? (WAISS speaking in foreign language.) ROBERTSON (on camera): But you know it? WAISS (through translator): Yes, we have to trust in military. And we trust they do everything to free them without harming them. ROBERTSON (voice over): As fighting continues around the Al-Shifa Hospital and across northern Gaza, the IDF estimates another 237 hostages are still missing and are vowing to continue their search and fight in the south.",

I think a couple of details that seem to have some currency at the moment, debate within the Israeli government about whether or not there should be some of the women and children released or all of the women and children released together. Of course, Hamas also saying that all the drones, the Israeli drones, should be taken out of the sky over Gaza. That's a new precondition that they're putting forward.I think the central part, though, at the moment, is the focus does seem to be on the women and children, and some families of hostages that I have talked to say, particularly of men, they say they're a bit worried about that because they want everyone released. They really want the women and children released and the elderly people as well. But they are concerned if the men aren't freed now as well, then they could be stuck there for a very long time -- Anderson.",

Nic Robertson, thanks.Joining us now is Rami Igra, former Chief of the Hostages and the MIA Unit of the Mossad, also Retired US Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, former Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs. Rami, when you hear about some of the terms of a hostage negotiations are being discussed, fuel trucks into Gaza, multiday pause in fighting, stopping drone flights over Gaza, which of these points do you think Israel can negotiate and which are completely out of bounds? RAMI IGRA, FORMER DIVISION CHIEF OF MOSSAD HOSTAGES &amp; MIA UNIT: I think that most of the times that we're-- terms that we hearing are non-negotiable. The Israeli are not going to go for what the Hamas really wants. The Hamas really wants is for us to stop the war, for us to forget the 7th of October, and for them to continue as it was the day before. The drones in the sky are essential for this war. They will continue. The release of part of the women and part of the children and not all of the hostages will create, in Israel, a terrible situation in the future. What are we going to do with the parents of all these soldiers which are, you know, obviously going to be kept for the last? And the pause that the Hamas wants, that will make it very difficult to restart the war the day after. And as we've said yesterday, these demands that the Hamas are now posting are really a non-negotiable situation. And if you ask me, the only way that we are going to see any advance in the release of hostages is when the pressure on Hamas becomes a lot stronger than it is today, meaning, the minute that we start dealing with the south of the Gaza Strip, the Khan Younis area, you will see the Hamas crumbling. Here, I want to note something that your reporter didn't say. What has happened in the last couple of days is that the most -- the closest people to Sinwar have been killed. And Sinwar is now feeling our breath very close to his neck.",

And as you have seen in the last couple of weeks, the fighting is very surgical. It is slow. It is very methodical. We are trying not to reach any of the non-combatant population in the Gaza Strip. And I think that there is no way that we can eradicate the Hamas without dealing with most of its forces that have been -- that have fled to the south. Now, again, one little note, the noncombatant population in the Gaza Strip is really a non-existent term because all of the Gazans that voted for the Hamas, and as we have seen on the 7th of October, most of the population in the Gaza Strip are Hamas. Nonetheless, we are treating them as noncombatant. We are treating them as regular civilians, and they are spared from the fighting.",

You can see the enemy running away from you. You have a better idea if they're repositioning. That's one of the dangers you have inside urban operations is your lack of visibility of the surrounding area because of the buildings in the area.

She talked about how Trump did nothing to stop the violence and how he did, in fact, engage in an insurrection.And notably, this is the first time a court has come to that conclusion. But despite all that, the judge did stop short of taking Trump off the Colorado ballot. In fact, she ordered the Secretary of State to keep him on the ballot. And, Anderson, that's because of the specific language of the 14th Amendment. So Section 3 said that certain officials cannot hold office if they've engaged in insurrection. But the judge noting here, President of the United States is actually not specifically listed under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. She wrote this. She said, \"Part of the court's decision is its reluctance to embrace an interpretation, which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that that was the intent of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\" So really saying because the constitution does not explicitly state a provision for a prospective president to be removed if they engage in insurrection, that Trump has to remain on the ballot here -- Anderson.",

The problem is in the 150 years or so since that was passed, neither the Constitution nor the Supreme Court nor Congress has given us any guidance as to how it works. And what we cannot do, we collectively, is invent a process now on the fly and then apply it retroactively because that would violate the 14th Amendment's due process provision. And I think this is why, Anderson, we've seen now every official who's considered this, Republican and Democratic, state -- secretaries of state, and now four different judges, including Democratic nominees, who have all ruled against these motions, who have all ruled in favor of Trump, but all for different reasons because we simply don't have a procedure in place for how this works.",

That's clearly something that an appellate court could disagree with, looking at the historical evidence about the intention of the people who drafted the 14th Amendment Section 3.

For example, the judge says, if we look at the impeachment clause, it says that the president, vice president, and officers shall be impeached, dot, dot, dot.
