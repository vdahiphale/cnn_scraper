Good evening.Tonight the race for the Republican nomination for president is down to just two candidates after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign just two days before the New Hampshire primary. This comes after a distant second place finish in Iowa and polls showing he's expected to finish a distant third in New Hampshire. On his way out the door, he took one more shot at Nikki Haley, endorsing former President Trump despite questioning his electability time and again out on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now, it's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents. The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You can be the strongest, most dynamic, successful Republican and conservative in America, but if you don't kiss that ring, then he'll try to trash you. You know what?

But Tim Scott, of course, Vivek Ramaswamy. So there does just seem to be this growing groundswell of people surrounding the former president.But, look, there is still a race here. Voters are still making up their minds here in New Hampshire. There's only been one contest. Iowa is the only state that's voted. And Donald Trump received about 50,000 votes. So, look, the Nikki Haley campaign is aggressively campaigning across the state of New Hampshire, also holding a rally at this hour here to try and sort of slow this march to the nomination. But, Jim, it just gets the sense -- you just have the feeling here that this is moving very quickly. And by the end of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, we could be off to the races here in terms of a rematch between Trump and Joe Biden. But let's see what the voters have to say. History shows that New Hampshire has many times delivered surprises here and had an echo to the Iowa result. We'll see if that is the case this time, Jim. But it certainly feels like this is a pretty dramatic change and DeSantis had planned to stay in the race. They had events scheduled this evening. Some of his supporters had gathered. Of course he had flown back to Florida and delivered that announcement. So some disappointed DeSantis supporters, no doubt about it. But this race is just beginning.

But they rallied around Trump.And this is what the party has done every time that they've had an opportunity to get away from Trump, they don't do it. They don't make the move. They could have done it after January 6th. No. Mitch McConnell wouldn't let other senators vote to convict him, impeach him. And then McConnell went out and gave a speech saying, well, he should have been impeached. It is a moral collapse of the party.

They had expected that DeSantis may drop out. And so they prepared a series of statements and campaign stops for the president to address. And again I am told he is going to address DeSantis dropping out and endorsing the former president tonight on stage. Now I just want to read to you what Trump told FOX News earlier today in a FOX News Digital article. Excuse me. He said that he was very honored by DeSantis' endorsement. He said, quote, \"I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country.\" Now, Jim, a few things I want to point out here. We know that Donald Trump for many months, I mean, really all throughout 2024, viciously attacked Ron DeSantis. Part of that was because the campaign was concerned about DeSantis' candidacy.

So really some of the kindest words we've heard from Donald Trump about Ron DeSantis.One thing has been extraordinary over the last year. Donald Trump defeated Ron DeSantis not just in Iowa but month by month by month in tens of thousands of -- and millions of dollars in a television advertising, really just driving up DeSantis' negatives. And, Jim, there's been so much overlap between the two campaigns as you know. Many of the people inside the inner circle of the Trump campaign helped elect DeSantis in Florida. They were central to his rise there. And then they went to work for the former president. So there's been so much overlap between the two. But clearly now, DeSantis loses, he goes back to become the governor of Florida. And we will see how this relationship continues.

And even in that statement from the Democrats that you read tonight, it focuses much less on DeSantis and more on former President Trump and lumping in DeSantis with President Trump's ideologies and policies. And so certainly, the Democrats and President Biden's campaign very eager for this to turn into a one-on-one contest, President Biden versus President Trump. And I think, you know, in their own internal research, there are numbers that indicate that many undecided voters just don't believe that former President Trump will become the Republican nominee, and until that happens, it's very hard for them to make this choice argument, this contrast argument with former President Trump. Right now, it's President Biden versus a Republican in the abstract. Once President Trump is in that position and is the nominee, they do think it will be much easier for them to run against him and you will start to see them doing that in the coming days and they will start to focus really squarely on this issue of reproductive rights and abortion and really making the argument that it is former President Trump who is the most responsible through his three Supreme Court nominees for the overturning of Roe versus Wade, and you will see President Biden and Vice President Harris at a joint campaign rally on Tuesday making that argument in Northern Virginia -- Jim.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, as part of our investigation, we looked at videos filmed on the ground, as well as satellite imagery looking at cemeteries in particular, in areas where the Israeli military has been operating inside of Gaza, and here is what we found, a total of 16 cemeteries damaged or destroyed by the Israeli military.In at least one case, the military says that they were looking for the bodies of hostages, but in other cases, they simply could not account for the reasons for the destruction seen at some of those cemeteries. I do want to warn our viewers that they may find some of these images disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice over): In Gaza, even the dead cannot escape the indignities of war. More than a dozen cemeteries like this one in Jabalia desecrated by the Israeli military. Gravestones destroyed, soil upturned, tread marks leaving little left for the living to honor their dead. This is that same graveyard before the war. One month later, a series of tread marks can be seen on the northwestern edge. It is no exception. A CNN analysis of videos and satellite imagery found that 16 cemeteries have been damaged or destroyed by the Israeli military since it launched its ground offensive. As Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza, they crushed the graves of thousands of Palestinians between November and January. Janina Dill, co-director of Oxford University's Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, says destroying graveyards violates international law, except under very limited circumstances. JANINA DILL, CO-DIRECTOR, OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS: Cemeteries are not military objectives. They are in fact what international law would consider an object that is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, like places of worship generally. So this is protected from intentional attack. It can only be intentionally attacked or destroyed if it becomes a military objective. DIAMOND (voice over): In some cases, like this cemetery in the Shajaiye Refugee Camp, Israeli bulldozers turned cemeteries into military outposts, parking armored vehicles behind freshly raised berms. The damage is often deliberate and progressive. Over two weeks in December, the military bulldozed more and more of this cemetery east of Khan Yunis, building defensive fortifications. CNN witnessed firsthand the results of Israel's bulldozing of graveyards while embedded with Israeli forces last week. The armored personnel carrier CNN was traveling in drove right through this cemetery in Al-Bureij on a freshly bulldozed dirt road. And then there's this. Tombs opened at a cemetery in Khan Yunis this week, bodies removed from their graves. In a statement, the Israeli military acknowledged exhuming bodies from the cemetery as part of its search for the bodies of Israeli hostages. An IDF spokesman could not account for the damage to the 16 cemeteries identified by CNN, but said that in some cases, there is no other choice, providing this photo of what it says is a Hamas rocket launcher at a cemetery in Gaza. CNN could not independently verify where it was taken. The spokesman could not account for the military posts over graveyards, but said, \"We have a serious obligation to the respect of the dead, and there is no policy to create military posts out of graveyards.\" In at least one case, the Israeli military appears to have taken pains to maneuver around a graveyard. The Deir El Belah War Cemetery, which holds the remains of many Christian and Jewish soldiers from World War I, left intact despite devastation all around. At the El Toufah Cemetery, a very different picture. Residents say bodies were uprooted by Israeli bulldozers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We're currently retrieving the corpses of the martyrs that are present in the cemetery. The occupation forces have run over most of them with their bulldozers, and we've only identified a small number of corpses and masses. As for the rest, their identities remain unknown. DIAMOND (voice over): South Africa cited Israel's destruction of cemeteries as part of its case, arguing Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Israel denies the allegation, but experts say cemetery destruction could be evidence of Israel's intent.",
