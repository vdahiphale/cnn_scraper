I mean, you know we saw Senator Rick Scott from Florida, he was a Republican leader in the past Congress, who suggested that this was one of the things that the Congress should do to try to lower the deficit, you know, at this point. You know, Joe Biden talked about bipartisanship at the very beginning of the speech. We saw this real warmth of bipartisanship. But he did throw a lot of red meat as well. He certainly was playing to a Democratic base and I was really stating the point that he will fight the Republican Congress.
