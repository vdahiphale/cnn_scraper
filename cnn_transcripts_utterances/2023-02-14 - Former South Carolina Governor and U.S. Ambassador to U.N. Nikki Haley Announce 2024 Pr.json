Nikki Haley coming out with this video previewing her announcement tomorrow in South Carolina saying definitely for the first time that she is running for president. And what this video does is sort of tell her story, talk about growing up in South Carolina to Indian immigrants, saying she wasn't black, she wasn't white, she was different. Talking about growing up then and becoming governor of South Carolina and standing up to fear, of course, when there was that awful shooting at the church in South Carolina.And one of the things that Nikki Haley really does in this video is talk about how great America was. And she said even growing up, when she faced challenges, her parents reminded her every day how lucky she was to have the opportunities here in America. They moved to the United States from India. It wasn't always easy for them. She makes that very clear in the video. But this video for her is really introducing herself to the American people. She talks about the Republican Party, their values. But she says that they have lost the popular vote in many of the recent presidential races, and that is something that needs to change. So it's clear that she is positioning herself as the new generation here, talks about not wanting to look back to the old leaders of the party, but --",

These many, many tips you heard about came in from many of our residents, and as a result the shooter was identified, and the threat was neutralized. So we are very proud of our citizens in Lansing. There is going to be so much fear. It's not just the students. It's the community. I've heard from parents and citizens who didn't know what was going on. So I want to share, we have a community mental health resource that is open 24/7. It's a crisis services, 517-346-8200. And I also want to share in the incredible job that was done by our law enforcement, LPD, ELPD, state police, Ingham County, and, of course, MSU. This is what they train for. And today and yesterday they were able to show that they are prepared. It's not something you ever want to do when you train, but they were prepared, and they were excellent.",
