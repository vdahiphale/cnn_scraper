It is Tuesday, October 3rd.And this morning, the ball is in Kevin McCarthy's court after Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, made good on his threat. He filed a motion to have McCarthy removed as speaker of the House. McCarthy's message to Gaetz has been -- bring it on. Now that Gaetz has, Republicans are likely to try procedural remembers to try to kill Gaetz's motion without having to hold an up or down vote to oust McCarthy directly. But no matter what, McCarthy is going to need to turn to Democrats. At this hour, CNN's whip count shows by Republicans say they're standing with Gaetz. McCarthy can only afford to lose four.

Matt Gaetz actually went to the floor a couple of hours earlier at noon and delivered a floor speech in what many folks that would be that motion to vacate. At the end of it, he said, stay tuned. And as you mentioned, we then saw it after votes last night.So, the question of what comes next, obviously, that's key. Because this was brought up as a privileged resolution, you know, in layman's terms that essentially means that Gaetz is able to force a vote on the legislation in a speedy manner. So, GOP leadership is going to have to set a vote on this resolution, on this motion to vacate the chair within two legislative days. So, that means either today or tomorrow. And as you laid out at the top, leadership is likely going to try to quash it with some procedural motion, whether it'd be a vote on tabling the measure, a vote on referring it, what have you. And again, that would shield lawmakers from having to weigh directly on whether or not McCarthy should remain speaker. But even so, these procedural votes are still going to put McCarthy in the hot seat, still going to put his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in a tough position deciding, do they side with him or do they go against him?",

He's a moderate Republican. He said that because of this effort to force votes on ousting Gaetz, which -- ousting for McCarthy, which although Gaetz said he is not likely to stop the first one if it fails, he's likely to do this over and over again, it would publicly to a government shutdown because this is going to take up floor time, it would probably lead to a government shutdown because this is going to take up floor time, this is going to take a lot of attention on lawmakers.And, you know, when you get to this question of not, if it's personal or is it based on policy? Listen, Matt Gaetz publicly is saying that this is because Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not met a series of demands that have to do with policy and spending, of course, the continuing resolution that'll put on the floor this weekend to avert a shutdown, that frustrated a lot of conservatives, including Matt Gaetz. At the end of the day, this relationship between Matt Gaetz and Speaker McCarthy has always been acrimonious. They've always sparred in the past. Remember back to January, that Matt Gaetz never actually threw his support behind McCarthy's bid for speakership. Behind all 15, battles they have also been engaged in a war of words and the pass. And so, I think what while Matt Gaetz would be frustrated with some of these missed demands by McCarthy, I think there is also a personal tinge to it.",

Check this out, just in the past day, we've smashed record high temperatures. Look at Michigan, 87 degrees. That was a tie. Btu look at Sioux Falls, 93, Fargo, North Dakota, and a lower middle 90s as well. This is an extended forecast, taking you through the second half of the work week. We do have temperatures in the 80s across, all the way basically to the Canadian border. But look at how drastically cooler it gets Wednesday to Thursday. It's all because of that cold front. There's the warmth across the East Coast, but it will be a short-lived because the weekend will bring back the fall vibes that we all want this time of year, right? But in the meantime, this collision of air masses, what does it do? It creates severe storms in the nation's midsection as our cold front sweeps across the area. You can see them firing up across the plains. And eventually, into Iowa, and southwestern sections of Minnesota. That's where the storm prediction center has a level three of five, that's for the potential large -- to very large hail. Damaging wind gusts, and even a couple of tornadoes across that region.
