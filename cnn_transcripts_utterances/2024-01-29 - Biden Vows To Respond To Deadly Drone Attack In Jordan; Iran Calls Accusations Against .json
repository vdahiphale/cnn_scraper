She was not saying specifically while they await further intelligence assessments that Iran ordered this specific deadly attack. That said, she did say quite clearly that the US holds Iran responsible as it does, frankly, for the activities and attacks of many of these Iran- backed militias in the region. And that extends from Jordan. This attack here of Syria, Iraq, of course, the Houthis firing on shipping in the Red Sea and, to a large degree, Hezbollah firing on northern Israel. And Hamas continue to be at war with Israel in Gaza. In terms of the options, she did, as you noted, at least to say that the US is going to respond. They're currently assessing their options right now. They'll do so at a time and place of their choosing. We know that the range of potential responses the president can choose from range from attacking directly Iranian forces, even the possibility inside Iranian territory, that said, that is considered at one end of the spectrum, right? And there are many options short of that, including attacking Iranian forces outside of Iran because often with these backed group -- these Iran-backed militias, you do have Iranian forces/militants co-stationed with them. So in other words, an attack on one of these bases in Syria and Iraq could also be targeting not just the groups backed by Iran, but Iranian personnel, particularly from the IRGC, for instance. So each of those would represent an escalation as well in terms of US retaliatory strikes in response to the many attacks we've seen so far on US forces in the region.",

The fact is if you look back to the Trump administration, while it did carry out an attack, which killed Soleimani, the head of -- very senior Iranian militant leader at the time the president had options as well, President Trump, to attack inside Iranian territory and did not. So that has often been a step too far given the lack of a desire for an open conflict between in the US and Iran. That said, there were options short of that, which would still be considered, right, direct attacks either on Iranian leadership, Iranian forces. The threading, the needle is difficult because you heard Sabrina Singh say there, no, they don't want war with Iran. And she said it's the US assessment that Iran does not want direct conflict with US. But the fact is -- and she was pressed on this -- there is an expanding indirect conflict between US and Iranian forces in the region. There have been many dozens, more than 100 attacks on US servicemembers in the region by Iranian-backed forces. There been many attacks by Iran-backed Houthi fighters on US shipping, US flag shipping, and other ships in the Red Sea, as well as attacks across the border into Israel by Hezbollah, again, of course, not on US, but on Israel, which is US ally. So you have a simmering regional conflict here, which has already expanded on so many fronts, not to open war between the US-Iran, but a quite serious conflict with a lot of potential fronts for further escalation. And it's in that very already hot environment that the US president now has to make a decision. He's decided he's going to respond. He said that exactly how the US respond. It's a difficult one.",

And ever since Evergrande started defaulting on its debt a couple of years ago, actually back in 2021 -- I lose track of time -- those investors, the international investors have been saying, look, this is a company with lots of assets and we want some of our money back. What the judge in Hong Kong said today is, look, actually enough of the fighting, enough of the offers of restructuring that nobody truly believes. What we want to see is liquidators taking control of this company and somehow selling off the assets. And eventually, then you'll see people get their money back. At least that's the hope.

A whirlwind romance between Travis Kelce as youcan see there and Taylor Swift gave NFL ratings a boost this year. And businesses want in on the hype. Of course, they do. American Airlines announced new offerings as you can see there to Las Vegas for the February 11th game just few days away from Valentine's Day. The flights are numbered 1989. Of course, after Swift's album with the same name and 87, Travis Kelce's jersey number. Flutter, the parent company of the sports betting site FanDuel also making big moves ahead of the game. It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Good timing indeed. Clare Duffy is keeping an eye on all of this for us. So Clare, just break it down for us. How are businesses across the board capitalizing not just on Taylor Swift and her romance there with Travis Kelce but also on the next games and what may come?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, Isa, I mean, the Superbowl is always such a huge moneymaker. But the hype is bigger than ever this year.Thanks to this romance between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, I just love them. You have even the airlines, as you said, looking to cash in on this hype. They're creating these special flight routes, which is normal for the Super Bowl creating routes from the cities that are going to be competing to the host city. But this year, they've named them in honor of Swift, of Kelsey of the Kansas City Chiefs as well as the San Francisco 49ers. And look, there may be good reason why the airlines are going to want to give people an added reason to shell out for flights to this year's games. Tickets to the Super Bowl this year are more expensive than ever. You have tickets going for on average just under $10,000 which is 70 percent more expensive than last year. So, fans certainly should hope they have a fun flight to get on. If they're paying that money, add that much money for the game, Isa.",

I'm a big fan of both of them and their romance not -- I don't know much about NFL. I'm not going to lie to you about that. But look, let's talk about sports betting markets because for us here in the U.K., it's still a big deal. Right? I'm just going to interrupt because the Secretary of State Antony Blinken is about to speak. Let's listen.",

Look first, I think it's very important to note that this is an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East. I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973 and arguably, even before that. And that is the environment in which we're operating. And of course, that was triggered by the horrific attacks of October 7th by Hamas against innocent men, women and children. We've made very, very clear from day one, that we're going to defend our people. We're going to defend our personnel. We're going to defend our interests and that's exactly what we've done. We've taken action and significant action to deter groups to degrade their capabilities in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen. At the same time, the President's been very clear that we want to prevent broader escalation. We want to prevent this conflict from spreading. So, we are intent on doing both. That is standing up for our people when they're attacked, while at the same time working every single day to prevent the conflict from growing and spreading. And that's exactly what we'll continue to do. It's fundamentally what's in the interest of the United States. What's in the interests of the region, and I think what's in the interests of the world. But the President said this, I think virtually from day one, to anyone who would try to use the crisis in the Middle East the conflict in the Middle East to sow further instability and to use it as an excuse to attack our personnel. We will respond, we will respond strongly. We will respond at a time and place of our choosing. And obviously I'm not going to telegraph what we might do in this instance or get ahead of the President. But I can again tell you that as the President said yesterday, we will respond and that response could be multi levelled, come in stages and be sustained over time. With regard to UNRWA, the reports that we got last week and UNRWA brought them to us, were deeply, deeply troubling. It is imperative that UNRWA immediately, as it said it would, investigate that it would hold people accountable as necessary and that it review its procedures. I had a very good conversation with Secretary General the United Nations Guterres last week when we were first made aware of these allegations. And we're going to be looking very hard at the steps that UNRWA takes, again to make sure that this is fully and thoroughly investigated, that there's clear accountability and that is necessary, measures are put in place so that this doesn't happen again, assuming the allegations are fully borne out. Certainly, we've not had the --",
