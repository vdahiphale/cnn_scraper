And that's been a one-stop shop for great ideas around heat. Our firefighters come up with innovative solutions. Even people in our art community have found ways to create aesthetically pleasing shade corridors.

Perhaps the most important steps he has taken have been through the Inflation Reduction Act.For anyone who's watching, there's help with your energy bills and really reducing that. Small businesses can get funding to install technology such as solar energy. There's opportunities for cities to get support with old solutions like planting trees but also new solutions like designing the transportation system to be better adapted to climate change. Phoenix has over 100 miles of cool pavement, which is a lighter colored sealant that we put on our city streets and they don't absorb as much heat. That's a program that maybe more than anything have been getting questions about from other mayors. It's working well for us.

It was just two years ago this month that President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by gangs and ever since then there's been a power vacuum with gangs taking control over swaths of the country.And so because of gang violence, because of gunfire just last week for several days in a row, members of the personnel at the U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince were ordered to stay exactly on that embassy compound. And then as you mentioned on Thursday, family members and non- emergency personnel ordered to leave Haiti immediately because it's so dangerous. What we know is that the U.S. authorities are working with their Haitian counterparts to try to resolve this situation with this mother and her young child. Right now, it's unclear who is responsible for this kidnapping. It's unclear whether they've made any demands whatsoever. We do have a statement from El Roi Haiti, that's the Christian humanitarian organization that this nurse from New Hampshire had gone down to Haiti to work for. Here's what they've said in a statement in part. \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" Now El Roi has said of course it's their highest priority to bring back these two safely. And so they're not going to be releasing a whole lot of additional information. We know from a State Department spokesperson that again their highest priority is the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad. But the context here, this kind of increasingly bad security situation is important. I should mention that the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was recently in Haiti and he said the Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare. He said the humanitarian situation, the conditions there are appalling. And he has called for what he calls a robust security force deployed by member states of the U.N. to work with the Haitian National Police to try to defeat and dismantle and arrest control back from these gangs, and bring the security situation under control.

Young players coming in and making a real impact for their country against teams that they're not expected to win against, and really just showing bravery, showing great skill, and passion and desire.And so I think it's a wonderful stage for so many different players to see.

And because there is -- and I really feel like I'm stating the obvious, but there's such a defining cultural ethos or zeitgeist of loneliness. You know, our culture, we're a very lonely culture, and we love connecting with each other, we love connecting with people we've never met. We love connecting with content, with ideas. And I feel like, there are so many ways that people can state the obvious, connect with content in a very unhealthy way. You know, in a way that promotes misinformation or anger or division or hate, and I feel like if someone has the opportunity to put something out into the world that does not promote misinformation, division, hate, bigotry, et cetera, it is almost like you could say there's a responsibility to do so. And in terms of being potentially overwhelmed by the space, I would say, the concern with anything like a podcast is the vulnerability in it. Because, you know, if I'm writing a song, or if I'm on tour, and I'm playing a song live, there are lots of ways to present myself to an audience that are sort of glamorous. And when you're having a 90-minute conversation with someone, there's no glamour to it. So it does sort of strip away the artifice in a way that is vulnerable, and that can be daunting, but at the same time, I guess I longed for that sort of honest communication.",

David Shafer came out and talked afterwards, but as we have been reporting this out, and as we've been doing these interviews for this documentary, really see how much they wanted to keep this meeting secret of going so far as to, you know, throw a local journalist out of the room and spread a lie about what the meeting was actually about before. It seems like they acquiesced and realized, the reporters who were there were not going to go away until they figured out what was going on.
