Today, we are beginning to see how exactly that could be done, starting with the who. Trump is tapping two immigration hard liners for top jobs in his administration. Sources tell CNN that Stephen Miller is seen as the architect of Trump's first term immigration policies will, in the coming days, be announced as deputy White House chief of staff for policy. And Trump has already announced that Tom Homan, the former acting ICE director, will be a border czar. These are two major roles on what Trump said would be his number one priority. But there is still several influential positions to fill and Palm Beach, all around Mar-a-Lago is buzzing with Trump allies now jockeying to fill those positions. Following it all for us, CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston. First, I want to begin with the Stephen Miller appointment. Longtime Trump adviser with some quite by any measure extreme views on immigration and what it means to be an American. I want to play how he laid out Trump's immigration plans a short time ago and get your thoughts. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The president-elect is hoping to speed things up, pushing Republican senators empowered by recapturing the majority to use recess appointments to fill those positions, in fact demanding that any such candidate supports that move.Manu Raju joins me now to explain. Manu, tell us exactly what Trump's position is on this and are those Senate leadership candidates responding? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, they are falling in line. Remember, the Senate typically does not like to give allow a president to come in and make recess appointments because essentially that's short circuits the entire confirmation process, essentially allows the president to install his cabinet appointee without having a vote of the United States Senate. But that has been denied over recent years, really since 2007. At that time, the then majority leader, Harry Reid, tried to block George W. Bush from installing making recess appointments. So, he took a procedural step to effectively prevent the Senate from formally going into recess. But now what Trump is calling for is that he wants the Senate not to have those essentially go into an extended recess when they go out of town, change the approach that has happened over the last number of years and allow him to essentially and put his nominees in directly. And very quickly, you saw all three of those leadership candidates, Rick Scott being the first one to come say, yes, Mr. President, I support that. Same with John Thune. The current number two Republican, and Senator John Cornyn who used to be the number two Republican, all saying, yes, they should do that even though, Jim, they will have 53 seats in the United States Senate, and they can pass and confirm these nominees along party lines without Democratic support but by doing that, if they go that route, essentially that would allow Trump to quickly get these nominees in place and cut out the Senate altogether. So we'll see if they ultimately do that. But right now, they're indicating they're falling in line.",

It's both a small faction of the Senate Republicans. Remember, there are 53 -- likely 53. We have not called the Pennsylvania race yet. Dave McCormick is leading that candidate in that race.So potentially they have 53 seats. That means a majority of senators in that 53 member Senate GOP would have to vote for the leadership. Rick Scott probably has maybe a dozen or so senators to support. He does not seem to have a majority, and this could go into multiple ballots. What would happen is that the person who has the least number of votes would fall off. Then there would be a second round of balloting, and then the majority of whoever gets the majority vote in that second, or potentially third round would become the next leader. And it is widely seen within the Senate. It is probably Thune or it's Thune and Cornyn to lose. It's hard to handicap between the two of them. Those two, both long time insiders, lots of relationships, have fundraised millions of dollars for their fellow Republicans. So it's a kind of a jump ball at the moment between those two men.",

You've reported that Trump and Netanyahu have already spoken three times in recent days, and that also Netanyahu is sending his confidant, Ron Dermer, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. to meet the president-elect. There's a point of view, you hear it in this country, certainly heard it in Israel, that Trump will give Netanyahu everything he wants in this second term. Is that a reasonable view? Is that the right one? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, first, you know, it's too soon to predict the future. But if we look at Trump's previous term in office, I think it's a mixed bag. Meaning on the one hand, he did give Netanyahu many, many things, especially by the way, the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights which Trump saw as a gift for Netanyahu before a crucial election campaign, that, you know, he made this decision several weeks before the election, and obviously, the decisions on Jerusalem and others. But on the other hand, when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Trump put on the table a plan that, you know, you can think it's a good plan, you can think it's a bad plan, but it was a plan for a two-state solution with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, something that, for example, President Biden did not do. And when Netanyahu wanted to annex parts of the West Bank, Donald Trump pulled the brakes on him and told him no. He actually pulled the brakes on him twice on this thing, once in January 2020, and another time in July 2020. So I think it's a mixed bag and we still need to see how Trump is going to deal with this issue this time around.",

There's already frustration around the COP process, even from the most earnest delegates who did the hard yards of trying to get 200 countries to agree on anything because there's a suspicion that the big fossil fuel interests and petro states have captured the process. Last year was held in the Emirates, even though the world decided and announced that that was the transition away from fossil fuels. This one and this little petro state on the Caspian Sea.You know, the site was picked according to fairness. It's supposed to go to Eastern Europe and Putin didn't want it to be held in Poland. So here we are and none of the boldface names, Keir Starmer of the U.K. the only G-7 leader present. No -- no presidents of China or India or the United States or Russia there. The Taliban has a presence for the first time oddly at this COP. So, there's general, you know, dissatisfaction with the signal this is sending. But the specter of all of that, again, as you mentioned, is the United States electing the most notorious climate denier of modern times. And Lee Zeldin, his new EPA commissioner, ran for New York Governor lost a couple of years ago. But his platform was very much like Trump's. He opposed the gas fracking ban in New York state, wanted to open that up against a lot of environmental protections, which Trump has promised in a transactional way. But what it does for diplomacy around the world, for vulnerable countries, for countries that have been promised hundreds of billions of dollars to prepare and now may be left with their hands out with this kind of leadership coming in, it's anyone's guess, Jim.

As President Biden said in the Rose Garden last week, setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. This is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet. Facts are still facts.

So the training that all of them received in the military, took hold and they realized that when they took the position in the cabinet or in the civilian positions, but even with that, the military is bound to obey the orders of the civilian masters of the government if those orders are legal and again, that's the key point. But to answer your question, that's a long way around answering your question it's certainly left the civil military relations frayed a bit and many people and I'll even cite myself who spoke up against what we believe to be potential illegal orders or violations of the Constitution.
