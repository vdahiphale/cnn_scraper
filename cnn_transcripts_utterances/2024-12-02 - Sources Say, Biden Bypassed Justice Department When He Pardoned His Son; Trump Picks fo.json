      "sentences": "Happening now, new fallout from President Biden's controversial pardon of his son, Hunter. That decision sparking bipartisan backlash tonight, as sources tell CNN the president bypassed the U.S. Justice Department when he made the call.Also tonight, Donald Trump's picks for Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth holding meetings with Capitol Hill senators today, this as Hegseth is facing new misconduct allegations, potentially making a tough confirmation fight even tougher. And we'll take a closer look at the hardline Trump loyalists the president-elect just tapped to lead the FBI. How Kash Patel is being received inside the agency he's vowing to dismantle. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're following two major political stories tonight, President Biden's contentious decision to pardon his son, Hunter, and the fast-moving developments inside the Trump transition. Our senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee is here in Washington, CNN's Kristen Holmes is live outside the Trump transition headquarters down in Florida. M.J., first to you. Tell us, first of all, about the fallout from President Biden's move. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Wolf, the blowback is certainly coming from all directions for President Biden. And it isn't just Republicans that are crying hypocrisy. Even some of his own allies and Democrats are really questioning how he has handled this issue. I've spoken with a number of Democrats, including former White House and administration officials who told me that they actually never believed it when President Biden himself said publicly that he would not pardon his son and that they simply cannot understand why he insisted over and over again that he wouldn't be taking this course of action. This is what one former senior West Wing aide told me. They said, anyone who was even close to the top knew that he was probably going to do this. Why did we pretend otherwise? Some Democrats, Wolf, telling me that the president could have at least avoided the appearance of hypocrisy if he had given an alternative answer to unequivocally saying that he would not pardon his son. We're also seeing a number of prominent Democrats questioning the decision itself to pardon his son, particularly given that we now know he had gone around his own DOJ. This is what Michigan Senator Democrat Gary Peter said on X. He said the decision was wrong and that a president's family and allies shouldn't get special treatment. This was an improper use of power. It erodes trust in our government and it emboldens others to bend justice to suit their interests. Now, Wolf, as you can imagine, the White House is getting a lot of questions and pressure to explain the President's reversal. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One earlier today that this is a course of action that the president would not have taken had Vice President Kamala Harris won the election instead of Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, Donald Trump's team brought through a number of various controversial picks today through Capitol Hill to meet with various senators, one of them being the new attorney general nominee, Pam Bondi. Now, she met with Senator Grassley, Senator Graham. Both of these meetings, we are told, went well. One thing to note here is that Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the transition team, they are breathing a sigh of relief that this is not Matt Gaetz. They find her far less controversial and they believe that she can get confirmed.Also up on the Hill is a far more controversial figure, which is Secretary of Defense Nominee Pete Hegseth. Now, this comes -- his trip to Capitol Hill, this is his second time up there, comes after new reporting in the New Yorker that essentially said that he was forced out of his position at two veteran advocacy groups for alleged misconduct, one of them being the Concerned Veterans Group of America, the New Yorker obtaining a whistleblower complaint. Here's what was in that complaint. This is just some of what was in this really bombshell report that Hegseth was repeatedly drunk at events, that he took staff to a strip club, was drunk, and tried to get on stage and dance. He sexually pursued female staffers, and he once chanted, kill all Muslims. This, again, just part of what is in that report, it follows another part of that report, which says that he was essentially removed from another veterans group for alleged misconduct as well. Now, he did meet with two senators up on the hill, one of them being Tommy Tuberville. Tuberville was asked about these allegations, he said he hadn't talked to Hegseth about them today, but in the past he had. Here's what else he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL):  I've asked him. And he had a good explanation, but I'm not going to try to explain to y'all about his personal endeavors over the many years, he's got great work ethic. He's very, very smart. He understands the business side as well as the military side, been in 20 years. He's actually fought in wars. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's unclear whether or not this constitutes as a surprise, but clearly is not the kind of headlines that Trump's team wants right now.",

The reason why this was so unprecedented is there is actually a current head of the FBI who is serving out a ten-year term, Christopher Wray, someone who was appointed by Donald Trump in his last term as president.So, this is essentially warning shots fired to Chris Wray saying that I will be firing you when I take office from Donald Trump. But on top of that, a second layer to this being the idea that Kash Patel is a loyalist who does not have experience deeply within the FBI. He did not serve as an agent. This is somebody who is incredibly controversial. We saw pushback from both Republicans and Democrats. Now I did speak to a number of transition officials today who believe that Kash Patel is in a different boat than some of these other controversial figures. They don't believe there's anything in his past other than his own rhetoric, so they think that he could still get confirmed. But, of course, it's going to be a big question, particularly, again, when we are hearing this pushback from both Democrats and Republicans that this figure would serve there. This is someone who is a loyalist to Donald Trump and has expressed interest in following through with some of what Donald Trump wants to do, which includes gutting the FBI. Wolf?",

And I think the American people would accept that, because for so long, when Hunter was facing criminal charges, people understood why his father was standing by him, because that's what a father does, is they stand by their son.I understand Democrats might be split on this. I don't know if it will be the biggest blemish on Joe Biden's tenure because we have so much more to come. We have these confirmation hearings. But I understand where he came from.

That's one of the reasons voters like him and put him back into office in January.So, I think this has actually empowered him with some of the nominees, including the ones we were talking about here earlier. I think it has empowered him with voters. Let's remember, CBS had a poll last week that said 60 percent of the nation approved of his handling of the transition.

And so he's surrounding himself now with someone like Kash Patel because he will do that. He will fall prey to the conspiracy theories. He will not be -- have a firewall between him and Donald Trump. And that is the danger of what is at stake in this democracy.I understand the last 24 hours could be unsettling for some people that Joe Biden just pardoned his son, but Joe Biden did not break the law by doing that. What Kash Patel could potentially do as FBI director is do something that he would target people that have not committed crimes just because they might have said something. He said he would go after the media. I pointed out yesterday, I'll point out today. We're all sitting on a media panel. That could make us all, maybe one day you say something that he doesn't like. We don't want that to be the standard bearer for who our FBI director is. We want to believe no one is above the law, Democrat or Republican. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  And I'll also just say one other thing. It reminds me of the dark days of the Nixon administration. I mean, it has been a long time since this country has seen such a partisan cabinet being put into place where they are promising explicitly to go after people not because of things that they actually have done to break the law, but because they might have gotten on the wrong side of the president.",

You are critical of this decision by the president. Are you suggesting President Biden was wrong to pardon Hunter despite the merits of the case? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO):  Well, this is undoubtedly an excruciating situation. I'm a father. My heart breaks for any father that would be in a situation like this, wanting to protect his son, just like I would want to do. But you know, when you're the president of the United States, you have different responsibilities. That is why it is probably the toughest job on the planet because you have to set aside all of your personal interests. You have to set aside everything that you might be pulled upon. That would be a conflict of interest, and put the Constitution, the good of the country first, which is why I came out today and said that I did believe that this particular pardon was a mistake, you know?

Two thirds of those people are women and children, according to the U.N. The White Helmets Group, the civil defense group on the ground is saying that the majority of those killed have been killed in these airstrikes, that we have been seeing in the wake of this astonishing offensive by the rebels in five days, Wolf, they've been able to take more territory than they have in the last eight years.And the reason that Assad was effectively able to quash this rebellion and why you haven't really heard about Syria much in the news for some years now, is because it has relied heavily on the support of Iran, on the support of Hezbollah and, most crucially, on the support of Russia and Russian airstrikes, which decimated huge parts of rebel held territory in Idlib, in Aleppo back in 2015. It appears now, Wolf, that potentially the rebels saw a moment that they could exploit where Israel was bombarding Hezbollah, where Iran was tied up also with the situation with Israel where Russia was preoccupied with Ukraine. And so they saw a window and they went for it. The question now is what happens next? Is Bashar al-Assad potentially really facing the end of his rule at this stage? Still far too early to say, but we are definitely seeing a ratcheting up of these devastating airstrikes and everyone waiting anxiously not just in Syria, but across the region to see what happens next, Wolf. So Clarissa, to that point, where do you think things go from here well, in terms of where the rebels are taking things, they have now taken Aleppo, as you mentioned, they are in control of the entirety of Idlib province, and they seem to be focused now on the city of Hama, which is in central Syria, population of about a million people. It is the fourth largest city. Rebels earlier today announced to people living in Hama that they should basically take care to avoid being anywhere near regime figures regime forces. And so the expectation is that in the coming hours or days, we may see some type of an offensive on that city but more broadly, I would say while a lot of people are feeling gratified to see Bashar al-Assad take a black eye, there's a lot of uneasiness as well about the rebel groups that are participating in this offensive, some of which, at one stage were in allegiance with al Qaeda and just a sense of unease about the prospect of the Syrian civil war being reignited at a time when this region is already in deep crisis, Wolf.",
