They'll then vote on whether to impeach him. Russian President Vladimir Putin has canceled his annual news conference, ducking potential questions about his failures in Ukraine. Putin has held a major news conference every December for the last decade. Hospitals in China are now being overwhelmed with cases of COVID-19. Widespread protests pushed Beijing to ease zero-tolerance restrictions this past week. All right. The World Cup semifinals begin today. Argentina and Croatia are now just hours away from battling it out for a place in the Sunday finals, kicking off at 2:00 p.m. eastern. And reigning champion France takes on Morocco tomorrow. Let's go to CNN's Amanda Davies live in Doha, Qatar. Amanda, it's Croatia's fighting spirit against the tough South Americans this afternoon. What are you watching for?",

That only happened in 1992, a year after they gained independence from Yugoslavia. And actually, Croatia -- this is just their fifth World Cup tournament, whereas Argentina have been in the final five times previously. That is what we are talking about. They have defied the odds and are looking to reach the final for a second-straight tournament after Russia 2018. That, in large part, is why their coach, Zlatko Dalic, is talking about victory tonight as being what would be his country's greatest- ever footballing moment. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZLATKO DALIC, CROATIA COACH (through translator):  I tell the players to enjoy football because there is no success -- no results if you don't enjoy your job. Each of us who does our job must enjoy it and must be happy in the job, and my players are. The players of the Croatian squad are happy. We train with great joy as well as in all our preparations, meetings, and matches. And tomorrow, I will tell them to enjoy football. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That means more imported orange juice and likely, higher prices.All right, looking at markets around the world right now, European stocks higher this morning. The EU striking a deal to tax imports based on greenhouse gas emissions. The European central bank and the Bank of England also set to decide on interest rates later this week. Taking a look at Wall Street right now, stock index futures up just a little bit here after a big rally in the Dow yesterday. The Dow ending up more than 500 points. The S&amp;P also adding more than one percent. Investors, at least for now, optimistic that a smaller interest rate hike is in store when the Fed kicks off its two-day meeting later this morning. Gas prices, by the way, fell another penny overnight. The national average now $3.25 a gallon. Average gas prices in 34 states now are lower today than on this day last year. So the big question in money right now, is inflation peaking? The Consumer Price Index report comes out later this morning. The Federal Reserve meeting kicks off today ahead of a rate hike we expect tomorrow. Let's bring in senior economic analyst at Bankrate, Mark Hamrick. Good morning, Mark. So, what you have been seeing here in terms of inflation, can we say it feels like it's peaking? MARK HAMRICK, SENIOR ECONOMIC ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM (via Skype):  It feels like it has peaked, Christine, and with sort of the season of miracles, it feels like a miracle we can actually make that proclamation with a high degree of confidence. And you're perfectly setting it up in the sense of that the Federal Reserve wants to see clear and convincing evidence that inflation has peaked. But as you know, they're not ready to take their foot off the brake in the sense of more interest rate increases to come with a likely announcement tomorrow on that point.",
