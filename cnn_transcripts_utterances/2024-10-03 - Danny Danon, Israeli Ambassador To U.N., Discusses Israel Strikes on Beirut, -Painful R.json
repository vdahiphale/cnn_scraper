You know, Hamas underestimated our determination. Also, Nasrallah in Beirut will know what happened in Gaza and in Beirut. The same will happen with Iran. You know, we are in pain. We celebrate the new year today also, Shanah. We reflect back and we analyze it was the hardest yield for the state of Israel ever. But, you know, the pain doesn't mean that we are weak. We are in pain, but we are strong. We are determined. And we will show it to anyone soon. They will realize that what they did was something that you don't do. You don't attack another member state of the U.N., a state with 200 ballistic missiles.",

It's so far away from -- from Israel.But when you have like radicals, they come after us. So we have that ability. We proved it in Yemen a few days ago and we've done it, some of the Houthis' infrastructure. So it's up to us to decide when and where we want to attack. But they are vulnerable. They know that.",

When you are radical leaders threatening to destroy the Jewish nation, we better believe them. So I haven't read the headlines here, but I will tell you that. It should be the interest of the U.S., Europe, and any other democracy to block Iran from achieving nuclear capabilities. If we fail with diplomacy, we have to consider all options.",

You go back to where we will. But I think Hezbollah is saying that line and we all know that they don't decide for themselves. They take direction from Tehran. And what happened two days ago, very interesting, Boris, Iran took the mask off because, for years, they were hiding behind Hezbollah, behind the Houthis. Today, it's clear that Iran is behind the attacks against Israel and against other U.S. targets in the region. And we should name them as responsible for what's happening.",

They were planning to invade Israel. I think they we're caught by surprise. Hamas did it before Hezbollah. But Hezbollah had the infrastructure and the ability and the ammunition to invade Israel.

This is a health care company. This is its largest manufacturing facility. It says it's located in the north coast of North Carolina, which is about 50 miles from Asheville. And this manufacturing site, the company says, is the largest U.S. manufacturer of I.V. fluids and dialysis solutions. And so we have been hearing from pharmacy experts and from folks around the country working in health kara that there could be a shortage of those items. They are already starting to put into place sort of efforts to conserve these fluids, trying not to use them when it's not necessary. We have heard about these shortages before. There was a hurricane, Hurricane Maria, that hit Puerto Rico in 2017 and that affected this same company. And there was a shortage of I.V. bags, I.V. saline after that, that lasted quite some time. Now, this plant in North Carolina experienced flooding and has been temporarily closed. Baxter says it's working with federal, state, and local authorities trying to assess the damage and reopen it as soon as they can and limit the impact here. But we've heard from experts that in previous natural disasters it can take as long as a year for the plants to come back online and that filters through the whole system -- Brianna?",

Joining us now to discuss is defense attorney, Misty Marris. Misty, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. The couple claimed that they're young daughter was the one who accepted the terms while using their mom's phone. She wasn't 18, but she said that she was 18 when she signed up for the terms of service. What do you make of this whole case?",

So that argument was one of the two arguments that were raised by the plaintiffs here.First, it comes down to whether or not the couple, the actual parents, and the plaintiffs in this case, consented to this arbitration agreement. So they raised the argument that their daughter, who was not 18-years- old, was the one who actually click that box. The court ultimately determined that there was evidence that the mother had actually accepted the terms and conditions prior to that time. And also testimony indicated that they weren't really clear on what the daughter had seen. They just did not remember seeing that click box that talk it's about arbitration popping up on the phone. So the court actually said that's an argument for the arbitration, but it's not going to preclude you from being bound by this arbitration agreement.",

And as we move into a consumer framework, where there's all of theseapplications, where we're using apps essentially in every aspect of our lives, we have to ask ourselves, as consumers, where's the protection? And the answer, Boris, is unfortunate. Because it's not like a contract where you might sit down in a room and you both have a lawyer and you're hammering out the details or you're talking to a contract or a service provider. No, it's either you click yes or you don't use the service. So I think these issues are going to be hashed out as they continue to climb up the courts. And there has been a movement where decisions have moved more towards the consumer-friendly side. And that's because, as we talked about, it's a contract. And contract law the drafter of the contract, there's an inference that the language is more beneficial to them. So it's a difficult road.",
