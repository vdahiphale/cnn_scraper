And he says that his stated goal in all of this is not just obviously to take over Aleppo, then Homs, and then, you know, obviously they're trying to make their way to Damascus. They also got Hama as well. But their goal is really to overthrow the Assad regime. Give us your take on that. Can they actually do it? Is this the window of opportunity that they've been waiting for at least eight years? ROBERT FORD, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SYRIA: Oh. Thank you. First of all, Jolani has always had this goal. He has never changed. He has never wavered in it. Second, I think what we are seeing in Syria is the most serious challenge during the entire 12-year Syrian civil war. The most serious challenge to the Assad government's control over the country. Never before have the Syrian armed opposition controlled Aleppo in its entirety, Hama and the eastern part and the southern parts of the country all at the same time.

He's been governing the province of Idlib and its capital, Idlib City since 2015. It functions. It has everything from a Department of Health to a Department of Education to Department of Economic Development, electricity, water, infrastructure services function. Syrian-American medical groups that send American citizens, Syrian-American citizens go over there to work in hospitals and clinics providing healthcare, have told me that they work comfortably with the HTS people. The HTS fighters don't bother them. They don't ask for money. They don't kidnap them. That the doctors and the medical staff can perform their work without difficulty. We now should look at the Aleppo City where your correspondent was just reporting. And we would just have to say so far so good, but it's still very, very early days.

I put Pete Hegseth in that category as well, because what he and Pete have talked about doing over at defense is to rid it of wokeism. And that's not -- that has nothing to do with going after our enemies, right? That's an internal kind of punitive course of action. But in the end, this might not come -- this might not be Joe Biden's job to safeguard. It is the Senate's job. And despite what Pete and other -- and other would-be nominees have said, they do have to answer to the Senate. They do have to answer to questions from these senators who have advice and consent. I spoke to a senator yesterday, who was very troubled by some of these appointments. I said, are you going to demand FBI background checks? And he said, well, we can't like legally require them, but we can say if you don't perform these, we will not -- we will not approve these nominees. So I think this is the job of the Senate.
