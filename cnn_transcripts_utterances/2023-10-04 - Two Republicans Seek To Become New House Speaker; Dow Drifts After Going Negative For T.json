Considering the turmoil up here at the Capitol, in New York, they're being remarkably restrained, but I suspect that is a calm before a potential storm. The markets and the events. Simple: The race is on. So far, two Republicans throw their hat into the ring to be the next US House speaker. Here in Washington turmoil, which could impact funding for Ukraine. Kyiv needs roughly two-and-a-half billion dollars a month to fund its war efforts. And the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak faces criticism from business leaders. He finally admits HS 2, the infrastructure project is going to be canceled from Birmingham northwards. Live tonight from Washington, DC. It's Wednesday, October the 4th. I'm Richard Quest, and in the nation's capital, I definitely mean business. A good day from Washington where political paralysis has taken hold on Capitol Hill. Two lawmakers have started the jockeying to become the next US House speaker. The Republican, Jim Jordan was the first to say he will seek the gavel, followed soon thereafter by Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader, and lawmakers ousted Kevin McCarthy from the top job yesterday, and then promptly adjourned and ended off. Now under the rules, without a speaker, the House of Representative cannot consider legislation. It grinds to a halt. So not surprisingly, President Biden says the situation is troubling.

So this is the route that HS 2 would have taken. This leg and gray on the right was already scrapped back in 2021, and today, a further scaling back saw the leg between Birmingham and Manchester in red also scrapped. So all that remains of the new line is from Birmingham to London. The rail project was first announced 13 years ago and since then, projected costs have almost tripled. You can see here the latest estimates of around 100 billion pounds or $120 billion. So Sunak says that the facts have changed, citing that the shift in work habits since the COVID-19 pandemic means that the costs won't bring the same benefits. So he has promised to redirect 36 billion pounds earmarked for this project into local transport projects instead. But politicians of all parties and businesses including Manchester United Football Club have called this a major act of economic self-sabotage damaging to our international standing as a place to do business. This flashing as a giant red warning light from the region that's been the Tories tickets to election success lately. Now, you probably remember that after Brexit, the UK government promised a Global Britain, which hinges on its reputation as a stable and future focused place to invest. But that does seem to be going off the rails. Britain, a pioneer of the modern railway has now cancelled part of its key infrastructure project. This, off the back of Sunak delaying net zero climate targets just days ago, angering car manufacturers and environmentalists, and we can say the same for tax cuts, the prime minister is focusing on cutting inflation instead. All the while, transport, health, and labor strikes continue week after week, exacerbating that sense of instability in the economy. But one thing that has to arrive on time is a general election, which must be called before the end of next year. Sunak's speech really kicked off the long campaign for that, but with his party lagging around 20 points behind in the polls, there is a lot that he'd need to do to get on that winning track.

There may e several of them who are vying for that position. But this is what I know. It gets down to negotiations. It gets down to whoever is going to represent them and it gets down to the Democrats, led by our very capable leader, Hakeem Jeffries and others to do the negotiation that can come to a point where people can agree. I know people are saying, how can this happen? You have the most right wing of the right wing, who are the ones who ousted the Speaker. You're not going to be able to do anything with them. That, too, is speculation. We have some of the most expert negotiators on our side, who are involved in negotiations day in and out. They have to do the best job that they can do. And don't forget we have the President of the United States in the corner office, who has the ability to sign or not sign any piece of legislation. And it could be that if Republicans want to have anything signed that they care about, they got to deal with the fact that it doesn't get done unless the President of the United States signs whatever it is they're interested in.",
