That means this drug that's been on the market for more than 20 years could soon be banned across the country, even in states where abortion remains legal. Vice President Harris responding tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  There is no question that the president and I are going to stand with the women of America and do everything we can to ensure that women have the ability to make decisions about their health care, their reproductive health care in the manner that is what they need and they decide that, not their government. It is contrary to what makes for good public health policy to allow courts and politicians to tell the FDA what it should do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Judge Matthew Kacsmayrk was one who issued this ruling. And in a nutshell, what it does is it suspends the FDA approval of mifepristone. But the order is paused for seven days, according to the judge, so that the U.S. DOJ can appeal.Now, about mifepristone, and mifepristone is is an abortion drug that was approved by the FDA back in 2000. It is the most common way to terminate a pregnancy in the United States. It has been used more than 5 million times since its approval. It's considered safe and effective. And medical groups say that the risk of death is, quote, non-existent. Now, the hearing, the preliminary injunction hearing happened last month. It was about four hours long. And what's really fascinating, Alisyn, is that there is no question during this hearing that this judge was sympathetic towards the plaintiffs. Now, the plaintiffs are coalition of anti-abortion groups. There's no question that he was sympathetic towards the plaintiffs, but there was nuance there, the judge asked questions that appeared that the judge was skeptical to going as far as the plaintiffs wanted him to go or to be as aggressive as what the plaintiffs were asking them to do, which, in this case, they were asking him to yank this medication off the shelves. The judge even asks the plaintiffs point to another case in which the judge did exactly what you're asking me to do, and the plaintiffs couldn't point to a case. And, Alisyn, that's what makes this case so unprecedented because it's the first of its kind.",

This judge, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, was appointed by President Donald Trump. And before this judge rose to the federal bench, he worked for a religious right law firm on anti- abortion advocacy. And who are the plaintiffs in this case? They are anti-abortion groups.And so abortion advocates have said, and they maintain, that the there was judge shopping in this case, not just pointing back to the background of this judge, but also saying that the plaintiffs didn't incorporate in Amarillo, Texas, until a few months before filing this particular case. And just by the way that the state of Texas assigns these federal cases, there was going to be one judge that was going to be assigned to this case and that that judge was going to be judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the plaintiffs argue that that was not the case, that they have the right to sue wherever the public is injured, and that one of those plaintiffs is a doctor from Amarillo. [22:05;09] Now, Alisyn, what's fascinating is that during this hearing, the plaintiffs admitted that this one doctor from Amarillo that's part of the plaintiff groups does not at all prescribe mifepristone, the abortion pill in question. But back to this federal judge, look, this judge is known as taking Texas or making Texas the graveyard of a lot of the Biden administration priorities and policies, whether it be immigration or the expansion of LGBTQ rights, things like that. And that's why advocacy groups, abortion advocacy groups maintain that there is definitely judge shopping because they knew what they were going to get, the plaintiffs knew what they were going to get.

What's shocking -- so, I've been writing about Matthew Kacsmayrk for many years. He has said outrageous things over the years, and there're outrageous things in this opinion. This is a garbage opinion from open to shut. The way it finds standing is garbage. The way it addresses the harm is garbage. He calls mifepristone chemical abortion. That's sort of that sort of a dog whistle. He says that this allows a woman to abort her unborn child at 49 days. So, I bought a visual aid the so called unborn child's the size of a grape at 49 days. This is not at a judicial opinion. This is a theological opinion.So, Matthew Kacsmaryk has certainly entitled his religious view about when life begins and what constitutes an unborn child. As a rabbi, I have my own views, which are quite different about when life begins. But the idea that this is now being legislated from the bench for the entire country is absolutely unconscionable.",

It's been FDA-approved for 22 years. This is something that is safer than a lot of other drugs on the market. And, actually, what we're doing here is we're making, you know, having a medication abortion more dangerous, not any safer because people will still be able to use misopristol, which is the other medication used when you're trying to have self-medicated abortion.

So, I authored this resolution, and we passed it through the House saying that, you know, Congress reaffirms its intention to allow the FDA to preempt any state laws that would be in conflict with what the FDA decides to do in this space.But even, then we never imagined that a judge, a Trump judge in this case, would go back 23 years and say, we don't even agree with the original approval of this widely used, safe medication abortion pill. This is how extreme the federal judiciary has become under Donald Trump because of his activist judges that he has appointed.

They have been, you know, jetting off together. He and his wife, Ginni Thomas, have been treated to all sorts of high end vacations, and he's never declared it.And so today, Justice Thomas responded, which is unusual, and he said, the Crows are among our dearest friends. These are the mega donors. And we have been friends for over 25 years. Early in my tenure of the court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends who did not have a business -- who did not have business before the court was not reportable.

And there is no way under any circumstance that he could have thought that taking a private jet for personal use for his own personal errands, which was one of the several ways in which he used the private jet of this billionaire mega -- Republican mega donor would qualify as personal hospitality.

I mean, this guy has committed so many impeachable offenses that looks like makes Donald Trump look like Malala or, you know, Mother Teresa or something. I mean, he just seems to have no sense of responsibility.And, you know, again, this is the first time we've seen this happen. Again, we remember with Justice Scalia and Dick Cheney going hunting together, but there, that was actually disclosed, as I recall from my dim memory of when that happened, and this was actually not disclosed, it was revealed.

However, we've seen -- especially this past week, we've seen suburban voters just reject Republicans left and right, particularly the Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Think of it this way, there were suburban counties that went for Mitt Romney in 2012. There was one that went for Romney by 30 points. It went for the Republican judge, Kelly, by three points. That's a massive swing. And it's because of what the Republican Party brand is, the MAGA, the Trump.

JESSICA WASHINGTON, \"THE ROOT\" SENIOR REPORTERagree with every single person on the panel because that's no fun, but I have to agree. I mean, it does seem like waiting makes sense, and you're right especially for the economic situation, this country to improve. People are still feeling the hurt from inflation even though it's getting better. So, I think it does make a ton of sense. And then also with Trump's trials and I think we talked about this recently. We also have the E. Jean Carroll trial.

Increasingly, it would appear that he's not gonna make the kind of progress on what he wants to see happen with the budget, that the members of his caucus, especially the hard right members, of his caucus wanna see in terms of these cuts. The president has insisted that if Kevin McCarthy wants to keep this -- whether it's the budget or the debt ceiling from being lifted-that he should make a proposal as to what he wants to see happens and let the American people see what that looks like.
