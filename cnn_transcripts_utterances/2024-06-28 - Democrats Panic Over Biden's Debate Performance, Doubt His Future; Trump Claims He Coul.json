I'm Anna Coren.Well, democratic sources are telling CNN they have major concerns about Joe Biden's performance in his first presidential debate of 2024 with Donald Trump. The candidates squared off at CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. The President appeared to stumble over his words and lose his train of thought on several occasions. Well, CNN analysts point out that Donald Trump was often less than truthful and frequently avoided answering the moderator's questions. Trump repeatedly hammered President Biden on immigration, which he says is ruining the country. And he said runaway inflation is killing people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We had an economy that was in freefall, the pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying, all he said was not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm, you'll be alright. Economy collapsed, or no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 50 percent. It was terrible. And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again, that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there's more to be done. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary. So we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929. We had given them back a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID. And nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounced back jobs have bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He's done a poor job and inflation is killing our country.

And he could have turned the page and been more optimistic about the future of the country. But that's really a secondary issue.The main issue for this debate for now and for all time is going to be that most people who watched it are going to be in shock about what they saw from the commander in chief of the United States. Our president appeared to be somewhat unwell tonight. I mean, remember, he's not just a candidate. We're analyzing the politics of this. He's the current sitting president of the United States. We're the most important country in the world. He's our president. And the performance he turned in tonight not only, in my opinion, calls into question what he's going to be able to do in this campaign, but it really calls into question what he's doing today. And really, I mean, if you were wondering can he serve another four years, most folks didn't think so before tonight. There's nobody out there that thinks he could serve four years after tonight. So it's really not a night for glee. As a Republican, you know, commentator on the political side, I'm somewhat concerned about the president.

I mean, I think it's unlikely that he will personally decide to step aside after one debate performance, but it is quite obvious, just listening to the reaction of my Democratic friends in the United States tonight, that there is a panic in the party, because when you when you think about the way they've positioned this campaign, it's that Donald Trump, they say, is an existential threat to democracy, that he wants to be a dictator, that he'll in the Constitution, that he'll do all these terrible things.And so if you believe that, if you believe all the things you're saying out loud, I think what Democrats are saying tonight is we may have a moral responsibility to try to get a different nominee. Again, I find this to be pretty unlikely. So let's look at the political situation. Before we started tonight, Joe Biden had a 38 percent approval rating, you know, pretty close race nationally, but Donald Trump is winning in all the swing states. None of that got better for Joe Biden tonight. The thing that's weighing down his candidacy the most before tonight was people just don't think he could do the job. But he's too old. That obviously got worse tonight. He was kind of up to here in the quicksand when we started. Now he's up to here. And when you get up to here, it's game over. I know, it's only June. But remember, the reason we had this debate is because Joe Biden wanted it. His campaign wanted it. And I think his advisors and his campaign have a lot of explaining to do to their party tonight for putting him on that stage in this condition. They did themselves no favors.",

The normal rules do not apply for sure. And so I think that still remains to be seen.I think what you're going to see from here on out from the Biden campaign and from President Biden is he's going to hit the ground running campaigning tomorrow. He's going to go out there, and he's going to talk to voters. And let's remember that is actually what matters, his one on one with voters, his conversations with the people that he has needs to continue to convince that he is up for the job that he has delivered for them and wants to continue to deliver for them. And that, frankly, the contrast that you saw today, regardless of how badly Joe Biden looked, the contrast in terms of the visions and the policies, is still I think a contrast that is good for the Democrats and good for President Biden. And that is the only thing that Donald Trump proves day after day after day is that he is in this for himself. He only fights for himself. He wants more power for the sake of having power. He needs to be elected in order to stay out of prison. He has no interest whatsoever in fighting for the American people. And fighting for the American people is what Joe Biden wakes up every day to do and what he wants to continue to do for another four years. We'll see if he can convince the American people that he is still the fighter that they want for them.",

It sure sounded as if the only way he could solve this quickly, would be giving Putin the land he has already seized roughly 20 percent of the country. But he didn't quite say that. He simply made it sound like the respect that foreign leaders have for him will make it possible for him to negotiate a deal.

That little bit of shift won't make a difference here. Look at the big question of the night. Who won the debate? We asked debate watchers in our instant poll. And the answer is a resounding Donald Trump did. 67 percent of debate watchers in our poll say Donald Trump won the debate tonight. Joe Biden, 33 percent say he won the debate tonight. Now, this group of debate watchers, they told us who they thought would win the debate going into it before the debate, and take a look at how that changed over time. 55 percent thought before the debate that Donald Trump would win the debate; 45 percent thought Joe Biden would win the debate. Look at what the debate did to those expectations. That's you know, Donald Trump did much better than expected. Joe Biden did worse than expected among this group. And compare this to these two men debating four years ago, that's not always a comparison we have obviously. The rematch is pretty unique. And so take a look at the complete reversal. Again, that top line there is the debate tonight, 67 percent say Trump won, 33 percent said by them. The next line is the second debate in 2020, where Biden won there by about 14 percentage points, 53 -- 39 in our instant poll that night. This looks a little bit more like the first debate Chris Wallace moderated 60 percent Joe Biden won that debate that night, 28 percent said Donald Trump won the debate that night. You can see how this night, where there's a complete reversal of that one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so it doesn't only have to be him stepping aside. It could be someone choosing to challenge him, generating a certain level of support and then in effect pressuring him step aside. All of these conversations I think are going to happen. As I said, they had been kind of pushed off the table. I think they're very much back on the table, whether he could really be beaten if he insists on going forward. It's still an uphill climb. But I don't think you can rule anything out after that performance, particularly because you know, the most dangerous thing in politics, I think we've talked about this before is validating a pre-existing supposition in the electorate. When Dan Quayle misspelled potato in 1992, it was a bigger deal than if Al Gore did, because no one questioned Al Gore's acumen and intelligence. This performance validated the biggest concern that voters have about Biden whether he is mentally and physically up to the job.

Well, don't forget that one reason that Biden not the only reason, certainly, but one reason that Biden is running in the first place is because people around him feel that the party has a conundrum in that they, you know, the Democrats are dubious that Biden can beat Trump, are also dubious that Kamala Harris can be Trump.But they also recognize that if she wants the nomination, denying the first woman of color who has been on the national ticket who's been serving as vice president, the prize would potentially tear apart the party and you could lose that way. So it's an extremely complicated situation if he steps -- even if he does step aside. But I think most people, you know, most attention focuses really on two names above all. I mean, there are -- there's Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren, but I think the two figures that most Democrats talk about the most are Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, and maybe Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania. I think there would be a lot of enthusiasm in the party, as I said, for the democrats who are dubious at nominating Biden in a way this was so bad, it might be good in that it opens this conversation in a way that a kind of middling performance would not have. But it's still, you know, as I think you were suggesting this -- it's going to be very difficult to remove him if he doesn't want to be removed, that doesn't mean that somebody won't challenge him and put some pressure on him but it's still going to be hard if he wants to go forward. There is a pathway though, the rules do allow it in a way they didn't in an earlier generation. So well see if all of the intense grumbling that you're hearing and that I'm hearing and that everyone is hearing actually translates into action because there are a lot of Democrats who feel that after tonight, Joe Biden almost certainly -- almost, almost certainly cannot win.",

The reason for that is, first of all, they believe they cannot vote for someone who promotes genocide in good conscience. Others in this camp might have more nefarious reasons for why this -- why they're doing this. they might want to see a Trump presidency because when Trump's policies are connotated with Gaza, it allows the Democrats to inherently move farther in the progressive direction. If Trump is the face of the Gaza genocide, then Democrats will oppose it flat out. There'll be no discrepancies within the party. Now, there will be another stream within the Democratic Party, in my opinion, that will vote for Gaza within that progressive base. It's not necessarily because of anything Biden said, but it's more so because they believe, of course, in the notion that Trump is the greater evil. And he made that known tonight. In the statement you just said, he said that Biden was not going far enough. He said that Biden needs to be promoting policies that have no red lines to allow Israel to finish the job. There will also be the notion within the progressive base that Biden can be pushed in a progressive direction. He can be pushed in a better direction in his party.
