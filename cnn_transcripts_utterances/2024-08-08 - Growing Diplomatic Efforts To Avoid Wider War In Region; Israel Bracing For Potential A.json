So, for now, though, the waiting continues and Israel bracing for an attack, not just by Iran, but also from the Iranian backed militant group Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon. A senior leader with Hezbollah was also assassinated last week by Israel. The latest U.S. intelligence believes an attack by the militant group which has more than 100,000 rockets and missiles on Israel's northern border could come at any time, independently of any action taken by Iran. And at an urgent meeting, Wednesday by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Saudi Arabia described the assassination of Haniyeh as a blatant violation of Iran's sovereignty. Still, a flurry of diplomacy by the U.S. continues across the region, urging Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah to stand down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You recall back in April, with that barrage of somewhat 300 missiles and drones that Iran fired towards Israel. That, that was a couple of weeks after Israel took out a senior IRGC official in a -- Iranian consulate compound in the Syrian capital Damascus.So, it does seem to bide its time. It will, of course, be trying to work out how it can best calibrate its response. It says that it wants to still, in its words from the from its mission to the United Nations, it still intends to punish Israel, but also to restore some kind of deterrence to Israel, to stop Israel from doing anything like that. Again, it's worth noting, of course, that Israel has still yet to claim the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, in an apartment block in Tehran. And at the same time, Israel's Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, saying in response to Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas who's believed to be underground in Gaza, in a tunnel somewhere after he was appointed the replacement, if you like, of Ismail Haniyeh, Israel, saying that, you know, they will still -- they still have a target on his back, and their intention is still to take him out if and when they get the opportunity. So, things still very tense. Israel still very much, you know, expecting and on edge, an expectation of some kind of retaliation from Hezbollah, from Iran, perhaps, a combination of Iran and some of its proxies. But still my sign of precisely when that might come, but it is -- it is expected to come, and there are still very genuine concerns that that could drag -- that could escalate into all that war, and drag the region into a war as well.

Now, is this going to change the outcome of the war? No. But is it going to change the way in which Ukraine is perceived in Russia and basically among their own population, as well as in the West? Yes, I think it probably will.So, what we are seeing, I believe, is a movement by the Ukrainians to capture some territory, perhaps, that a gas pipeline, that transshipment point within that pipeline that could have a major impact, because it turns out that 50 percent of Russia's gas actually goes through that pipeline at that particular location, that is the gas that's exported to Europe. And that's a major, major piece for the Russian economy. And if the Ukrainians gain leverage over that and turn that off, that would not only affect Europe, but it would also affect Russia's ability to collect some of the -- some of the monies that they have collected, even during the -- this war, in spite of the sanctions. And from a military standpoint, what this does is it gives the Ukrainians an opportunity to force the Russians to move some of their forces from other areas where the Ukrainians are feeling pressures, such as in the Donbas region, especially around the town of Pokrovsk. So, that is going to make, I think, a big difference in this particular case, but it shows that the Ukrainians are willing to try some fairly audacious tactics at this particular point in time.

According to unreliable reports, Ukraine has concentrated elements from two to four brigades in the area.

Let's talk about the arrests. On Wednesday morning, police arrested a 19-year-old Austrian citizen, who is a sympathizer of Islamic State. This arrest, let's bring up the map for you, it took place in turn in Ternitz, which is located south of Vienna. And there, that's where officials found chemical substances at the suspect's home.

I think a lot of people probably have been caught up in the news cycle and not aware of what has taken place. But this began is a student-led protest at the beginning of July. It was over a quota system that gave preferential treatment in government jobs. Now, this then morphed into something far greater when Hasina ordered her police, her security forces to crack down on the protesters, leading to the deaths of more than 300 over the following month.And it really reached a tipping point last Sunday when protesters gathered in the tens of thousands on the street, calling on Hasina to resign. And I think it is important for our international audience to know that her father was the founder of Bangladesh when it was liberated from Pakistan in 1971. Well, she responded in force on the weekend and nearly 100 protesters were killed on Sunday in what was the deadliest single day of protests. Then, at the beginning of this week, on Monday, protesters began their march towards her residence. Hasina then fled the country by helicopter, flying to India, really leaving her country in chaos. Now, this power vacuum has really caused a great deal of concern within Bangladesh and amongst its neighbors, particularly India. There have been attacks on the Hindu minority, which make up something like 8 percent of the population, a population of more than 170 million people which are predominantly Muslim. We know that Hindu homes, temples have been attacked, and neighboring India is extremely concerned that there will be this mass exodus of Hindus trying to flee across the border.
