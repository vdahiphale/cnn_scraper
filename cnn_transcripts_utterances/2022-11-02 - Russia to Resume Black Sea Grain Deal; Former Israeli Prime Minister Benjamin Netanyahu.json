From a fast-moving region, you are watching CONNECT THE WORLD.Israel's former prime minister set to complete an emphatic comeback, as voters shift the country to the Right. Amid final election results due anytime soon, new concerns today that Iran is getting increasingly aggressive and may be planning to attack energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. Over the next two hours, a closer look at the shifting dynamics in this region where I am and the impact for wherever you are watching around the world. We're starting in Israel this hour. Final results from today's elections could be announced later today or tomorrow. With some 80 percent of the votes counted, Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and its allies on track to win a majority of seats in Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset. The ultranationalist bloc that will join the Likud ruling coalition, performing well, setting the stage for the most rightwing government in Israeli history. Hadas Gold connecting us from Jerusalem. Hadas, huge turnout this election. Just explain where things stand and what's behind that surge, the surge to the Right this year.",

      "sentences": "Huge turnout, the highest seen in years. And actually the numbers we are seeing from the earlyofficial results show a better result for Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies than the opinion polls were predicting. They were predicting maybe just making it to the 61 seat majority they needed to form a government and needed for Benjamin Netanyahu to become prime minister. And instead what we're seeing is a 65-seat majority, where even if one of the smaller parties, as these final votes get counted, even if they somehow pass a threshold and maybe take four seats away or something, they still have a good cushion, 65 minus 4, that's 61. That still gives them the majority. It's hard to see an outcome where Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies are not going to be in power. It will be, as we're seeing right now, the most far- right Israeli government that Israel has ever seen. That's because of the explosion in popularity of these far-right parties, specifically this bloc called Religious Zionism/Jewish Power. It's these two parties that came together in one. Their probably most well-known leader is Itamar Ben-Avi, very much known as a settler leader. We've often seen him sort of stirring up trouble in hot point places like Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem. These people have exploded in popularity. In fact, they were once considered the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. Just a year ago, Netanyahu was dismissing the idea that Itamar Ben-Avi would be a minister and now in the last final days, he said, yes, of course, they will be considered for minister. Not only will they be in the government, they clearly will be, their party will likely be the third largest party in the Israeli parliament behind Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party and current caretaker prime minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party. But what kind of ministerial positions will these people get? Will they get important ones that can change Israeli policy, like defense, like public security? How much influence will they have in this new government, Becky?",

I can think it will be hard to imagine someone from the UAE coming to visit and meeting with the government, where there's someone like Itamar Ben-Avi, sitting in a ministerial position. Now when Benjamin Netanyahu is asked about this -- and he had been asked about this on CNN and elsewhere -- he essentially says, look, listen. Likud is still the biggest party. They're the biggest party in the Israeli parliament, they will have something like 31 seats, he will be the prime minister. He's the one who gets to decide on the policy, gets to decide the direction. But you cannot ignore the power that this group will have, because if Benjamin Netanyahu does not have those 14 seats, he doesn't have the majority. So he's going to have to cater to them in some way. The question will be, what will be the price they will extract from him?",

One Israeli expert saying, after years of political deadlock, a new right- wing government might stick. A flurry of missiles and a new level of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea says the North truly crossed a line this time. Seoul launching three surface-to-air  missiles that landed just north of the maritime border between the two nations. This is a flexing of firepower, after a barrage of missile launches from Kim Jong-un's military. Nearly 2 dozen missiles and scores of artillery shots fired into the waters of the east and west coasts. One of the North's ballistic missiles crossed the northern limit line for the first time near the South's territorial waters. Selina Wang is following the story for you from Beijing.

One of those missiles included one that landed near South Korean waters. It triggered a rare air raid warning on South Korea's Ulleung island. Now in an immediate response, we also saw South Korea launch three air to surface missiles from fighter jets. So we are seeing a strong retaliation from South Korea. We're seeing this escalate into a tit-for-tat. Now this entire region has been on edge because, to your earlier point, this has been an unprecedented year. This counts as the 29th series of launches from North Korea this year. We have seen recent aggressive acceleration in North Korean weapons testing. Now the timing here is critical. This comes just two days after the U.S. and South Korea held joint military exercises that include hundreds of aircraft. It includes thousands of military personnel from both countries. We had heard North Korea make extremely strong statements as backlash against those joint military exercises, threatening even more powerful follow-up measures. So experts are saying this dramatic response we saw today is because of those joint military exercises and that it could be a pretext, in fact, for an even more provocative response to come. Just last week, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test, its first one since 2017. Satellite imagery does show activity at its underground nuclear test site. Key context here as well is that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to build up the country's nuclear arms, has vowed to build up its missiles launch capabilities. He sees them as critical to regime stability and giving North Korea more leverage in future negotiations with the United States. Now U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is scheduled to meet his South Korean counterparts in the coming days we. know, Becky, that there will be plenty for them to discuss.",

And then, the theory, according to this intelligence, is that they would go from there to Russia. Now the National Security Council's John Kirby said they don't necessarily know yet that they have landed in Russia. They're continuing to monitor this, these artillery shells. And we should just note that this comes as, of course, Russia has turned to Iran for weaponry. We've seen those deadly attack drones used to great effect on the battlefield by Ukraine. We know that there are, according to our sources, planned shipments of additional weaponry from Iran to Russia. Those are expected to be some advanced missiles. And so what this reporting this morning indicates is Russia isn't only looking for those weaponry backing from Iran. But they're also looking for artillery. That is demonstrative of the fact that they are, according to U.S. officials, just not doing very well in terms of their stockpiles, having to turn to North Korea, diverting these shipments through other countries, to try to hide the fact that they are trying to get this weaponry, this ammunition, from North Korea. That will continue to watch this, because the key here is, when or if, of course, these artillery shells actually get to Russia and how impactful they are on the battlefield. There's some folks who believe it could have quite an impact, just because of how much artillery Russia has already used during this aggressive war. But there are some who also point out the fact that North Korea's artillery shells in the past don't have a great track record of being particularly accurate. So they may not be as impactful as one would expect them to be.",

Then the Ukrainians expanded a little bit more and talked about the nature of that weaponry. And what they are particularly concerned about, in addition to two different types of ballistic missiles that can go up to 700 kilometers, which would give them a huge potential to move right into Ukraine or hit right into Ukraine, they're also very concerned about these Arash 2 drones. The reason they're so concerned about these drones is they can carry roughly five times more explosives than the Shahed drones the 136 drones, that have been used for the last six weeks which such devastating effect on the battlefield here. So their concern is that an influx of these Arash 2s and they're potentially looking at hundreds arriving, as early as the coming days, that that would be incredibly difficult for them to defend against in terms of their air defense systems. And that it could have yet more devastating impact on civilian life but also on civilian infrastructure, which, as you know, Becky, has been the real focus of Russia's targeting in recent weeks.

Now we have U.S. and Saudi officials saying there are indications of a possible attack against energy infrastructure in the Middle East. A Saudi official confirming to me that Saudi intelligence has shared with the United States intelligence pointing to a possible, credible, imminent attack against Saudi oil or energy infrastructure inside the kingdom. Beyond that, there are few specifics. The United States does not seem terribly worried that any attack could affect its own infrastructure in the Middle East. We have not seen the U.S. military raise its protection levels. We have not seen U.S. embassies in the region warn citizens of any kind of imminent attack. But as you say, this could be directly tied to the Iranian protests, those anti government protests. Of course, the Iranian regime may be trying to deflect from those protests. They have accused Saudi Arabia of backing those protests, of fomenting the unrest, including through that TV channel I was just talking about, General Salami, the head of the IRGC, making that warning to Saudi Arabia. Of course, an attack against Saudi Arabia or the region could also come through a cyber operation, Iranian cyber operation, as well as some Iranian proxies in the region like the Houthis.

The time here is half past six in the evening.The U.S. government is waging a war on inflation on two fronts today. The most obvious attack comes in the form of higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to enact another steep rate hike, taking another three quarters of a point on to what it charges banks for loans. That, of course, spills down to that man on the street. Then there is President Biden. He is delivering a speech today to tout his program to train American workers in highly skilled technical jobs an effort that should, he says, over time, ease some of the labor shortages that are fueling inflation. Let's take a deeper dive into all of this. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House. Stand by, we'll come to you. Also joined by business correspondent Rahel Solomon. Rahel, I want to start with you. The Fed is expected to raise rates by three quarters of a percent. Are we anywhere close to the top of all of this? And were those rates to go higher, at this point, what do we expect?",

So that will take the federal funds rate, its benchmark interest rate, as you pointed out, Becky, essentially, the rate banks charge each other. That will take it to about 4 percent. In terms of the peak, the Fed says it expects to hit about closer to 5.4 percent, 6 percent, I believe? So we still have some ways to go. Here is what we're expecting. We're expecting the Fed to raise a few more times, perhaps, half a percent at the next meeting in December. Perhaps another half a percent or lower in the early 2023. And then hold it there. It will keep it higher for longer and hold it there. And what it signals, Becky, is that this inflation we're experiencing here in the U.S., which is hovering around 8.2 percent, it's proving to be quite stubborn, quite persistent.
